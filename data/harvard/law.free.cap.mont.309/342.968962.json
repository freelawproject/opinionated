We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court committed reversible error in admitting opinion testimony from a Montana Highway Patrol officer regarding the effect of prescription medications on Nobach\u2019s driving ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">\u00b63 Most of the facts in the underlying case are undisputed. On September 14, 1999, Nobach, who is trained as a pharmacist but worked as a waiter, left his place of employment at Woods Bay, Montana, after becoming ill at work. He set out to drive home to Kalispell, a distance of about 25 miles. Nobach recalls driving the approximately five miles to Bigfork, but does not recall leaving there. He regularly took-and had taken that day-prescription and over-the-counter medications for his chronic pancreatis and low blood pressure caused by atrial fibrillation.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">\u00b64 At about 6:30 p.m., Nobach was driving his vehicle erratically on Montana Highway 35, followed by six or eight other vehicles, when Flathead County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Rod Myers noticed the vehicle while traveling in the opposite direction. Myers turned around to follow Nobach and eventually positioned his patrol vehicle directly behind Nobach\u2019s vehicle. Myers followed Nobach for approximately three or four miles and observed Nobach\u2019s vehicle swerving, weaving, making wide turns and forcing other vehicles to take evasive action. Nobach\u2019s vehicle eventually drove off the road and rolled over onto its top. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>helping Nobach from his vehicle, Myers noticed Nobach was extremely pale, disoriented and sweaty. In addition, Nobach seemed subdued, nonchalant, sleepy and slow. Paula Gill, a Montana Department of Justice criminal investigator, happened upon the accident scene; her observations of Nobach were consistent with those of Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b65 Montana Highway Patrol Officer Michael Brooks responded to the accident scene and took over the investigation. A portable breath alcohol test registered no alcohol in Nobach\u2019s system, which caused Brooks to conclude that Nobach was under the influence of drugs because of his physical condition. That is, Brooks believed Nobach was \u201cunder the influence of something. I didn\u2019t know what it was at the time.\u201d Brooks thought Nobach was under the influence of some sort of depressant because his pupils were constricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b66 During a pat-down search, Brooks removed approximately 20 pills from Nobach\u2019s pants pocket. He arrested Nobach for DUID and took Nobach to a local hospital for a blood test. The toxicology report on Nobach\u2019s blood sample ultimately indicated prescription medications in Nobach\u2019s blood, but no nonprescribed or illegal medications or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b67 The State of Montana charged Nobach with misdemeanor DUID. Myers, Brooks, Gill, a pharmacist at Kalispell Regional Medical Center, and Nobach testified at the jury trial. Exhibits, including the toxicology report on Nobach\u2019s blood sample, were admitted into evidence. The jury convicted Nobach of DUID and, thereafter, the District Court sentenced him and entered judgment. Nobach appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\u00b68 Did the District Court commit reversible error in admitting Brooks\u2019 opinion testimony regarding the effect of prescription medications on Nobach\u2019s driving ability?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">\u00b69 On direct examination, Brooks testified he had received training about the effects drugs and alcohol have on people and their driving behavior. Specifically, he testified that a person\u2019s demeanor and behavior vary depending on what type of drug(s) they have ingested. The symptoms exhibited by persons under the influence of narcotic drugs such as two of the medications noted in the toxicology report, according to Brooks, were those he noticed in Nobach, namely, \u201cvery pale, sweaty; his speech was slurred; very slow to answer my questions.\u201d On further inquiry, Brooks testified he became aware of Nobach\u2019s driving on the evening in question through other people; he had not observed Nobach driving. When the prosecution asked Brooks his opinion about whether drugs affected Nobach\u2019s ability to drive, Nobach\u2019s counsel objected on the basis of lack of foundation-on a pharmacological basis-for an expert opinion by Brooks regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>effect the drugs mentioned in the toxicology report would have had on Nobach. He also objected that the opinion would go to the ultimate issue of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b610 The District Court overruled the objection without determining specifically whether Brooks\u2019 opinion would be an expert opinion or not. It merely stated that \u201copinions can be given, and the fact that it\u2019s an ultimate issue doesn\u2019t make it inadmissible.... I think your objection goes to the weight [the opinion] should be given, not its admissibility.\u201d Brooks then opined, based on his training and experience, that Nobach\u2019s ability to drive safely was diminished as a result of his consumption of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u00b611 On cross-examination, Nobach\u2019s counsel asked Brooks whether it was possible that the levels of various drugs in Nobach\u2019s blood, as contained in the toxicology report, were so low that they would have, no effect. Brooks replied \u201cI guess anything\u2019s possible, but I\u2019m not sure. Like I said, I\u2019m not a pharmacist and I don\u2019t work in the forensic lab, so I don\u2019t know what those levels mean.\u201d Later, on redirect, the prosecution inquired of Brooks regarding the effects two or more depressants can have on one another. Nobach again objected on lack of foundation grounds, but the District Court overruled the objection based on Brooks\u2019 training. Brooks then opined that the effect of two depressants is that \u201c[t]hey\u2019re multiplied;\u201d in other words, one plus one could equal four or five.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00b612 On appeal, Nobach asserts that the District Court abused its discretion in admitting expert testimony without sufficient foundation, and that the error was prejudicial and requires reversal. The State contends Brooks\u2019 testimony was proper lay opinion or, in the alternative, that Brooks was properly qualified as an expert. In any event, according to the State, any error by the District Court in admitting Brooks\u2019 opinion that Nobach\u2019s ability to drive safely was diminished by his consumption of drugs was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Southern, </em>1999 MT 94, \u00b6 48, 294 Mont. 225, \u00b6 48, 980 P.2d 3, \u00b6 48 (citations omitted). If error occurred, we determine whether it was structural error, which results in automatic reversal, or trial error, which may or may not be reversible depending on whether the error was prejudicial. <em>See State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 41, 306 Mont. 215, \u00b6 41, 32 P.3d 735, \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\n<em>a. Lay or Expert Opinion Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQI\">\u00b614 Under the Montana Rules of Evidence, both lay opinion testimony and expert opinion testimony may be admissible in evidence. Specifically, Rule 701, M.R.Evid., authorizes a lay witness to give an opinion rationally based on the person\u2019s perception and helpful to a clear understanding of the person\u2019s testimony or the determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>a fact in issue. R\u00edale 702, M.R.Evid., on the other hand, allows the admission of opinion testimony about \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\u201d if the opinion will help the jury to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue and the witness has been \u201cqualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education[.]\u201d Our initial focus, therefore, is on whether Brooks\u2019 testimony constitutes a lay opinion or an expert opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b6 15 In support of its position that the District Court properly admitted Brooks\u2019 testimony as lay opinion, the State advances <em>State v. Carter </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 449, 948 P.2d 1173, and <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 194, 864 P.2d 787, for the proposition that a lay witness may give an opinion regarding intoxication based on the witness\u2019 personal observations. In <em>Carter, </em>a lay witness was permitted to testify at trial that, based on his personal observations of the defendant, the defendant was intoxicated. We upheld the trial court\u2019s admission of the opinion under Rule 701, M.R.Evid., concluding it was rationally based on the lay witness\u2019 visual observation of the defendant for \u201cquite some time,\u201d and his testimony that he knew the objective signs of intoxication and had \u201cmuch experience\u201d being around people in varying states of intoxication. <em>Carter, </em>285 Mont. at 456, 948 P.2d at 1177. Similarly, we concluded in <em>Bradley </em>that lay opinion testimony that the defendant was intoxicated, based on the three lay witnesses\u2019 observations of the defendant after the accident at issue, met the requirements of Rule 701, M.R.Evid. We expressly held that the rule \u201cdoes not preclude lay witnesses from testifying to a person\u2019s state of intoxication.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>262 Mont. at 198, 864 P.2d at 789. The law aside, the fact is that most adults are sufficiently experienced with people who have been drinking to offer an opinion that a person is, in fact, intoxicated from alcohol based on their personal observations.</p>\n<p id=\"AxF\">\u00b616 The State contends Brooks\u2019 opinion that Nobach was under the influence of alcohol or drugs was based on his observations at the scene and, consequently, is analogous to the lay opinions accepted in <em>Carter </em>and <em>Bradley, </em>under Rule 701, M.R.Evid., as proper lay opinion testimony. At the outset, we observe that the portable breath test Brooks performed at the accident scene ruled out alcohol as a factor in this case and it was only at that point that Brooks believed Nobach was under the influence of drugs. Thus, the type of \u201cintoxication\u201d about which the lay witnesses in <em>Carter </em>and <em>Bradley </em>opined was not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b617  Moreover, we are not persuaded that lay people are sufficiently knowledgeable about common symptoms of drug consumption, much less the effects of drug consumption on a person\u2019s ability to drive a motor vehicle safely, to offer lay opinion testimony on those subjects, based on personal observations, under Rule 701. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>addition, Brooks\u2019 opinions that Nobach\u2019s ability to drive safely was diminished by the consumption of drugs and as to the effect of two depressants purportedly were based on his training and experience, subjects which generally relate to expert opinion testimony. <em>See </em>Rule 702, M.R.Evid. Under the facts before us here, a lay person could as easily have believed-based on his or her personal observations-that Nobach was merely ill, as he was when he left his place of employment at Woods Bay. Finally, Brooks\u2019 opinion that Nobach\u2019s ability to drive safely was diminished by consumption of drugs is substantially unlike the lay opinions in <em>Carter </em>and <em>Bradley, </em>which did not go to the effect of the apparent intoxication on the person\u2019s ability to drive. For all these reasons, we conclude that Brooks\u2019 opinion testimony was not qualitatively similar to the lay opinion testimony we held properly admitted under Rule 701, M.R.Evid., in <em>Carter </em>and <em>Bradley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\u00b618 The State also advances <em>Hart-Anderson v. Hauck </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 444, 781 P.2d 1116, for the proposition that a law enforcement officer may give an opinion about the cause of an accident and, as a consequence, that the prosecution in the present case was not required to qualify Brooks as an expert under Rule 702, M.R.Evid. In <em>Hart-Anderson, </em>a law enforcement officer testified at trial, over a lack of foundation objection, that the cause of an accident was driving too fast for existing road conditions. There, the officer-while not an eyewitness to the accident-had investigated hundreds of automobile accidents during his 14-year career; he also had interviewed the parties involved in the accident and made observations at the scene of the accident, including those regarding icy road conditions. <em>See Hart-Anderson, </em>239 Mont. at 448, 781 P.2d at 1118. We concluded the officer\u2019s testimony could assist the trier of fact on the causation issue; the officer had \u201cextensive experience in these types of investigations and an adequate foundation was presented for his testimony.\u201d <em>Hart-Anderson, </em>239 Mont. at 449, 781 P.2d at 1119. While we did not specifically address either Rule 701 or Rule 702, M.R.Evid., in <em>Hart-Anderson, </em>our reliance on the officer\u2019s training and experience, together with our statement that an adequate foundation was presented, at the very least suggests that we had in mind the foundational requirement of Rule 702 that an expert be qualified by \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education[.]\u201d Nothing in Rule 701, M.R.Evid., or our cases thereunder, suggests the necessity or propriety of such a focus in determining whether a lay opinion may be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\u00b619 The State also posits that <em>State v. Gregor off </em>(1997), 287 Mont. 1, 951 P.2d 578, is similar to the present case. Its reliance on <em>Gregoroff </em>is puzzling, since the case supports Nobach\u2019s position rather than its own. There, the officer was not presented as an expert witness but offered an opinion that the driver was under the influence of alcohol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>to an extent that it diminished his ability to drive his truck safely; the trial court admitted the testimony over a lack of foundation objection. The officer\u2019s training and experience encompassed 12 weeks\u2019 training at the Highway Patrol Academy, including special training in DUI investigation; 8 years\u2019 experience as a Highway Patrol Officer; 2 separate 2-week-long traffic investigation courses; an accident reconstruction course which resulted in recognition as an \u201caccident reconstructionist;\u201d a course on instructing on DUI detection; teaching various law enforcement entities on the subject; participation in over 100 DUI arrests; and investigation of over 200 traffic accidents. <em>Gregoroff, 287 </em>Mont. at 4, 951 P.2d at 580. On appeal, we stated the officer\u2019s training and experience clearly qualified her as an expert in accident investigation and reconstruction. We went on to state that, under Rule 702, M.R.Evid., an expert witness can assist the trier of fact by giving an opinion based on her \u201cspecialized knowledge,\u201d and to hold that the officer was qualified as an expert to express her opinions regarding the cause of the accident. <em>Gregoroff, 287 </em>Mont. at 4-5, 951 P.2d at 580-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b620 <em>Gregoroff </em>clearly \u201cfills in the blanks\u201d we left in <em>Hart-Anderson </em>by clarifying that a law enforcement officer can offer an expert opinion about the cause of an accident so long as sufficient foundation is presented, as required by Rule 702, M.R.Evid. The officer\u2019s expert opinion in <em>Gregoroff </em>is strikingly similar to that offered by Brooks in the present case, namely, that Nobach\u2019s ability to safely drive his vehicle was diminished by his consumption of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b621 Nobach compares Brooks\u2019 opinion testimony to the testimony of a law enforcement officer regarding the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test in <em>Hulse v. State, Dept. of Justice, Motor Vehicle Div., </em>1998 MT 108, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75. There, we held that, before a law enforcement officer may testify regarding a correlation between alcohol consumption and HGN, the State must present foundation evidence establishing that the officer has special training or education qualifying him as an expert on the scientific basis for the HGN test. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 70. Nobach maintains, and we agree, that foundation as to scientific training or education also is required here.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b622  We conclude Brooks\u2019 opinion that Nobach\u2019s ability to drive safely was diminished as a result of his consumption of drugs was expert opinion testimony requiring an adequate foundation pursuant to Rule 702, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"AZJ\">\n<em>b. Foundation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b623 The State argues that Brooks\u2019 experience and training, like the officer\u2019s in <em>Gregoroff, </em>provides a sufficient foundation for the admission of his expert opinion that Nobach\u2019s ability to drive safely was impaired by consumption of drugs and as to the effects of several prescription <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>medications interacting with each other. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b624 Brooks testified that he had been employed by the Montana Highway Patrol for three and one-half years. During that period, his main duties were \u201cjust traffic regulation,\u201d although he also testified that he does traffic accidents and arrests for the offense of driving under the influence of alcohol. Prior to joining the Highway Patrol, he went to a military academy in San Antonio, Texas, for two and one-half months, served three years as a military police officer in the Navy, and attended the Highway Patrol Academy in Helena, Montana. He stated generally that he had training at the Highway Patrol Academy, and also three days of specialized training in Missoula, in determining whether a person is under the influence of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b625 It is clear that Brooks\u2019 training and experience with regard to the effects of drug consumption-particularly the consumption of prescription medications-is substantially less than the <em>Gregoroff </em>officer\u2019s training and experience on the effects of alcohol ingestion. Brooks did not testify regarding the extent of any training he received relating to determining the influence of drugs at either the Highway Patrol Academy or the military academy. Moreover, he testified affirmatively that a lot of the three days of drug-related training he received centered around common illegal or illicit drugs like marijuana, methamphetamine, speed and cocaine. Brooks also admitted his lack of familiarity with some of the prescription drugs Nobach took regularly and also with some of those which reflected in the toxicology report on Nob\u00e1ch\u2019s blood sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u00b626  We hold the foundation regarding Brooks\u2019 training and experience in this case is insufficient to demonstrate the special training or education and adequate knowledge on which to base an expert opinion as required under Rule 702, M.R.Evid. <em>See Southern, </em>\u00b6 49 (citations omitted). Because Brooks\u2019 experience and training did not provide a sufficient foundation for the admission of his expert opinion, the District Court abused its discretion in admitting that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">c. <em>Harmless or Reversible Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">\u00b627 The final portion of our analysis requires a determination of whether the error in admitting Brooks\u2019 expert testimony was harmless, as the State contends, or reversible, as Nobach argues. We recently addressed and clarified our approach to harmless or reversible error. The first step in the analysis is to determine whether the claimed error is categorized as \u201cstructural\u201d error or \u201ctrial\u201d error. Structural error is error that affects the framework within which a trial proceeds; it typically is of constitutional dimension, precedes the trial, and undermines the fairness of the entire trial proceeding. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38 (citations omitted). Trial error, on the other hand, typically occurs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>during the presentation of a case to the jury and includes improper admission of evidence. <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 40, 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b628 Based on these definitions of structural error and trial error, the erroneous admission of Brooks\u2019 expert testimony is clearly trial error. As such, its admission does not automatically constitute grounds for reversal but is amenable to qualitative assessment under our harmless error statute, \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA, regarding its prejudicial impact relative to the other evidence introduced at trial. <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. Specifically, we review whether the finder of fact was presented with admissible evidence which proved the same facts as did the tainted evidence and, if so, whether the tainted evidence would have contributed to the conviction qualitatively by comparison. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b629 On the record before us, the jury was presented with admissible evidence that proved the same facts as Brooks\u2019 disputed testimony on whether drugs affected Nobach\u2019s ability to drive. The State\u2019s expert witness, pharmacist Gary Morrison, identified-one by one-the narcotic and analgesic drugs in the toxicology report on Nobach\u2019s blood sample and discussed the negative side effects of those drugs. He testified that methadone, a powerful pain reliever, causes drowsiness and slows reaction time and reflexes. Hydrocodone, another pain reliever, also dulls reflexes. Phenobarbital, a barbituate, has drowsiness as a side effect. The toxicology report also indicated the presence in Nobach\u2019s blood of Ambien (a sleeping pill), caffeine, and acetaminophen (a Tylenol ingredient). Morrison testified without objection that this combination of drugs in a person\u2019s body would cause drowsiness, cloud judgment and slow reaction time. He further testified he would not advise a person to operate a motor vehicle while taking the drugs contained in the toxicology report and would expect that a trained pharmacist like Nobach would be aware of the effects of taking such drugs. In addition, although Nobach\u2019s position at trial was that his reaction to medication was not the cause of his accident, he admitted having stated under oath prior to trial that he believed the accident was caused by an adverse reaction to his medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b630 The above-described expert testimony of pharmacist Morrison covered in greater detail and with greater clarity the same subject matter as the erroneously-admitted testimony of Brooks. Moreover, Morrison\u2019s testimony was admitted without objection. Particularly since Brooks admitted his own lack of familiarity with the meaning of the levels of the various drugs in Nobach\u2019s blood, we conclude that under the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test endorsed in <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43, Brooks\u2019 erroneously-admitted testimony-considered qualitatively in comparison to the other evidence presented-would not have contributed to Nobach\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u00b631  We hold that while the District Court abused its discretion in admitting expert opinion testimony from Brooks regarding the effect of the prescription medications on Nobach\u2019s driving ability, the error was harmless and is not grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b375-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
