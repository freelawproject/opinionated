Did the District Court err in denying Greenway\u2019s third motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">\u00b64 2.

Did the District Court err in denying Greenway\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, or alternatively, for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ApM\">\u00b66 Greenway is a Montana corporation located in Helena, Montana. Tony Casiano (\u201cCasiano\u201d) was hired by Greenway as a construction laborer in October 1997. On April 27, 1998, Casiano completed Greenway\u2019s six month probationary period. During Casiano\u2019s employment at Greenway, he worked on several projects, including the construction of a surgical center next to St. Peter\u2019s Hospital in Helena (\u201cthe Surgi-Center project\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">\u00b67 On July 17, 1998, while working at the Surgi-Center project, Casiano was discharged from his employment by his supervisor, John Ellermeyer, for alleged insubordination. That same day, Jon Hoovestal, Vice President of Greenway, informed Casiano of Greenway\u2019s written internal grievance procedures. Greenway did not provide Casiano a written copy of its grievance procedures after his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">\u00b68 On April 7, 1999, Casiano filed a complaint against Greenway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>under the Montana Wrongful Discharge Act alleging that: 1) his discharge was in retaliation for filing a worker\u2019s compensation claim in violation of \u00a7 39-71-317(1), MCA; 2) Ms discharge was not for good cause in violation of \u00a7 39-2-904(2), MCA; and 3) his discharge was in retaliation for refusing to violate public policy in violation of \u00a7 39-2-904(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b69 On August 1, 2000, Greenway filed a third motion for summary judgment allegmg Casiano\u2019s action was barred by \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA, since he failed to first exhaust Greenway\u2019s internal grievance procedures prior to filing his action in the District Court. Relying on our holding in <em>Eadus v. Wheatland Memorial Hospital </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 216, 926 P.2d 752, the District Court entered an order denying Greenway\u2019s motion on September 12,2000. The court determined that Casiano\u2019s action was not barred by \u00a7 39-2-911, MCA, as Greenway did not provide Casiano a written copy of its internal grievance procedures witMn seven days after Ms discharge in compliance with \u00a7 39-2-911(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b610 A jury trial commenced on October 16, 2000. After the jury was selected, sworn, and the venire were excused, Greenway\u2019s counsel moved to discharge the jury pursuant to <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69. Greenway alleged Casiano\u2019s counsel impermissibly exercised a peremptory challenge against a prospective juror based upon the prospective juror\u2019s social condition as a Helena business owner. Additionally, Greenway requested that Casiano\u2019s counsel state why a peremptory challenge was exercised against the prospective juror. The District Court derned Greenway\u2019s motion and did not reqmre Casiano\u2019s counsel to state the reason employed in exercising a peremptory challenge against the prospective juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b611 On October 19, 2000, the jury returned a special verdict finding that Casiano was not discharged m retaliation for filing a worker\u2019s compensation claim. The jury further found that Casiano was not discharged for good cause because Greenway violated the express provisions of its written personnel policy. The jury awarded Casiano damages in the amount $40,908.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u00b612 On October 26, 2000, Greenway filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, or alternatively, for a new trial claiming there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s damage award of $40,908.00. On November 16, 2000, the District Court demed Greenway\u2019s motion finding there was not a complete absence of credible evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. On the same day, the District Court entered judgment in the amount of $43,777.33 against Greenway. Greenway appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\">\u00b613 Our review of a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment is de novo. <em>See Eadus v. Wheatland Memorial Hospital &amp; Nursing Home </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 216, 219, 926 P.2d 752, 754 (citation omitted). Therefore, we apply the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria as applied by the district court. <em>See Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903. Pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont. at 264, 900 P.2d at 903 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b614 In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to discharge the jury based upon a <em>Batson </em>challenge, we will defer to the district court\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous, and will review the district court\u2019s application of the law de novo. <em>See State v. Ford, </em>2001 MT 230, \u00b6 7, 306 Mont. 517, \u00b6 7, 39 P.3d 108, \u00b6 7 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u00b615  We will not reverse a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law unless there is a complete absence of credible evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Kneeland v. Luzenac America, Inc., </em>1998 MT 136, \u00b6 53, 289 Mont. 201, \u00b6 53, 961 P.2d 725, \u00b6 53 (citations omitted). In reviewing the evidence, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>See Kneeland, </em>\u00b6 51 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u00b616 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion. <em>Kneeland, </em>\u00b6 54 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">\u00b617 Did the District Court err in denying Greenway\u2019s third motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">\u00b618 Greenway contends Casiano\u2019s wrongful discharge action is precluded by \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA, because Casiano failed to exhaust its internal grievance procedures prior to filing his action in the District Court. Additionally, Greenway asserts the requirements of \u00a7 39-2-911(3), MCA, were satisfied since it provided Casiano a written copy of its grievance procedures dining his employment, and Jon Hoovestal, Vice President of Greenway, expressly told Casiano about its internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>grievance procedures and how to facilitate such procedures on the day of his discharge. Greenway alleges that although it did not provide Casiano a written copy of its grievance procedures within seven days of his discharge, Hoovestal\u2019s oral explanation equates to supplying a copy of its grievance procedures to Casiano in compliance with \u00a7 39-2-911(3), MCA. Greenway further claims the facts presented in <em>Eadus </em>are distinguishable from the facts in this case, as there was no evidence in <em>Eadus </em>that the employer\u2019s grievance procedure was orally explained to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b619 Casiano responds that Greenwsiy\u2019s failure to provide him a written copy of its internal grievance procedures within seven days of his discharge, as required by \u00a7 39-2-911(3), MCA, precludes Greenway from availing itself of the defense set forth in \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA, pursuant to our decision in <em>Eadus. </em>Casiano points out that the facts presented in <em>Eadus </em>are analogous to the facts presented in the case at hand. Most notably, the employee in Eadus, as here, was provided a written copy of the employer\u2019s internal grievance procedures during her employment, but was not provided another copy within seven days of her discharge. Further, the employer <em>in. Eadus, </em>as here, notified the employee of its written internal grievance procedures on the day of her discharge. Casiano therefore contends we should affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Greenway\u2019s third motion for summary judgment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b620 Section 39-2-911(3), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">If the employer maintains written internal procedures under which an employee may appeal a discharge within the organizational structure of the employer, the employer shall within 7 days of the date of the discharge notify the discharged employee of the existence of such procedures <em>and shall supply the discharged employee with a copy of them. If the employer fails to comply with this subsection, the discharged employee need not comply with subsection (2). </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u00b621  We held in <em>Eadus </em>that the plain language of \u00a7 39-2-911(3), MCA, precludes an employer from availing itself of the defense set forth in \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA, if the employer fails both to notify the discharged employee of its internal grievance procedures and to provide the employee a written copy of its internal grievance procedures within seven days of the employee\u2019s discharge. <em>See Eadus, </em>279 Mont. at 222, 926 P.2d at 756. Here, it is undisputed that Greenway notified Casiano of its internal grievance procedures on the day of his discharge, but failed to provide him a written copy of the procedures within seven days of his discharge. Consequently, we conclude that Greenway did not comply with \u00a7 39-2-911(3), MCA, and thus Casiano was not required to comply with \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>prior to filing his action. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Greenway\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b622 Did the District Court err in denying Greenway\u2019s motion to discharge the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u00b623 Relying upon <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69, Greenway contends its constitutional right to equal protection of the law, guaranteed by Article II, \u00a7 4, of the Montana Constitution, was denied when Casiano\u2019s counsel exercised a peremptory challenge against a prospective juror based upon the prospective juror\u2019s social condition as a Helena business owner. Greenway additionally alleges the District Court committed reversible error when it failed to require Casiano\u2019s counsel to provide reasons why it exercised a peremptory challenge against the prospective juror.</p>\n<p id=\"A6x\">\u00b624 Casiano asserts a peremptory challenge may be exercised without having to explain the reason behind its utilization. Moreover, Casiano points out that <em>Batson </em>and its progeny involve discrimination of members of a cognizable racial group or a suspect class in the jury selection process. Casiano thus claims that a <em>Batson </em>challenge is not applicable in the case at hand since the prospective juror excused in this case is not a member of a cognizable racial group or suspect class.</p>\n<p id=\"AVB\">\u00b625 The issue of discrimination based on social condition in jury selection is a matter of first impression for this Court. The United States Supreme Court has held that the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution forbids the State in criminal cases from utilizing peremptory challenges to remove potential jurors based solely on their race. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 89, 106 S.Ct. at 1719. The Court has expanded the scope of <em>Batson </em>to forbid defendants in criminal cases and litigants in civil cases from utilizing peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors based on race. See <em>Georgia v. McCollum </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 42,112 S.Ct. 2348, 120 L.Ed.2d 33; and <em>Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co. </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 614, 111 S.Ct. 2077, 114 L.Ed.2d 660. The Court further broadened the application <em>o\u00ed Batson </em>to preclude the use of peremptory challenges to exclude jurors based upon their gender in <em>J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B. </em>(1994), 511 U.S. 127, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 128 L.Ed.2d 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u00b626 We have held that \u201c[wjhile defendants have a right \u2018to be tried by a jury whose members are selected pursuant to nondiscriminatory criteria,\u2019 <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 85-86, 106 S.Ct. at 1717, this right must be exercised in a timely manner.\u201d <em>State v. Ford, </em>2001 MT 230, \u00b6 21, 306 Mont. 517, \u00b6 21, 39 P.3d 108, \u00b6 21 (citation omitted). Accordingly, we must address whether Greenway\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge was timely made before we address the merits of its challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>\u00b627 We determined in <em>Ford </em>that a <em>Batson </em>challenge must be made prior to the impanelment of the jury and the dismissal of the venire to be timely. <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6 28. In determining the point in the proceedings when a <em>Batson </em>challenge should timely be made, we noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">If we allow a <em>Batson </em>challenge to be raised after the jury is impaneled and sworn and the venire dismissed, we not only impair the ability of the challenged attorney to effectively defend his or her strikes, but we also deprive the district court of the ability to correct any error in the proceedings in a timely fashion. While we have not previously addressed the <em>Batson </em>challenge explicitly, the concept of requiring a substantive challenge to be brought while the district court still has the opportunity to cure the alleged defect is not novel. We have consistently held that the purpose of a timely objection is to give a district judge the first opportunity to correct any error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\"><em>Ford, </em>\u00b6 27 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b628 Here, Greenway\u2019s counsel moved to discharge the jury based upon <em>Batson </em>and its progeny after the jury was selected, sworn, and the venire excused. We note that neither counsel in this case nor the District Court had the benefit of our <em>Ford </em>decision at the time of trial. However, our decision in <em>Ford </em>controls. Therefore, we conclude that Greenway\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge was untimely. Hence, we will not address the merits of Greenway\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Greenway\u2019s motion to discharge the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u00b629 Did the District Court err in denying Greenway\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, or alternatively, for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">\u00b630 Greenway points out that the jury\u2019s damage award of $40,908.00 was based on the assumption that Casiano would have remained employed with the company for four years had he not been wrongfully discharged from his employment. Greenway alleges, however, the evidence presented at trial was uncontroverted that Casiano would have been laid off due to lack of work on November 31,1998, when the Surgi-Center project was completed, as were all hourly employees. Greenway therefore maintains the jury award should be reduced to $8,018.00, the amount of money Casiano would have earned at his hourly wage from the date of his discharge through November 31, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">\u00b631 Casiano claims contradictory evidence was presented at trial regarding whether he would have continued to work for Greenway after the Surgi-Center project was completed. Notably, Casiano points out that Greenway continued his employment in the winter of 1997-1998 although there was not a construction project, and thus the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>could have made a reasonable inference from this evidence that Greenway would have continued his employment after completion of the Surgi-Center project. Casiano therefore contends there was not a complete absence of credible evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b632 Further, we agree with the rationale stated by the District Court in denying Greenway\u2019s motion. In its November 16, 2000, Order, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">In looking at the evidence, the Court would acknowledge that if it was the trier of fact, it would have to agree with Defendant\u2019s argument. However, the Court cannot say that there is a <em>complete </em>absence of credible evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. The jury was in a position to judge the credibility of Defendant\u2019s witnesses and must have believed that Casiano would have continued to work for Greenway as did John Ellermeyer. Although this Court might disagree with the jury\u2019s conclusion in this regard, it cannot say that there is a complete lack of credible evidence to support the verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u00b633  Since reasonable inferences could have been made from the evidence that Greenway would have continued Casiano\u2019s employment after the completion of the Surgi-Center project, we conclude there was not a complete absence of evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Greenway\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, or alternatively, for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u00b634 We note in passing that Casiano requests the imposition of sanctions against Greenway on the grounds that Greenway\u2019s appeal was taken without substantial or reasonable grounds, pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P. After reviewing the record and the arguments made by Greenway, we conclude that sanctions are not appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\u00b635 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b389-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
