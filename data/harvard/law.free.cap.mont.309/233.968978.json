The County also appeals from the court\u2019s issuance of a writ of mandate ordering approval of Mesa\u2019s application. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in concluding that the term \u201cexisting,\u201d as used in the County\u2019s Zoning Regulations, applies only to telecommunications towers actually in existence and not to towers that were approved but not yet built.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">\u00b63 Resolution No. 98-69, Section 27-320 of the County Zoning Regulations (Regulations) sets standards for telecommunications towers. Section 27-320G, subsection 11, of the Regulations is entitled \u201cTower Separation\u201d and requires that \u201c[a]ll commercial telecommunications towers over fifty (50) feet in height ... shall be located at least one (1) mile from any other commercial telecommunications tower.\u201d The Regulations further provide that \u201c[n]o new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning Department that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant\u2019s proposed antenna.\u201d Regulations, Section 27-320E, subsection 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">\u00b64 In November of 2000, Mesa applied to the City of Billings/Yellowstone County Planning Department for permission to construct a wireless telecommunications tower 250 feet in height within the County\u2019s zoning jurisdiction. Mesa proposed to lease Summit Wireless space on the tower for an antenna. The City of Billings/County Planning Department reviewed the application and recommended it be denied based on the 1-mile separation requirement, because a 100-foot tower had been built and a 300-foot tower had been approved, but not yet built, within a mile of the tower proposed by Mesa.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">\u00b65 The Regulations allow the Commissioners to waive the 1-mile separation requirement on \u201cspecial review\u201d if an applicant establishes that an existing tower could not accommodate the applicant\u2019s proposed antenna. In fact, the Commissioners ha.d waived the requirement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>approving the application for the 300-foot tower, which was submitted by TriStar. Mesa applied for special review.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\">\u00b66 The County Zoning Commission held a public hearing on Mesa\u2019s request for special review. At the hearing, Mesa presented evidence that it was not technically feasible to place Summit\u2019s antenna on the existing 100-foot tower. Mesa did not present evidence that it would be infeasible to place the antenna on the previously-approved 300-foot tower. A TriStar representative testified that TriStar could and would accommodate Summit\u2019s antenna on its tower, construction of which had not yet begun. Following the December 11, 2000 public hearing, the Zoning Commission recommended to the Commissioners that Mesa\u2019s application for special review be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b67 A week later, the Commissioners held a hearing on Mesa\u2019s application and took it under advisement. On January 9, 2001, the Commissioners issued a written denial of Mesa\u2019s application for special review, reasoning that Mesa\u2019s proposed tower was within a 1-mile radius of the proposed and approved TriStar tower. They concluded it would \u201cnot make sense\u201d to interpret the Regulations to fail to consider the approved tower.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b68 Mesa then filed a \u201cPetition for Declaratory Judgment, Judicial Review, and Appropriate Writ,\u201d in the District Court, seeking a declaration of its legal rights and relief from application of the 1-mile Regulation. The parties ultimately agreed the matter could be resolved via a summary ruling on Mesa\u2019s request for declaratory judgment and, accordingly, each party moved for summary judgment on the same undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b69 The District Court granted Mesa\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the County\u2019s. In doing so, the court adopted Mesa\u2019s argument that the 1-mile separation requirement applied only to towers that have been constructed and not to unconstructed towers approved for construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err in concluding that the term \u201cexisting,\u201d as used in the Regulations, applies only to telecommunications towers actually in existence and not to towers that were approved but not yet built?</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">\u00b611 Our standard of review in summary judgment appeals is <em>de novo. </em>We use the same standards used by the trial court: first, whether issues of material fact exist and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P.; <em>Winslow v. Montana Rail Link, </em>Inc., 2000 MT 292, \u00b6 38, 302 Mont. 289, \u00b6 38, 16 P.3d 992, \u00b6 38 (citation omitted). In cases such as this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>one, where the parties agree on the facts, we review only the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Watters v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co., </em>2000 MT 150, \u00b6 21, 300 Mont. 91, \u00b6 21, 3 P.3d 626, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b612 The County argues the meaning of \u201cexisting tower\u201d is imprecise and open to at least two reasonable interpretations: one that includes approved but not yet built towers, and one that excludes approved but not yet built towers. In light of such an ambiguity, the County urges that interpreting the Regulation to include approved but not yet built towers furthers the Regulations\u2019 purpose of limiting the number of towers and, as a result, limits the towers\u2019 adverse aesthetic effects.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag6\">\u00b613 Mesa contends, on the other hand, that the term \u201cexisting tower\u201d is not ambiguous. The District Court agreed, and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b614 The same rules of construction apply to official enactments by county commissioners as apply to the construction of a statute. <em>State, ex rel. Thompson v. Gallatin County </em>(1947), 120 Mont. 263, 271, 184 P.2d 998, 1002. Under those rules, we look first to the plain meaning of the words used in determining the intent of the enacting entity; only where that intent cannot be determined from the plain meaning of the words used may we go further and apply other means of interpretation. <em>See Murphy for L. C. v. State </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 342, 344, 748 P.2d 907, 908 (citations omitted). The role of the judge is to \u201cascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained [in the Regulations], not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b615  The term \u201cexisting tower\u201d as used in the Regulations is neither ambiguous nor imprecise. \u201cExist\u201d means to have real being, whether material or spiritual, or to have being in space and time. WEBSTER\u2019S NinthNew Collegiate Dictionary 435 (1991). A telecommunications tower clearly has no spiritual being. Such a tower does, however, have real material being. In addition, a tower has being in space and time. Neither can be said of an \u201capproved\u201d tower on which construction has not begun. Consequently, we conclude that an \u201cexisting tower\u201d does not include one which has not yet been built or even begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b616 Moreover, as the District Court noted, other sections of the Regulations refer separately to \u201cproposed\u201d and \u201cexisting\u201d towers. <em>See </em>Regulations, Sections 27-320G, subsection 8, and 27-320K, subsection 5. The Regulations clearly distinguish between towers which have been constructed and towers merely proposed for construction. The Commissioners\u2019 denial of Mesa\u2019s application did not specifically address the Regulations\u2019 use of the word \u201cexisting;\u201d nor did it recognize the alternative use of the word \u201cproposed.\u201d It focused on the purposes of the Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u00b617 Because the question of law at issue here can be resolved based on the plain meaning of the words used in the Regulations, we do not address at length the County\u2019s argument regarding the purpose of the Regulations. We merely point out that the Regulations set forth a number of legitimate and competing public purposes, including \u201cenhanc[ing] the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community as quickly, effectively, and efficiently as possible.\u201d <em>See </em>Regulations, Section 27-320A.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\">\u00b618 For similar reasons, we do not address at length the County\u2019s reliance on <em>City of New York v. Love Shack </em>(N.Y.A.D. 1 Dept. 2001), 729 N.Y.S.2d 37, in support of its contention that the term \u201cexisting\u201d in a regulation includes a use that has been approved. <em>Love Shack </em>is distinguishable. First, there is no indication in <em>Love Shack </em>that the policy at issue there made a distinction between \u201cexisting\u201d and \u201cproposed\u201d adult establishments. Second, the New York court\u2019s decision may have been influenced by the fact that the applicant concealed its intention to open an adult establishment in its application for a building permit. <em>See Love Shack, </em>729 N.Y.S.2d at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"Au9\">\u00b619  We hold the District Court correctly concluded that the term \u201cexisting\u201d as used in County Regulations only applies to telecommunications towers actually in existence and not to towers that were approved but not yet built. Therefore, we affirm the District Court\u2019s summary declaratory judgment in Mesa\u2019s favor and its writ of mandate requiring the Commissioners to approve Mesa\u2019s application to build a telecommunications tower.</p>\n<judges id=\"b261-4\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b261-5\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"A_z\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b620 I dissent. The zoning regulations in question were designed to limit the number of communications towers in the county. In light of that purpose, the Board of County Commissioners interpreted the term \u201cexisting tower\u201d as encompassing approved but not yet built towers. I would defer to that reasonable interpretation. The interpretation adopted by the District Court and approved by this Court results in an increase in the number of towers in the county and thereby defeats the purpose of the regulation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
