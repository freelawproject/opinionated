Brown appeals from the March 30,2001, Memorandum and Order of the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, dismissing Brown\u2019s claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">\u00b62 Brown raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in granting judgment to Defendants without first conducting a hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in holding that Brown failed to state a cognizable claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AtS\">\u00b65 In 1976, Brown was charged, convicted and sentenced on his plea of guilty to five separate felonies. Brown was sentenced to serve ten years for theft, one hundred years for deliberate homicide, twenty years for sexual intercourse without consent, forty years for robbery and twenty years for aggravated assault. The court ordered that, for purposes of parole, the sentences were separate and would be served consecutively. In 1982, Brown was sentenced to an additional four years for the offense of escape, which sentence was to run consecutively to the 1976 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">\u00b66 In 1993, Brown filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with this Court. Brown argued that prison officials had miscalculated his parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>eligibility date by applying an unconstitutional parole statute and through miscalculation and misapplication of his earned good time credits. We denied Brown\u2019s petition, holding that Brown had misinterpreted the parole statute and that the statute was constitutional. Resolution of these issues did not require us to calculate or apply Brown\u2019s earned good time credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b67 In May 1996, Brown filed a complaint in the First Judicial District Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, and 1988, seeking to address alleged deprivations of his rights by prison officials. Upon motion by Defendants, the District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P. The court held that the issues Brown raised in his complaint were, in essence, the same issues previously litigated in his 1993 petition for writ of habeas corpus, and therefore the claims were barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b68 Brown appealed and this Court remanded the case back to the District Court, concluding that the District Court mischaracterized the issues in the 1993 Writ, and because we did not consider Brown\u2019s <em>earned </em>good time credits in the 1993 Writ, that three of Brown\u2019s claims were not barred by collateral estoppel. Brown\u2019s remaining claims were: (1) prison officials\u2019 alleged failure to apply good time credits at 13 days per month from 1982 through 1992; (2) prison officials\u2019 alleged failure to recalculate Brown\u2019s good time credits in light of statements made by them pertaining to Brown\u2019s eligibility date in his previous suit; and (3) application of the new inmate policy to Brown constituted an ex post facto application of the law. <em>Brown v. State </em>(1997), No. 96-651 (unpublished) (hereinafter <em>Brown I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b69 After an unexplained delay of approximately four years, the District Court dismissed Brown\u2019s remaining claims, holding that they were not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err in granting judgment to Defendants without first holding a hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">\u00b611 Brown argues that the District Court\u2019s failure \u201cto follow the previous remand ORDER from this Court April 15,1997-over four (4) years ago, should be addressed by the Court and some type of remedial ORDER or guidelines developed to require a District Court to hold hearings when ordered to do so. This is an ongoing problem faced by <em>pro se </em>prisoner litigants at the District Court level which this Court should address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">\u00b612 Defendants did not respond to this argument in their brief, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Brown argues in his reply that \u201c[flailure to address this issue is an admission that Appellant is correct on the subject. Rule 8(d) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b613 Rule 8(d), M.R.Civ.P., provides that, \u201c[a]verments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required, ... are admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading. Averments in a pleading to which no responsive pleading is required or permitted shall be taken as denied or avoided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b614 Brown has misapplied Rule 8(d) to these proceedings. Rule 1, M.R.Civ.P., states that, \u201c[tjhese rules govern the procedure in the district courts of the state of Montana.\u201d The Rules of Appellate Procedure apply to this appeal, and those rules do not contain a provision similar to Rule 8(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b615  On remand, the trial court is free to make any order or decision in further progress of the case, not inconsistent with the decision of the appellate court. <em>Haines Pipeline Const., Inc. v. Montana Power Co. </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 282, 290, 876 P.2d 632, 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b616  In <em>Brown I, </em>our direction to \u201cremand for further proceedings,\u201d did not require the District Court to conduct a hearing as argued by Brown. Accordingly, the District Court did not err when declining to conduct a hearing on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\u00b617 Did the District Court err in holding that Brown failed to state a cognizable claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983?</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\u00b618 The District Court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Rule 12(c), M.R.Civ.P. A movant for judgment on the pleadings must establish that no material issue of fact remains and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hedges v. Woodhouse, </em>2000 MT 220, \u00b6 8, 301 Mont. 180, \u00b6 8, 8 P.3d 109, \u00b6 8. The district court must construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, whose allegations are taken as true. <em>Hedges, </em>\u00b6 8. A district court\u2019s decision on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is a conclusion of law and this Court reviews the district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if the trial court\u2019s decision was correct. <em>Hedges, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">\u00b619 The District Court held that Brown\u2019s claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey </em>(1994), 512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383. In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that a state prisoner\u2019s claim for damages is not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 if \u201ca judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,\u201d unless the prisoner can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has been previously invalidated. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372, 129 L.Ed.2d at 394. The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>concluded that Brown\u2019s claim, essentially, is that \u201cby miscalculating his good time, the Defendants are subjecting him to extended unlawful incarceration. This implicates the validity of his continued incarceration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b620 Brown argues that the District Court erred in concluding that his claim implicates the validity of his continued incarceration. He states that, because his sentence is for a total of 194 years, a favorable ruling would only allow him an earlier parole appearance; his period of incarceration would not be shortened because there is no guarantee that he would be granted parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b621 Habeas corpus is the exclusive remedy for a state prisoner who challenges the fact or duration of his confinement and seeks immediate or speedier release, even though such a claim may come within the literal terms of \u00a7 1983. <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez </em>(1973), 411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1841, 36 L.Ed.2d 439, 456. In <em>Preiser, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that Congress had provided state prisoners with a specific remedy through habeas corpus, and that specific provision overrides the general terms of \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b622 In <em>Heck, </em>the petitioner did not seek immediate or speedier release, but monetary damages, and argued that he could not obtain those damages through a habeas corpus proceeding. The Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment,... a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. ... Thus, when a state prisoner seeks damages in a \u00a7 1983 suit, the district court must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated. But if the district court determines that the plaintiff\u2019s action, even if successful, will <em>not </em>demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff, the action should be allowed to proceed, in the absence of some other bar to the suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\"><em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372-73, 129 L.Ed.2d at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"AOl\">\u00b623 Brown attempts to distinguish his situation from <em>Heck </em>and its progeny by casting his claim as one for an earlier parole appearance, rather than as effecting his ultimate release date. He states that \u201c[e]ven if he were to receive \u2018day for day\u2019 good time credit toward this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>sentence [194 years], he would never live long enough to discharge the sentence. The only result of a favorable ruling would be for him to receive a parole appearance and be considered for parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b624 The Ninth Circuit considered a similar argument in <em>Neal v. Shimoda </em>(1997), 131 F.3d 818. In that case, state prisoners were challenging their classification as sex offenders. As a result of the classification, the prisoners became ineligible for parole until completing a treatment program. The court held that this challenge did not fall under the rubric of <em>Heck </em>because a decision in the prisoners\u2019 favor would not \u201cundermine the validity of their convictions or continuing confinement at all. The only benefit that a victory in this case would provide [the prisoners], besides the possibility of monetary damages, is a ticket to get in the door of the parole board, thus only making them <em>eligible </em>for parole consideration . . . [I]t will in no way <em>guarantee </em>parole or necessarily shorten their prison sentences by a single day.\u201d <em>Neal, </em>131 F.3d at 824 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b625 Brown\u2019s case is easily distinguishable from NeaZ. The prisoners in <em>Neal </em>were challenging the process by which they were declared sex offenders. The label did not affect their sentences, but only affected their eligibility for parole. Brown, on the other hand, claims that prison officials improperly calculated his good time credits. If Brown is successful and receives his good time credit, it will indeed shorten his prison sentence, albeit not enough to have any practical impact.</p>\n<p id=\"AeV\">\u00b626  We hold that Brown\u2019s claims, if proven, would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence and are therefore not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 unless he can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated. As we noted in <em>Brown I, </em>Brown\u2019s claims are not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel and may be brought in a proceeding for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u00b627 The District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b135-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b135-8\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"At8\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">\u00b628 In <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>a portion of which is set forth in \u00b6 22 of the Court\u2019s opinion, the United States Supreme Court held that if the District Court determines that the plaintiffs action, even if successful, would not demonstrate the invalidity of his outstanding criminal conviction, then a \u00a7 1983 action should be allowed to proceed, unless there is some other bar to the suit. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Here, even if Brown was successful in his action, his outstanding criminal judgment would not in any sense be invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">\u00b629 As in <em>Neil v. Shimoda, </em>cited by this Court at \u00b6 24, the only benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Brown might receive if his \u00a7 1983 cause of action was successful, would be a possible advancement of his opportunity to appear before the Parole Board. This brings his case squarely within the <em>Neil v. Shimoda </em>holding. I would therefore reverse the holding of the District Court that Brown failed to state a cognizable cause of action under 42 U.S.C. 1983.</p>\n<judges id=\"b136-4\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER joins in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
