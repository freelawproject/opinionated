The District Court dismissed his petition when it concluded Pettijohn was barred from petitioning for postconviction relief, and that he waived his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>direct appeal by pleading guilty. Pettijohn appeals the denial of his petition for postconviction relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue presented is whether a district court possesses subject matter jurisdiction to impose a persistent felony offender designation upon a defendant being sentenced for felony DUI. We recently addressed this identical issue in <em>State v. Yorek, </em>2002 MT 74, 309 Mont. 238, 45 P.3d 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b63 On September 8, 1999, Pettijohn was charged with Count I, operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a fourth or subsequent offense, and Count II, failure to wear a seatbelt, a misdemeanor. Pettijohn entered pleas of not guilty to both counts on September 13, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b64 On September 17,1999, the State filed a Notice of Intent to Seek Increased Punishment, advising that it would seek to have Pettijohn sentenced as a persistent felony offender, based on his two prior felony convictions (DUI, Fourth or Subsequent Offense and Bail Jumping) in February, 1998, in Missoula County. The subsequent Omnibus Memorandum, filed on September 27,1999, also indicated the State\u2019s intention to seek increased punishment for Pettijohn as a persistent felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u00b65 On November 5, 1999, Pettijohn signed a Plea of Guilty and Waiver of Rights form, which stated that the maximum penalty under the DUI count could include time for persistent felony offender designation. On November 8, 1999, Pettijohn formally withdrew his guilty plea, and entered pleas of guilty, which the District Court accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">\u00b66 The District Court entered its sentence on January 5, 2000. On Count I, Pettijohn was sentenced to thirteen months in Montana State Prison (MSP), followed by four years of supervised release, and to ten years in MSP as a persistent felony offender, with the sentences to run concurrent to each other. The record is unclear as to Count II, which was presumably dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">\u00b67 Pettijohn filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for postconviction relief on September 12, 2000, wherein he raised several issues, including the legality of the persistent felony offender sentence. In its Response, the State argued Pettijohn was procedurally barred from raising his claims by \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA, because he failed to raise them on direct appeal. The State also argued Pettijohn waived his right to postconviction relief when he pled guilty, and that the District Court correctly designated Pettijohn as a persistent felony offender, since the State provided proper notice of its intent to seek increased punishment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Pettijohn was eligible for such designation based on his prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b68 The District Court dismissed Pettijohn\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, noting that a defendant who knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to direct appeal from a conviction is precluded from bringing a motion for postconviction relief. The District Court did not address the merits of Pettijohn\u2019s challenge that the imposition of persistent felony offender sentence was illegal. Pettijohn appeals the dismissal of his petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law correct. <em>State v. Charlo, </em>2000 MT 192, \u00b6 7, 300 Mont. 435, \u00b6 7, 4 P.3d 1201, \u00b6 7 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u00b610 Does a district court possess subject matter jurisdiction to impose a persistent felony offender designation upon a defendant being sentenced for felony DUI?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\u00b611 Pettijohn argues that the District Court erred in concluding he was procedurally barred from bringing his petition for postconviction relief under \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA, citing <em>State v. Moorman </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 330, 336, 928 P.2d 145,149, for the proposition that \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA, does not apply when the question presented is whether the sentencing court had subject matter jurisdiction to impose a particular sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">\u00b612 In <em>State v. Yorek, </em>under a similar factual scenario, we recently decided the identical issue presented by Pettijohii. Our holding in <em>Yorek </em>is dispositive of Pettijohn\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">\u00b613 We concluded in <em>Yorek </em>that the District Court possessed statutory authority pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA, to impose a persistent felony offender sentence on a person convicted of a felony DUI under \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA. <em>Yorek, </em>\u00b6 22. Like the defendant in <em>Yorek, </em>Pettijohn falls squarely within the persistent felony offender statute, because, within the past five years, Pettijohn was convicted of two other felonies and was currently being sentenced for a second felony committed on a different occasion than the first two. Moreover, the State provided proper notice to Pettijohn of its intent to seek imposition of a persistent felony offender sentence, pursuantto \u00a7\u00a7 46-13-108 and46-13-110(3)(g), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">\u00b614  We conclude, based on our decision in <em>State v. Yorek, </em>that the District Court possessed statutory authority, and therefore had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>jurisdiction, to designate and sentence Pettijohn as a persistent felony offender, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA. Moreover, and as in <em>Yorek, </em>because our conclusion reaches the merits of Pettijohn\u2019s claims and is dispositive, we need not address whether Pettijohn\u2019s guilty plea effectively waived his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b615 Although the District Court dismissed Pettijohn\u2019s petition based on a procedural bar, we will uphold a decision of the district court, if correct, regardless of the district court\u2019s reasoning in reaching its decision. <em>Ingersoll v. State, </em>1999 MT 215, \u00b6 12, 295 Mont. 520, \u00b6 12, 986 P.2d 403, \u00b6 12 (citation omitted). Therefore, the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Pettijohn\u2019s petition for postconviction relief is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b271-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, TRIEWEILER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
