INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b61 Todd Peterson (Peterson) was charged by information with fourth offense driving under the influence, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401 and \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA, in the Tenth Judicial District Court, Fergus County. Peterson collaterally challenged the felony status of the charge through a motion to dismiss, asserting that two of his previous misdemeanor convictions were constitutionally insufficient because he was not properly informed of his right to counsel. The District Court denied his motion, finding that Peterson was properly informed of his right to counsel in both instances. Peterson appeals the denial of his motion. We affirm the District Court on one conviction and remand for further findings on the other conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">Did the District Court err in finding that Peterson was informed of his right to counsel in two previous misdemeanor convictions for driving under the influence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">H. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">\u00b63 The facts of Peterson\u2019s most recent guilty plea to driving under the influence (DUI) are not at issue in this case. Therefore, we turn directly to the facts regarding Peterson\u2019s guilty pleas in two of his previous convictions. In 1988, Peterson pled guilty to a DUI charge in front of Fergus County Justice of the Peace David L. Sather (Judge Sather). In 1989, Peterson pled guilty to a DUI charge in front of Lewistown City Judge R. D. Brassey (Judge Brassey). Peterson asserted in an affidavit attached to his motion to dismiss that he was not properly informed of his right to counsel in both of these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u00b64 The District Court held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Peterson was properly advised during the entry of these two pleas and heard testimony from five witnesses. Sandra Coppedge, the custodian of the records for Fergus County Justice Court, testified regarding the documentation of Peterson\u2019s previous pleas and these documents were admitted as evidence. Judge Brassey testified regarding Peterson\u2019s 1989 plea. Because Judge Sather passed away on July 21,1999, Judge Brassey and Fergus County Justice of the Peace Jack Shields (Judge Shields) also testified regarding their understanding of the routine procedures Judge Sather used and would have followed in 1988. Peterson testified regarding both pleas, and his mother Betty Schramm (Schramm), testified regarding the 1989 plea.</p>\n<p id=\"A1v\">\u00b65 Following the hearing, the District Court entered an Order Denying Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (Order). In its Order, the court noted evidence in addition to that submitted at the hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Specifically, the court noted Judge Sather\u2019s testimony in <em>State v. Louann Rowland Petersen </em>(Fergus County Cause No. DC 96-46), in which Judge Sather testified as to his routine practice. The District Court further noted that this testimony was consistent with Judge Brassey\u2019s testimony of Judge Sather\u2019s routine practice to inform defendants of the right to counsel and the right to appointed counsel if indigent. Peterson now appeals this Order. Further details of the testimony and evidence are discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">IH. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b66 A rebuttable presumption of regularity, including the presumption that a defendant was properly informed of and waived any constitutional rights at issue, attaches to a prior DUI conviction used to enhance a subsequent conviction to a felony. <em>State v. Okland </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 10, 17-18, 941 P.2d 431, 436. This presumption must be overcome by direct evidence of irregularity from the defendant. <em>State v. Big Hair, </em>1998 MT 61, \u00b6 16, 288 Mont. 135, \u00b6 16, 955 P.2d 1352, \u00b6 16. The burden then shifts to the State to prove by a preponderance of evidence that the prior conviction was not obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>State v. Ailport, </em>1998 MT 315, \u00b6 7, 292 Mont. 172, \u00b6 7, 970 P.2d 1044, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u00b67 We review a trial court\u2019s findings on the evidence regarding a prior plea to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Ailport, </em>\u00b6 6. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or our review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been committed. <em>Ailport, </em>\u00b6 6. In making its findings, the trial court may consider evidence offered by the State that is outside the record of the conviction at issue which demonstrates the conviction was constitutionally sound. <em>Ailport, </em>\u00b6 15. Further, we have declined to require any specific type of evidence for the State to meet its burden. <em>State v. Brown, </em>1999 MT 143, \u00b6 20, 295 Mont. 5, \u00b6 20, 982 P.2d 1030, \u00b6 20. Conflicts in the evidence and questions of credibility are properly resolved by the trier of fact. <em>Brown, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>State v. Moga, </em>1999 MT 283, \u00b6 14, 297 Mont. 1, \u00b6 14, 989 P.2d 856, \u00b6 14. Finally, we review a trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Stringer </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 367, 374, 897 P.2d 1063, 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in finding that Peterson was informed of his right to counsel in two previous misdemeanor convictions for driving under the influence?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">\u00b69 At issue in this case is a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>counsel, <em>State v. Craig </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 140, 148, 906 P.2d 683, 688, or right to court appointed counsel if indigent, <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 14, 941 P.2d at 433, whenever a sentence of imprisonment is imposed, <em>State v. Hansen </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 321, 325, 903 P.2d 194, 197. The right to counsel may be validly waived by the defendant if the waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 14, 941 P.2d at 433. If a prior conviction is invalid for failure to inform the defendant of these rights regarding counsel, it may not be used to enhance the penalty of a subsequent conviction. <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 15, 941 P.2d at 434 (citing <em>Lewis v. State </em>(1969), 153 Mont. 460, 463, 457 P.2d 765, 766).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b610 We have reviewed the issue of collateral challenges to the validity of prior DUI convictions a number of times. In <em>Okland, </em>we upheld the district court when it prohibited the use of a prior DUI conviction to enhance a subsequent DUI to a felony because the prior conviction record demonstrated that the defendant asked for a court appointed attorney but was eventually convicted without an attorney. <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 19-20, 941 P.2d at 436-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b611 Further, in <em>Moga </em>we upheld the trial court when it allowed the use of a prior DUI conviction where the defendant testified that he was not informed of his right to counsel but the presiding judge submitted an affidavit stating that, although he could not remember the specific defendant, the record of the prior conviction indicated it was routine and it was his routine practice to properly inform defendants of the right to counsel, the right to court appointed counsel, and to require a valid waiver of that right. <em>Moga, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-15. In contrast, in <em>Jenni, </em>we upheld the district court when it disallowed the use of a prior DUI conviction when the State\u2019s evidence consisted only of a court document that generally stated the defendant was advised of all his rights. <em>State v. Jenni </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 21, 25-26, 938 P.2d 1318, 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">\u00b612 In <em>Couture </em>we upheld the trial court when it allowed the use a prior DUI conviction where the defendant denied being informed of the right to counsel, but the court record indicated the defendant was informed even though he did not sign the acknowledgment forms. <em>State v. Couture, </em>1998 MT 137, \u00b6 15-18, 289 Mont. 215, \u00b6 15-18, 959 P.2d 948, \u00b6 15-18. In <em>Ailport, </em>we upheld the trial court\u2019s allowance of a prior DUI conviction where the court was required to consider competing affidavits regarding a North Dakota court\u2019s routine practice. <em>Ailport, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b613 The parties in this case agree that Peterson met his burden to show direct evidence of irregularity because he testified that he was not informed of his rights regarding counsel or appointed counsel at either conviction. <em>See Couture, </em>\u00b6 15. <em>Compare Big Hair, </em>\u00b6 17-18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>(defendant\u2019s statement that he couldn\u2019t recall whether or not he was informed of his rights insufficient to rebut presumption of regularity of prior proceeding). Therefore, we must determine whether the District Court was clearly erroneous in finding that the State met its burden by a preponderance of the evidence to show Peterson was properly informed of his rights in each of his prior pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">A. The 1989 Plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b614 Regarding this conviction, Peterson asserts that he was not properly informed of his right to counsel. The State asserts that Judge Brassey\u2019s testimony regarding his routine practice to inform defendants of the right to counsel and the right to appointed counsel if indigent proves that Peterson was properly informed. The District Court found that the preponderance of the evidence demonstrated that Peterson\u2019s prior conviction was valid because he was \u201cadvised of his constitutional rights, he specifically requested time to consult with an attorney and thereafter entered a plea of guilty upon the advice of counsel.\u201d After a careful review of the record as discussed below, we conclude there is a conflict in the evidence that requires remand to the District Court for further findings regarding this plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b615 In support of his motion, Peterson testified that at his arraignment, he requested time to consult with attorney Torger Oaas (Oaas). He and his mother, Schramm, both testified that they later met with Oaas, that Peterson and Schramm decided not to hire Oaas because they were unable to afford his fee, and that Oaas did not give Peterson any legal advice. Further, Peterson and his mother both testified that Oaas was not present when Peterson plead guilty. Peterson also testified that Judge Brassey did not tell him the court would appoint Oaas, that Oaas was not appointed by the court as his attorney, and that to his knowledge, Oaas never received money from the court for his representation. Finally, Peterson testified that he told Judge Brassey he had talked to Oaas, but that he did not hire Oaas.</p>\n<p id=\"Ael\">\u00b616 In support of its burden, the State introduced court documents as evidence and Judge Brassey testified. Two documents are relevant to. the issue here. One is a Notice of Jury Trial and the other is a copy of Peterson\u2019s traffic citation, both of which have Judge Brassey\u2019s handwritten notes on them. The Notice of Jury Trial indicates that it was copied to \u201cDefense Attorney Torger Oaas\u201d and has Judge Brassey\u2019s handwritten note: \u201c12/7/89 on advice of attorney chg plea to guilty.\u201d Judge Brassey\u2019s notes on the traffic citation read: \u201crequested time to consult w/atty T. Oaas - set trial after consulting w/attorney.... 12/7/89 9:05 am chg plea to guilty on advice of attorney.\u201d Judge Brassey testified that although he did not remember Peterson\u2019s case specifically, it was his routine practice to inform defendants of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>right to counsel and the right to appointed counsel if indigent.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b617 However, in contrast to this routine practice, Judge Brassey also testified that since Oaas\u2019 name was written on the ticket, according to his routine practice, it was probably due to the defendant\u2019s request for a court appointed attorney. Further, he testified that according to his routine practice, if a defendant had an attorney, he would never accept a guilty plea from that defendant without the attorney present. In addition, he testified that his notation \u201cchg plea to guilty on advice of attorned\u2019 indicated to him that an attorney was present when Peterson plead guilty. When asked if it was possible Peterson appeared to plead guilty without an attorney, Brassey stated that due to his notation \u201con advice of attorney,\u201d he \u201cwouldn\u2019t allow that.... I am sure I wouldn\u2019t allow him to come in and enter a plea without his attorney once he has an attorney. That was not my procedure.\u201d Finally, Judge Brassey testified that according to his routine practice and his notations on Peterson\u2019s records, he was \u201csure [Peterson] had one [an attorney], absolutely. I wouldn\u2019t have had a hearing without one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b618 The above excerpts demonstrate that an important question was left unresolved by the trial court-i.e. whether Peterson was or was not represented by counsel. This question derives from Peterson\u2019s and Schramm\u2019s testimony that no attorney was present at the guilty plea and Judge Brassey\u2019s testimony that if he wrote \u201con advice of attorney\u201d on the ticket, that an attorney was present. This also in turn leaves a question as to whether Peterson knowingly and intelligently waived his right to an attorney. Because the District Court found that Peterson\u2019s conviction was valid in part on the grounds that he \u201centered a plea of guilty upon the advice of counsel,\u201d the court did not consider whether Peterson waived his right to an attorney. Yet Peterson and Schramm testified that Peterson did not have an attorney. Further, Judge Brassey\u2019s testimony is inconsistent with a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to appointed counsel by Peterson because Peterson and Schramm both assert that they did not hire Oaas as they couldn\u2019t afford his fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b619  While Judge Brassey testified to a routine practice to inform defendants of the right to counsel if indigent at arraignment, his testimony regarding his specific routine practice when using the phrase \u201con advice of attorney\u201d is not consistent in this case. Because the District Court did not address this inconsistency in Judge Brassey\u2019s testimony and resolve whether Oaas actually represented Peterson, we remand for further proceedings and a determination of this issue. <em>See State v. Olson </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 27, 32-33, 938 P.2d 1321, 1325 (remanding to trial court for further findings of fact because it incorrectly decided the State failed its burden to prove prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>conviction valid as a matter of law rather than as an issue of fact.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">B. The 1988 Plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b620 Regarding this plea, Peterson asserts the District Court erred by taking judicial notice of Judge Sather\u2019s testimony in another case regarding his routine practice. Peterson further asserts that the District Court erred in considering testimony from two other judges regarding Judge Sather\u2019s routine practice. The State asserts that Peterson failed to preserve his first claim of error for appeal regarding Judge Sather\u2019s testimony because he failed to object in the trial court. The State further argues that the court\u2019s judicial notice of this evidence was proper. Finally, the State asserts that Peterson also failed to preserve for appeal his argument regarding testimony from Judges Brassey and Shields and that this testimony describing Judge Sather\u2019s routine practice was also properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b621 We agree with the State that Peterson failed to preserve his right of appeal on the issue of judicial notice of Judge Sather\u2019s testimony in another case because he failed to object to the District Court. Rule 103(a)(1), M.R.Evid., and \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, both provide that error may not be predicated upon a ruling unless some sort of objection appears on the record. Rules 201 and 202, M.R.Evid., govern judicial notice of facts and of law respectively. Although the parties disagree whether judicial notice of Judge Sather\u2019s testimony in another case constitutes judicial notice of fact versus judicial notice of law, both rules contain the same subsection providing for review of the propriety of taking judicial notice by the trial court. This subsection reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">(e) Opportunity to be heard. A party is entitled upon timely request to an opportunity to be heard as to the propriety of taking judicial notice and the tenor of the matter noticed. In the absence of prior notification, the request may be made after judicial notice has been taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">This rule explicitly provides for review by the trial court upon request by a party, either before or after judicial notice is taken. Peterson never made such a request in this case. We will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal when the appellant had opportunity to make objection at the trial level. <em>State v. Weeks </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 63, 85, 891 P.2d 477, 490-91. <em>See also State v. Loh </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 460, 478-79, 914 P.2d 592, 603 (general objection to judicial notice insufficient to preserve issue for appeal). Therefore, we will not consider this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">\u00b622 Because the District Court merely stated that Judge Sather\u2019s testimony was consistent with Judge Brassey\u2019s testimony, we must now turn to Peterson\u2019s argument that the court erred in considering the testimony of Judge Brassey regarding Judge Sather\u2019s routine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b623 Peterson claims that admission of this evidence as proof of habit or routine practice under Rule 406, M.R.Evid., was error, but cites no authority in support of his argument as required under Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. Further, at trial Peterson objected to the evidence by arguing it was hearsay and speculative, but did not assert that it violated Rule 406, M.R.Evid. Rather, Peterson makes the conclusory assertion on appeal that admission of this evidence was error because in other cases, judges have only testified as to <em>their own </em>routine practice. The State asserts that, as a consequence of Peterson\u2019s failure to properly preserve this argument for appeal and his failure to cite authority on appeal, we should not consider this argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AM\">\u00b624  We agree. As mentioned, the rule is well established that this Court will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory on appeal because it is unfair to fault the trial court on an issue it never considered. <em>State v. Weaselboy, </em>1999 MT 274, \u00b6 16, 296 Mont. 503, \u00b6 16, 989 P.2d 836, \u00b6 16 (citation omitted). Further, we do not consider arguments on appeal that are unsupported by authority. <em>State ex rel. Booth v. Montana Twenty-First Judicial Dist., </em>1998 MT 344, \u00b6 35, 292 Mont. 371, \u00b6 35, 972 P.2d 325, \u00b6 35. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s finding that Peterson was properly informed of his right to counsel in the 1988 conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b625 We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision as to Peterson\u2019s 1988 DUI conviction and remand for further proceedings on Peterson\u2019s 1989 DUI conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b230-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
