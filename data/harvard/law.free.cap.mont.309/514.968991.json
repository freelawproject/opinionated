Boucher entered a plea of guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol in Mineral County Justice Court. After judgment, Boucher moved to withdraw the plea, and the Justice Court denied the motion. Boucher appealed to the District Court, which both found that Boucher\u2019s plea had been entered voluntarily and dismissed the appeal due to lack of jurisdiction. This Court exercises subject matter jurisdiction by deeming Boucher\u2019s filing in the District Court as a petition for postconviction relief. On the basis that the record does not support a finding that Boucher entered his plea voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">\u00b62 Boucher received a citation for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, on November 11,1999. He appeared in Mineral County Justice Court the following day and entered a plea of not guilty. At the time of his initial appearance, Justice of the Peace Wanda James advised Boucher of his constitutional rights, and Boucher signed a form that stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\">I understand that if you [sic] willingly and knowingly enter a guilty plea in this case, you [sic] are giving up your [sic] right to appeal this case to the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">\u00b63 On March 31,2000, Boucher, his attorney and the county attorney appeared in Justice James\u2019 court and discussed the possibility of amending the charge to DUI <em>per se </em>and some of the ramifications of a guilty plea. The State amended the original complaint and Boucher entered a plea of guilty to a DUI <em>per se </em>violation, under \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA, by telephone conversation with Justice James on April 3, 2000. Justice James testified she did not recall whether she had reiterated or discussed waiver of Boucher\u2019s right to appeal over the telephone at the time he changed his plea. The court issued a written judgment memorializing the sentence, which was mailed to Boucher. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>judgment included the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\">The Defendant may appeal this Judgment to the district court by filing written notice of the appeal within ten days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b64 Boucher then learned that as a result of his guilty plea his driving privileges would be revoked in the State of Washington where he worked on a temporary construction job. On April 7, 2000, Boucher filed a motion in Justice Court to withdraw his plea, stating the following basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">The plea was entered with the [Defendant\u2019s] understanding that he could continue driving. Subsequent events of no fault of any of the parties have proven this to be impossible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The Justice Court denied Boucher\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">\u00b65 On April 12, 2000, Boucher filed a <em>pro se, </em>hand-written notice to the District Court of an appeal \u201cto [his] guilty plea.\u201d The State immediately moved to dismiss the appeal. Boucher, with the assistance of counsel, filed a response to the motion, alleging that his plea was not knowing or voluntary because he had not been apprised by the Justice of the Peace at the time he entered the plea on April 3, 2000, that he was waiving his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">\u00b66 At the hearing held on September 14, 2000, the District Court reviewed the Justice Court\u2019s denial of Boucher\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. The court found Boucher had been informed at the time of his initial appearance on November 12,1999, that a guilty plea waived the right to a trial and appeal. The court also found that Justice James admonished Boucher on several occasions that any collateral consequences of his guilty plea, specifically including the effect on his driving privileges in Washington, were unknown to the court and would have to be determined exclusively by Boucher with the assistance of counsel. The court noted that the Justice of the Peace did not make mention of any right to appeal the judgment when Boucher entered his guilty plea by telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">\u00b67 The District Court concluded that Boucher entered his guilty plea knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently. Further, the court held that the Justice Court\u2019s oral judgment, which contained no mention of any right to appeal, controlled over the subsequent written judgment, which stated that the defendant could appeal within 10 days. On the issue of jurisdiction, the court concluded Boucher was not entitled to appeal to the district court as a matter of law and granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">\u00b68 Boucher filed a notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal. On October 20,2000, the District Court stayed Boucher\u2019s sentence pending the outcome of the appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u00b69 The threshold issue before this Court is whether the District Court has jurisdiction to review a postconviction denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea in Justice Court. The underlying issue is whether the District Court correctly concluded that Boucher entered his guilty plea in Justice Court voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b610  Whether to dismiss a claim based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>In re Marriage of Skillen, </em>1998 MT 43, \u00b6 9, 287 Mont. 399, \u00b6 9, 956 P.2d 1, \u00b6 9. A district court may permit the withdrawal of a guilty plea for good cause. Section 46-16-105(2), MCA. This Court reviews denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Bowley </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 298, 304, 938 P.2d 592, 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court have jurisdiction to review a postconviction denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea in Justice Court?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\u00b612 The issue of a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction may be presented at any time. <em>Balyeat Law, PC v. Pettit, </em>1998 MT 252, \u00b6 15, 291 Mont. 196, \u00b6 15, 967 P.2d 398, \u00b6 15. A party can never waive or consent to subject matter jurisdiction where there is no basis for the court to exercise jurisdiction. <em>In re Marriage of Skillen, </em>\u00b6 10. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-17-203(2), MCA, entry of a guilty plea in justice court waives a defendant\u2019s right to a trial <em>de novo </em>in district court. This Court recently held there is no statutory right of appeal from a justice court\u2019s order denying a motion to withdraw a guilty plea. State <em>v. Feight, </em>2001 MT 205, \u00b6 22, 306 Mont. 312, \u00b6 22, 33 P.3d 623, \u00b6 22; <em>State v. Fox, </em>2001 MT 209, \u00b6 17, 306 Mont. 353, \u00b6 17, 34 P.3d 484, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\u00b613 The State asserts on appeal that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Boucher\u2019s appeal because Montana law does not provide for an appeal to district court after a defendant enters a plea of guilty in a court of limited jurisdiction. Boucher acknowledges that a defendant who enters a guilty plea in justice court waives the right of trial <em>de novo </em>in district court, pursuant to \u00a7 46-17-203(2), MCA, but contends his guilty plea is not valid, and challenges the Justice Court\u2019s acceptance of the plea on the grounds that his plea and waiver were not entered voluntarily. Boucher cites <em>State v. Waymire </em>(1987), 226 Mont. 406, 736 P.2d 106, for the proposition that reason, justice and public policy dictate that an appeal of a guilty plea injustice court may be tried anew in district court provided the appeal is properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b614 In <em>State v. Waymire, </em>the Court addressed two separate cases where defendants sought to withdraw their guilty pleas. Jeffery Waymire alleged that the justice court entered a plea on his behalf but without his consent. The other defendant, Charles Metcalf, voluntarily entered a guilty plea in justice court but was dissatisfied with his sentence. Although the defendants presented very different legal issues, we held that the remedy for both was trial <em>de novo </em>in district court. <em>Waymire, </em>226 Mont. at 408-09, 736 P.2d at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b615  Following the <em>Waymire </em>decision, the Legislature limited the right of appeal from courts of limited jurisdiction by amending \u00a7 46-17-311, MCA, in 1991 to read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">Appeal from justices\u2019, municipal, and city courts. (1) Except ... for cases in which legal issues are preserved for appeal pursuant to 46-12-204, all cases on appeal from a justice\u2019s or city court must be tried anew in the district court... (2) The defendant may appeal to the district court by filing written notice of intention to appeal within 10 days after <em>a </em>judgment is rendered <em>following trial....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Sec. 217, Ch. 800, L. 1991 (words of amendment in italics). Subsequently, we determined \u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA, as amended, procedurally requires adjudication of a matter by trial in a justice or city court as a prerequisite to an appeal in district court for a trial <em>de novo. Feight, </em>\u00b6 15. We also held that \u00a7 46-17-311, MCA, provides the exclusive statutory remedy for appeals from the courts of limited jurisdiction. <em>Feight, </em>\u00b6 15. At present, unless a specific issue has been preserved for appeal prior to final judgment, our laws provide no appeal from a plea of guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>entered in a court of limited jurisdiction. <em>Feight, </em>\u00b6 12. Accordingly, a motion to withdraw a guilty plea may be granted or denied at the discretion of a justice or city court that has original jurisdiction, with no right of direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AWg\">\u00b616 On appeal to this Court, the State argues that after the Justice of the Peace denied Boucher\u2019s request to withdraw his guilty plea, Boucher\u2019s remedy was to petition the District Court for postconviction relief on the grounds that his conviction in Justice Court was based on an involuntary plea. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u00b617  Section 46-21-101(2), MCA, states that \u00e1 defendant who has exhausted all appeal remedies provided by law may seek relief from a sentence by filing a petition for postconviction relief with the district court in the county where the court of limited jurisdiction is located. Postconviction relief is available when the sentence violates state law, the Montana Constitution or the Constitution of the United States. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Section 46-21-101(1), MCA. A postconviction hearing is not another form of appeal from a criminal case, but a separate civil proceeding aimed at vacating, setting aside or correcting a sentence. <em>Coleman v. State </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 428, 433, 633 P.2d 624, 627. The right to postconviction relief is available to a defendant whose sentence was imposed by a justice, municipal or city court. <em>State v. Christensen </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 374, 377, 877 P.2d 468, 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b618 Recently, in <em>State v. Liefert, </em>2002 MT 48, \u00b6 8, 309 Mont. 19, \u00b6 8, 43 P.3d 329, \u00b6 8, the State invited this Court to deem an appeal as a petition for postconviction relief in order to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the denial of Liefert\u2019s motion to withdraw a plea entered in justice court. We did so, but did not determine whether a petition for post-conviction relief is proper in similarly situated cases. <em>Liefert, </em>\u00b6 8. The instant controversy presents such a similarly situated case.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b619 The District Court correctly determined as a matter of law that Boucher had no right to appeal the Justice Court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. However, given the contrary instructions regarding the appeals process issued by the Justice of the Peace, the fact that justice court is not a court of record, and the nature of Boucher\u2019s constitutional challenge to the validity of his plea, the District Court held an evidentiary hearing to establish a factual basis for ruling on issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b620 The absence of an appellate remedy and the constitutional claims asserted establish Boucher\u2019s eligibility to pursue postconviction relief in accordance with \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA. In view of this right and consistent with our holdings in <em>Christensen </em>and <em>Liefert, </em>we deem Boucher\u2019s appeal to the District Court as a petition for postconviction relief and the District Court proceedings as the functional equivalent of a postconviction hearing. We now address the District Court\u2019s finding that Boucher\u2019s plea was entered voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u00b621 <em>Did the District Court correctly conclude that Boucher entered his guilty plea in Justice Court knowingly and voluntarily ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">\u00b622  In light of the importance of the constitutional rights and protections waived by a guilty plea, the plea must be a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant. <em>State v. Radi </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 155, 159, 818 P.2d 1203, 1206 <em>(citing North Carolina v. Alford </em>(1970), 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162). The defendant must be aware of the rights waived, which include the right to a speedy and public trial by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>jury, the right to effective assistance of counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, the right to testify and have witnesses testify, the right not to be compelled to incriminate oneself, the right to have charges proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and the right to appeal a finding of guilty. <em>State v. Yother </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 128, 130, 831 P.2d 1347, 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b623 Because the voluntary nature of a guilty plea is crucial to the integrity of the judicial process, numerous statutes set forth procedural requirements for a valid plea. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-12-204, 46-12-210, 46-12-212 and 46-16-105(1), MCA. If these requirements are not met, the court may not accept the plea, and the case must be either dismissed or tried on its merits. Section 46-12-204 (2), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">The court may not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere without first determining that the plea is voluntary and not the result of force or threats or of promises apart from the plea agreement. The court shall also inquire as to whether the defendant\u2019s willingness to plead guilty or nolo contendere results from prior discussions between the prosecutor and the defendant or the defendant\u2019s attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u00b624 Additional procedural safeguards to insure that a plea entered in a court of limited jurisdiction is voluntary are outlined in \u00a7 46-17-203(2), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">A plea of guilty or nolo contendere in a justice\u2019s court, city court, or other court of limited jurisdiction waives the right of trial de novo in district court. A defendant must be informed of the waiver before the plea is accepted, and the justice or judge shall question the defendant to ensure that the plea and waiver are entered voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">More explicitly, \u201cthe court shall determine that the defendant understands ... there will not be a further trial of any kind, so that by pleading guilty or nolo contendere the defendant waives the right to a trial.\u201d Section 46-12-210(1)(e), MCA. A court may permit a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea at any time, before or after judgment, for good cause shown. Section 46-16-105(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">\u00b625  To determine whether good cause existed and whether a court abused its discretion by denying a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea, we consider three factors: (1) the adequacy of the court\u2019s interrogation at the time the plea was entered regarding the defendant\u2019s understanding of the consequences of the plea; (2) the promptness with which the defendant attempts to withdraw the plea; and (3) whether the plea was the result of a plea bargain in which the guilty plea was given in exchange for dismissal of another charge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>Bowley, </em>282 Mont. at 304, 938 P.2d at 595. The fundamental purpose of allowing the withdrawal of a guilty plea is to guard against the conviction of an innocent person. <em>State v. Schaff, </em>1998 MT 104, \u00b6 17, 288 Mont. 421, \u00b6 17, 958 P.2d 682, \u00b6 17 <em>(citing Bowley, </em>282 Mont. at 303-04, 938 P.2d at 595). If there is any doubt that a plea was involuntary, the doubt should be resolved in favor of defendant. <em>Schaff, </em>\u00b6 17 <em>(quoting State v. McAllister </em>(1934), 96 Mont. 348, 353, 30 P.2d 821, 823).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b626 Boucher\u2019s challenge is based solely on the adequacy of the Justice Court\u2019s advisement regarding Boucher\u2019s waiver of his appeal rights, as required by \u00a7 46-17-203(2), MCA, and \u00a7 46-12-210(1)(e), MCA. Boucher maintains that he was confused about his right to appeal and did not realize he was waiving his appeal right at the time he entered his guilty plea. He further contends that the Justice of the Peace neither informed nor questioned him at the time he changed his plea over the telephone to make certain that he understood the consequences of his waiver. Justice James testified at the hearing in District Court that she did not recall discussing Boucher\u2019s waiver at the time he entered his plea on April 3, 2000, and relied upon the statement signed five months earlier on November 12,1999, signifying Boucher understood he would waive his right to appeal for a trial <em>de novo </em>in district court if he pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b627 The Justice Court was required to determine that Boucher understood he waived certain constitutional rights, including the right to a trial and appeal, pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-210(1), MCA. The court accomplished this at Boucher\u2019s initial appearance by having Boucher acknowledge in writing that he understood the waivers he would make if he pleaded guilty. Months later, the State amended the complaint and Boucher changed his plea to guilty. Section 46-17-203(2), MCA, states: \u201cA defendant must be informed of the waiver before the plea is accepted, and the justice or judge shall question the defendant to ensure that the plea and waiver are entered voluntarily.\u201d This statute gives the clear impression that the justice court is to inform the defendant about the waiver of the right to appeal and ascertain that the defendant understands the waiver at the time a guilty plea is entered and before the court accepts the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u00b628 Boucher entered a plea of not guilty at his initial appearance. Accordingly, he waived no constitutional rights on November 12,1999, when he signed the waiver acknowledgment form provided by the court. Boucher\u2019s waiver occurred only after the State amended the charge and when he changed his plea to guilty in April 2000. Prior to accepting the change of plea, the court is required to \u201cquestion the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>defendant to ensure the plea and waiver are entered voluntarily.\u201d According to the testimony of Justice James, she did not reiterate the information the court provided five months earlier concerning Boucher\u2019s constitutional rights and failed to question Boucher regarding his understanding of the waiver at the time Boucher changed his plea. Consequently, we conclude that the court\u2019s colloquy was inadequate and good cause existed to permit Boucher to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u00b629  Since any doubt about whether a plea was voluntary should be resolved in favor of the defendant, we hold that the District Court, under these facts, erred by not allowing Boucher to withdraw his guilty plea. Therefore, we reverse Boucher\u2019s guilty plea, and remand this matter to the Justice Court for further proceedings in regard to the charge against Boucher for driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b547-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AOP\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u00b630 I concur in our Opinion. I write separately, however, to strongly urge the Legislature to amend \u00a7\u00a7 46-17-203, MCA, and 46-17-311, MCA, in the manner hereafter suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\u00b631 Our Opinion sets out the history of the 1991 amendment to \u00a7 46-17-311, MCA, which limits the right of appeal to district courts from courts of limited jurisdiction. Section 46-17-311(2), MCA, restricts this right of appeal to those cases where the defendant has first been tried in the limited jurisdiction court. Our Opinion also traces our recent cases interpreting \u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA, which, faithful to the plain and unambiguous language of this statute, hold that there is no statutory right of appeal to the district court from a justice court\u2019s order denying a motion to withdraw a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">\u00b632 While that is the law, as the author of all three of our controlling opinions-Feigii\u00ed, <em>Fox, </em>and Liefert-1 have no hesitancy in saying that this statutory scheme is flawed to the extent that it denies direct appeals to the district courts from the limited jurisdiction courts in cases involving the denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his or her guilty plea on the ground that the plea was not voluntary. My rationale for this conclusion is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">\u00b633 It is common knowledge that many defendants who plead guilty to offenses in Montana\u2019s courts of limited jurisdiction do so without the benefit of counsel. In my experience, the judges of these courts typically do a good job ensuring that pleas are voluntarily entered as required by \u00a7 46-17-203(2), MCA, and explaining to the accused the consequences of a guilty plea as required by \u00a7 46-17-203(1)(b), MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>and \u00a7 46-12-210, MCA. Notwithstanding, the fact remains that some of these defendants inevitably fail to fully understand and appreciate the importance of the rights they are waiving by pleading guilty and the consequences that may follow from their plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b634 As our Opinion points out, the law is absolutely clear that any guilty plea, to be constitutionally effective, must be voluntary, knowing and intelligent. <em>Radi, </em>250 Mont. at 159, 818 P.2d at 1206. To this end, \u00a7 46-17-203(2), MCA, specifically requires the limited jurisdiction court judge or justice to inform the defendant of the waiver of the right of appeal by trial <em>de novo </em>imposed by this section, before accepting a plea of guilty or <em>nolo contendere. </em>Additionally, the judge or justice must question the defendant \u201cto ensure that the plea and waiver are entered voluntarily.\u201d <em>See also </em>H.B. 454, 51st Leg., Sec. 3; Chap. 277, L. 1989, which added subsection (2) to \u00a7 46-17-203, MCA (Committee minutes and exhibits clearly demonstrate the legislators\u2019 and proponents\u2019 concern regarding voluntariness and that the entire scheme depends upon the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b635 When, however, voluntariness of a guilty plea becomes an issue-and it does with some regularity in all trial courts-then there must be a process for appellate review of the magistrate\u2019s decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his or her plea of guilty. While that is not a problem where the plea is entered in a district court proceeding, it is where the plea is entered in a court of limited jurisdiction. This is so by reason of a. combination of three factors: First, under Article VII, Section 4(2), of Montana\u2019s Constitution, trial <em>de novo </em>in district court is the only means of appeal from the courts of limited jurisdiction, unless the Legislature provides otherwise. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 46-17-311(1), MCA. Second, under \u00a7 46-17-203(2), MCA, a guilty plea waives trial <em>de novo </em>in district court. Aid, third, under \u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA, a limited jurisdiction court defendant has no statutory right of appeal to the district court unless he or she has first been tried in the lower court. In other words, by reason of the combined provisions of Article VII, Section 4(2), \u00a7 46-17-203(2), MCA, and \u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA, a district court judge has no authority to judicially review by way of direct appeal, a limited jurisdiction court judge\u2019s or justice\u2019s decision to deny a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his or her guilty plea on grounds of voluntariness. <em>Feight, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-22; <em>Fox, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b636 This scheme results in an anomaly. A defendant who receives a trial but is unhappy with the outcome can receive an entirely new trial in the district court. On the other hand, a defendant who pleads guilty in a court of limited jurisdiction has no opportunity for a new trial or for appeal even if his plea was constitutionally invalid. In addition, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>defendant who pleads guilty under this scheme also has no opportunity for an <em>independent </em>review of the voluntariness of his or her plea (aside from the less-than-adequate remedy of postconviction relief, as discussed below) because the only review allowed is that before the same judge who accepted the plea in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\u00b637 The case at bar presents a good example of why an independent judicial review of the voluntariness of a plea is necessary. Here, the Justice Court abused its discretion by denying Boucher\u2019s initial motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Boucher\u2019s plea was not voluntary, knowing and intelligent. His plea was constitutionally invalid. Notwithstanding, under the present statutory scheme, Boucher has no avenue to directly appeal the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. And, that brings us to our decision in <em>Liefert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u00b638 Consistent with the statutory scheme which the Legislature has enacted and absent any defendant, to date, challenging the constitutionality of the aforementioned strictures on direct appeal imposed by \u00a7\u00a7 46-17-203(2), MCA and 46-17-311(2), MCA, we treated a limited jurisdiction court defendant\u2019s \u201cappeal\u201d to the district court from the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea as a petition for postconviction relief under \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA. <em>See Liefert, </em>\u00b6 8. Despite having done so in that case and in the one at bar, I do not believe that postconviction relief is the appropriate remedy, however.</p>\n<p id=\"ATWS\">\u00b639 Postconviction relief is a civil proceeding involving a collateral attack on the defendant\u2019s conviction, rather than a direct appeal. <em>State v. Garner, </em>1999 MT 295, \u00b6 19, 297 Mont. 89, \u00b6 19, 990 P.2d 175, \u00b6 19. Being a civil proceeding on collateral review, an indigent defendant has no right to appointed counsel except under the narrow circumstances set out in \u00a7 46-21-201(2), MCA. Such a defendant would have the right to appointed counsel on a direct appeal. <em>State v. Rardon, </em>2001 MT 77, \u00b6 3, 305 Mont. 78, \u00b6 3, 22 P.3d 1132, \u00b6 3. Additionally, we have held that a defendant is entitled to counsel during a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the criminal proceeding-i.e. where there is potential substantial prejudice to the defendant. <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 145, 915 P.2d 208, 220 <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39,304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817. In my view, the stage at which a criminal defendant seeks to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis of constitutional invalidity is a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>proceedings implicating the right to counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u00b640 Furthermore, the postconviction process-which is designed for collateral review following appeal-is, on the one hand, cumbersome in that the defendant must file a verified petition supported by affidavits, records and other documents, \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-103 and 46-21-104, MCA, yet, on the other hand, this process gives the defendant a year to challenge his plea, \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, in contrast to the ten days for a direct appeal allowed by \u00a7 46-17-311(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u00b641 Moreover, review on appeal would allow the defendant challenging the voluntariness of his or her plea.a hearing, similar to the procedure where the defendant preserves issues of law for review under \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA, and \u00a7 46-17-311(1), MCA. <em>See also State v. Barker </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 85, 89-92, 858 P.2d 360, 362-64; <em>State ex rel. Wilson v. District Court </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 449, 893 P.2d 318. In contrast, a defendant is not entitled to a hearing in a postconviction proceeding unless the district court grants a hearing at its discretion. Section 46-21-201(1)(a), MCA. Again, keeping in mind that a guilty plea must be voluntary, intelligent and knowing, it is hard to conclude that these constitutional imperatives are statutorily protected by a scheme that forces the defendant to utilize a cumbersome civil proceeding which allows the reviewing court discretion to appoint counsel and hold a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u00b642 Finally, subsection (2) of \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA, is anomalous in that it restricts the filing of postconviction petitions by defendants from sentences imposed by the courts of limited jurisdiction to situations where the defendant has exhausted all appeal remedies provided by law. As already noted, defendants who plead guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>in the courts of limited jurisdiction have no appeal remedies to exhaust. Sections 46-17-203(2), MCA and 46-17-311(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u00b643 To remedy these defects and anomalies, I suggest that the Legislature statutorily provide an exception to \u00a7\u00a7 46-17-203(2), MCA and 46-17-311(1) &amp; (2), MCA, to give the district courts authority to entertain direct appeals from the courts of limited jurisdiction in cases where the defendant claims that his or her plea was not voluntary. The district courts should have authority to appoint counsel, hold a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>hearing, and then enter appropriate findings of fact, conclusions of law and a decision affirming or reversing the limited jurisdiction court judge\u2019s or justice\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw the guilty plea. If the district court reverses the decision of the limited jurisdiction court judge, then the case would be remanded for trial in the lower court. Alternatively, the district court\u2019s decision could be appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b644 In sum, I suggest that the present statutory scheme is flawed in the foregoing respects and may well be subject to legal challenge. Under Article VII, Section 4(2), of Montana\u2019s Constitution the Legislature can-and should-remedy this situation. Accordingly, I urge the Legislature to statutorily provide criminal defendants who seek to withdraw an involuntary guilty plea entered in a court of limited jurisdiction an avenue of direct appeal to the district courts.</p>\n<judges id=\"b551-5\">JUSTICES LEAPHART joins in the foregoing special concurrence.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\"> I acknowledge that we held in <em>State v. Garner, </em>2001 MT 222, 306 Mont. 462, 36 P.3d 346 <em>(Garner II), </em>that a hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is not a critical stage of the proceedings. I continue to believe that our decision was in error. And, the great weight of federal and state jurisprudence supports my conclusion. <em>See Garner II, </em>\u00b6 59 (Nelson, J., dissenting). This case presents one more real-life example of why <em>Garner II </em>should be overruled to that extent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b551-6\">JUSTICE REGNIER</author>\n<p id=\"ADr\">Concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u00b645 I concur with the Court\u2019s analysis in the second issue and I agree with the result reached by the Court on the jurisdictional issue. However, once again, I disagree with the \u201cpostconviction relief\u201d formula employed by the Court to establish jurisdiction with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">\u00b646 Within the last seven months, this very jurisdictional issue has appeared before this Court on several occasions, and, in all likelihood, the inquiry will not end with this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Yet, in the short time since October of 2001, the majority has established nothing short of an elusive jurisdictional target for practitioners to hit.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">\u00b647 In <em>Feight, Fox, </em>and <em>Kempin </em>the Court applied a rigid construction of \u00a7 46-17-311, MCA, to prohibit the respective appeals from justice court to district court on jurisdictional grounds. In <em>Liefert, </em>in order to circumvent its own narrow jurisdictional construction, the Court deemed Liefert\u2019s appeal from justice court to district court a petition for postconviction relief so that it might address another substantive argument raised in the appeal. Curiously, while <em>Feight, Fox, </em>and <em>Liefert </em>raised identical issues, i.e., whether a district court can review a denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea in justice court, the majority reached an entirely different result in <em>Liefert </em>than it did in <em>Feight </em>and <em>Fox </em>based on its postconviction relief concoction.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u00b648 Finally, in the case at bar, the Court reinforces the notion that \u201ca motion to withdraw [a] guilty plea may be granted or denied at the discretion of a justice or city court that has original jurisdiction, with no right of direct appeal.\u201d However, the Court states that \u201c[t]he absence of an appellate remedy and the constitutional claims asserted establish Boucher\u2019s eligibility to pursue postconviction relief in accordance with \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA.\u201d Yet, by justifying this postconviction relief fiction in light of the \u201cabsence of an appellate remedy,\u201d the Court impliedly validates Justice Cotter\u2019s intimation that the Court has \u201cso little confidence in <em>[Feight\u2019s] </em>correctness that [it] must devise methods to avoid its consequences ....\u201d <em>Liefert, </em>\u00b6 34 (Cotter, J., specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b649 Unfortunately, with today\u2019s holding, the majority has once again bypassed an opportunity to revisit the ill-conceived precedent established in <em>Feight. </em>I believe that there currently exists statutory authority which sanctions a defendant\u2019s right to appeal a denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea in justice court, aside from the postconviction relief placebo conjured by the <em>Feight </em>majority. In my view, defendants are entitled to appeal a justice court\u2019s denial of their motion to withdraw a guilty plea pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3-5-303 and 46-20-104, MCA, as outlined in my dissent in <em>Feight.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u00b650 I believe the majority\u2019s postconviction relief justification perpetuates the inequitable ambiguity created by <em>Feight </em>and its successors by injecting a \u201cmeans to an. end\u201d solution into this arena. For the sake of those laboring to abide by its rule of law, the majority would be better served to employ a consistent, objective analysis on this jurisdictional issue involving courts of limited jurisdiction so as to preserve the integrity of our judicial system. To date, it has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u00b651 Consequently, as stated above, I concur with the ultimate result articulated by the majority. However, the jurisdictional justification should be premised on a defendant\u2019s statutory right of appeal promulgated by the Legislature in \u00a7\u00a7 3-5-303 and 46-20-104, MCA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-7\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the foregoing concurrence.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-10\"> <em>See State </em>v. <em>Feight, </em>2001 MT 205, 306 Mont. 312, 33 P.3d 623; <em>State v.
