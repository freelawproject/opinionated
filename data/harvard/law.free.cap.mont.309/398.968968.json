Halseth (Halseth) appeals from the judgment entered by the Seventeenth Judicial District Court, Blaine County, on its findings of fact, conclusions of law and decree of foreclosure. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in determining that Halseth was not entitled to possession of the mortgaged property during the statutory redemption period.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">\u00b63 In 1993, Halseth executed a promissory note in favor of First Security Bank of Havre, now known as Independence Bank (Bank), secured by a mortgage on real property he owned in Blaine County. In 1994, he executed three more promissory notes along with security agreements giving the Bank security interests in his farm machinery, equipment and crops. Halseth subsequently defaulted on the promissory notes and, in October of 1999, the Bank filed a foreclosure action in the District Court. The District Court held a bench trial, at which Halseth stipulated that he had defaulted on the notes and the Bank was entitled to foreclose. He contended, however, that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>currently was residing on the Blaine County property and, therefore, was entitled to possession of the property for the one-year redemption period following the foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\u00b64 The District Court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law and a decree of foreclosure, granting the Bank the right to take possession of the real and personal property at issue, sell it and apply the proceeds toward the judgment amount. The court further determined that Halseth was not entitled to retain possession of the property during the following year because he was not residing there. The court entered judgment on the decree and Halseth appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b65  Whether a debtor occupies mortgaged property so as to allow him or her to retain possession following a foreclosure sale is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court. <em>Interstate Prod. Credit Ass\u2019n v. DeSaye </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 320, 322, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287. We will affirm a district court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>DeSaye, </em>250 Mont. at 322, 820 P.2d at 1287. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence of record, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if a review of the record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>DeSaye, </em>250 Mont. at 323, 820 P.2d at 1287. Substantial evidence is that which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion and, while consisting of more than a scintilla of evidence, may be less than a preponderance. <em>Foley v. Arvidson, </em>2000 MT 388, \u00b6 8, 304 Mont. 43, \u00b6 8, 16 P.3d 389, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in determining that Halseth was not entitled to possession of the mortgaged property during the statutory redemption period?</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">\u00b67  Following a judicial foreclosure of mortgaged real property, the judgment debtor has the statutory right to redeem the property from the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale any time within one year after the sale. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 25-13-802 and 71-1-228, MCA. During this one-year redemption period, the purchaser is not entitled to possession of the property if the debtor \u201cpersonally occupies the land as a home for himself and his family.\u201d Section 71-1-229, MCA. Halseth contended in the District Court that he resided on the Blaine County property which was the subject of the foreclosure proceeding and, therefore, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>entitled to retain possession of the land during the redemption period.</p>\n<p id=\"ARP\">\u00b68  In determining whether Halseth occupied the property as required by \u00a7 71-1-229, MCA, the District Court looked to \u00a7 1-1-215, MCA, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-4\">Every person has, in law, a residence. In determining the place of residence, the following rules are to be observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">(1) It is the place where a person remains when not called elsewhere for labor or other special or temporary purpose and to which the person returns in seasons of repose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">(2) There may only be one residence. If a person claims a residence within Montana for any purpose, then that location is the person\u2019s residence for all purposes unless there is a specific statutory exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">(3) A residence cannot be lost until another is gained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">(6) The residence can be changed only by the union of act and intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Based on the testimony at trial and the above guidelines, the District Court found that Halseth resided in Harlem, Montana, had not shown the requisite union of act and intent to change his residence to the Blaine County property and, as a result, did not reside on that property. The court then concluded that, because Halseth did not reside on the Blaine County property, he did not occupy the property as his home as required in \u00a7 71-1-229, MCA, and, therefore, was not entitled to retain possession during the statutory redemption period.</p>\n<p id=\"ArF\">\u00b69 Halseth does not challenge the District Court\u2019s application of \u00a7 1-1-215, MCA, in reaching its decision and, as a result, we do not address the propriety of applying the criteria set forth therein to the requirements of \u00a7 71-1-229, MCA. Halseth does assert, however, that the court\u2019s finding of fact regarding his lack of intent-under \u00a7 1-1-215, MCA-to make the Blaine County property his residence is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">\u00b610 Halseth testified at trial that he moved into a camper trailer on the Blaine County property in June of 2000 for the sole purpose of establishing his right to retain the property during the redemption period following foreclosure. Prior to that time, he resided in a house he owns in Harlem, Montana, and for which he pays the mortgage, property taxes and insurance. Halseth also testified that the Harlem house was being rented by his girlfriend, but there was no written rental agreement and no rent receipts; nor had she paid any rent in the five months prior to the trial. He further testified that he still stays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>at the Harlem house occasionally. Additionally, although the telephone service to the Harlem house is in his girlfriend\u2019s name, Halseth gives out-and receives calls at-that telephone number for both business and personal purposes, even though he has telephone service at the Blaine County property.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b611 Halseth does not dispute that, prior to June of 2000, the Harlem house was his legal residence. Moreover, as a matter of law, Harlem remains Halseth\u2019s legal residence until he demonstrates, by the union of act and intent, that he has changed his residence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-1-215, MCA. The above testimony establishes that, while he moved to the camper trailer on the Blaine County property, Halseth retained ties to his Harlem home and did not intend to relinquish his residence in Harlem. Consequently, we conclude Halseth\u2019s testimony constitutes substantial evidence supporting the District Court\u2019s finding that he did not demonstrate the union of act and intent necessary to change his residence from Harlem to the Blaine County property. We further conclude that the court\u2019s finding is not otherwise clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b6 12 Halseth argues the District Court should have found he did intend to make the Blaine County property his permanent residence and points to portions of his trial testimony which he asserts supports such a finding. However, we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact only to determine whether substantial evidence supports those findings, not whether the evidence would support contrary findings. <em>In re Estate of </em>Bradshaw, 2001 MT 92, \u00b6 20, 305 Mont. 178, \u00b6 20, 24 P.3d 211, \u00b6 20 (citations omitted). As we concluded above, substantial evidence of record supports the District Court\u2019s finding of fact regarding Halseth\u2019s lack of intent to make the Blaine County property his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u00b613  Based on its finding that the Blaine County property was not Halseth\u2019s legal residence pursuant to \u00a7 1-1-215, MCA, the District Court determined that Halseth did not occupy the property as required in \u00a7 71-1-229, MCA, and, therefore, was not entitled to retain possession during the statutory redemption period. Having concluded the court\u2019s finding of fact was not clearly erroneous, we hold that the District Court did not err in determining that Halseth was not entitled to possession of the mortgaged property during the statutory redemption period.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b614 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b426-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
