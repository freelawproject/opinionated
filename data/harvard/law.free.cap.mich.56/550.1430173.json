The facts, it is claimed, did not come to the knowledge of the respondent till the trial was over.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">It appears, however, by the bill of exceptions, that when the juror was called he was asked by the prosecuting attorney where he resided, and he replied, \u201c In the Seventh ward of Grand Rapids.\u201d ' He was further asked how long he had resided \u201chere,\u201d \u2014 apparently meaning in Grand Rapids, where the trial was taking place. The' reply was: \u201cAbout three weeks. Came to the city to get work; have not got any yet.\u201d N o further questions were asked, and both parties announced themselves \u201c satisfied for cause,\u201d and the juror was sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The answers fairly suggested the probability that the juror was not qualified, and if either party desired satisfaction on the subject, the examination should have been pursued further. It was too late after the trial to enter upon a new investigation under the pretense of having been ignorant of the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b565-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
