Upon the trial the validity of a tax deed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was brought in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>question, and the circuit judge ruled that it was invalid. The only question raised on the record in this Court concerns the correctness of this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The reason for holding the deed invalid was that it was-executed by. the deputy Auditor General in his own name, when if executed by him at all it should have been executed in the name of his principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The statute provides that \u201cthe Auditor General may appoint a deputy, for whose acts he shall be \u25a0 responsible, and may revoke such appointment at pleasure; and such deputy may execute the duties'of the office during the sickness or necessary absence of the Auditor General.\u201d ITow. Stat. \u00a7\u25a0 283. It is one of the duties of the Auditor General to execute deeds to carry into effect sales of State tax lands. Pub. Acts-1881, p. 272.'</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">A similar statute respecting the powers and duties of the deputy Auditor General has been in existence in this State for many years, and we may take judicial notice that it has been construed in the office of the Auditor General as authorizing the deputy to act in his own name when the circumstances exist which authorize him to act at all. A great many deeds have been executed in this manner, and other acts done which are open to question on'the same ground. The case is therefore one upon which it is probable that large-interests depend.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">If the question were entirely new, and were presented as a, question as to the most proper and correct method of executing the duty by the deputy, we should say unhesitatingly that the-proper method would be for the deputy to perform the act in the name\u2019 of his principal. But this is matter of form rather than that of substance, and the rights neither of the-State nor of any individual are greater or less because of one form being adopted rather than the other. The objection to-a deed executed as this is, even if valid, is purely technical, and if sustained it must be upon grounds that in no way affect the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">A similar objection to the acts of other deputies has been several times made in this State. In <em>Calender v. Olcott </em>1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Mich. 344, a deputy county clerk had issued in his own name a writ of summons. The statute empowered the deputy, in the absence of the clerk from his office or from the court, to perform all the duties of the office ; and this was held sufficient authority for him to act in his own name. In <em>Wheeler v. Wilkins </em>19 Mich. 78, a return by a deputy-sheriff in his own name was held, on the authority of <em>Calender v. </em>Olcott, to be sufficient. <em>People v. Johr </em>22 Mich. 461, raised the question whether the indorsement and recording of a county treasurer\u2019s bond by the deputy Auditor General was sufficient; and the court dispose of it shortly by saying: \u201cAs to the indorsement of S. D. Bingham, deputy Auditor General, he being a State officer known to the law, we are bound to take judicial notice that he was such officer, and the indorsement or certificate by him has the same force and validity as if signed by the Auditor General himself. This shows an approval and acceptance by the' Auditor General.\u201d p. 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">These eases would seem to settle the question now raised. They arc all decided upon statutes which under specified circumstances give to deputies the power to perform the duties pertaining to the office of their principals, and a decision under one statute is authority for a like decision under any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">But if as a new question the practice were one of doubtful validity, yet having continued for many years under a construction of the statute by the proper executive department of the government and affecting, as has been said, matter of form, only, it ought not now to be disturbed or called in question. The practical construction of the statute has done no mischief, and it should now be accepted as correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">When, in the performance of executive duties, it becomes necessary for the executive department to construe a statute, great deference is always due to its judgment; and the obligation is increased by the lapse of considerable time before its acts are called in question. This has been several times held by the Federal Supreme Court, and by the subordinate courts of the Federal system, and a reference to a few of the cases will be sufficient to show the current of decision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>M'Keen v. Delaney </em>5 Or. 22; <em>Surgett v. Lapice 8 </em>How. 48, 71; <em>Bissell v. Penrose </em>8 How. 317; <em>Union Insurance Co. v. Hoge </em>21 How. 35, 66; <em>United States v. Gilmore </em>8 Wall. 330; <em>United States v. Pugh </em>99 U. S. 265, 269; <em>United States v. Lytle </em>5 McL. 9; <em>Hahn v. United States </em>14 Ct. CL 305; <em>Swift v. United States </em>14 Ct. Cl. 481. It was also held by this Court in the case of <em>Malonny v. Mahar </em>1 Mich. 26, where the question was whether a deputy county treasurer had authority to administer a certain oath in the place of his principal, and also in the subsequent case <em>of Britton v. Ferry </em>14 Mich. 53. The case of <em>Continental Improvement Co. v. Phelps </em>47 Mich. 299, 303, rests in part on the same principle. The cases in other states which hold the same doctrine are too numerous for citation, but as they all rest upon the inconvenience that would arise from unsettling what in good faith has been done in the necessary discharge of public duty,, many citations would only serve to show the frequency in which the occasions for the application of the principle arose. As we have recognized and acted upon the principle heretofore, we may well leave this case to rest upon our previous decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The rule which favors the acceptance of a practical construction of statutes has its limits, and must not be suffered to defeat the manifest purpose of the legislation. <em>Matter of Manhattan Savings Institution </em>82 N. Y. 142. Butin this case the practical construction gives effect to the legislative intent; nothing but the form of doing so being called in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">It is objected that It does not appear in this case that the circumstances existed which authorized the deputy to act; namely, that the Auditor General was sick or necessarily absent. This objection, if available here, would have been equally so in <em>People v. Johr </em>22 Mich. 461, in which the presumption in favor of the correctness of official action was held to support the act done.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">A new trial must be ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b166-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-9\"> This indenture, made the ninth day of February,in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-tliree, between Hubert R.
