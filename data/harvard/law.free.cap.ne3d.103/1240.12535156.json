On January 21, 2016, the defendant, Aaron Mello, was indicted on charges of unlawful possession of heroin with intent to distribute, subsequent offense, and unlawful possession of methadone with intent to distribute, subsequent offense. The defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence, claiming, among other things, that \"[t]he affidavit in support of the search warrant fails to provide sufficient nexus between drug selling activity and the defendant's residence to establish probable cause to search the residence.\" The motion judge held a nonevidentiary hearing in the Superior Court, and subsequently issued a memorandum of decision and order allowing the motion to suppress on the basis that \"the affidavit fails to provide a sufficient nexus of narcotics-related activity to the defendant's apartment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court allowed the Commonwealth's application for leave to file this interlocutory appeal pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 15(a)(2), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=422%20Mass.%201501\">\n    422 Mass. 1501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996).

In the present case, the motion judge determined that the affidavit failed to establish a sufficient nexus between the drug dealing activity and the defendant's apartment because there is \"no indication that [the informant] purchased anything from [the defendant] from inside [the] apartment,\" and \"[t]he information provided by the [informant] establishes that the defendant sells heroin, but it fails to provide that the defendant actually stores heroin at 229 Stafford Rd., Apt. 2.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The affidavit delineated information from a confidential informant, which Detective Luis Duarte had obtained \"[w]ithin the last 72 hours.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The information included the following: (1) the defendant, who goes by the street name \"Slim,\" lives at 229 Stafford Road, second floor; (2) the defendant \"regularly sells heroin from out of his address at 229 Stafford Rd.\"; (3) the defendant \"would sell heroin either from his apartment or meet parties out on the street\"; (4) the informant had purchased heroin from the defendant \"on several separate occasions in the recent past\"; (5) whenever the informant \"would purchase heroin from [the defendant], [the informant] would either meet [the defendant] at his address or a prearranged location\"; and (6) the informant carried out a controlled buy in which he entered the defendant's apartment building and \"was met by [the defendant] outside of the 2nd floor apartment,\" at which time the defendant sold him the agreed upon amount of heroin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The particularized information delineated above was more than sufficient to permit a reasonable inference that the defendant likely kept a supply of drugs in the home.

See also Cypher, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 5.70 (4th ed. 2014). Not only did the informant state that the defendant \"regularly sells heroin from out of his address,\" but the informant also indicated that he had purchased heroin from the defendant on multiple occasions in the recent past, and that to effectuate these purchases, the informant would meet the defendant at either his address or a prearranged location. Combined with the informant's subsequent controlled buy, wherein he met the defendant outside of the second-floor apartment at which time the defendant \"sold [the informant] the agreed upon amount of heroin,\" it was reasonable to infer that drugs were likely kept in the defendant's apartment.

In view of the informant's prior purchases of narcotics from the defendant at the apartment and prearranged locations, along with the controlled buy from the defendant discussed\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , we agree that the affidavit satisfied both prongs of the\n    <em>\n     Aguilar\n    </em>\n    -\n    <em>\n     Spinelli\n    </em>\n    test.
