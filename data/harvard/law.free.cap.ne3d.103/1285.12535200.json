The relevant facts leading to this appeal are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On May 7, 2015, Appellee Stark County Job and Family Services (\"SCJFS\" or \"agency\") filed a complaint alleging that K.K., born in 2008, was neglected and/or dependent. A companion case involving K.K.'s sister, born in 2009, was also initiated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Initial concerns included the mental health of appellant-mother, her substance abuse, and housing issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} K.K. and her sister were initially placed under agency protective supervision. However, emergency shelter care was granted\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   on June 5, 2015, one month after the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} An adjudication hearing took place on July 10, 2015. Both parents stipulated to a dependency finding at that time. Temporary custody of K.K. and her sister with SCJFS was also maintained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On October 16, 2015, the girls' maternal great uncle filed a motion for change of legal custody. However, he subsequently withdrew his request to intervene in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In the meantime, SCJFS filed a motion for permanent custody on October 5, 2016. However, the trial court denied same via a judgment entry issued on December 9, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Throughout much of the case, K.K. and her sister were in placement with their paternal grandmother, even though she had not shown an interest in long-term custody. Tr. at 45. In April 2017, the agency attempted a third-party placement and correspondingly filed a motion for change of legal custody. However, said placement arrangement was not successful. Another foster placement was then arranged, which fared much better.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On June 26, 2017, SCJFS filed a second motion requesting permanent custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The matter proceeded to an evidentiary hearing held on September 11, 2017. Appellant appeared with counsel. K.K.'s father also appeared with counsel; however, he was found\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   to have abandoned the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Following these proceedings, via a judgment entry with findings of fact and conclusions of law issued September 13, 2017, the trial court granted permanent custody of K.K. to SCJFS. A\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   judgment entry was issued on September 18, 2017. Permanent custody was also granted as to K.K.'s sister, under a separate case number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On October 13, 2017, appellant filed a notice of appeal. She herein raises the following two Assignments of Error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING PERMANENT CUSTODY TO THE STARK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF JOB AND FAMILY SERVICES (SCDJFS) AS SCDJFS FAILED TO SHOW BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT GROUNDS EXISTED FOR PERMANENT CUSTODY AND SUCH DECISION WAS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \"II.

Under these circumstances, we are compelled, based on R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d), to directly proceed to an analysis of the best interest issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Walton/Fortson Children,\n   </em>\n   5th Dist.
