The trial court found Michael J. Howard, defendant below and appellant herein, guilty of second-degree-felony possession of heroin and fourth-degree-felony possession of cocaine, both in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). The court sentenced appellant to serve a total of nine-and-one-half years in prison. Appellant assigns the following errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT FAILED\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   TO PROPERLY CONSIDER AND GRANT APPELLANT'S MOTION TO WITHDRAW HIS GUILTY PLEA.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN SENTENCING APPELLANT TO THE MAXIMUM SENTENCED [SIC] ALLOWED BY LAW.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN DENYING APPELLANT'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On July 16, 2015, a Scioto County grand jury returned an indictment that charged appellant with four drug-related offenses. Appellant entered not guilty pleas and later filed a motion to suppress evidence. The trial court overruled appellant's motion to suppress evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On January 6, 2016, appellant agreed to plead guilty to possession of heroin (a second-degree felony) and possession of cocaine (a fourth-degree felony), both in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). At the change of plea hearing, the trial court initially noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The record should further reflect that it's a negotiated plea, pursuant to Section 2953.08(D) and Criminal Rule 11(F), that as long as [appellant] abides by his conditions of bond when he returns here for sentencing February 17 * * * he'll receive a four year mandatory prison term [for the possession of heroin offense], and on the [possession of cocaine offense], an 18 month prison-non-mandatory prison term, for a total of five-five and a half years. If he fails to abide by his conditions of bond he'll receive a nine and one half year prison term.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both defense counsel and appellant concurred that the court accurately recited their understanding of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The trial court asked appellant if he understood that \"by proceeding in this fashion, * * * you're waiving your right to appeal[.]\" Appellant indicated that he understood. The court observed that appellant had signed a document entitled, \"Waiver,\" and questioned appellant whether he signed the Waiver. Appellant responded affirmatively. The document indicates that the court advised appellant of the charges against him, the penalty provided by law, his rights under the constitution, including the right to a jury trial, the right to confront witnesses, the right to compulsory process, and the right to require the state to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The document additionally recites that \"[n]o promises, threats or inducements have been made to me by anyone to secure my plea of guilty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In addition to asking appellant about the written form, the trial court verbally questioned appellant whether he understood that pleading guilty waives his right to a jury trial, his right to confront witnesses, his right to compulsory process, and his right to require the state to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant responded that he understood and further stated that he understood that he could not be made to testify against himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court next reviewed the maximum penalties and informed appellant that a fourth-degree felony carries a maximum prison term of eighteen months and a $5,000 maximum fine, and that a second-degree felony carries a maximum prison term of eight years and a $15,000 maximum fine. Appellant indicated that he understood the maximum penalties. Appellant also signed two documents entitled, \"Maximum Penalty.\" One document outlined\n   the maximum penalty for appellant's possession of cocaine offense, and the other set forth the maximum penalty for appellant's possession of heroin offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After the trial court explained post-release control, the court asked appellant if he was \"satisfied with the efforts of [his] lawyer.\" Appellant answered, \"Yes.\" The court asked appellant: \"Other than what's been stated on the record here today, has anybody made any additional promises, threats, or inducements in order to get you to change your plea to guilty?\" Appellant responded, \"No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The trial court next asked appellant, \"how do you plea?\" Appellant answered, \"No contest.\" Defense counsel interjected, \"Guilty.\" The trial court stated, \"No, that won't get it.\" Appellant then stated, \"No, guilty. Guilty.\" The court again asked him his plea, and appellant stated, \"Guilty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court subsequently accepted appellant's guilty plea and scheduled the sentencing hearing for February 17, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 10} However, prior to the sentencing hearing, appellant took a drug test, tested positive for THC and fled the jurisdiction. Appellant later was apprehended in the State of Nevada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On June 23, 2016, appellant, through new counsel, filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. He claimed that when he entered his guilty plea, \"he was in distress * * *, acted out of fear and panic, was confused in his thought process, and prematurely entered a guilty plea.\" Appellant contended that \"his judgement was impaired when he entered his guilty plea [due] to emotions of fear, panic, and confusion.\" He asserted that \"he did not have any other choice but to accept a plea deal in this case, despite significant misgivings about accepting the same.\" He thus argued that his plea was not knowing and voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On June 23, 2016, the trial court held the sentencing hearing. The court noted that appellant did not appear as scheduled for the February 17, 2016 sentencing hearing. The court pointed out that appellant appeared late, tested positive for THC, and fled the jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Before the trial court proceeded with the sentencing hearing, defense counsel addressed appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Appellant's counsel asserted that appellant will testify that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   he was basically told he had no option but to plea, that he was scared into this. He was confused, and therefore, that's why he did. * * * He's explained to me the full background of what happened. So he feels as though there are many legitimate grounds to grant a withdraw[al] of his plea based on his prior interactions with his previous counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant took the stand and testified that he tried to plead \"no contest,\" but the court would not allow it. Appellant spoke with his counsel, and counsel informed him that he has \"to enter a guilty plea. That was part of the deal.\" Appellant stated that he believed that he should be permitted to withdraw his plea because his previous defense counsel pressured him to accept the state's plea offer. Appellant claimed that his previous counsel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"This is the best deal. I've seen people\" * * * get more for less. Take this deal. You know, if you want to see your daughter, you want to get out, take this deal. And I was just like, what, I couldn't believe it like the amount of evidence that was-that was being held against me or whatever and by me never being in prison, never, you know, I just couldn't understand it. He was like, \"Well, take it or you're going to get eight years or something.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Appellant stated that he \"was scared like shit\" and did not believe that he really had a choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The state cross-examined appellant and asked him whether he wished to withdraw his plea because he believes \"the sentence [he] agreed to was too harsh.\" Appellant responded, \"Not necessar[il]y too harsh[;] it was just I was coerced into believing that I have no other option.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 16} After consideration, the trial court overruled appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and found that appellant had entered his guilty plea in a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary manner. The court then proceeded to sentencing and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [O]n January 6, 2016, [appellant] entered a negotiated plea, which he absolutely recognized was not appealable. He was told he would get a four year mandatory prison term on the felony two, Possession of Heroin, 18 months non-mandatory on the Possession of Cocaine, and also I told him very clearly if he failed to abide to his conditions of bond he'd get nine and one half years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The trial court recited that it considered the record, the oral statements, as well as the purposes and principles of sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11(A), (B), and (C), and the seriousness and recidivism factors set forth in R.C. 2929.12(B), (C), (D), and (E). The court further indicated that it considered R.C. 2929.13(B). The court found, after weighing the seriousness and recidivism factors, that prison is consistent with the purposes of principles of sentencing and that appellant is not amenable to community control sanctions. The court additionally determined that (1) consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender, and are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public; and (2) appellant's criminal history shows that consecutive terms are necessary to protect the public from future crime. The court next indicated that the sentence is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   a jointly recommended and agreed sentence by the Defendant and the State of Ohio that if he failed to abide by his conditions of bond he'd receive a mandatory eight year prison term on the felony of the second degree, and an 18 month non-mandatory prison term[ ] on the felony of the fourth degree, running consecutively with each other, for an aggregate nine and one half year prison term.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The court thus sentenced appellant to serve eight years in prison for his possession of heroin conviction and eighteen months in prison for his possession of cocaine conviction. The court also ordered appellant to serve the sentences consecutively to one another, for a total of nine years and six months in prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   MOTION TO WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by overruling his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Initially, we note that trial courts possess discretion when deciding whether to grant or to deny a presentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Instead, appellant fled the jurisdiction and filed his withdrawal motion following his apprehension in the State of Nevada and only about an hour and one-half before the rescheduled sentencing hearing. Thus, the trial court could have determined that the timing of appellant's motion-made not before the originally-scheduled sentencing hearing, but rather, made after his apprehension and immediately before the rescheduled sentencing hearing-suggested that appellant's motivation for seeking to withdraw his plea was based upon the harsher prison\n   sentence he faced for violating the conditions of his bond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant signed a written document stating that the court had advised him of the nature of the charges and the maximum penalties.

In fact, the record suggests that the plea agreement, while not included in written form in the trial court record,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   required appellant to plead guilty. After appellant stated that he pled \"no contest,\" trial counsel interjected, \"Guilty,\" and the trial court informed appellant that pleading \"no contest\" would not suffice.

We again point out that appellant did not seek to withdraw his guilty plea-or claim that he was confused whether he could enter a no-contest plea-before the originally scheduled February 17, 2016 sentencing date. Instead, appellant did not file his withdrawal motion until six months after the change of plea hearing. In the interim, appellant violated the conditions of his bond and fled the jurisdiction. Appellant filed his withdrawal motion immediately before the rescheduled sentencing hearing. These factors strongly suggest that appellant's plea withdrawal motion was a last-ditch attempt to avoid the harsher prison sentence he faced for violating the conditions of his bond.\n   <em>\n    See Bush, supra.\n   </em>\n   Consequently, we do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion by denying appellant's presentence motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant's first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   SENTENCING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 46} In his second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by sentencing him to the maximum term of imprisonment, nine and one-half years. Appellant recognizes that the trial court imposed the nine-and-one-half-year prison term due to appellant's violation of the conditions of his bond, but argues that violating the conditions of his bond is not a sufficient reason to impose the maximum sentence. Appellant further contends that the trial court plainly erred by failing to determine whether the offenses merged for purposes of sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 47} The state asserts that the trial court imposed a jointly-recommended sentence and that R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) thus precludes appellant from appealing his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Initially, we reject appellant's argument that we review a trial court's felony sentence using the abuse-of-discretion standard of review.

The plea agreement is not in writing, but the transcripts of the plea and sentencing hearings show that the trial court referred to the sentence the court would impose, if appellant violated the conditions of his bond, as a jointly-recommended sentence. At the plea hearing, the trial court read its understanding of the parties' jointly-recommended sentence into the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   The record should further reflect that it's a negotiated plea, pursuant to Section 2953.08(D) and Criminal Rule 11(F), that as long as [appellant] abides by his conditions of bond when he returns here for sentencing February 17 * * * he'll receive a four year mandatory prison term [for the possession of heroin offense], and on the [possession of cocaine offense], an 18 month prison-non-mandatory prison term, for a total of five-five and a half years.

Furthermore, when the court asked appellant and his trial counsel at the plea hearing if the court accurately recited their understanding of the plea agreement, which included a statement that appellant would receive a nine-and-one-half year prison term if he violated the conditions of his bond, both appellant and trial counsel stated that the court did.

The sentencing hearing transcript also shows that the trial court considered the appropriate statutory factors and made relevant findings.

Rather, we believe appellant merely sets forth unsupported rhetoric in an attempt to circumvent the rule that a defendant's guilty plea waives the right to challenge on appeal a trial court's decision denying a suppression motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   {\u00b6 73} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant's third assignment of error and affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Harsha, J.: Concurs with Concurring Opinion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Hoover, J.: Concurs in Part &amp; Dissents in Part with Opinion\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    The trial court dismissed the remaining counts of the indictment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

We further point out that the record does not contain a written plea agreement that might clarify whether the nine-and-one-half-year prison sentence is included in the agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-152\">\n   Harsha, J., concurring:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   {\u00b6 74} I characterize this type of a plea agreement as including a \"conditional\" sentence, not a dual sentence. The outcome was conditioned upon the fact of complying with bond requirements. It did not impose \"dual\" sentences, i.e. two sentences. Because Howard agreed to the conditional sentence, I think he's stuck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   {\u00b6 75} Nonetheless, I agree a more appropriate approach would feature separate charges for failure to appear. And where there is no agreed conditioned sentence, if the court just automatically imposes the maximum sentence, Ohio sentencing statutes and/or due process might require a different result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Hoover, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   {\u00b6 76} I respectfully dissent in part and concur in part with the lead opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   {\u00b6 77} As for the first assignment of error, I conclude that the trial court erred by denying appellant's presentence motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Accordingly, I would sustain appellant's first assignment of error and reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   {\u00b6 78} As the Ohio Supreme Court has made clear, when a motion to withdraw a plea is made prior to sentencing it shall be \"freely and liberally granted.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Xie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1711998\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/62/521/\">\n    62 Ohio St.3d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=584%20N.E.2d%20715\">\n    584 N.E.2d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). I also acknowledge that a presentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea need not be automatically granted, and that the decision on the motion is within the trial court's discretion. However, I find it important to note that a defendant is not required to establish a manifest injustice\n   as in the case of a postsentence motion to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   {\u00b6 79} Here, the record establishes some evidence that appellant was confused about what plea he was allowed to enter; and he appeared to not fully understand the nature of the charges and the negotiated sentence. Appellant also claims to have a valid defense to the charges. I also note that permitting withdrawal of the guilty plea would minimally prejudice the State-while the harm in denying the motion greatly prejudices appellant. Thus, I believe that these factors, when considered in conjunction with the rule that presentence motions to withdraw a plea are to be treated liberally and freely allowed, tips the balance scales in favor of appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   {\u00b6 80} As for appellant's second assignment of error, the conditional sentence is problematic. The separate offense of failure to appear could have been implemented. However, even the maximum prison sentence for a failure to appear would only have been eighteen months. See R.C. 2929.14(A)(4). If Howard had appeared as he was scheduled, he would have been sentenced to a prison term of five and a half years. Instead, he was sentenced to nine and a half years. Circumstances of the underlying crime never changed between the time that Howard changed his plea to the time that he was actually sentenced; and no new information was learned regarding the circumstances of the crime. Thus, the extra years imposed upon Howard was clearly for his failure to appear. This extra four years of punishment is more than double that which the legislature has deemed should be the punishment for a failure to appear. Nonetheless, I do agree that this was an agreed sentence and that we cannot review the merits of it pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(D)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   {\u00b6 81} For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the lead opinion as to appellant's first assignment of error. I concur with the lead opinion with respect to the second assignment of error. Lastly, I decline to express opinion as to the merits of appellant's third assignment of error.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
