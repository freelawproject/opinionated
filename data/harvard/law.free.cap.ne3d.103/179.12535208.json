Parisi filed a\n   <em>\n    Verified Petition for Writ of Mandamus\n   </em>\n   against the Dayton Bar Association and the Dayton Bar Association\n   Certified Grievance Committee (the \"DBA\" and \"DBACGC,\" respectively). Parisi, an attorney, asks this court to compel the respondents to produce public records related to grievances against her. The DBA and DBACGC moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that the records sought are related to the attorney disciplinary process and are not subject to release. Parisi filed a response; the DBA and DBACGC filed a reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On February 15, 2017, this court notified the parties that it intended to convert the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment, and gave the parties an opportunity to submit additional evidentiary materials and argument. Civ.R. 12(B) ; Loc. App.R. 8(A). The DBA and DBACGC filed a notice that they would stand on the materials already filed. Parisi filed a response to the notice, and separately asked for a continuance to conduct discovery pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F), a request this court overruled on April 3, 2017. We then gave Parisi additional time to file an additional response to the converted motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In response, Parisi filed her own motion for summary judgment, to which the DBA and DBACGC responded. Respondents also moved to strike the exhibits to Parisi's motion, arguing that they were not submitted in accordance with Civ.R. 56 or were otherwise improper. Parisi filed a reply to both filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} This matter is therefore before the court on: 1) the DBA and DBACGC's converted motion for summary judgment; 2) Parisi's motion for summary judgment; and 3) the DBA and DBACGC's motion to strike exhibits to Parisi's motion for summary judgment. Parisi's previously-filed motion for leave to file a memorandum of additional authorities is also pending. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the DBA and DBACGC are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We deny the request for a writ of mandamus and dismiss this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Standard for a Writ of Mandamus\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} \"A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that only applies in a limited set of circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

We do the same here, without deciding which version applies as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule V, Section 27(C) (\"This rule * * * shall apply to all pending investigations and complaints so far as may be practicable and to all future investigations, complaints, and petitions * * * \"). The current disciplinary procedure is described generally and to the extent relevant to this case in the following paragraphs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The Disciplinary Rules provide that \"a certified grievance committee shall review and may investigate a grievance that alleges facts that, if substantiated, would constitute misconduct by a judicial officer or attorney * * *.\" Rule V, Section 9(C)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A certified grievance committee (\"CGC\") \"shall review and may investigate any matter filed with it or that comes to its attention and may file a complaint pursuant to this rule in cases where it finds probable cause to believe that misconduct has occurred * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205975008\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A CGC may retain outside experts such as an independent investigator or other experts in the course of its investigation. Rule V, Section 9(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 18} A grievance filed with a CGC \"may be dismissed without investigation if the grievance and any supporting material do not contain an allegation of misconduct\" by the attorney. Rule V, Section 9(C)(2). \"If, upon review or investigation of a grievance, a certified grievance committee * * * determines that the filing of a complaint with the Board is not warranted, the grievant and the judicial officer or attorney shall be notified in writing of that determination * * *.\" Rule V, Section 10(C). In this situation, a copy of the grievance is available upon request of the attorney involved. Rule V, Section 10(C). \"Files related to any matter that the committee dismissed without investigation shall be retained for two years,\" while those \"related to any matter in which the committee initiated an investigation shall be retained for ten years.\" Rule V, Section 5(D)(1)(f)(ii) and (iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Conversely, a CGC may file a complaint with the Board of Professional Conduct (the \"Board\") upon a majority vote of the CGC, after giving the attorney an opportunity to respond. Rule V, Section 10(A) and (B). While the \"complaint shall not include any documents, exhibits, or other attachments unless specifically required\n   by Civ. R. 10,\" ( Rule V, Section 10(E)(2)), certain other materials must be submitted to the Board with the complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The relator shall submit with the complaint sufficient investigatory materials to demonstrate probable cause. The materials shall include any response submitted by or on behalf of the respondent to the notice of intent to file provided by the relator pursuant to Section 10(A) and an affidavit from bar counsel or other appropriate representative of the relator documenting relator's contacts with or attempts to contact the respondent prior to filing the complaint. The materials may include investigation reports, summaries, depositions, statements, and any other relevant material.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Rule V, Section 10(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 20} At this point in this process, the materials are generally confidential: \"[p]rior to a determination of probable cause by the Board, all proceedings, documents, and deliberations relating to review, investigation, and consideration of grievances shall be confidential\" unless one of three exceptions apply. Rule V, Section 8(A)(1). Likewise, and subject to the same exceptions, \"all investigatory materials prepared in connection with an investigation conducted pursuant to Section 9 of this rule or submitted with a complaint filed pursuant to Section 10 of this rule shall be confidential prior to certification of a formal complaint pursuant to Section 11 of this rule.\" Rule V, Section 8(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} One exception is \"[w]here the respondent expressly and voluntarily waives confidentiality of the proceedings.\" Rule V, Section 8(A)(1)(a). However, the same provision somewhat confusingly notes that \"[a] waiver of confidentiality does not entitle the respondent or any other person access to documents or deliberations expressly designated as confidential under this section.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205975008\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} A probable cause panel of the Board reviews the complaint and investigatory materials submitted by a CGC and \"make[s] an independent determination of whether probable cause exists for the filing of a complaint.\" Rule V, Section 11(A). \"The panel shall issue an order certifying the complaint, in whole or in part, to the Board or dismissing the complaint and investigation in its entirety.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205975008\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 23} If the complaint is dismissed without a finding of probable cause and is not certified to the Board by a probable cause panel, the documents, proceedings, and investigatory materials prepared or submitted remain confidential. Rule V, Section 8(A)(3). It is unclear whether the aforementioned exceptions, including the waiver-of-confidentiality exception, also apply to this provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} If a complaint is not dismissed but is instead certified to the Board, different confidentiality provisions apply. As relevant here, the Disciplinary Rules provide that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   From the time a complaint has been certified to the Board by a probable cause panel, the complaint and all subsequent proceedings conducted and documents filed in connection with the complaint shall be public except as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (3) The summary of investigation prepared by the relator shall be confidential as workproduct of the relator. All other investigatory materials and any attachments prepared in connection with an investigation conducted pursuant to Section 9 of this rule or submitted with a complaint filed pursuant to Section 10 of this rule shall be discoverable as provided in the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Rule V, Section 8(B)(3). Proceedings then continue on the certified complaint before the Board and the Supreme Court of Ohio\n   as appropriate.

R.C. 149.43(C)(1)(b). Parisi asserts in her Petition that the PRA applies to the DBACGC because it is a public office. Specifically, she asserts that the DBACGC acts as, or has been found to be, an \"arm\" of the Supreme Court of Ohio with respect to disciplinary proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parisi v.

Because the Supreme Court is a public office, Parisi reasons, its \"arms\" are also public offices when they perform disciplinary functions on behalf of the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Public access to most Supreme Court records, however, is controlled by the Public Access Rules set forth in Rules 44 through 47 of the Rules of Superintendence for the Courts of Ohio (\"Superintendence Rules\"), rather than by the Public Records Act.

We need not determine today whether the Public Records Act or the Public Access Rules apply to this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither party has moved for summary judgment specifically on this basis. Parisi simply asks for relief in her motion, assuming that the PRA applies and focusing on whether the requested records are public records or exempt from disclosure. The DBACGC does not concede that it is a public office, but does not move for summary judgment on this basis. It instead asserts that if it is a public office subject to the requirements of the PRA, the requested records are barred from release. We therefore make no determination today on these issues. We conclude that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the PRA applies, and\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the DBACGC is a public office as defined thereunder, the records at issue cannot be released via a public records request made under R.C. 149.43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.\n     <em>\n      Public Records\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Subject to certain exceptions, the PRA provides that upon request, \"all public records responsive to the request shall be promptly prepared and made available for inspection to any person at all reasonable\n   times during regular business hours.\" R.C. 149.43(B)(1). A \"public office or person responsible for public records shall make copies of the requested public record available at cost and within a reasonable period of time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20N.E.3d%20761\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Requested Records\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Before determining whether the DBACGC has a clear legal duty to provide records to Parisi under the PRA, we must determine whether the requested records are public records. Before making that determination, we have to decipher what exactly Parisi requested and received, and which records remain in dispute between the parties. We have not been aided much by the record before us in this respect: Parisi nebulously asked for \"all records which the DBA has concerning me\" and invites us to \"speculate as to what information might be contained in the said documents,\" while the DBACGC declines to provide specific information about what was withheld (with the exception of the \"investigator's summaries of investigation\"), replying cryptically to Parisi that \"we believe your request for records falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board of Professional Conduct of the Ohio Supreme Court\" as the reason for not producing further records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 39} The parties appear to agree that Parisi made the first public records request pertinent to this case on February 16, 2016 by letter.

The April 8 Letter states that \"[a]ny documents maintained by the Certified Grievance Committee of the Dayton Bar Association were related to grievances filed against\" Parisi. However, citing Rule V, Section 8(A)(1) and (A)(3) of the Disciplinary Rules, the DBACGC asserted that the Rule \"exempts disclosure of all proceedings, documents and deliberations relating to review, investigation, and consideration of grievances before a probable cause determination where a complaint is not filed or a filed complaint dismissed for lack of probable cause.\" The letter does not state whether or how the records requested from\n   <em>\n    Parisi I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Parisi II\n   </em>\n   , or other grievances filed during the specified time, fit into the cited rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 41} After additional email correspondence, the DBACGC sent an email to Parisi on April 8, 2016 to confirm a telephone discussion about the scope of Parisi's request. The April 8 Email states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Per my discussion with you today, it is my understanding that you are not seeking any records related to the grievances of [R.J.G., S.D., T.J. and K.L.], those grievances that were the subject of\n   <em>\n    Parisi I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Parisi II\n   </em>\n   , with the following exception.

The DBACGC noted that only \"the summary of investigation prepared by the investigator has been removed as exempted from disclosure as a confidential work product,\" citing Rule V, Section 8(A)(1)(a) and (B)(3) of the Disciplinary Rules. \"No other documents have been removed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 46} As to the Judge S.W. grievance, which \"was not investigated by the Dayton Bar Association's Certified Grievance Committee,\" the DBACGC provided \"[t]he only documents in [its] possession\" on the CD-rom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 47} \"As to the grievances of [R.J.G., S.D., T.J. and K.L.], which were the subject of Parisi I and Parisi II, those records relating to the committee's votes have been downloaded on to the CD rom.\" The DBACGC again did not disclose the \"summaries of the investigator,\" which it said were also confidential work product under Rule V, Section 8(B)(3). The DBACGC indicated that it would respond to Parisi's expanded request separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 48} On April 22, 2016, the DBACGC informed Parisi that it could not provide any additional documents. Although the April 22 Letter did not indicate what records were being withheld, it stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   While you have waived confidentiality of those matters that did not proceed to a probable cause determination or were dismissed without a probable cause determination, we do not believe that waiver applies to those matters where a formal complaint was filed and a probable cause finding made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Additionally, based upon our further review of those rules ( Rule V, Section 2(A) and (B); Section 5(H), we believe your request for records falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board of Professional Conduct of the Ohio Supreme Court, and we cannot disclose any further documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   This action followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Items Still at Issue\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Comparing Parisi's requests with the DBACGC's responses, it appears that the following three categories of materials have been requested but not provided to Parisi:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   a. Reports and/or Summaries: variously referred to as the \"investigator's report\" (April 8, 2016 email from DBACGC to Parisi), the \"summary of investigation prepared by the investigator\" (April 15, 2016 letter from DBACGC to Parisi), an \"investigatory report\" prepared by an investigator (Parisi's\n   <em>\n    Motion for Sum\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    mary Judgment\n   </em>\n   , filed April 13, 2017), or the \"investigator's summaries of investigation\" (\n   <em>\n    Reply Memorandum of Respondents Dayton Bar Association in Support of Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , filed July 11, 2016, at fn. 2) for\n   <em>\n    Parisi I, Parisi II\n   </em>\n   , and the 2011 N.A. grievance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   b. Previously disclosed documents (April 11, 2016 email from Parisi to DBACGC).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   c. \"[A]ll records which the DBA has concerning me, including records associated with Parisi I and Parisi II,\" including \"all emails, text messages, and any and all electronic messages, whether made on the DBA's or an individual's electronic equipment\" (April 11, 2016 email from Parisi to DBACGC).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   We will deal with each in turn. Before doing so, however, we take a moment to frame the matter as it stands and to articulate some principles that apply to the disciplinary process as a whole and that guide our consideration of each category of requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 50} The DBACGC has moved for summary judgment on Parisi's mandamus claim for public records. It disputes that the documents requested by Parisi and withheld by it are \"public records\" under the PRA, because their release is barred by state law, namely the Disciplinary Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 51} The DBACGC cites Rule V, Section 5(H) of the Disciplinary Rules throughout its pleadings, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   No employee, appointee, or member of a certified grievance committee shall disclose to any person any proceedings, documents, or deliberations of the committee. Prior to taking office, bar counsel and each employee, appointee, or member of a certified grievance committee shall swear or affirm that he or she will abide by these rules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Other provisions require a similar oath of confidentiality by the Commissioners of the Board of Professional Conduct, Board-appointed masters, employees of the Board, Disciplinary Counsel, and employees of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. Rule V, Sections 1(H) and 4(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Parisi acknowledges that the \"proceedings, documents, or deliberations\" of the DBACGC are confidential under Rule V, Section 5(H). She argues that Section 5(H) does not apply to documents or emails, etc., that are not produced by the DBACGC itself, but may have been produced by \"an investigator, witnesses, and the like\" during the DBACGC's investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 53} We do not find this distinction to be supportable. The general confidentiality provision in Rule V, Section 5(H) speaks broadly of \"any proceedings, documents, or deliberations,\" terms that we believe encompass witness statements collected or received by a CGC in the course of its \"proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Vindicator Printing Co. v. Philomena\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist.

To construe the rule otherwise would be absurd; a construction that safeguards only the official result of an investigation but none of the unconfirmed allegations or the investigator's speculations would protect neither the public, the attorney, nor the alleged victim. In other\n   words, we do not believe that committee members are free to disclose to the public the grievances they've received and what their investigators have uncovered about those grievances, but are forbidden only from saying what the committee officially decided to do about them. All \"proceedings, documents, or deliberations\" are protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 55} This interpretation is consistent with the broad definition of confidentiality in the Disciplinary Rules, the confidentiality protection historically attaching to disciplinary proceedings, and the breadth of the rules as applied by the Supreme Court of Ohio. Section 35(D) of the current version of Rule V (containing definitions) says that the term \" 'Confidential' acknowledges the oath of office of Sections 1, 4, and 5 of this rule, the necessity of confidentiality of all proceedings, documents, and deliberations of a certified grievance committee, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, and the Board and its hearing panels.\" We do not think this statement allows any interpretation that would limit it the way Parisi suggests. We conclude that \"all proceedings, documents, and deliberations,\" including witness statements and communication by an investigator or members of the committee, are confidential and their release barred by Rule V, Section 5(H).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Previous versions of Rule V similarly provided that \"[a]ll proceedings and documents relating to review and investigation of grievances made under these rules shall be private * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Everage v.

The DBACGC also withheld a copy of the \"summary of investigation prepared by the investigator\" for the 2011 N.A. grievance that did not proceed to probable cause, although Parisi may already have this report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit A to Parisi's May 24, 2017\n   <em>\n    Relator's Reply Memorandum\n   </em>\n   (discussing Beck's investigation of the N.A. and K.L. grievances).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 62} The DBACGC states that \"[t]he only documents not provided to Ms. Parisi in response to her February 16, 2016 request (as clarified and confirmed with Ms. Parisi) were the investigator's summaries of investigation.\" Parisi argues that she has not asked for the \"summary of investigation\" but the documents that the summary summarizes, including, presumably, the investigator's reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Much confusion in this case, and indeed, in this interaction between the parties, appears traceable to this unresolved difference in understanding. Not having reviewed any documents that were produced or withheld except to the extent they were filed within the slim record here, it is unclear to this court whether the requested \"investigator's report\" is the same thing as the withheld \"investigator's summary of investigation,\" and further, whether one or the other is the same thing as the \"summary of investigation prepared by the\n   <em>\n    relator\n   </em>\n   \" of the grievance complaint (i.e., the bar association or its grievance committee, as distinct from an investigator retained or assigned by the bar association). While this may appear to be a semantic question, the distinction is relevant\n   because the Disciplinary Rules protect the \"summary of investigation prepared by the relator\" differently than \"other investigatory material.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Rule V, Section 8(B)(3) provides that \"[t]he summary of investigation prepared by the relator shall be confidential as workproduct of the relator.\" The DBACGC's position appears to be that the requested \"investigator's report\" is the same thing as the withheld \"investigator's summary of investigation,\" which is the same thing as the \"summary of investigation prepared by the relator\" that is confidential workproduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Parisi makes the distinction noted above, arguing for release of \"all other investigatory material\" summarized in the summary, presumably including the investigator's reports. She refers the court to the latter portion of Rule V, Section 8(B)(3), which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   All other investigatory materials and any attachments prepared in connection with an investigation conducted pursuant to Section 9 of this rule or submitted with a complaint filed pursuant to Section 10 of this rule shall be discoverable as provided in the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The list of \"sufficient investigatory materials\" in Section 10 contains both investigation reports and summaries: \"The [submitted] materials may include investigation reports, summaries, depositions, statements, and any other relevant material.\" Rule V, Section 10(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Upon review of the Disciplinary Rules and the materials before us, we conclude that the requested investigator's reports are \"records the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law.\" R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(v). If the reports are indeed the \"summary of investigation prepared by the relator\" as the DBA and DBACGC argue, then they are \"confidential * * * workproduct of the relator\" and barred from release by Rule V, Section 8(B)(3), in addition to the general confidentiality provision of Rule V, Section 5(H). If the reports are not workproduct but \"other investigatory materials\" that are/were discoverable during disciplinary proceedings as Parisi argues, then they remain confidential for purposes of this public records request by virtue of Rule V, Section 5(H).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b6 67} We make this determination without reviewing the documents in camera for three reasons. First, neither party has filed a motion asking us to review them in camera. Second, we are cognizant that ordering the DBACGC to produce documents relating to the attorney disciplinary process would implicate, and possibly cause its members to violate their oath of confidentiality. Rule V, Section 5(H). Third, the Supreme Court of Ohio has held that an in camera review is unnecessary when the question before the court is a particular document's\n   <em>\n    status\n   </em>\n   under the law, rather than its content.\n   <em>\n    Salemi v.

Here, the parties agree generally about the content of the documents-investigator's reports and records related to grievances against and/or investigations of Parisi-and we are able to determine the status of this category of documents without an in camera review of each document's details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    Confidential Workproduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 68} The DBACGC treats the requested investigator's reports as confidential workproduct. Rule V, Section 8(B)(3). Parisi argues that any workproduct protection afforded the \"summary of investigation prepared by the relator\" by that rule ended when the disciplinary litigation ended, citing the recent Supreme Court case of\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Caster v. Columbus\n   </em>\n   , Ohio Sup. Ct. Slip Opinion No.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280667\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/151/425/\">\n    2016-Ohio-8394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207448756\">\n    2016 WL 7448756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Caster\n   </em>\n   does not make as sweeping a pronouncement as Parisi suggests. In\n   <em>\n    Caster\n   </em>\n   , the Court dealt \"primarily with * * * the specific-investigatory-work-product exception in R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(c), which * * * includes 'information assembled by law enforcement officials in connection with a probable or pending criminal proceeding.' \"\n   <em>\n    Caster\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19, quoting\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The DBACGC instead relies on the exemption in R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(v) for \"[r]ecords the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law,\" which includes the workproduct protection set out in the Disciplinary Rules. Parisi has not presented, and we have not found, any authority for extending\n   <em>\n    Caster\n   </em>\n   into civil or disciplinary proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Caster's\n   </em>\n   analysis, largely related to Crim.R. 16 and criminal defendants, does not apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 70} Further, even if the workproduct protection had expired pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Caster\n   </em>\n   , the summary of investigation would not transform from a document specifically protected from production to a freely-available public record, as Parisi argues. Rather, it would continue to be protected by the general confidentiality provisions of Rule V, Section 5(H).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    Other Investigatory Materials\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   {\u00b6 71} If the investigator's reports are not confidential workproduct, but are \"other investigatory material,\" different standards apply. As discussed above, all \"proceedings, documents, or deliberations\" of a certified grievance committee are covered by the broad and overarching general confidentiality provision set out in Rule V, Section 5(H) and are barred from disclosure. Rule V also specifically addresses confidentiality of other investigatory materials during two phases of disciplinary proceedings: the time period prior to a probable cause finding, and the time period after. \"Prior to a determination of probable cause by the Board, all proceedings, documents, and deliberations relating to review, investigation, and consideration of grievances shall be confidential\" unless an exception applies. Rule V, Section 8(A)(1). However, \"[f]rom the time a complaint has been certified to the Board by a probable cause panel, the complaint and all subsequent proceedings conducted and documents filed in connection with the complaint shall be public,\" subject to other exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Parisi argues for two exceptions to these provisions, based on two exceptions to the specific rules. First, she asserts that she waived confidentiality as to the proceedings, which is an exception to the pre-probable cause time period. Second, she argues that the materials are \"discoverable\" and are therefore public records, which is an exception to the post-probable cause time period. Neither argument has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    Waiver Exception\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   {\u00b6 73} Before a probable cause finding and certification of a complaint to the Board of Professional Conduct, \"all proceedings, documents, and deliberations relating to review, investigation, and consideration of grievances,\" as well as \"all investigatory materials prepared in connection with an investigation conducted pursuant to Section 9 * * * or submitted with a complaint filed pursuant to Section 10,\" are confidential, with some exceptions. Rule V, Section 8(A)(1), Section 8(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   {\u00b6 74} One exception is \"[w]here the respondent expressly and voluntarily waives confidentiality of the proceedings.\" Rule V, Section 8(A)(1)(a). Parisi argues that as the respondent in the disciplinary proceedings she has waived the confidentiality of the proceedings. Her statements to the DBACGC in the record so reflect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   {\u00b6 75} However, the waiver exception appears only in the section covering \"Proceedings Prior to Probable Cause.\" Neither of Parisi's disciplinary cases are in that posture, and the waiver exception therefore does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dayton Bar Assn. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Lowe\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of Ohio rejected a similar argument that documents disclosed by a prosecutor during discovery automatically became public records under R.C. 149.43 by virtue of their disclosure. We similarly disagree that \"discoverable\" means \"public\" in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   {\u00b6 80} Second, Parisi's argument conflates her status as a respondent in the disciplinary matters, and her status as a member of the public in this action. She is not seeking\n   <em>\n    discovery\n   </em>\n   of materials\n   <em>\n    as a party\n   </em>\n   to her disciplinary\n   <em>\n    cases\n   </em>\n   under the\n   Rules of Civil Procedure, as those cases are already resolved; she has filed a separate public records request as a member of the public under R.C. 149.43. Setting aside the fact that the discoverability provision did not exist during\n   <em>\n    Parisi I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Parisi II\n   </em>\n   and was apparently unavailable to her at that time,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   which we discuss in paragraphs 83-84, we are aware of no provision that would allow a member of the public to submit discovery requests in a grievance proceeding, or further, to demand access to discovery that was not made, nor available even to the disciplined attorney, in closed disciplinary cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 81} In other words, the fact that sensitive, otherwise confidential investigatory materials may be demanded and released to an attorney facing professional discipline during an ongoing adversarial proceeding before a Supreme Court Board does not mean that the same documents must be provided to any member of the public, upon request, at any time.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lowe\n   </em>\n   at 354,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=673%20N.E.2d%201360\">\n    673 N.E.2d 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   {\u00b6 82} Rule V, Section 8(B) appears to recognize this, specifically describing as \"public\" only \"the complaint and all\n   <em>\n    subsequent\n   </em>\n   proceedings conducted and documents filed in connection with the complaint,\" and only after the complaint has been certified to the Board by a probable cause panel. (Emphasis added.) \"Other investigatory materials\" do not fall within this category of \"public\" documents and proceedings. They are also not automatically made public by the fact that an investigated attorney may seek access to them during active disciplinary proceedings. We conclude that, at this time, after the disciplinary matters against her were resolved, Parisi is not entitled to the investigator's reports by virtue of the discovery provision in Rule V, Section 8(B)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   {\u00b6 83} Finally, we note that Parisi unsuccessfully sought access to the investigator's reports during disciplinary proceedings in\n   <em>\n    Parisi II.\n   </em>\n   The record contains a certified copy of an Order filed on April 29, 2013 in Case No. 12-060 before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline [now Board of Professional Conduct] in\n   <em>\n    In re: Complaint Against Georgianna I.

First, she notes that \"[s]ince the filing of this Mandamus complaint, Relator has learned that the Respondents have conducted a number of public activities involving her. Specifically, Relator notes that the Respondents had a specific Bar/Bench Conference about her case and her, and that it was video taped.\"\n   <em>\n    Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   filed April 13, 2017, p. 6.
