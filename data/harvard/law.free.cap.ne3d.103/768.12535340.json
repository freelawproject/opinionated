Federico asserted numerous challenges to the bank's right of possession, including that the assignment of the mortgage to the bank was void because it did not comply with the pooling and servicing agreement, that the foreclosing attorneys did not have authority to conduct the foreclosure, and that the default and foreclosure notices were legally insufficient. After a jury trial, judgment for the bank for possession and rent entered in May, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Federico appealed the judgment to the Appellate Division of the District Court Department, but she did not file her brief in that court in a timely manner. Ultimately, after Federico had been granted several extensions of time to file her brief, the Appellate Division dismissed her appeal. Federico filed a timely notice of appeal from the decision and order of the Appellate Division. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 109.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On appeal to this court, Federico raises numerous issues concerning the underlying summary process proceeding in the District Court. Essentially, she contends that she received an unfair trial and that the trial judge was biased against her. However, because Federico did not present any of those claims to the Appellate Division, she may not raise them here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \"In a civil case, after a judgment in the District Court, an 'appellant is barred from pursuing in the Appeals Court a claim of error that it failed to raise at the Appellate Division.'\"\n   <em>\n    Gossels\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fleet Natl.

App. Ct. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 744 (2003) (\"We apply the abuse of discretion standard to determine whether the judge was warranted in dismissing the appeal\"). Federico's brief, however, does not address the propriety of the Appellate Division's order dismissing her appeal; therefore, we do not address the issue.
