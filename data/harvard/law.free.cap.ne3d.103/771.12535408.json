We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We set forth the basic undisputed material facts, as recited in the motion judge's memorandum of decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The defendants are siblings and own real estate at 18 Winchester Street, Boston, as joint tenants. In 2013, they communicated with each other about selling the property to the plaintiff, Thirty 2 Rutland Street, LLC. The defendants each granted authority to Shu Ying\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to sign their names on \"Offers to Purchase Real Estate\" (OTPs) for the property. The grants of authority were made at a meeting where each sibling was present. They were not memorialized in writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In July, 2013, the plaintiff executed an OTP to buy the property for $1,600,000 and tendered the document and the deposit to the defendants' real estate agent. That same day, Shu Ying signed the OTP as the seller. He signed only his own name, and did not indicate on the document if he signed only for himself or also as an agent for his siblings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, the defendants refused to execute a Standard Form Purchase and Sale Agreement or convey the property to the plaintiff in accordance with the OTP, and this litigation resulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. A Superior Court judge granted the plaintiff's motion and denied the defendants' motion, and ordered specific performance of the OTP for the plaintiff. The judge denied the defendants' motion to reconsider, and a final judgment entered following a stipulated dismissal of the remaining claims in the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n   . \"The judgment sought [by a motion for summary judgment] shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and responses to requests for admission ... together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=436%20Mass.%201404\">\n    436 Mass. 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002).

The Statute of Frauds, G. L. c. 259, \u00a7 1, provides that agreements for the sale of land must be \"in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith or by some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.\" As the motion judge noted in her thoughtful memorandum, there is no dispute that Shu Ying had the siblings' authority to sell the property. Rather, the defendants contend that parol evidence cannot be used to determine Shu Ying's intention to sign the OTP for both himself and his siblings. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Tzitzon Realty Co\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Mustonen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304992\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/352/648/#p654\">\n    352 Mass. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 654 (1967), the Supreme Judicial Court considered whether a wife could be bound by the signature of her husband alone where she did not herself sign the memorandum of the sale of real estate. The Superior Court judge confirmed the report of a master who had found, after an evidentiary hearing, that the husband's signature was \"with [the wife's] consent and acquiescence and that it was the intention and design of both that the [husband's] signature represent the signature of both.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304992\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/352/648/#p654\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304992\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/352/648/#p654\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Based on these facts-and despite their proof by parol evidence-the Supreme Judicial Court held that the husband's signature bound the wife to the memorandum in satisfaction of the Statute of Frauds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304992\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/352/648/#p654\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304992\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/352/648/#p654\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Here, there is no dispute that Shu Ying had the authority and the intention to sell the property on behalf of his siblings when he signed the OTP.
