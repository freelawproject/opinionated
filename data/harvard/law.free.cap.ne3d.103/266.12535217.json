As he was 16 years old, Appellee was subject to mandatory transfer to the general division if the juvenile court found probable cause to believe he committed the offense. The probable cause hearing was held jointly with the co-defendant. The juvenile court found the state failed to establish probable cause to believe Appellee committed murder. In evaluating probable cause in the case against Appellee, the juvenile court refused to consider the detective's testimony on what the co-defendant told him and the co-defendant's video statement. For the following reasons, we conclude the state presented sufficient credible evidence of probable cause. The juvenile court's judgment dismissing the complaint is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to issue a mandatory transfer order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On July 31, 2015, a delinquency complaint was filed in juvenile court against Appellee alleging he purposely caused the death of Jarell Brown on July 26, 2015, which constitutes the offense of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02. A firearm specification was attached to the charge. As the charge was murder and Appellee was sixteen at the time of the offense, he was subject to mandatory transfer to the general division of the common pleas court if there was probable cause to believe he committed the act charged. In accordance, the state filed a motion to relinquish jurisdiction asking the court to conduct a transfer hearing. The probable cause hearing commenced on various dates due to a witness's failure to appear and refusal to testify, even after a material witness warrant was issued and immunity was granted. The hearings proceeded jointly with co-defendant J.J. who was also charged with murder for the victim's death. J.J. was fourteen years old on the day of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The medical examiner testified he observed the body of the eighteen-year-old\n   victim at the scene. The body was lying in a puddle of water on Indianola Avenue approximately 100 yards west of Market Street. (Tr. 10). The victim suffered a single gunshot wound ; the bullet entered the victim's upper back and exited his neck. (Tr. 11). The shot was not fired by a shotgun or an assault rifle. (Tr. 22). The medical examiner opined the victim could have been able to run for up to \"a minute or so\" upon suffering the wound, after which he would have been incapacitated until he died three to four minutes later. (Tr. 19-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Detective Spotleson testified the victim's body was found on the side of the road at 27 West Indianola Avenue in front of a fabrication business. (Tr. 52, 58). A man driving down the road saw the body and called the police. (Tr. 52). Firemen from the nearby fire station walked to the scene to report they heard three shots just before the police dispatch. (Tr. 53). Upon noticing undisturbed gravel near the body, the detective concluded the victim had not been thrown from a vehicle. (Tr. 52). The victim's brother told the detective the victim would have been carrying money and a 9mm firearm. (Tr. 54). The police found $30 in the victim's wallet but recovered no gun from the scene. (Tr. 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The detective explained how he discovered where to look for video evidence showing the victim's movements. A witness reported he saw three males enter a beverage store on Market Street and then saw them walk a few blocks north to Hylda Avenue. One of the three individuals was wearing a red sweatshirt, which was the color of the sweatshirt the victim was wearing. (Tr. 55-56). This witness heard what he perceived as fireworks and soon noticed police at the scene on Indianola.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The detective retraced the reported path and collected videos along the way, which established his timeline. (St. Ex. 4). He created photographic still shots from the videos. (St. Ex. 5-15). A 9:50 p.m. video from the front of a jewelry store facing Market Street showed a person (said to be Appellee) walking south on Market Street; he was wearing dark pants, a white t-shirt, and white shoes. (St. Ex. 5). A 9:56 p.m. video from the same business showed two people (said to be J.J. and the victim) walking south on Market Street: one was wearing dark shorts or pants, a long-sleeved red shirt or jacket, and white shoes; and one was wearing white shorts, a dark long-sleeved shirt or jacket, and white shoes. (St. Ex. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} A video from a beverage store further south on Market Street showed Appellee, J.J., and the victim entering the store together and buying items. Appellee purchased a drink and the victim purchased cigar products. (St. Ex. 4, 10:02-10:04 p.m., Chan. 1,4). A 10:02 p.m. still shot from this video showed J.J. and the victim entering the business. (St. Ex. 7-8); (Tr. 61-62). A 10:03 p.m. still shot showed Appellee with the victim and J.J. during the purchase of the products. (St. Ex. 9-11); (Tr. 63). The three individuals were clearly portrayed in this evidence, and juvenile officers were able to provide the detective with their names. (Tr. 70-71). The detective identified Appellee and J.J. in court. (Tr. 71). The beverage store video showed: Appellee wearing dark pants or jeans, a white T-shirt, and white shoes; J.J. wearing white shorts, a dark sweatshirt, and white shoes; and the victim wearing a red sweatshirt, dark shorts, and white shoes. (St. Ex. 9-11). Their attire matched that worn by the individuals walking in the direction of the beverage store in the minutes-earlier jewelry store video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} At 10:08 p.m., the video from the front of the jewelry store showed three individuals walking north on Market Street (from the direction of the beverage\n   store). (St. Ex. 12); (Tr. 65). The attire of these individuals matched that worn by Appellee, J.J., and the victim five minutes earlier. A 10:09 p.m. video from the side of the jewelry store showed the three individuals had turned left off of Market Street and onto West Hylda Avenue. (St. Ex. 13); (Tr. 65-66). In this video, the back of the heads and hair of the individuals can be seen in addition to the clothing (for purposes of comparison with the beverage store video). The victim was walking in front with Appellee and J.J. following him. Just prior to walking out of camera range, the three individuals moved from the sidewalk to the street as if starting to cross West Hylda Avenue. (St. Ex. 13-14); (Tr. 66-67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Crossing West Hylda Avenue from their position one would encounter an alley connecting West Hylda to Indianola Avenue. The alley runs along the side of the fabrication business, and it outlets where the victim's body was found. (Tr. 66-67). In this alley, the detective found a 9mm shell casing. (Tr. 56). Near the shell casing, the detective found a cigar and cigar wrappers, whose serial numbers matched those sold to the victim at the beverage store. (Tr. 56-57, 119). The beverage store tracked the sale of the products on the cash register and found it matched the time on the video showing Appellee, J.J., and the victim at the cash register. (Tr. 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} A video was also recovered from the fabrication business showing a male who \"appears to be the victim\" running down the alley toward Indianola. (St. Ex. 15); (Tr. 57, 68). The timestamp on the video was 10:08 p.m., but the detective ascertained the clock on that camera was set seven or eight minutes behind, meaning it portrayed the victim running at 10:15 or 10:16 p.m. (Tr. 68-69). In concluding this portrayed the last moments of the victim's life, the detective noted the police were called and officers arrived within minutes of the shooting. (Tr. 112, 128). The evidence suggested to the detective that Appellee and J.J. were with the victim in the alley in the minutes before his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The detective also testified about his interview of J.J. occurring on August 4, 2015, which was preserved on video. (St. Ex. 2-3). J.J. was read his rights and signed a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights form. (St. Ex. 16). The detective testified J.J. said he, the victim, and Appellee went to a friend's house on Princeton Avenue but this friend asked them to leave because he had issues with the victim; this friend was the material witness who refused to testify. (Tr. 76-77). J.J. initially told the detective the victim left the house in a blue car. (Tr. 77). When the detective mentioned he saw J.J. with the victim in a video from the beverage store, J.J. changed the story to say: a car pulled up after they left the store; the victim said he was going to rob the \"weed man\"; the victim produced a gun but was shot in the back of the head by the car's passenger; and the victim ran one way while J.J. ran the opposite way. (Tr. 78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The detective told J.J. there was no car in the jewelry store's video, and J.J. then declared: he, Appellee, and the victim left the store, walked north on Market Street to Hylda, and turned into the alley; Appellee relieved himself in the alley; the victim handed his gun to Appellee so the victim could roll a joint; Appellee told J.J. he was going to shoot the victim because he was a snitch; Appellee walked up behind the victim and fired the gun at him; J.J. believed the shot hit the victim in the head; Appellee tried to shoot the victim again but the gun did not fire; Appellee pulled J.J. by the back of the shirt, and they ran south down the alley back toward Hylda; the victim ran north up the alley toward Indianola; and they eventually\n   went back to their friend's house, where Appellee brandished a 9mm and bragged about shooting the victim. (Tr. 79-81). J.J. made all three statements within the first 30 minutes of his interview, repeating the final story after a break. (St. Ex. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} There was no objection to this testimony as it was presented. The final day of the probable cause hearing was held on March 15, 2017, nearly a year after this testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When a request for a continuance was denied, the state rested pending admission of its exhibits. At this point, Appellee objected to the exhibits containing J.J.'s statement and the signed\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights form. (Tr. 212). It was argued J.J.'s statements, although admissible against J.J. as his own statements, were not admissible against Appellee. (Tr. 212-213). The state disagreed, and the court held a discussion off the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The juvenile court thereafter sustained Appellee's objection so J.J.'s statement would not be considered as evidence of probable cause in the case against Appellee but would be considered in the case against J.J. (Tr. 215-217). In closing, Appellee's attorney argued that, without the statements of J.J. or the friend previously held as a material witness, there was no evidence Appellee committed murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The juvenile court agreed and dismissed the charge against Appellee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court said the dismissal was without prejudice as the complaint could be refiled if the state found more evidence or secured the testimony of the missing witness. (Tr. 233). In a March 16, 2017 judgment entry, the juvenile court memorialized its decision to dismiss the complaint without prejudice and found \"the State failed to carry its burden of proof and did not establish probable cause to believe that the Subject Child committed an act that would be a felony, if committed by an adult.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state filed a timely notice of appeal from the dismissal of the complaint, and briefing was completed on October 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In reviewing appealability, the state cites R.C. 2945.67(A), which provides: \"A prosecuting attorney * * * may appeal as a matter of right any decision of a trial court in a criminal case, or any decision of a juvenile court in a delinquency case, which decision grants a motion to dismiss all or any part of an indictment, complaint, or information * * *.\" The\n   state may appeal as a matter of right from the dismissal of an indictment regardless of whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    State v. Craig\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5575457\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/116/135/\">\n    116 Ohio St.3d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-5752\">\n    2007-Ohio-5752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=876%20N.E.2d%20957\">\n    876 N.E.2d 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16. \"[T]he order of a juvenile court denying a motion for mandatory bindover bars the state from prosecuting a juvenile offender as an adult for a criminal offense.

Here, Appellee moved the juvenile court to dismiss the case against him at the probable cause hearing. (Tr. 226). The court found the state failed to present evidence of probable cause and dismissed the complaint, making the decision appealable by the state as a matter of right under R.C. 2945.67(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    GENERAL LAW ON PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING FOR BINDOVER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Juv.R. 30(B) provides: \"Mandatory Transfer.

Appellee and J.J. were with the victim who was buying cigars in a store within minutes of the shooting. They left the store together and walked in the direction of the alley. Appellee and J.J. walked behind the victim as they approached the location of the alley. A video shows them leaving the sidewalk as if to cross the street to the side where the alley was located. According to a reasonable construction of the evidence, a gun was fired at the victim in the alley. A 9mm shell casing was found in the alley near a cigar and cigar wrappers with serial numbers showing they were purchased at the store at the time the three were in the store. The victim usually carried a 9mm firearm, but no firearm was recovered from the scene. The victim was shot from behind with a handgun; the bullet entered his upper back and exited his neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The medical examiner opined the victim could have run for a minute after suffering the wound. A video shows a person, whom the detective concluded was the victim, running down the alley alone toward the street where his body was found. This was minutes after the victim stepped off the sidewalk with Appellee and J.J. on Hylda Avenue across from the opening of the alley. A passing motorist saw the victim's body in the road soon after the firing of shots which were heard by others in the area, including the firemen at the nearby fire station. The motorist, rather than the victim's companions, called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellee contends the timeline may not be as compact as the detective suggests, noting the detective thought he was called to the scene around 11:00 p.m. Appellee believes it was significant the firemen reported hearing three shots but only one 9mm casing was found in the alley. At the hearing, the defense theorized a car may have been waiting on West Hylda Avenue just outside the camera's range and focused on whether the detective could disprove someone else, such as the material witness, was waiting for the victim with a gun just outside the range of the video. (Tr. 123). Appellee concludes the prosecution failed to demonstrate a car or unidentified person was not present at the scene.

United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28364\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/171/#p178\">\n    483 U.S. 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 178,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28364\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/171/#p178\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28364\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/171/#p178\">\n    97 L.Ed.2d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) (court may consider hearsay in making factual determinations prerequisite to a hearsay exception). Thus, two allegedly inadmissible statements can corroborate each other so as to indicate truthworthiness under Evid.R. 804(B)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Besides the fact that two alleged hearsay statements corroborated each other, the evidence collected by the detective also provided corroboration for J.J.'s final story. Any finding to the contrary was wholly unreasonable at the probable cause hearing. In any event, the juvenile court's decision appears to have been based on a belief the confrontation clause prohibits a co-defendant's testimonial statement to a detective to be admitted at a preliminary juvenile transfer hearing. We do not believe there is such a prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude there was sufficient, credible evidence demonstrating probable cause in this case. Viewing the evidence presented at the probable cause hearing and all rational inferences in the light most favorable to the state, a rational person could conclude there were reasonable grounds for believing Appellee committed murder, i.e., there was a \"fair probability\" Appellee was culpably involved in the murder. When a reviewing court reverses a juvenile court's finding of\n   no probable cause and finds sufficient probable cause in a mandatory transfer case, a proper remedy is to reverse and remand with instructions to enter a mandatory transfer order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A.J.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695431\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/120/185/\">\n    120 Ohio St.3d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-5307\">\n    2008-Ohio-5307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=897%20N.E.2d%20629\">\n    897 N.E.2d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Accordingly, the juvenile court's judgment of dismissal is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to enter an order of mandatory transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Donofrio, J., concurs in judgment only; see concurring in judgment only opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Waite, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   DONOFRIO, J. concurs in judgment only with concurring opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 54} I respectfully concur in judgment only with the majority's judgment that the judgment of dismissal is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to enter an order of mandatory transfer. I write separately, however, because once the conclusions are reached that the Ohio Rules of Evidence do not apply at a juvenile mandatory bindover hearing and that the juvenile court is not bound by confrontation clause standards at a juvenile mandatory bindover hearing, there is no need for further analysis in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 55} At paragraph 41, the majority asks the question whether the Ohio Rules of Evidence apply at juvenile mandatory bindover hearings. They conclude that, in fact, the rules of evidence do not apply at juvenile mandatory bindover hearings. I agree with this determination based on the majority's reasoning in paragraphs 42 through 47. I further agree with the majority's analysis of the confrontation clause in paragraphs 37 through 41 and with their conclusion that the juvenile court was not bound by confrontation clause standards for the admissibility of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Once the above conclusions are reached, however, there is no need for further discussion regarding hearsay, non-hearsay, or hearsay exceptions. In fact, I do not agree with the majority's analysis regarding non-hearsay issues of J.J.'s statement to the detective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 57} I would simply conclude that because the rules of evidence and the confrontation clause standards do not apply in this case, the trial court erred in excluding J.J.'s statements to the detective. When J.J.'s statements are considered along with the other evidence presented at the mandatory bindover hearing, there was sufficient evidence on which to bind Appellee over.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    As aforementioned, the probable cause hearing commenced on various dates due to issues with a material witness, who fled after he was granted immunity and released on the material witness warrant. The witness was interviewed by the detective on video; after initially saying the victim left his house in a blue car, this witness subsequently said he heard Appellee make incriminating statements at his house before and after the shooting. (St. Ex. 17-18). Appellee objected to the use of the witness's out-of-court statement, arguing there was no corroboration to show truthworthiness under the statement against interest hearsay exception. The juvenile court found this statement was barred by the confrontation clause and would not satisfy the declaration against interest hearsay exception in Evid.R. 804(B)(3) as there were no corroborating circumstances indicating truthworthiness. (9/26/16 J.E.) The court suggested it could not use J.J.'s statement as corroboration. (Tr. 154-157).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    In J.J.'s case, the court found probable cause (on the basis of complicity) and set the matter for an amenability hearing, as his younger age made bindover discretionary. (Tr. 233).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The entry mistakenly stated, \"Exhibits 1 through 16 were excluded on the within matter.\" There was no objection to St. Ex. 1 (the coroner's packet introduced during the medical examiner's testimony) or St. Ex. 4-15 (the video evidence). As to these exhibits, the court stated, \"[t]he state has provided copies of the originals that are now accepted and admitted into evidence.\" (Tr. 215, 217).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    In a discretionary transfer case where the court finds probable cause, the case must be continued for an amenability hearing after a full investigation. Juv.R. 30(C). If the court decides to retain jurisdiction after the amenability hearing, it shall set the proceedings for the hearing \"on the merits.\" Juv.R. 30(E).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    No objection was entered during the detective's testimony on what J.J. told him. Eleven months later, the court ruled State Ex. 2-3 (J.J.'s video statement) inadmissible and seemed to impliedly strike the detective's testimony on what he was told by J.J.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
