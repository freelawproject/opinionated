In June, 2012, the defendant bought and moved into a fourth-floor unit in a condominium complex. The victim lived directly below the defendant with his wife and two year old son in a unit that he and his wife had bought. Soon after the defendant moved into her unit, the victim heard loud noises, including \"very loud stomping\" and \"heavy, loud thuds,\" coming from the defendant's unit. The victim tried to speak to the defendant about the noise, but to no avail. The noise increased in frequency and in strength. The victim also tried unsuccessfully to resolve the issue through the condominium association. The noise became so unbearable that the victim paid to have his bedroom ceiling soundproofed. This did little to mask the noise. He then began to report this conduct to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   After calling the police numerous times in February and March of 2013, the victim applied for and was granted a harassment prevention order pursuant to G. L. c. 258E. The ex parte order entered on April 12, 2013, and after a hearing on April 23, 2013, at which both parties were present, the order was extended to October 22, 2013. At a subsequent hearing, at which both parties were present, the order was extended for one year until November 18, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The harassment prevention order did not deter the defendant. In total, the police were called to the condominium complex nearly forty-seven times between September, 2012, and April, 2013, for the most part due to complaints regarding the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Ineffective assistance of counsel\n   </em>\n   . The defendant claims that nine of her convictions, charged in seven complaints, violated her right to a speedy trial pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 36,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20Mass.%20909\">\n    378 Mass. 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979). Because defense counsel did not move to dismiss on this ground, the defendant claims that her counsel was ineffective because a motion to dismiss would have been allowed. She raises this claim for the first time on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Although the speedy trial claim was not raised below, \"we assess whether ... counsel's error in failing to preserve this issue amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Denehy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223614\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/466/723/#p728\">\n    466 Mass. 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 728 (2014).

The defendant next contends that the Commonwealth's decision to file nolle prosequis on four of the charges at the conclusion of the evidence prejudiced her. She claims that because those charges were not dismissed or nolle prossed prior to trial, the jury heard otherwise inadmissible prior bad act evidence resulting in her being prejudiced. As there was no objection, we review to determine whether there was error, and if so, whether it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304943\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/352/556/#p563\">\n    352 Mass. 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563-564 (1977).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Commonwealth filed the nolle prosequis at the urging of the trial judge to reduce jury confusion and for case management purposes. At the close of evidence, there remained twenty-three charges on thirteen complaints, and some charges appeared duplicative due to the defendant's ongoing conduct during different times on the same date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Generally, the Commonwealth is permitted to introduce evidence of prior bad acts to meet its burden of proof on the charge of criminal harassment. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ). Moreover, some of the evidence of the defendant's conduct was the basis for other charges that were submitted to the jury. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DelValle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276659\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/443/782/#p790\">\n    443 Mass. 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 790 (2005) (evidence of prior bad acts may be admissible if relevant for purpose of showing intent, motive, state of mind, or other relevant issue at trial). There was no error, let alone a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Jury instruction on prior bad acts\n   </em>\n   . The defendant next contends that the judge should have sua sponte instructed the jury on prior bad act evidence. As there was no request from the defendant, nor an objection to the given instructions, we review to determine whether any error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Resende\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462664\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/141/#p153\">\n    476 Mass. 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 153 (2017). The judge is not required to give such an instruction sua sponte, and none was required here. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1178151\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/436/799/#p809\">\n    436 Mass. 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 809 (2002).

The defendant next contends that it was error to admit the unredacted harassment prevention order. She contends that the following language was prejudicial: \"[T]he Court determined that there is a substantial likelihood of immediate danger of harassment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because there was no objection, we review for error, and if error is found, whether it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of a justice.\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While the existence of a harassment \"prevention order itself is required to establish violation of the order,\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reddy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229449\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/85/104/#p109\">\n    85 Mass.

Notwithstanding, defense counsel in his closing argument argued that many people obtain harassment prevention orders, but that, here, even if the defendant had been noisy, that did not satisfy the elements of the crimes charged. He also argued that as to the victim obtaining the harassment prevention order, \"We don't know what he said, we don't know what the basis of it was.\" See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Foreman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1011130\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/52/510/#p515\">\n    52 Mass. App. Ct. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 515-516 (2001). Moreover, the Commonwealth did not emphasize or exploit the \"substantial likelihood\" language to prove that the defendant violated the order. Contrast\n   <em>\n    Reddy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229449\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/85/104/#p109\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229449\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/85/104/#p109\">\n    at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although error, it did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Sergeant Gunter's testimony\n   </em>\n   . The defendant argues that the testimony of Sergeant Gunter regarding a conversation he had with an assistant district attorney was hearsay that created an \"improper official imprimatur\" of the defendant's guilt. Because the defendant did not object to the testimony, we review for error, and if error is found, whether it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304943\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/352/556/#p563\">\n    352 Mass. at 563-564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his testimony, Gunter did not express his views-or those of the assistant district attorney-about the defendant's guilt. In addition, most of Gunter's testimony regarding the criminal harassment charge was brought was elicited by defense counsel. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882741\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/405/339/#p344\">\n    405 Mass. 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 344 (1989) (\"If the defendant had elicited the potentially prejudicial response, he cannot now complain of its prejudicial effect\" [quotation omitted] ). There was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Forfeiture of the condominium unit\n   </em>\n   . The defendant contends that the judge's order that she stay away from her condominium unit, unless escorted by police, constituted a forfeiture requiring a jury trial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant makes this contention for the first time on appeal, and \"[o]ur system is premised on appellate review of that which was presented and argued below.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bettencourt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3730570\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/447/631/#p634\">\n    447 Mass. 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 634 (2006). Notwithstanding, the stay away order entered in this case does not constitute a civil forfeiture. Generally the Commonwealth seeks forfeiture when monies, real estate, or other property are \"furnished or intended to be furnished by any person in exchange for a controlled substance.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    One 2004 Audi Sedan Auto\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668948\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/456/34/#p37\">\n    456 Mass. 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37 (2010), quoting from G.

Forfeiture \"results in total loss of the property.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    One 1972 Chevrolet Van\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"900715\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/385/198/#p201\">\n    385 Mass. 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 201 (1982).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Here, the Commonwealth did not seek forfeiture, and the judge's order did not result in forfeiture of the unit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   See G.
