Ross pleaded guilty to engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, conspiracy to engage in a pattern of corrupt activity, and aggravated funding of drug trafficking. Ross failed to appear for the sentencing hearing and remained at large for three years. Upon his apprehension, he received an aggregate 30-year prison term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} First Ross asserts that his conviction should be overturned because his acts occurred between October 17, 2011 and December 18, 2011, but selling and possessing\n   controlled substance analogs was not a crime until December 20, 2012. Ross's argument is meritless because the Supreme Court of Ohio recently rejected this argument and held that controlled substance analogs were criminalized on October 17, 2011, the effective date of H.B. 64. which treated controlled substance analogs as controlled substances. Therefore, his acts were criminal when he committed them. We overrule Ross's first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Next Ross asserts that the controlled substance analog statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to him, violating his constitutional right to due process of law. However, we agree with the federal decisions analyzing a similar federal controlled substance analog statute, and with the decisions from the Twelfth and Ninth District Courts of Appeals; thus we hold that the controlled substance analog statute is neither unconstitutionally vague on its face or as applied to Ross. We overrule Ross's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Ross also contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at both the initial plea hearing and the hearing to withdraw his guilty plea because his counsel failed to challenge the controlled substance analog statute. However, because there was no legal support for his argument, Ross cannot show that a challenge would have had a reasonable probability of success. Therefore, he cannot show that his counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Counsel has no duty to press untested legal theories. And even if we assume counsel's performance was deficient, Ross can show no prejudice from his counsel's failure to challenge the statute, i.e., a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. We overrule Ross's third assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Next Ross asserts that the trial court erred when it refused to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea. He argues that he has a complete defense based on his contentions that (1) his acts were not criminalized when he committed them and (2) the controlled substance analog statute is unconstitutionally vague. However, we reviewed and rejected both arguments under Ross's first two assignments of error. Our review of the record reflects that Ross had a change of heart regarding his guilty plea, which is not a reasonable legitimate basis for withdrawing a plea. Accordingly, the trial court did not act arbitrarily, unreasonably or unconscionably in denying Ross's motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. We overrule Ross's fourth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Finally, Ross asserts that the trial court's imposition of consecutive sentences was not supported by the evidence and he was sentenced for offenses that should have been merged as allied offenses. The state contends that the sentencing was made pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement and is unreviewable. The record reveals that: (1) Ross agreed to the 30-year consecutive prison term as part of his negotiated plea agreement, (2) statutory findings and evidence supporting those findings are not required prior to imposing consecutive sentences that are part of a jointly recommended sentencing agreement, and (3) RICO offenses do not merge with their predicate offenses. We find that the agreed sentence was jointly recommended, imposed by the sentencing judge, and authorized by law. Because, it is not reviewable under R.C. 2953.08(D)(1), we do not undertake a review of the merits of Ross's fifth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} We affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In 2012, a Scioto County Grand Jury indicted Ross on 21 counts, which consisted of one count each of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity and conspiracy to engage in a pattern of corrupt activity (Ohio RICO violations), one count of aggravated funding of drug activity, two counts of trafficking in drugs, ten counts of aggravating trafficking in drugs-three of which were in the vicinity of a juvenile, two counts of aggravated possession of drugs, one count of trademark counterfeiting, one count of weapon under a disability, one count of trafficking in crack cocaine in the vicinity of a school and one count of possession of crack cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} As part of a negotiated plea agreement Ross pleaded guilty to the two Ohio RICO violations and one drug offense: Count I-engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity in violation of R.C. 2923.32(A)(1), Count II-conspiracy to engage in a pattern of corrupt activity in violation of R.C. 2923.01, and Count III-aggravated funding of drug activity in violation of R.C. 2925.05(A) /(C)(1). In return the state agreed to dismiss the remaining counts. At the plea hearing the trial court placed the agreement on the record in open court, stating that if Ross abided by the conditions of bond, Ross would receive a 10-year prison term, but if he failed then he would be sentenced to a 30-year term. The sentencing hearing was set for July 9, 2013, but Ross breached the conditions of bond and failed to appear. Ross remained at large for three years but was eventually apprehended in Cuyahoga County using a false name. He was returned to Scioto County in March 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Upon his return Ross filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, which the trial court denied. The trial court sentenced Ross to an 11-year prison term on count I, 8-year term on count II,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 11-year term on count III. The trial court ordered the sentence to run consecutively for a total aggregate prison term of 30 years as part of \"a jointly recommended and agreed to sentence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Ross appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Ross assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I. IT WAS PLAIN ERROR FOR THE TRIAL COURT TO CONVICT MR. ROSS FOR INNOCENT ACTS, IN VIOLATION OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM\n   <em>\n    EX POST FACTO\n   </em>\n   CONVICTIONS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   II. THE \"CONTROLLING SUBSTANCE ANALOG\" STATUTE UNDER WHICH MR. ROSS WAS CONVICTED WAS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE ON ITS FACE AND IN ITS APPLICATION, AND HIS CONVICTION WAS A FUNDAMENTAL ERROR THAT VIOLATED HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   III. COUNSEL FOR MR. ROSS PROVIDED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE AT BOTH THE INITIAL PLEA HEARING AND THE HEARING TO WITHDRAW HIS PLEA OF GUILTY.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   IV. THE COURT ERRED BY FAILING TO ALLOW MR. ROSS TO WITHDRAW HIS PLEA OF GUILTY.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   V. THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED TO MR. ROSS'S PREJUDICE BECAUSE AN ORDER IMPOSING CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES IN THIS CASE IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE FACTS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   III. LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Controlled Substance Analog Statute\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   1. Controlled Substance Analogs were Criminalized on October 17, 2011\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Ross argues that his conviction should be overturned because \"controlled substance analogs\" were not criminalized until December 20, 2012, when 2012 Sub.H.B. No. 334 (\"H.B. 334\") became effective.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ross contends that his conviction involved the possession, funding and sale of controlled substance analogs from acts that occurred between October 17, 2011 and December 18, 2011. Ross argues that the Tenth District Court of Appeals decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 14AP-154,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-5303\">\n    2014-Ohio-5303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206726161\">\n    2014 WL 6726161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is directly on point and mandates that his conviction be vacated and he be immediately released from prison. For support Ross also cites two subsequent Tenth District decisions:\n   <em>\n    State v. Mohammad\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. Franklin No. 14AP-662,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-1234\">\n    2015-Ohio-1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201446481\">\n    2015 WL 1446481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ross argues that the definition of \"controlled substance analog\" in R.C. 3719.01(HH)(1) is vague because for a substance to be a controlled substance analog the chemical structure must be \"substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I or II.\" He argues that \"substantially similar\" is an undefined term and a completely subjective one that cannot be uniformly applied with consistent standards, creating an \"arbitrary enforcement\" problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Ross did not raise this issue below; therefore he again forfeits all but plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 21} \"[S]tatutes enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

At the same time counsel filed a motion for funding for an expert in pharmaceutical chemistry to assist Ross in challenging the analog. It is likely no coincidence that within a week of those filings, Ross's counsel and the state had reached a negotiated plea agreement in which Ross would plead guilty to only three counts of the 21-count indictment and receive only 10 years of a\n   potential prison term exceeding 30 years, with consideration for judicial release in five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 40} But even if we were to assume trial counsel's performance was deficient for failing to raise these challenges, Ross cannot demonstrate prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.

He claimed he had wanted to challenge the state's evidence, but he \"was forced to take an attorney that didn't want to fight for me\" and \"didn't know nothing about the case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state challenged Ross's testimony, but Ross denied knowing that his attorney reviewed the lab report, shared the report with the state in discovery, and discussed the evidence during plea negotiations. The trial court denied the motion, finding that Ross \"was represented by a highly competent attorney\" who was one of the county's \"finest criminal attorneys.\" Ross made the motion three years after he entered his plea; he understood the nature of the charges and possible penalties when he entered the plea. The trial court denied the motion finding that \"this is a classic change of heart effort * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 48} A balance of the outlined factors does not warrant withdrawal of Ross's guilty plea. The trial court considered counsel's competency, finding him \"highly competent\" and one of the county's \"finest criminal attorneys.\" The record shows that Ross was given a full Crim.R. 11 hearing prior to entering his plea and a full hearing on his motion to withdraw-Ross does not contest this. The trial court gave full and fair consideration of the motion, replaying recorded portions of the change of plea hearing for Ross's benefit. We find that the motion was not timely; Ross made it three years after he failed to appear for his sentencing hearing, all the while his whereabouts unknown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 49} We also find that reasons set forth in Ross's motion were not supported by and conflicted with his testimony at the hearing. In his motion Ross cites \"new evidence\" that he obtained\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   entering his plea. His motion stated, \"Due to the new evidence from the independent lab testing, Defendant does not wish to waive his rights to trial as he feels strongly that he is not guilty * * *. When Defendant signed his guilty plea, he was under the mistaken impression that the prosecutor's drug tests results were accurate. It has since been proven that this is not the case.\" However, at the hearing Ross testified he had the lab results from his supplier when he made his purchases and gave them to his attorney\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   entering his guilty plea; he claimed that his attorney \"just didn't look at it. He didn't take it serious, * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Ross contends that he \"has a complete defense to the charges, and, in fact, a constitutional argument against conviction.\" However, his \"complete defense\" and \"constitutional argument\" are based on the meritless arguments that (1) his\n   acts were not criminalized until December 20, 2012 and (2) the controlled substance analog statute is unconstitutionally vague-arguments we have reviewed and reject.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Our review of the record reflects that Ross had a change of heart regarding his guilty plea, which is not a reasonable and legitimate basis for withdrawing a plea. Accordingly, the trial court did not act arbitrarily, unreasonably or unconscionably in denying Ross's motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. We overrule Ross's fourth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   D. Imposition of Consecutive Sentences\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Ross concedes that the trial court made the findings required by R.C. 2929.14(C) prior to imposing consecutive sentence, but argues those findings are not supported by competent, credible evidence. Ross also contends that several of the offenses are allied offenses of similar import and should have been merged for purposes of sentencing. Specifically, he argues that the indictment includes the statement that Count III (aggravated funding of drug activity) was a predicate event of the pattern of corrupt activity alleged in Count I (engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity) and Count II (conspiracy to engage in a pattern of corrupt activity). As a result, Ross claims Count III should have merged into Counts I and II.

The 30-Year Prison Term is Part of the Negotiated Plea Agreement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Although the record does not contain a written document, the plea agreement stated on the record in open court in accordance with Crim.R.11(F) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   THE COURT: The record should further reflect it's a negotiated plea, * * * that as long as this Defendant abides by his conditions of bond he'll receive a negotiated ten year prison term. It really doesn't matter how we break it down since nothing is mandatory. So we'd give him ten years on Count I, and on Count 2, which is a felony two, we'll give him the eight years On the felony, Count 3 the ten years, but again, there [sic] all running concurrently for each other, for an aggregate ten year prison term.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Now he's also going to be eligible for judicial release between five to seven years. * * * this Court has made representation that if the Defendant has no disciplinary conduct marks against him while he's in prison and participates in every single program that's offered to him at a good or excellent level of participation, that I would consider a judicial release at the five years. However, if he fails to abide by his conditions of bond in any way that he'd be looking at serving 30 years in prison. * * * And, Mr. Ross, is this your understanding, sir?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   THE COURT: Okay, All right, it's very important then you abide by your conditions of bond so that you can get your deal and not get a 30 year deal.

And he understood it. He did it with a lawyer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In response Ross's counsel stated that Ross had just informed him that Ross did not know he had agreed to a 30-year prison term if he breached bond. The trial court offered to play back the recording of the change of plea hearing to show that the 30-year prison term was part of the agreement. Later in the hearing the trial court replayed the recording from that portion of the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b6 58} At the sentencing portion of the hearing the trial court again stated that the 30-year prison term was part of the negotiated plea agreement and Ross made no objection:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   THE COURT: This sentence, pursuant to Revised Code Section 2953.08(D), is a jointly recommended and agreed sentence that he will serve * * * all running consecutively with each other, for an aggregate 30 year prison term.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Ross did not object to the trial court's inclusion of the 30-year prison term as part of the negotiated plea agreement at either the change of plea hearing or the sentencing hearing. On appeal Ross has not included an assignment of error contesting the trial court's finding that the 30-year sentence is \"a jointly recommended and agreed sentence.\" Nor has he included it in his statement of issues presented for review.

Rather, the effect of the RICO statute of providing enhanced sanctions indicated an intent to permit cumulative punishments for RICO offenses and the underlying predicate offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Additionally, we hold the trial court did not violate the duty to merge allied offenses under R.C. 2941.25 because Ross's RICO offenses do not merge with the predicate drug offense of aggravated funding of drug trafficking. Therefore, the jointly recommended sentence is \"authorized by law.\" Because the sentence is not subject to review under R.C. 2953.08(D)(1), we do not undertake an analysis of Ross's fifth assignment of error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Because his acts of selling and possessing controlled substance analogs were criminalized at the time Ross committed them, we affirm Ross's convictions. Ross's constitutional right to due process of law was not violated because the controlled substance analog statute is not unconstitutionally vague on its face or as applied to him. Ross's ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails because Ross cannot show that the legal challenges he contends should have been raised or stood a reasonable probability of success. Therefore, he has failed to show ineffective assistance. The trial court did not err in refusing to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea where the basis for his request was a change of heart regarding the strength of the state's analog evidence. Finally, Ross's challenges to his sentence are not reviewable because the sentence was jointly recommended, imposed by a sentencing judge, and authorized by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Abele, J. &amp; Hoover, J.: Concur in Judgment and Opinion, with Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Abele, J., concurring in judgment and opinion with concurring opinion:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   {\u00b6 73} Although I agree with the principal opinion and the sentiment expressed in footnote 5 at page twenty-five, I nevertheless harbor severe reservations in this matter about both the nature of the plea agreement and the corresponding alternative or conditional sentences. It is most unusual for a court to accept a negotiated guilty plea, and then impose two separate penalties-one sentence if the defendant appears to begin serving the sentence and a second, much more severe sentence if the defendant fails to appear to serve the sentence. At first glance, one may reason that this situation is a product of the defendant's own making-and it is. The defendant did indeed agree to this very unusual arrangement, and the failure to appear for court proceedings is an affront to the court and to the administration of justice. Nevertheless, other remedies are available and are designed to be used in this type of situation (e.g. criminal charge for the failure to appear, forfeiture of the amount of cash or property posted as bond and used to secure a defendant's appearance, etc.). Here, an increase of twenty years in prison (defendant agreed to a ten year sentence if he appeared and a thirty year sentence if he failed to appear) bears little or no relation to the severity of the offenses for which the appellant was convicted. Thus, I am extremely wary about the use of a conditional sentence in this case to the point that I would welcome further review of the propriety of such a sentencing scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Hoover, J., concurring in judgment and opinion with lead opinion and with concurring opinion, with opinion:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   {\u00b6 74} I concur in the judgment and opinion of the lead opinion as well as with the concurring opinion. I write separately only to note my concern with the additional twenty years that the trial court added to the ten year sentence for Ross's failure to comply with his bond conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   {\u00b6 75} As Judge Abele aptly states, \"[O]ther remedies are available and are designed to be used in this type of situation.\" Here, Ross could have been charged with a separate offense of failure to appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   However, even the maximum prison sentence for failing to appear in these circumstances would only have been eighteen months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2929.14(A)(4). If Ross had appeared as he was scheduled, Ross would have been sentenced to a prison term of ten years. Circumstances of the underlying crime never changed between the time that Ross changed his plea to the time that he was actually sentenced; and no new information was learned regarding the circumstances of the crime. Thus, the extra twenty years imposed upon Ross was clearly only for his failure to appear. This twenty years of punishment is highly disproportionate to what the legislature has deemed should be the punishment for a failure to appear. This seems to run afoul of fundamental fairness principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   {\u00b6 76} Nonetheless, I do agree that this was an agreed sentence and that we cannot review the merits of it pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(D)(1).

One counsel sought to withdraw because Ross failed to meet with him and had made \"misrepresentations and tactics used to trick attorney\" into representing him: \"Assuming the Defendant's true name is Michel Ross, that would have been the only truth counsel has heard so far.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    We are quick to note that the conditions/or alternative sentence imposed here includes a seemingly draconian increase in the period of incarceration if the defendant fails to satisfy the condition necessary for imposition of the lesser sentence. Were it not for the fact that Ross agreed to the terms of the conditional sentence, one might wonder if such a dramatic increase in sanctions would offend the concept of fundamental fairness under substantive due process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    However, in this case even if there was a due process concern, Ross himself invited the error and therefore would be foreclosed from raising it even under a plain error challenge.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
