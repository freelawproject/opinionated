The state raises two assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. The trial court erred when it granted defendant's motion to vacate postrelease control. To impose valid postrelease control, the language in the sentencing entry may incorporate the advisements given during the sentencing hearing by referencing the postrelease control sections of the Ohio Revised Code and do not need to repeat what was said during the sentencing hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. The requirement that a trial court must journalize the specific requirements of postrelease control is based upon legal precedent that should not be retroactively applied in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In this appeal, the state acknowledges that under current precedent in the Eighth District, the postrelease-control notification was invalid because the trial court did not include the \"specific consequences of violating postrelease control in the sentencing journal entry.\" The state contends, however, that this precedent was decided in error and should be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Finding no merit to the state's appeal, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In late 2007, Tolbert was sentenced to six years in prison for three separate cases: Cuyahoga C.P. No CR-07-498281-A,\n   Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-07-498417-A, and Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-07-501690-B. In each of these cases, the trial court stated the following in the sentencing entries regarding postrelease control:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Postrelease control is part of this prison sentence for 3 years for the above felony(s) under R.C. 2967.28.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Tolbert was released from prison in these cases on May 13, 2013. At that time, he was placed on three years of postrelease control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On December 13, 2013, Tolbert was convicted of receiving stolen property in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-13-577719-A. He was sentenced to six months in prison and advised that upon his release, he may be placed on postrelease control for up to three years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Tolbert was released from prison in CR-13-577719-A on May 15, 2014. Upon his release, the Adult Parole Authority (\"APA\") chose not to place him on postrelease control for this case. Instead, the APA placed Tolbert on postrelease control for the time remaining in his 2007 cases, which was 2.44 years. When Tolbert filed his motion to vacate postrelease control, he was \"serving a prison sanction for violating\" the terms of his 2007 postrelease control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} When Tolbert filed his motion to vacate postrelease control, the state and Tolbert filed a joint statement of justiciability with the trial court along with Tolbert's motion to vacate because Tolbert had previously filed a motion to vacate postrelease control that the state opposed, believing that Tolbert was on postrelease control from his 2013 case. When the state learned that Tolbert was actually on postrelease control from his 2007 cases, it conceded that the issue was not moot and joined with Tolbert to file the statement of justiciability. The state further acknowledged to the trial court \"that current binding precedent in the Eighth District Court of Appeals supports Tolbert's arguments.\" But the state opposed Tolbert's motion \"for purposes of further appellate review.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} After the trial court granted Tolbert's motion to vacate his postrelease control, the state moved this court for leave to appeal, asserting that the appeal \"presents this court with a question of public and general interest.\" The state further explained that \"this exact proposition of law\" was currently under review by the Ohio Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State v. Grimes\n   </em>\n   , Supreme Court Case No. 2016-0215, and that \"\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   will be dispositive of the substantive issue in the instant case.\" Because the state believed that\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   would be dispositive of the issues in this appeal, it requested this court \"to accept jurisdiction in this case until the Supreme Court of Ohio render[ed] its decision in\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   .\" This court granted the state leave to appeal and held the case until the Ohio Supreme Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   , which it did so on May 24, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Tolbert explained that\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   was applicable because it established what information a trial court\n   must include in a sentencing entry to validly impose postrelease control when the court orally provided all of the required advisements at the sentencing hearing. But Tolbert maintained that even under\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   , the trial court's advisement in his 2007 cases was invalid for two reasons: (1) it was not clear whether his postrelease control was discretionary or mandatory, and (2) the sentencing entry gave no indication at all that there were consequences for violating postrelease control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} We now turn to the state's assigned errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion to Vacate Postrelease Control\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In its first assignment of error, the state argues that although the trial court followed Eighth District precedent when it vacated Tolbert's postrelease control-because the trial court failed to journalize \"the specific consequences of violating postrelease control in Tolbert's 2007 cases\"-the state maintains that the prior Eighth District \"decisions were wrongly decided\" and should be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Prior Eighth District Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In granting Tolbert's motion, the trial court relied on our unanimous en banc decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Mace\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100779,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-5036\">\n    2014-Ohio-5036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206065663\">\n    2014 WL 6065663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Mace\n   </em>\n   , we were asked: \"whether a sentencing journal entry that states that the appellant is subject to postrelease control for the 'maximum period allowed' for that felony is void, even if the court informed the defendant at the sentencing hearing of the specific period of postrelease control imposed.\" This court unanimously answered that the appellant's postrelease control was void.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} This court has repeatedly followed\n   <em>\n    Mace\n   </em>\n   , finding that when a trial court failed to set forth the specific consequences for violating postrelease control (that the parole board could impose a maximum prison term of up to one-half of the prison term originally imposed) in a sentencing entry and the defendant completed his sentence, the term of postrelease control was void and should be terminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Fifth District held that the trial court's August 2011 sentencing entry was \"silent as to the consequences of violating postrelease control\" because the court \"failed to inform [Grimes] if he violated his supervision or a condition of post-release control, the parole board could impose a maximum prison term of up to one-half of the prison term originally imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The Supreme Court first reviewed the statutory requirements for postrelease control notifications that a trial court is required to give an offender at the sentencing hearing.

The offender \"may\" be supervised if the offender has been convicted of a less serious felony for which the APA has discretion to impose postrelease control. R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(d) and 2967.28(C). The postrelease-control law also designates the term of supervision for each degree of felony. R.C. 2967.28(B) and (C). Additionally, the court, at the sentencing hearing, must notify the offender that if he or she \"violates that supervision * * *, the parole board may impose a prison term, as part of the sentence, of up to one-half of the stated prison term originally imposed upon the offender.\" R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(e).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The Supreme Court explained that although it had held in\n   <em>\n    State v.

When reviewing the trial court's postrelease control advisement in the sentencing entry in this case, there is no question that the trial court informed Tolbert of the duration of postrelease control-three years. With respect to the remaining requirements, however, Tolbert raises two arguments, which we address below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Discretionary or Mandatory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Tolbert first argues that the trial court's sentencing entry was invalid under\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   because the trial court did not specifically use the word \"mandatory.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The trial court's statement that \"[p]ostrelease control is part of this prison sentence for 3 years\" conveyed to Tolbert that his supervision would be mandatory for three years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. McGee\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101307,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-5289\">\n    2014-Ohio-5289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206679603\">\n    2014 WL 6679603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (court's sentencing entry, which stated: \"postrelease control is part of this prison sentence for 5 years for the above felony(s) under R.C. 2967.28,\" provided the defendant with notice that he would be subject to mandatory postrelease control);\n   <em>\n    State v. Rucker\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150434,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-5111\">\n    2016-Ohio-5111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204063866\">\n    2016 WL 4063866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6 (court's statement to defendant that \"you'll be on a period of supervision\" was sufficient to notify him of the mandatory nature of his postrelease control).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Consequences for Violating Postrelease Control\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Tolbert next argues that the trial court's sentencing entry was invalid under\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   because it did not give any \"indication that there are consequences for violating postrelease control.\" We agree with this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that a trial court need not specifically spell out the consequences for violating postrelease control in the sentencing entry as long as it did so at the sentencing hearing. But it held that the sentencing entry must still contain an advisement \"that any violation by the offender of the conditions of postrelease control will subject the offender to the consequences set forth in the statute.\" Here, the sentencing entry says nothing about Tolbert being subject to any consequences for violating the terms of his postrelease control. Accordingly, we hold that even under\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   , the trial court's sentencing entry was not sufficient to validly impose postrelease control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Thus, after reviewing\n   <em>\n    Grimes's\n   </em>\n   applicability to prior Eighth District cases, we find that they are overruled by\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   to the extent that these cases found postrelease control to be invalid when the sentencing entry did not spell out the specific consequences for violating postrelease control. But we note that a trial court must still advise an offender that he or she will be subject to consequences under R.C. 2967.28.\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 31} We need not address the state's remaining arguments within its first assignment of error because they are moot in light of\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   , which the state acknowledged in its motion for leave to appeal and in its appellate brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The state's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Retroactivity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 33} In its second assignment of error, the state maintains that when the trial court announced Tolbert's sentences in 2007, the postrelease control advisement was sufficient under Eighth District law at that time. Subsequent to Tolbert's sentence, however, the Eighth District \"announced a new rule of law when it held that in order to impose postrelease control sanctions, the sentencing journal entry must specifically state that if the offender violates postrelease control, he could be subject up to an additional prison term of up to one-half of the originally stated prison term.\" The state maintains that this \"new\" rule of law should not have been applied retroactively. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 34} It is well established that when postrelease control is not properly imposed, the sentence is void and must be set aside.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Singleton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4094716\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/124/173/\">\n    124 Ohio St.3d 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-6434\">\n    2009-Ohio-6434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=920%20N.E.2d%20958\">\n    920 N.E.2d 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing a history of Supreme Court cases on void postrelease control).
