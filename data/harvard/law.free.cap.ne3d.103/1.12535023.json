Hoffman. Before the accident occurred, both Deputy Johnson and Trooper Hoffman were responding to a call for help from Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper Keith Fellure. Trooper Fellure indicated that he had located a vehicle involved in a \"rolling domestic\" on Left Fork Road and requested assistance with the three individuals found with the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 3} While Deputy Johnson and Trooper Hoffman were en route to assist Trooper Fellure, both reached speeds over 100 miles per hour. Trooper Hoffman's vehicle was in front of Deputy Johnson's vehicle, but at some point, Deputy Johnson lost sight of Trooper Hoffman's vehicle. As Deputy Johnson topped a hill and rounded a slight curve, he saw Trooper Hoffman's vehicle backing up in his lane of travel in order to turn left onto Left Fork Road. Deputy Johnson applied his brakes and swerved to the left of the center line in an attempt to avoid a collision, but was unable to stop his vehicle before colliding with Trooper Hoffman's vehicle. A subsequent crash investigation indicated that Deputy Johnson's vehicle was traveling around 65 to 74 miles per hour at the point of impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellees subsequently filed a complaint and alleged that Deputy Johnson negligently, willfully, wantonly, and recklessly caused appellees' injuries. Appellants denied liability and additionally claimed that they are statutorily immune from liability under R.C. Chapter 2744.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Both parties filed summary judgment motions. Appellees asserted that no genuine issues of material fact remain concerning appellants' liability for appellees' injuries and regarding appellants' statutory immunity. Appellees alleged that based upon the evidence in the record, reasonable minds could only conclude that Deputy Johnson operated his vehicle in a willful, wanton, and reckless manner when he responded to Trooper Fellure's call for assistance. Appellees claimed that Deputy Johnson's conduct was willful, wanton, and reckless for the following reasons: (1) he was traveling between 101-106 mph on a two-lane roadway with a 55 mph speed limit; (2) his speed was grossly excessive given the road contours; (3) he did not slow down as he approached the intersection of Jackson Pike and Left Fork Road; (3) he did not know the location of Left Fork Road; (4) he did not have sufficient training regarding high-speed emergency vehicle handling; (5) he drove left-of-center;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (6) he did not exhibit due regard for safety; (7) he was unaware of a departmental policy concerning officer conduct when responding to an emergency call; and (8) after the accident, the sheriff ordered Deputy Johnson to complete an emergency vehicle course. Appellees argued, therefore, that appellants are not statutorily immune from liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellants also asserted that no genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether they are statutorily immune from liability under R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a) and 2744.03(A)(6)(a). In contrast to appellees' argument, however, appellants claimed that reasonable minds could only conclude that Deputy Johnson's conduct was not willful, wanton, or reckless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   They argued that Johnson's operation of his vehicle did not constitute willful, wanton, or reckless conduct for the following reasons: (1) Deputy Johnson activated his lights and sirens; (2) Deputy Johnson was responding to a fellow officer's call for help; (3) Deputy Johnson was traveling in his own lane; (4) Trooper Hoffman reversed his vehicle in Deputy Johnson's lane of travel; (5) the roadway was dry and it was clear day; (6) traffic was light; (7) there were no intersections with traffic control devices along the route; (8) Deputy Johnson applied his brakes and attempted to swerve to avoid Trooper Hoffman's cruiser; and (9) Deputy Johnson did not violate the sheriff's office emergency run response policy. Appellants further argued that despite Deputy Johnson's speed, none of the evidence shows that Johnson's decision to exceed the speed limit posed an obvious risk to others or presented a high likelihood that injury would result. They additionally contended that even if Deputy Johnson's training was not as extensive as Trooper Hoffman's, he did not lack any training or know that he would be unable to control a vehicle traveling over 100 miles per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   SUMMARY JUDGMENT EVIDENCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The parties primarily relied upon the deposition testimony to support their summary judgment motions. Appellants additionally presented a copy of the sheriff's emergency-run policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sheriff's Emergency-run Policy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The policy states: \"During emergency runs, employees must always give due regard to all other vehicles using the roadways. * * * * [T]he law does not relieve the vehicle operator from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons and property upon the highway.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The policy further provides that \"[e]mployees' driving actions must be very cautious-slowing at all intersections and sometimes even stopping.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Deputy Johnson\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Deputy Johnson stated that before the accident occurred, he heard a dispatch regarding a motor-vehicle-domestic-violence\n   situation. The dispatch indicated that the suspect vehicle was traveling towards Jackson Pike. Deputy Johnson headed westbound on Jackson Pike, behind an Ohio State Highway Patrol cruiser. Deputy Johnson related that he and the patrol cruiser were \"going in and out of traffic at a high rate of speed,\" but he slowed down due to heavy traffic and eventually lost sight of the vehicle. Shortly thereafter, Deputy Johnson met Trooper Hoffman in a parking lot. They discussed the suspect vehicle. Deputy Johnson then heard Trooper Fellure state over the radio that he had tracked the suspect vehicle to Left Fork Road. Deputy Johnson indicated that neither he nor Trooper Hoffman knew the precise location of Left Fork Road, but both knew its general location. Both Deputy Johnson and Trooper Hoffman left the parking lot and headed eastbound on Jackson Pike, towards Left Fork Road. Deputy Johnson stated that, at some point, he lost sight of Trooper Hoffman's vehicle. While en route to Trooper Fellure's location, Deputy Johnson heard Trooper Fellure radio that he located the suspect vehicle and it had crashed. Trooper Fellure indicated that there were multiple suspects and asked for assistance. Deputy Johnson stated that once Trooper Fellure requested assistance, he accelerated and activated his lights and sirens. Deputy Johnson continued on a straight stretch of road before topping a hill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 10} As Deputy Johnson topped the hill and rounded a \"little\" curve, he saw Trooper Hoffman's vehicle backing up in Deputy Johnson's lane of travel and trying to turn left onto Left Fork Road. Deputy Johnson hit the brakes and tried to swerve to avoid Trooper Hoffman's vehicle, but was unable to do so. Deputy Johnson was unaware of how fast he was traveling, but in his written statement made shortly after the accident, he estimated that as he topped the hill, he was going approximately 70 mph. At the time of his deposition three years later, he could not state how fast he was going.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Deputy Johnson stated that he is familiar with Jackson Pike, the road upon which the accident occurred. He indicated that he drives by the accident scene every day when he travels to work. Deputy Johnson related that he is familiar with the hill and the curve-the point where he noticed Trooper Hoffman's vehicle. He stated that while he did not know how fast he was traveling on May 29, 2010, he did not believe he was traveling too fast for the hill and curve conditions. Deputy Johnson further indicated that he believes the distance between the top of the hill and the location of Trooper Hoffman's vehicle was a couple hundred yards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Deputy Johnson explained that he became employed as a part-time sheriff after he completed the Ohio Police Officers Training Academy (OPOTA) in 2007. Deputy Johnson stated that part of training including a driving course and that although the driving course did not cover high-speed maneuvering, it did include braking, maneuvering, and high-speed driving. He indicated that every few months, he returns to OPOTA for training classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Deputy Johnson stated that at the time of the accident, he did not know whether the sheriff's office had a written policy regarding emergency-response calls. He explained that he was trained to use lights and sirens during an emergency run and to travel with \"regards to safety.\" Deputy Johnson denied that he was disciplined as a result of the accident. He stated that the sheriff did, however, place \"a letter * * * in [his] file about taking a driving course.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Trooper Hoffman\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Trooper Hoffman stated that on the date of the accident, he received a\n   dispatch regarding a \"rolling domestic.\" Trooper Hoffman explained that a \"rolling domestic\" involves a domestic violence situation in which the individuals are traveling in moving vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Trooper Hoffman related that he located the suspect vehicle and attempted to stop the vehicle, but the vehicle failed to yield. Trooper Hoffman thus initiated a pursuit. He followed the vehicle to Jackson Pike. Traffic became congested and he discontinued his pursuit. Trooper Hoffman then drove to a parking lot and Deputy Johnson subsequently appeared. Trooper Hoffman gave Deputy Johnson the description of the suspect vehicle and asked him if he had seen it. Trooper Hoffman then heard Trooper Fellure state over the radio that he found a vehicle involved in a crash on Left Fork Road. Trooper Hoffman departed for the accident scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Trooper Hoffman stated that he did not activate his lights and sirens, but he did exceed the speed limit so as to not \"wast[e] time.\" Trooper Hoffman estimated that he traveled between 80-85 mph during the three-and-one-half mile stretch to Left Fork Road. He does not believe that he acted recklessly or wantonly by exceeding the speed limit. Trooper Hoffman explained that while en route to Left Fork Road, he did not encounter much traffic and he did not need to pass any vehicles. Moreover, Trooper Hoffman stated that although \"[t]here is a slight bend to the road,\" he would not \"call it a curve.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Trooper Hoffman explained that he was unaware Deputy Johnson had followed him until he noticed Deputy Johnson's vehicle in the rear-view mirror. Trooper Hoffman stated that he noticed Deputy Johnson's vehicle just before he started backing up to turn left onto Left Fork Road. Trooper Hoffman believed Johnson was around \"a quarter mile or better behind [him].\" Hoffman explained that Deputy Johnson \"was far enough behind [him], [that he] knew [he] had a safe amount of time to make [the] turn.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Trooper Hoffman related that he underwent a six-month training course at the Ohio State Patrol Academy, with approximately two weeks dedicated to driver-training skills, such as defensive driving skills, maneuverability skills, high-speed-precision maneuverability, vehicle pursuits, inclement weather driving, and driving in tandem with another vehicle. Trooper Hoffman additionally related that he completes yearly in-service training that includes supplemental driver training. Trooper Hoffman stated that when employed as a trooper, he commonly drove over 100 miles per hour, even while en route to routine calls. The fastest he has ever driven in a patrol cruiser is 147 miles per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Trooper Hoffman explained that the standard applicable to law enforcement officers conducting emergency runs is \"due regard for safety of the other motorists around you.\" He agreed that some emergency runs necessitate exceeding the posted speed limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   4\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Henry Lipian\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellees' expert witness, Henry Lipian, testified that he conducted an accident reconstruction primarily to determine the speed of Deputy Johnson's vehicle at the time of the accident. Lipian explained that his analysis showed that Deputy Johnson's vehicle was traveling between 101 and 106 miles per hour at the point where visible tire marks appeared on the road and between 66 and 74 miles per hour at the point of impact. Lipian stated that the reconstruction indicates that Deputy Johnson \"was swerving to the left while at\n   the same time engaging in a hard braking event.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Lipian further opined that Johnson's conduct was reckless. Lipian stated, \"the speed in and of itself, to me, is a recklessly high speed.\" He explained how he reached his conclusion: \"One of the things I kind of apply is even on my most liberal analysis, if I were to stop somebody, when I was still a policeman, for a speed that I'm looking at, would I consider giving them a warning? No. You're not getting a warning for going 100 miles an hour in a 55 zone approaching an intersection.\" Lipian did not believe that there is any \"justification for that kind of speed.\" Lipian further stated that combining Deputy Johnson's excessive speed \"with an inexperienced officer who has minimal, if any, real legitimate training, who's part time, you know, that factors into it as well.\" Lipian believed that an individual with \"a considerable amount of driver's training, maybe even a driving instructor, [who] has a lot of experience,\" might be able to \"push the envelope a little bit more on certain conditions where you can drive faster.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In his written report, Lipian stated that \"[t]he nature of the emergency call did not justify [Deputy Johnson's] heedless disregard for the safety of the motoring public.\" Lipian indicated that Deputy Johnson did not possess \"the requisite training either in classroom or on-the-road training, and as a part-time officer he did not have the overall experience to operate a patrol car at such high speeds as would a more highly trained officer.\" Lipian ultimately concluded that Deputy Johnson \"displayed a flagrantly reckless lapse of due care. There was no justification for the high speed he was operating at, especially upon the approach to the intersection and coming up behind Trooper Hoffman. His speed was unsafe, unreasonable and completely unjustified.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   5\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Sergeant Fred Cook\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 23} OSHP Sergeant Fred Cook testified that he conducted an accident reconstruction. His analysis indicated that Deputy Johnson was traveling between 89 and 97 miles per hour when he started to skid and 65 to 72 miles per hour at the time of impact. Sergeant Cook stated that he also examined the power train control module from Trooper Hoffman's vehicle. It indicated that twenty seconds before impact, Hoffman's vehicle had been traveling 107.7 miles per hour and continued decelerating until it reached zero. The accident investigation report that Sergeant Cook prepared indicates that as one approaches the accident scene from the west, as Deputy Johnson was, the roadway slopes downward with a gradual curve to the left and there is over 1100 feet of visibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   6\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Trooper Fellure\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Trooper Fellure testified that on the date of the accident, he tracked the suspect vehicle to Left Fork Road. He radioed in the information and drove down Left Fork Road. When Trooper Fellure encountered the vehicle, it was sitting in a ditch and three individuals were standing outside of the vehicle. He ordered them to the ground, but \"[t]hat wasn't going to happen.\" Trooper Fellure explained that the individuals \"started running right at [him],\" and he used his shoulder microphone to call for help. He does not recall the precise words he used to call for help, or if his \"voice was amped up on the radio where [other officers] could tell, hey, we've go to get there or not, you know.\" Trooper Fellure also could not recall whether he\n   used a code, such as \"87,\" which means he needs backup, or \"88,\" which means \"officer in trouble.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   TRIAL COURT'S DECISION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 25} On January 20, 2017, the trial court overruled the parties' summary judgment motions. The court determined that genuine issues of material fact remain regarding whether Deputy Johnson operated his vehicle in a willful, wanton, or reckless manner. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellants' two assignments of error challenge the propriety of the trial court's decision to deny their summary judgment motion. Appellants contend that the trial court incorrectly determined that genuine issues of material fact remain concerning whether they are entitled to statutory immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744. Because the two assignments of error raise related issues, for ease of analysis we combine our discussion of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 27} We initially note that appellate courts conduct a de novo review of a trial court's summary judgment decision.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Argabrite v.

As the officer approached an intersection with a red light, he decelerated his car and visually inspected the intersection to look for cross-traffic or pedestrians. The officer did not notice any vehicles approaching. Once in the intersection, he saw the plaintiff's vehicle and fully braked, but was unable to avoid a collision. The data recorder from the officer's car indicated that five seconds before the accident, the officer was traveling approximately 65 miles per hour.

Because the law and current police and emergency practice clearly contemplate the necessity in some circumstances of such emergency runs, a responding officer does not create an 'unreasonable' risk of harm by engaging in an emergency run merely because such a response creates a greater risk than would be incurred by traveling at normal speed and in compliance with opposing traffic signals.

In\n   <em>\n    Elsass\n   </em>\n   , the injured driver was attempting to make a u-turn in the middle of a four-lane roadway when the officer's police cruiser crashed into it. The plaintiffs alleged that the officer acted recklessly by failing to activate the cruiser's lights and siren, by failing to illuminate his headlights, by violating departmental policy, and by speeding. They further claimed that the officer acted recklessly because he lacked sufficient training and experience in operating a police car without supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 65} The appellate court determined that the plaintiffs did not establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the officer acted recklessly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The court noted that the record did not contain any evidence to show that the officer failed to illuminate his headlights.

[The officer] used his headlights and attempted to pass [the plaintiff's] vehicle in the appropriate lane.

The court noted that the officer graduated from the police academy and worked with a supervisor for six months. The court additionally observed that the officer had been on the force for less than two years. The court determined, however, that being on the force for less than two years did not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the officer recklessly operated his police cruiser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   {\u00b6 67} The court further determined that the evidence failed to show that the officer acted willfully or wantonly, so as to impose liability upon the political subdivision. In determining that the officer did not act wantonly, the court found that the record did not contain any evidence to show that the officer knew that failing to activate his lights and siren and exceeding the posted speed limit presented a great probability of harm to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42. The court cited the following circumstances to support its conclusion: (1) the traffic \"was very limited\" around the time of the accident; (2) the area was well-lit; (3) the weather was clear; (4) the officer was not driving at a \"very high rate of speed,\" but instead, was driving around 45 miles per hour; (5) \"[t]ime was of the essence in responding to an emergency where someone had been stabbed and the suspect was still in the area\"; (6) the officer was driving in the passing lane of the street; and (7) the accident occurred when the driver made a u-turn into the officer's path.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   {\u00b6 68} For similar reasons, the court additionally determined that the officer did not act willfully. The court explained: \"in consideration of the limited traffic and clear visibility at the time, as well as a driver's reasonable expectation to be able to drive in a passing lane unimpeded by curb-lane traffic making u-turns, there is no evidence to indicate that [the officer] could reasonably know or appreciate any likelihood of the resulting injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.

The appellate court determined that the officer's speed, combined with his failure to activate his lights and sirens, created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he acted willfully, wantonly, or recklessly.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=899%20N.E.2d%201040\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46 and \u00b6 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   {\u00b6 76} In\n   <em>\n    Wagner v.

Appellant assert that the following collection of facts fail to demonstrate willful, wanton, or reckless conduct: (1) Deputy Johnson was traveling in his own lane of travel; (2) Trooper Hoffman's vehicle unpredictably and unforeseeably backed up in Deputy Johnson's lane of travel and blocked Deputy Johnson's lane of travel; (3) the weather was clear and dry; (4) traffic was light; (5) Deputy Johnson activated his lights and sirens; (6) the section of the road where the accident occurred did not contain a traffic control device for traffic traveling on Jackson Pike, as Deputy Johnson\n   was; (7) Deputy Johnson was responding to a fellow officer's call for help, which necessitated a rapid response; (8) Deputy Johnson applied his brakes and attempted to swerve in order to avoid colliding with Trooper Hoffman's cruiser; and (9) Deputy Johnson did not violate departmental policy. Appellants recognize that Deputy Johnson was traveling at a high rate of speed, but argue that speed alone does not sufficiently show that a law enforcement officer willfully, wantonly, or recklessly operated a motor vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   {\u00b6 78} Appellees contend that the following circumstances create genuine issues of material fact as to whether Deputy Johnson willfully, wantonly, and recklessly operated his vehicle: (1) he was traveling over 100 miles per hour; (2) he did not know how fast he was driving; (3) he drove left of the center line; (4) the roadway contained a hill and a curve, which limited Deputy Johnson's visibility of potential traffic in front of him; (5) he was driving over 100 miles per hour while approaching an intersection; (6) he did not know the location of Left Fork Road; (7) he did not have adequate training and experience to be able to control a vehicle traveling over 100 miles per hour; (8) he received a reprimand following the accident; and (9) he did not drive with due regard to the safety of other vehicles traveling upon the roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   {\u00b6 79} As we explain below, we do not believe that reasonable minds could conclude that Deputy Johnson willfully, wantonly, or recklessly operated his motor vehicle. Appellees have not satisfied the \"rigorous\" requirement to show that Deputy Johnson acted willfully, wantonly, or recklessly.\n   <em>\n    Argabrite\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. Thus, they failed to meet their \"onerous\" burden to establish that the political subdivision and Deputy Johnson are not immune from liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    Willful\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   {\u00b6 80} In the case sub judice, we believe that the evidence fails to lead to any reasonable conclusion or inference that Deputy Johnson intentionally deviated from a clear duty or from a definite rule of conduct, that he possessed a deliberate purpose not to discharge some duty necessary to safety, or that he purposefully performed a wrongful act with knowledge or appreciation of the likelihood of resulting injury.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   {\u00b6 81} We first note that appellees have not set forth a clear duty or definite rule of conduct from which Johnson deviated. Appellees presented evidence showing that a law enforcement officer has a duty to operate his motor vehicle with due regard for safety. The standard of \"due regard for safety\" does not clearly or definitively define a precise duty or conduct, however. Rather, it appears to be a flexible concept so that an officer possesses discretion in determining how to respond to calls for help. Indeed, the deposition testimony establishes that law enforcement officers are afforded discretion to determine how to respond to emergency calls. Trooper Fellure explained that the standard means that emergency responders are \"not going to go a hundred miles an hour through a red light,\" but he further stated that there are \"no set rule[s].\" Additionally, Trooper Hoffman stated that law enforcement officers have discretion when determining how to respond to an emergency situation. Trooper Hoffman stated that \"there's no way that they can make a hard [and] fast rule that this is what you're going to do.\" Gallia County Sheriff Joseph R. Browning likewise stated that officers have discretion when determining how to respond to an emergency call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   {\u00b6 82} Furthermore, even though Deputy Johnson intentionally deviated from the speed limit, law enforcement officers are\n   permitted to exceed the speed limit. R.C. 4511.24 (stating that speed limitations do not apply to emergency or public service vehicles responding to an emergency). We observe that the evidence shows that Trooper Hoffman drove in excess of 100 miles per hour in response to Trooper Fellure's call for assistance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Trooper Hoffman testified that he routinely exceeded the speed limit and often traveled over 100 miles per hour. Thus, Trooper Hoffman's testimony shows that no definite rule of conduct prohibited Johnson from traveling over 100 miles per hour in order to assist a fellow officer. Additionally, the record contains no evidence to show that Deputy Johnson violated an established policy by driving 100 miles per hour. Thus, the evidence fails to show that Deputy Johnson intentionally deviated from a clear duty or from a definite rule of conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   {\u00b6 83} For similar reasons, the evidence does not suggest that Deputy Johnson possessed a deliberate purpose not to discharge some duty necessary to safety or that he purposefully did a wrongful act. While obeying the speed limit may be a duty necessary to safety for the ordinary motorist, law enforcement officers are permitted to exceed the speed limit. R.C. 4511.24 ;\n   <em>\n    Byrd\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baum v. Ohio State Hwy.

Thus, Deputy Johnson was permitted to exceed the speed limit. Moreover, although the ordinary motorist might commit a wrongful act by exceeding the speed limit, we again note that law enforcement officers are permitted to exceed the speed limit. Thus, an officer who exceeds the speed limit does not necessarily commit a wrongful act. The evidence in the case at bar fails to show that Deputy Johnson intended to commit a wrongful act by failing to obey the speed limit. Instead, he believed that exceeding the speed limit was an appropriate response to Trooper Fellure's call for help. He thus did not intend to commit a wrongful act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   {\u00b6 84} Consequently, reasonable minds could only conclude that Deputy Johnson did not operate the vehicle in a willful manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <em>\n    Wanton\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   {\u00b6 85} We likewise do not believe that the evidence leads to any reasonable conclusion that Deputy Johnson acted wantonly. The evidence, construed most strongly in appellees' favor, shows the following: (1) at the time of the accident, the weather was cloudy and dry, traffic was light, and it was daylight; (2) the accident occurred on Jackson Pike, on a rural section of the road; (3) driveways and other roadways lined Jackson Pike; (3) Deputy Johnson was familiar with the road upon which the accident occurred but was not entirely certain where the turn for Left Fork Road was located; (3) approximately 1100 feet from the crash site, the road was elevated with a slight curve; (4) once he topped the hill, Deputy Johnson had 1100 feet of visibility to the crash site; (5) Deputy\n   Johnson traveled between 100 and 106 miles per hour while en route to Trooper Fellure's location on a roadway with a posted speed limit of 55 miles per hour; (6) Deputy Johnson activated his vehicle's lights and sirens; (7) Deputy Johnson was traveling in his own lane when he noticed Trooper Hoffman's vehicle backing up in his lane of travel; (8) Deputy Johnson braked and swerved to the left of the center line in an attempt to avoid a collision; (9) Deputy Johnson was traveling between 65 and 74 miles per hour at the time of impact; (10) Deputy Johnson did not admit to disregarding the consequences of his actions, but he did admit, three years after the accident, that he was unsure how fast he was traveling; (11) the evidence is unclear whether Deputy Johnson violated departmental policy, but following the accident, the sheriff \"cautioned [Deputy Johnson] in the future to drive with due care\" and requested that he complete a driving course; (12) Deputy Johnson completed the six-month police academy training in 2007; and (11) Deputy Johnson has been employed as a part-time deputy since 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   {\u00b6 86} The foregoing facts do not suggest a complete absence of care. Deputy Johnson exercised some care by activating his lights and sirens when he responded to Trooper Fellure's call for help, by applying his brakes when he noticed Trooper Hoffman's vehicle blocking Deputy Johnson's lane of travel, and by swerving in an attempt to avoid a collision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Argabrite\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29 (noting that officer activated lights and sirens);\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43 (same);\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30 (observing that officer removed foot from accelerator prior to impact);\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39 (recognizing that officer activated lights and sirens);\n   <em>\n    Bricker\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48 (pointing out that officer activated lights and sirens and braked in attempt to avoid collision);\n   <em>\n    Byrd\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26 (same);\n   <em>\n    Shalkhauser\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29 (noting that officer activated lights and sirens). While Deputy Johnson may have been traveling at a high rate of speed, he stated that he did not believe he was traveling too fast for the road conditions and that he was familiar with the road-including the slight curve or bend and the hill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29 (observing that officer stated he was familiar with road). Deputy Johnson's testimony therefore implies that he gave at least some conscious thought to his speed while he was driving, that he did not believe he was driving in an unsafe manner, and that he did not exhibit an entire absence of care. We also note that recently the Ohio Supreme Court explicitly indicated that high-speed alone does not sufficiently demonstrate wantonness.\n   <em>\n    Argabrite\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   {\u00b6 87} Additionally, Deputy Johnson was not following Trooper Hoffman's vehicle too closely. Instead, the evidence plainly shows that Deputy Johnson lost sight of Trooper Hoffman's vehicle and that he had approximately 1100 feet of distance between his vehicle and Trooper Hoffman's vehicle when he crested the hill shortly before the accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43 (pointing out that officer did not follow vehicle too closely);\n   <em>\n    Shalkhauser\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29 (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   {\u00b6 88} Furthermore, the evidence does not indicate Deputy Johnson knew that driving over 100 miles per hour presented a great probability of harm under the circumstances. At the time of the accident, it was still daylight, the roadway was clear, traffic was light, and the weather was dry.\n   <em>\n    See Argabrite\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Bricker\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Byrd\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Elsass\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Shalkhauser\n   </em>\n   . Deputy Johnson stated that he did not believe he was traveling too fast for the road conditions and that he was familiar with the road on which the accident occurred. Deputy Johnson may not have known the exact location where he needed to turn onto Left Fork Road, but he stated\n   that he had a general idea of where the road was located. Deputy Johnson had not been following Trooper Hoffman too closely. Deputy Johnson had no reason to know that Trooper Hoffman's vehicle would be backing up in Deputy Johnson's lane of travel. Furthermore, even if Deputy Johnson has not undergone the same training as Trooper Hoffman, the record does not contain any evidence that Deputy Johnson was so inadequately trained that he knew he would be unable to control his motor vehicle at a speed over 100 miles per hour.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Instead, the record indicates the opposite: Deputy Johnson stated that he did not believe he was traveling too fast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   {\u00b6 89} We recognize appellees' argument that Deputy Johnson's statement that he did not know how fast he was traveling shows that he did not exercise any care. We do not believe, however, that Deputy Johnson's failure to look at his speedometer to determine his speed shows an absence of care. Even though Deputy Johnson may not know the precise speed at which he was traveling, he explained that he did not believe he was traveling too fast given the road conditions and circumstances. Under the circumstances present in the case at bar, we cannot equate a failure to look at the speedometer with a failure to exercise any care. Consequently, we do not believe that reasonable minds could conclude that Deputy Johnson acted wantonly when responding to Trooper Fellure's call for help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <em>\n    Reckless\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   {\u00b6 90} Additionally, the evidence does not allow reasonable minds to conclude that Deputy Johnson was reckless. Assuming, arguendo, that Johnson consciously disregarded a known risk of harm to another, we cannot conclude that the risk of harm was unreasonable under the circumstances and substantially greater than negligent conduct. Admittedly, Deputy Johnson's speed posed a risk of harm to others. The risk of harm, however, was not unreasonable under the circumstances. Deputy Johnson exceeded the speed limit because he believed a fellow officer needed assistance with multiple individuals who had been involved in a domestic violence situation. We are unable to conclude that an officer who exceeds the speed limit in order to assist a fellow officer necessarily creates an unreasonable risk of harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Byrd\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28 (noting that \"question of unreasonable risks must be weighed in terms of what is acceptable in the context of an emergency run, not ordinary driving conditions\"). Furthermore, we note that the\n   <em>\n    Argabrite\n   </em>\n   court explicitly stated that traveling at a high rate-of-speed does not show recklessness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   {\u00b6 91} Additionally, even if Deputy Johnson violated departmental policy, a violation of departmental policy does not equate to per se recklessness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. Instead, the officer must be conscious that violating departmental policy will in all probability result in injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Without evidence of that knowledge, evidence of a policy violation demonstrates negligence, at best.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As we have already explained, the evidence does not show that Deputy Johnson knew that exceeding the speed limit would in all probability result in injury. While perhaps Deputy Johnson was or should have been aware that his conduct might result in harm, proving that he recklessly\n   disregarded a known or obvious risk of harm to another requires appellees to show more than a mere possibility of injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Toole\n   </em>\n   , 118 Ohio St.3d at 374,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=889%20N.E.2d%20505\">\n    889 N.E.2d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"[r]ecklessness * * * requires something more than mere negligence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   {\u00b6 92} Moreover, we do not agree with appellees that Deputy Johnson's training and experience was so inadequate that his decision to drive over 100 miles per hour created an unreasonable risk of harm. Even if Deputy Johnson did not complete the same driving courses as Trooper Hoffman, nothing in the record shows that the training and he experience he did receive was inadequate. The undisputed evidence shows that he completed his training at the police training academy and worked under supervision after he graduated. Additionally, although appellees claim that Deputy Johnson lacks sufficient experience as a law enforcement officer to be able to drive at speeds over 100 miles per hour, we are unaware of any rule that requires a law enforcement officer to be employed for a certain length of time before the officer may exceed the speed limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   {\u00b6 93} While we recognize that appellees' expert opined that Deputy Johnson acted recklessly, the expert's opinion constitutes a legal conclusion and is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shalkhauser\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. We further note that the expert based his standard of recklessness as applied to an ordinary motorist, not as applied to a law enforcement officer responding to an emergency call.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1737409\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/72/469/#p471\">\n    72 Ohio St.3d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=650%20N.E.2d%201347\">\n    650 N.E.2d 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The expert explained the basis for his opinion as follows: \"One of the things I kind of apply is even on my most liberal analysis, if I were to stop somebody, when I was still a policeman, for a speed that I'm looking at, would I consider giving them a warning? No. You're not getting a warning for going 100 miles an hour in a 55 zone approaching an intersection.\" Moreover, while the expert indicates that Deputy Hoffman was approaching \"an intersection,\" the record does not contain any evidence that the intersection with Left Fork Road contained a traffic control device that required traffic traveling on Jackson Pike, as Deputy Johnson was, to stop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 4511.01(KK) (\" 'Intersection' means: (1) The area embraced within the prolongation or connection of the lateral curb lines, or, if none, the lateral boundary lines of the roadways of two highways that join one another at, or approximately at, right angles, or the area within which vehicles traveling upon different highways that join at any other angle might come into conflict. The junction of an alley or driveway with a roadway or highway does not constitute an intersection unless the roadway or highway at the junction is controlled by a traffic control device.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   {\u00b6 94} In sum, we believe that the case at bar is more similar to those cases in which the courts concluded that the officer did not willfully, wantonly, or recklessly operate his motor vehicle (\n   <em>\n    Argabrite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bricker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Byrd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Elsass\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Shalkhauser\n   </em>\n   ) than to those cases in which the courts determined that genuine issues of material fact remain regarding the officer's level of culpability (\n   <em>\n    Hardesty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   ). Unlike\n   <em>\n    Hardesty\n   </em>\n   , in the case at bar, the evidence fails to indicate that Deputy Johnson drove over 100 miles per hour on a roadway with a posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour, during heavy traffic and during rush hour; and that he failed to activate his siren or to maintain a safe distance between his car and Trooper Hoffman's vehicle. Instead, Deputy Johnson drove over 100 miles per hour on a rural stretch of road with a posted speed limit of 55 miles per hour during light traffic; and he activated his lights and\n   sirens and did not follow Trooper Hoffman too closely. Furthermore, unlike the officer in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   , Deputy Johnson activated his lights and sirens. Additionally, unlike the officer in\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   , Deputy Johnson was familiar with the road upon which the accident occurred, he maintained a safe distance, and he did not admit to disregarding the consequences of his actions. Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   , the officer pursued a motorcyclist at speeds over 100 miles per hour for a relatively minor traffic infraction (alleged driving under suspension). In the case sub judice, however, Deputy Johnson traveled at speeds over 100 miles per hour based upon his belief that a fellow officer needed help containing multiple suspects involved in a domestic violence situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   {\u00b6 95} In the case at bar, just as in\n   <em>\n    Argabrite\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   , the evidence shows that Deputy Johnson traveled at a high rate-of-speed, but also like the officers in\n   <em>\n    Argabrite\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   , he did so during daylight or well-lit conditions, when traffic was light, and with his lights and sirens activated.
