They later discovered black mold in various locations in their house. Subsequent home inspections uncovered what they described as \"numerous problems with the home\" that caused water penetration. They brought suit against the builder of the house, defendant-appellee NVR, Inc., d.b.a. Ryan Homes, Inc. They alleged Ryan Homes fraudulently designed the house, was grossly negligent in building the house, and concealed these facts, with the result being water infiltration and the formation of black mold that proximately caused their health issues. The Minayas also brought claims against defendant-appellee city of Strongsville (the \"city\") alleging that it did not inspect the house before issuing a certificate of occupancy and was otherwise negligent in failing to inspect the house. The counts against both defendants sought an award of punitive damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Ryan Homes filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on grounds that the house was built in 1988 and the Minayas' claims, filed in 2015, were barred by the ten-year statute of repose. The city filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings claiming that it was immune from suit, owed no duty of care to the Minayas, and that it could not be liable for punitive damages. The court granted both motions and this appeal followed. The two assignments of error challenge both the dismissal in favor of Ryan Homes and judgment on the pleadings in favor of the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. Motion to Dismiss\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The basis for Ryan Homes' motion to dismiss was that the Minayas' claims were barred by the ten-year statute of repose in R.C. 2305.131 because the company built the home in 1988 and that the Minayas did not bring their claims until 2015. Ryan Homes acknowledged that the Minayas pleaded fraud, a cause of action that is outside the statute of repose, but maintained that the Minayas did not plead their fraud claim with the requisite particularity and, in any event, that Ryan Homes made no representations of any kind to the Minayas, who it claimed were at least the third owners of the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Civ.R. 12(B)(6) states that a complaint is not subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle the plaintiff to relief.\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

With respect to damages for bodily injury arising out of defective and unsafe conditions of an improvement to real property, no cause of action shall accrue \"later than ten years from the date of substantial completion or improvement.\" R.C. 2305.131(A)(1). The intent behind R.C. 2305.131 is, among other things, to recognize that after the completion of the construction of an improvement to real property, builders lack control over the improvement and have no ability to maintain the premises, lack control over the effects that weather might have to the improvement, and that it would place an unacceptable burden on builders to maintain records and other documentation pertaining to design and construction for a period in excess of ten years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 3(B) of S.B. 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} There is an exception to the affirmative defense of the statute of repose that exists \"if the defendant engages in fraud in regard to furnishing the design, planning, supervision of construction, or construction of an improvement to real property * * *.\" R.C. 2305.131(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The Minayas brought two causes of against Ryan Homes: Count 1 alleged fraudulent concealment; Count 2 alleged \"gross negligence and negligence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} With respect to Count 2, we agree that this claim is barred by the statute of repose because it does not make any allegation of fraud that would take it outside the statute of repose. Count 2 alleges that \"Defendant Ryan Homes owed plaintiffs a duty to exercise due care and caution and to build and develop the subject property in a prudent and workmanlike manner.\" Complaint at \u00b6 84. The Minayas alleged that Ryan Homes breached this duty by building the house in a \"negligent and unworkmanlike manner\" that allowed the house to become environmentally contaminated. Complaint at \u00b6 86-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The allegations in Count 2 are simple negligence claims of a kind that are specifically encompassed by the statute of repose. In fact, the Minayas appear to concede implicitly that Count 2 is subject to the statute of repose because their brief in opposition to Ryan Homes' motion to dismiss does not address this count at all. Given the plain reading of the complaint and the Minayas' failure to make any argument against dismissal, we concluded that the court did not err by dismissing Count 2 as being subject to the statute of repose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} With respect to Count 1 and the fraudulent concealment cause of action, the Minayas concede that Ryan Homes finished building the house in 1988 and their claims relating to the construction of the house would ordinarily be barred by the statute of repose. Complaint at \u00b6 64. However, they assert that they pleaded a claim of fraudulent concealment to which the statute of repose does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} We agree with Ryan Homes, however, that the Minayas failed to plead their fraudulent concealment claim with the kind of particularity required by Civ.R. 9(B). That rules states that \"[i]n all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.\" In the context of pleading fraud, the word \"particularity\" means that the pleading must contain allegations of fact which tend to show each and every element of a cause of action for fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    CitiMortgage, Inc. v.

The Minayas further alleged that Ryan Homes purposely hid these housing code violations \"in places in which others could not readily investigate or inspect, such as behind drywall, or in the underground piping.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Missing from Count 1 is an allegation that Ryan Homes made any false statements or failed to disclose any material fact. What the Minayas did claim was that Ryan Homes \"acted with the intent to mislead the purchasers of the home, in that these defects were so egregious logic deems they could not possibly all be honest mistakes, and that said defects were items that would not expose themselves or their consequences until a quantity of time passed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74. The Minayas reassert the same logical proposition with respect to the location of the negligence: \"Logic dictates since the defects concealed were located in areas not readily available to inspect or investigate, Ryan Homes intended for all purchasers of the home to rely on the fraudulent concealment when purchasing the home, not just the original purchaser.\" Complaint at \u00b6 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Allegations in a complaint must be supported by facts.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v. Lawson Milk Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1415451\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/40/190/#p193\">\n    40 Ohio St.3d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=532%20N.E.2d%20753\">\n    532 N.E.2d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). The Minayas did not rely on specific facts to support their cause of action for fraudulent concealment, but invoked logic to allege that Ryan Homes' negligence in designing and building the house was so pervasive that it must have intended to make the mistakes it did and then must have intentionally covered up those mistakes. This is a form of causal reductionism: the Minayas conclusion that Ryan Homes acted intentionally because there were so many defects in the house fails to account for other possibilities that did not require intentional action. The many defects alleged in the house may have been mere coincidence or gross ineptitude. One cannot infer intent to commit fraud based solely on the assertion that the errors allegedly committed were so numerous as to be intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The same rationale applies to the Minayas' argument that Ryan Homes purposely hid its negligence in order to avoid detection. Notably, the alleged building code violations consisted of improperly installed insulation, piping, or electrical systems. We agree with Ryan Homes that \"[i]t would be an odd home indeed if the piping, electrical systems, insulation and related elements about which Plaintiffs complain were open to view.\" Motion to dismiss at 8. That the alleged defects were located in places concealed from direct examination does not permit the inference\n   that Ryan Homes fraudulently concealed them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} A party cannot avoid the statute of repose by \"clever pleading\" that attempts to transform a negligence claim into a fraud claim.\n   <em>\n    Mardis v.

The Minayas claim that Ryan Homes made representations concerning a concealed, material fact. It is undisputed that the Minayas, being at least the third owners of the house, had no actual contact with Ryan Homes that induced them to purchase the house. \"A plaintiff fails to state a valid cause of action for fraud when he alleges that a third-party relied on misrepresentations made by a defendant and that he suffered injury from that third-party's reliance.\"\n   <em>\n    Moses v.

With the city's immunity presumptively established, we next determine whether there are any exceptions to immunity listed in R.C. 2744.02(B). None of the exceptions to immunity apply: the Minayas' claims against the city did not involve the operation of a motor vehicle; were not caused by a city employee's negligent performance with respect to a proprietary function; did not involve injury caused by the negligent failure to keep roads in repair; did not occur on the grounds of buildings used in connection with a governmental function; and liability was not expressly imposed on the city under another section of the Revised Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)-(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The Minayas argue that the employee who conducted the housing inspection acted in bad faith or in a wanton or reckless manner, so the city is not immune under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b).

R.C. 2744.03(A) sets forth several defenses or immunities that may be asserted by a political subdivision or an employee to establish nonliability. Among those defenses are that the political subdivision is immune from liability if the injury\n   resulted from the exercise of judgment or discretion in using personnel, unless the judgment or discretion was exercised \"with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\" R.C. 2744.03(A)(5).

In other words, R.C. 2744.03(A)(5) applies only if one of the exceptions to immunity set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B) exists.\n   <em>\n    Caraballo v. Cleveland Metro.

The safety of buildings is a concern not only for the owners, but for the occupants of those buildings and any neighboring structures.
