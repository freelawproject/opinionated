We conclude that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We draw the facts from the summary judgment record and note where they are disputed. When Wesley Oprzedek, as trustee of the Oprzedek Realty Trust, purchased 68 Dane Street in the city of Beverly (city) in 2009 for $875,000, the property had been operated as a lodging house, authorized by annually renewed licenses since 1939. The trustee continued to operate the property as a lodging house and applied to the city for and was granted the required annual lodging licenses for 2010, 2011, and 2012. He spent in excess of $250,000 to renovate and repair the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The parties agree that \"[a]t the time the [t]rust invested in the [the property], [the trustee] reasonably believed that [he] would be able to continue to use the property for the purpose intended and for which it had been used for a [seventy-five] year period, specifically a rooming house.\" When, in November, 2012, the trustee applied for a lodging license for 2013, the city renewed the license for only ninety days even though the applicant was in \"general compliance with building, health and [e]lectrical requirements.\" His subsequent application dated February 28, 2013, was denied on March 25, 2013. The trustee did not appeal from that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On July 16, 2014, the trustee reapplied for a lodging license but after a hearing on October 14, 2014, the city denied the application. The trustee's complaint alleges on information and belief that the denial was the result of political and neighborhood pressure. The minutes of the city council meeting note that councilors \"were opposed to issuing a license due to past issues\" and that the owner had not complied with CORI\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and SORB\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   checks of tenants. The city's committee on legal affairs recommended that the city council deny the license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trustee alleges that he explored other potential uses of the property but they were not viable. He alleges that the value of the property with a lodging house license was $950,000. On October 7, 2015, the trustee sold the property for $659,000. Before the sale was completed, the city granted the new owner a lodging license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trustee did appeal from the 2014 denial pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 30, and included a regulatory taking claim and an interference with existing and prospective contractual relations claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   A Superior Court judge granted summary judgment to the city. In his summary judgment memorandum, the judge noted that the trustee disputes the allegations regarding his noncompliance with SORB and CORI checks, and the judge therefore did not consider those allegations for summary judgment purposes. He dismissed the claim under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 30, as moot because it sought an order compelling the board to issue a lodging license to the trustee but he had sold the property. Applying the analysis set forth in\n   <em>\n    Penn Central Transp. Co\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    New York City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769262\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/104/#p124\">\n    438 U.S. 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 124 (1978) (\n   <em>\n    Penn Central\n   </em>\n   ), the judge also denied the taking claim. He concluded that (i) the summary judgment record did not establish a sufficient decrease in value to support a regulatory taking claim, (ii) the trustee's expectation of receiving a renewed license each year did not give rise to vested rights in a license and, therefore, he was entitled only to fair treatment; and (iii) the character of the governmental action consisted of a discretionary denial of a requested license and was not a physical invasion of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . On appeal, the trustee does not challenge the motion judge's conclusion that his G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 30, appeal from the denial of a lodging license is moot because the property has since been sold, and he does not pursue the license denial issue. The only issue before us, therefore, is whether denial of the trustee's license applications constituted a regulatory taking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   It is not entirely clear that the trustee has a property interest compensable under the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment and art. 10 in the renewal of a lodging license that must be renewed annually and is nontransferable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Carney\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Attorney Gen\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788624\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/803/#p816\">\n    451 Mass. 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 816 (2008), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Members of the Peanut Quota Holders Assn\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939764,702815\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/421/1323/\">\n    421 F.3d 1323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1331 (Fed.

Here, the city made a determination to deny this particular applicant a license. It did not enact a city-wide prohibition of lodging houses or prohibit any other owner of this property from obtaining a license. We have said in the context of college dormitories, which fall within the definition of \"lodging houses\" in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 22, that \"[a] dormitory license may be denied because the facilities are physically inadequate, because the applicant institution has a bad record in running dormitories, or because supervisors are unqualified, or of bad character.\"\n   <em>\n    Trustees of Boston Univ\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Licensing Bd. of Boston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994713\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/24/475/#p477\">\n    24 Mass.
