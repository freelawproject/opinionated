On appeal, he maintains that the judge erred in: (1) assigning his ex-wife, Hemalatha Frasca (wife), thirty-five percent of any future inheritances he may receive; (2) failing to consider the wife's interest in a property located in India; and (3) awarding his personal property to the wife. We vacate in part and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The parties were married for roughly thirty-four years. After both spouses filed for divorce, the consolidated complaints came before a judge of the Probate and Family Court, and the judge found the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The parties lived an upper middle class life-style, funded in large part by the husband's mother. Among other things, the husband's mother provided a home in Boston for them to live in, bought them an investment property in California, and paid for their children's private schooling from preschool through college. The husband holds a Ph.D. and has taught at many prestigious universities, while the wife earned a general education diploma (GED) and has not been employed outside the home. At the time of their divorce proceedings, the husband's mother was paying for him to live in a retirement community, and the wife was living in the marital home rent free. The judge found that the wife was completely financially dependent on the husband and his family's wealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Future inheritance\n   </em>\n   . The husband contends that because he had no vested interest in an inheritance at the time of the divorce, the judge's assignment of any future inheritance constituted an abuse of discretion, requiring reversal. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 34, provides \"for the equitable division of the property interests of partners in a marriage.\"\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5744557\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/19/364/#p369\">\n    19 Mass.

When reviewing a divorce judgment, we examine (1) whether the judge considered all the factors outlined in \u00a7 34 when dividing the marital assets; and (2) whether the judge's reasoning is apparent from the findings and rulings.

App. Ct. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264 (1993). Here, when allocating the marital property, it was well within the judge's discretion to consider the high probability that the husband would inherit from his still-living mother at some point in the future. It was error, however, to assign the wife thirty-five percent of any future inheritances that the husband may receive. See\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5744557\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/19/364/#p369\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (husband's expectancy under still-living mother's will was not part of marital estate).

The husband also contends that the trial judge erred in failing to find that the wife owned property in India.

The appellant bears the burden of showing that a finding of fact is clearly erroneous.

The resolution of conflicting testimony was for the judge, who explicitly credited the wife's testimony that she did not own the land. See\n   <em>\n    Baccanti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Morton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1080030\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/434/787/#p790\">\n    434 Mass. 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 790-791 (2001). The judge's factual findings were not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Personal property\n   </em>\n   . Lastly, the husband takes issue with the portion of the judgment that provides for each party to \"retain ... all personal property ... presently in their possession.\" He maintains that the judge erroneously granted the wife his academic work and papers, because she has no interest in them. At the time of the divorce, his possessions were in the marital home with the wife.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The husband testified about these personal possessions, but the judge made no explicit findings, nor provided any rationale for her decision to grant \"all\" personal property to the wife. The record is devoid of evidence or rationale to support the award with respect to the academic papers. On remand, the judge should once again consider the disposition of the husband's academic papers and provide written findings.
