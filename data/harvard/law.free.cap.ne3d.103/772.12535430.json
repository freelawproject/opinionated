Upon arrival, he observed a black sedan straddling the double-yellow line in the middle of Granite Street and debris on the road between the car and a visibly damaged telephone pole. The vehicle had major front-end damage on the passenger side, was leaking fluids, and all of the airbags had deployed. The defendant, who was two or three feet away from the car when Eng arrived, told him that she had been driving because her friend was too drunk to drive. The friend, a young woman who was the registered owner of the vehicle, was curled up in a fetal position in the back seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendant had bloodshot eyes, and a moderate odor of alcohol emanated from her breath. Her speech was \"thick tongue[d] and slurred,\" as she bounced back and forth between topics of conversation with Eng. On her way into the police station, the defendant was stumbling and unsteady on her feet. Once at the station, Eng asked the defendant to count backwards from fifty-seven to forty-two. She agreed to take the test, but did not count backwards in numerical order. At trial, when asked his opinion of the defendant's sobriety, Eng opined that \"she was intoxicated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the evidence\n   </em>\n   . \"When reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty, 'we consider the evidence introduced at trial in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, and determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20377\">\n    92 Mass.
