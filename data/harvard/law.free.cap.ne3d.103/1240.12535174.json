L. c. 209A as well as the order denying her motion to vacate that order. She contends that (1) there was insufficient evidence to support the 209A order, and (2) the District Court judge violated her due process rights by failing to provide her with a meaningful opportunity to challenge the plaintiff's evidence. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   There are two substantial procedural defects in this case that preclude our evaluation of the merits of the defendant's claims. First, the defendant has failed to provide us with an adequate appellate record, as is her burden. See Mass.R.A.P. 18(a), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=425%20Mass.%201602\">\n    425 Mass. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). In particular, we note the absence of a transcript from the hearing after notice. Without such a transcript, we can neither weigh the sufficiency of the evidence against the defendant, nor evaluate the adequacy of the process she received in the lower court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Shawmut Community Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zagami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1418684\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/30/371/#p372\">\n    30 Mass.

App. Ct. 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84 (1995) (lacking an adequate transcript, \"we are unable to address the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence\"). Second, as far as we can tell, the defendant failed to make her due process argument in the District Court and, therefore, it is not properly before us on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    NES Rentals\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maine Drilling &amp; Blasting, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275184\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/465/856/\">\n    465 Mass. 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860 n.8 (2013) (argument raised for first time on appeal is waived).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Notwithstanding the procedural shortcomings in the appellate record, we have reviewed the limited record before us.
