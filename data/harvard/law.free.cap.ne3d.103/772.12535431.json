The scope of the judge's inquiry may include any relevant statutes, the deeds to the properties in question, and the manual and by-laws at issue.\n   <em>\n    Fortin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"819066\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/416/781/#p786\">\n    416 Mass. 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 786 (1994).

However where, as the judge concluded in the order here, his inquiry will not \"intrude into the religious beliefs and practices of the church,\" it avoids such prohibited entanglement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Once the judge makes this initial determination, neutral principles of law can be applied to determine who, under the controlling document, may properly act as the church's agent to pursue summary judgment and obtain possession of the properties. At oral argument, counsel for the church conceded that the manual contains nothing that would require the judge to conduct a religious evaluation and stated that he \"honestly d[id] not know\" whether the by-laws contain any ecclesiastical doctrine that would call for such an evaluation. Church by-laws, however, are considered \"a contract between the church and its members, and are interpreted according to principles of contract law.\"\n   <em>\n    General Convention of the New Jerusalem in the United States of America, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    MacKenzie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3816887\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/832/#p835\">\n    449 Mass. 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 835 (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We remand the matter to the Housing Court for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum and order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Remanded.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    The church brought two summary process complaints: the first against Anita Christmas and Andrea Christmas on December 23, 2013, and the second against Frances and Otto on September 1, 2014.
