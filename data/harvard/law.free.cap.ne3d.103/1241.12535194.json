At trial, however, the victim repudiated the affidavit and, consistent with her earlier statements, she reiterated her original statements to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned the victim regarding a recent charge of operating while under the influence and whether the charge incentivized her to curry favor with the prosecution. It was after this claim of recent bias that the judge permitted the responding officers to testify to the victim's statements on the night of her 911 telephone call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A witness's pending criminal charges are classic sources of bias in favor of the prosecution. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DiMuro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3999155\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/28/223/#p228\">\n    28 Mass. App. Ct. 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228 (1990). Accordingly, defense counsel's cross-examination opened the door to the admission of the prior consistent statements the victim gave to police before \"the motive to act out of bias arose.\"\n   <em>\n    Kindell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772009\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/44/200/#p203\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772009\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/44/200/#p203\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   There was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    911 telephone call\n   </em>\n   . We also see no merit to the defendant's hearsay challenge to the admission of the victim's 911 telephone call. Hearsay is admissible as a spontaneous utterance \"if (1) there is an occurrence or event 'sufficiently startling to render inoperative the normal reflective thought processes of the observer,' and (2) if the declarant's statement was 'a spontaneous reaction to the occurrence or event and not the result of reflective thought.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"735003\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/437/620/#p623\">\n    437 Mass. 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 623 (2002), quoting from 2 McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 272, at 204 (J.W. Strong ed., 5th ed. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The 911 telephone call here satisfies both of these prongs. First, the victim's report of fleeing from an attack meets the test for a startling event. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nunes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1157258\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/430/1/#p4\">\n    430 Mass. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4 (1999) (\"The statement itself may be taken as proof of the exciting event\");\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hartnett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277036\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/72/467/\">\n    72 Mass. App. Ct. 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 475 &amp; n.13 (2008) (assault and battery a sufficiently startling event). Second, the fact that the victim was hiding in the bushes and tentative to come out from hiding when she made the telephone call shows that she was still under the influence of the startling event. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"289708\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/364/211/#p223\">\n    364 Mass. 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223 (1973) (no required time between event and statement; each case decided on its own facts).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Medical records\n   </em>\n   . Last, the defendant claims that admission of redacted emergency medical technician (EMT) reports and hospital records relating the victim's statements as to how she got her injuries were improperly admitted. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, patient records kept by hospitals under G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 70, \"shall be admissible ... as evidence ... so far as such records relate to the treatment and medical history of such cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Bouchie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"332065\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/376/524/#p527\">\n    376 Mass. 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527 (1978), quoting from G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79. This statute applies to EMT reports as well as proper hospital records. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Palacios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461256\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/90/722/#p726\">\n    90 Mass. App. Ct. 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 726-727 (2016). Because we construe \u00a7 79\"liberally,\" medical records are admissible \"even though incidentally the facts recorded may have some bearing on the question of liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ackerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20Mass.%201033\">\n    476 Mass. 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1034 (2017), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dargon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4268743\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/457/387/#p394\">\n    457 Mass. 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 394 (2010). Furthermore, \"fact-specific references to the reported cause of [a patient's] injuries are part of her medical history and are relevant to treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DiMonte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310314\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/233/#p242\">\n    427 Mass. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242 (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Here, although the medical records contained the victim's statements that she was attacked and \"strangled,\" they were admissible. First, the cause of the victim's injuries, including that they resulted from strangulation, was admissible treatment evidence. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310314\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/233/#p242\">\n     ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310314\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/233/#p242\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Furthermore, even if the cause of her injuries was inadmissible, where the victim properly testified to the nature of the attack, including that she was strangled, the admission of the challenged evidence \"did not prejudice the defendant [in light of it being] merely cumulative of properly admitted evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barbosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684968\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/116/#p130\">\n    463 Mass. 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 130 (2012), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310260\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/336/#p348\">\n    427 Mass. 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 348 (1998).
