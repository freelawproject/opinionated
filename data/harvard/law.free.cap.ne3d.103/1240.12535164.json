App. Ct. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43 (2005). The judge specifically credited the testimony of the four Springfield police officers who testified at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On July 1, 2015, Springfield police officers were dispatched to a residence based on a report of a fight there, involving seven or eight people. As he approached, Officer Chad Joseph observed people running through the front door of the residence and also saw neighbors pointing towards the residence. Joseph was familiar with the location based on a number of prior incidents involving drug violations and domestic abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In front of the residence, Joseph observed a woman who was bleeding from the mouth. Joseph spoke to her and noticed that she was shaking, frantic, and her speech was difficult to understand. She stated that \"they beat me up\" and pointed to the residence. At this time, backup had arrived, and at least four officers approached the residence. As they stood outside the residence, the officers could hear people running upstairs. The officers knocked on the front door and when it was opened, the officers stated their intention to enter the home and conduct a protective sweep; they did not seek nor were they given consent to enter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Several officers then entered the residence and proceeded to conduct a protective sweep of the entire house in search of other injured parties or assailants. Joseph went to the second floor with Officers Williams and Dyer. The officers approached a door at the top of the stairs that was closed and locked. They heard footsteps behind the door and what sounded like an item being dragged across the floor. After knocking and announcing themselves several times, the officers ordered that the door be opened upon threat of kicking it down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following these repeated commands, the defendant opened the door. Joseph secured the defendant and removed him from the residence pending completion of the protective sweep. Williams and Dyer then entered the room, which appeared to be a bedroom; no people were found in the room. Williams then opened a closet door in the room and in the closet the officers immediately saw a large plastic cooler with the lid open. Inside the cooler were unsecured handguns, a stun gun, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. Subsequent investigation revealed that the defendant and his brother, Munir Qadir, shared the bedroom, and neither was authorized to possess ammunition, firearms, or stun guns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judge denied the defendant's motion to suppress, finding that the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The defendant maintains that the judge erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence from the warrantless search because the officers were not confronting a situation that came within the emergency aid exception. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement \"applies when the purpose of the police entry is not to gather evidence of criminal activity but rather, because of an emergency, to respond to an immediate need for assistance for the protection of life or property.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Snell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651221\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/428/766/#p774\">\n    428 Mass. 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774, cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248194,1248226,1248418,1248259,1248393,1248079,1248306,1248021,1248286,1248537,1248538,1248315,1248124,1248190\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/1010/\">\n    527 U.S. 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3999720\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/28/217/#p219\">\n    28 Mass.

We agree. The officers were familiar with the residence because of prior domestic abuse and drug issues. Upon arriving, the officers observed an injured female who was unable to provide detailed information apart from indicating that her assailant(s) were inside the residence. The officers also saw several people flee into the residence as the police arrived, and neighbors were pointing to the residence. Under these circumstances, it was reasonable for the officers to believe that an emergency existed inside the residence and to enter for the purpose of locating additional injured parties or to quell further violence inside. See\n   <em>\n    ibid\n   </em>\n   ., quoting from\n   <em>\n    Michigan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639144\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/45/#p49\">\n    558 U.S. 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (2009) (\" 'Officers do not need ironclad proof of \"a likely serious, life-threatening\" injury to invoke the emergency aid exception.' ... It suffices that there are objectively reasonable grounds to believe that emergency aid might be needed\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Having concluded that the entry was justified, we turn to the second requirement of the emergency aid exception: that the conduct of the police following the entry must be reasonable in the circumstances, which here means a search for possible victims and assailants. See\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657557\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/453/818/#p823\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657557\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/453/818/#p823\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Contrary to the defendant's contention, there was no evidence to suggest that the police used the perceived emergency as a pretext to conduct a search of the premises. Once inside the residence, the scope of the sweep was reasonable as it was limited to areas where a person could be located and was brief in duration. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657557\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/453/818/#p823\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657557\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/453/818/#p823\">\n    . at 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The protective sweep was limited in scope to a cursory inspection for a [perpetrator] or victim, and reflected the officers' lawful purpose in entering the house and conducting the sweep\"). Upon opening the closet door in furtherance of this lawful purpose the officers observed handguns, a stun gun, and multiple rounds of ammunition in plain view. The defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Motion for required findings of not guilty\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant next argues that the judge erred in denying his motion for required findings of not guilty because there was insufficient evidence that the defendant had constructive possession of the firearms and ammunition found in the closet, and insufficient evidence of unlawful storage of a firearm. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In determining the sufficiency of the evidence at trial, we apply the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Latimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p677\">\n    378 Mass. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677-678 (1979), that is, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, \"whether any rational fact finder could have found all essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3898701\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/81/836/#p839\">\n    81 Mass.

There was sufficient evidence to support the convictions of the crimes of possession of firearms and ammunition without a license beyond a reasonable doubt. Because the incriminating evidence was found in the bedroom closet, and not on the defendant himself, the Commonwealth had to prove that the defendant had constructive possession of the items. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Boria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1346413\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/440/416/#p418\">\n    440 Mass. 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 418 (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To prove constructive possession, the Commonwealth must show \"knowledge coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brzezinski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882480\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/405/401/#p409\">\n    405 Mass. 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 409 (1989), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3979472\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/17/495/#p498\">\n    17 Mass.

Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Frongillo\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was present at the residence-and in the room-where the firearms were located. There was evidence from which the jury could infer that he fled to that room, locked the door, and dragged a cooler containing the firearms to the closet. The defendant also ignores that constructive possession may be joint. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"819078\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/416/279/#p284\">\n    416 Mass. 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 284 (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Unlawful storage of firearms\n   </em>\n   .
