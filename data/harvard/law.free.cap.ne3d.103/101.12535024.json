On appeal, Appellants contend that 1) the trial court committed reversible error by granting Appellees' motion to reconsider judgment after granting judgment pursuant to the hearing on the merits; 2) the trial court committed reversible error by reversing its own judgment and ignoring the local rules regarding the preparation and filing of judgment entries; 3) the trial court committed reversible error by granting judgment that ignored proper motion procedure for filing of motions; 4) the trial court committed reversible error by improperly applying the doctrine of stare decisis; and 5) the trial court committed reversible error by finding judgment against Appellants with respect to plaintiffs who had been dismissed with prejudice prior to the hearing on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Because the entry appealed from does not constitute a final appealable order, we lack jurisdiction to review the merits of this appeal. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellants, John Wharton and University Off Campus Housing, are the owners of residential property located at 82 \u00bd N. Court Street, Athens, Ohio. The premises was rented by Appellees, Catherine Ibold, Halle Simonetti, Alexandra Dighero, as well as three others who were previously dismissed with prejudice from this litigation, Hanna Hrach, Alyson Rowe and Sarah Leach. According to the written lease, the lease term began May 11, 2014, and ended May 2, 2015. On February 4, 2016, Appellees, along with Hanna Hrach, Alyson Rowe and Sarah Leach, filed a complaint in the Small Claims Division of Athens County Municipal Court alleging wrongful withholding of a security deposit by the landlord, in the amount of $1,632.00 for non-discounted rent, $329.00 for cleaning and $242.00 for damages. Without going into details that are not pertinent to our disposition of this matter on appeal, the litigation involved a discounted rent provision in the lease which provided that the six tenants were entitled to discounted rent for each installment if they paid in full on or before the third day of April, August and December during the lease term. A problem arose when Catherine Ibold did not pay her August rent installment until August 4, 2014, which prompted a disqualification of rent letter to be sent to the tenants advising them they owed an additional $1.632.00 by August 20, 2014. The case was subsequently transferred to the Civil Court docket of the Athens Municipal Court. The litigation proceeded through discovery, with original plaintiffs, Hanna Hrach, Alyson Rowe and Sarah Leach being dismissed with prejudice at their request prior to a bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} After hearing the evidence and testimony presented, the trial court orally ruled, on the record in open court, in favor of Appellants on December 1, 2016. Appellees filed a motion for reconsideration on December 2, 2016, referencing a decision of the court issued twelve years prior which involved John Wharton. Appellants filed a memorandum in opposition to Appellees' motion for reconsideration on December 8, 2016. Later in the day on December 8, 2016, the trial court issued a decision and journal entry vacating its prior verbal order and granting judgment in favor of Appellees. Appellants thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration, to which Appellees objected and the trial court denied. It is from the trial court's December 8, 2016, written order that Appellants now bring their appeal, setting forth five assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"I. THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR BY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   GRANTING PLAINTIFFS/APPELLEES' MOTION TO RECONSIDER JUDGMENT AFTER GRANTING JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO THE HEARING ON THE MERITS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.

THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR BY GRANTING JUDGMENT THAT IGNORED PROPER MOTION PROCEDURE FOR FILING OF MOTIONS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   IV. THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR BY IMPROPERLY APPLYING THE DOCTRINE OF STARE DECISIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   V. THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR BY FINDING JUDGMENT AGAINST DEFENDANT/APPELLANTS WITH RESPECT TO PLAINTIFFS WHO HAD BEEN DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE PRIOR TO THE HEARING ON THE MERITS.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In their first assignment of error, Appellants contend that the trial court committed reversible error by granting Appellees' motion to reconsider judgment after granting judgment pursuant to the hearing on the merits. Appellants essentially argue that the trial court's oral pronouncement of judgment in their favor at the conclusion of the bench trial constituted a final appealable order and that, as such, Appellees' subsequently-filed motion for reconsideration was a nullity because motions for reconsideration are not provided for by the Rules of Civil Procedure. Appellees respond by arguing that the trial court's oral pronouncement of judgment was not a final order and that the trial court had jurisdiction to consider the motion for reconsideration before a final judgment had been entered. Based upon the following, we agree with Appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In\n   <em>\n    Pitts v.

Absent an attorney fee request under specific authority, appellate courts should \"treat the fee request as having been overruled sub silento\" when not specifically disposed of in the trial court's order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205265674\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, we have historically dismissed appeals for lack of a final, appealable order when a trial court specifically 1) raises the attorney issue and defers its adjudication, or 2) awards attorney fees and defers the determination of the amount of fees.\n   <em>\n    Jones v. McAlarney\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Here, Appellees not only requested an award of attorney fees in their prayer for relief, they specifically sought an award of attorney fees as part of their claim, alleging they were entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees pursuant to R.C. 5321.16 (C). R.C. 5321.16 titled \"Security deposits; interest; forfeiture; procedures\" provides as follows in section (C):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"If the landlord fails to comply with division (B) of this section, the tenant may recover the property and money due him, together with damages in an amount equal to the amount wrongfully withheld, and reasonable attorney fees.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Thus, the claim for reasonable attorney fees herein was pursuant to a specific statute and not merely a pro forma request contained in the prayer for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 15} A review of the record and particularly the journalized entry reveals that the trial court did not fully dispose of the claim for reasonable attorney fees. It appears the failure to dispose of this claim occurred as a result, at least in part, of the unusual manner in which the trial court disposed of the case. As set forth above, at the conclusion of the bench trial on the merits, the trial court decided in favor of Appellants and made an oral pronouncement on the record. Because the trial court decided in favor of Appellants, additional testimony and evidence regarding Appellees' attorney fee claim was not offered at that time. However, because the trial court ultimately changed its disposition of the matter and a written judgment entry was subsequently journalized in favor of Appellees, the attorney fee claim became pertinent. The trial court's December 8, 2016, \"Decision and Journal Entry\" stated as follows, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"Judgment is granted in favor of plaintiffs in the amount of $3,264 ($1,632 for withheld portion of security deposit with mandatory double damages). Plaintiffs' requested attorney fees as the rate of $150/hour, but did not present evidence of counsel's time spent on the case, thus the Court cannot grant attorney fees\n   <em>\n    at this time.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thus, the trial court did not dismiss or deny Appellees' claim for reasonable attorney fees, it merely stated it could not grant the claim \"at this time.\" We conclude the procedural history of this case, coupled with the trial court's use of the phrase \"at this time,\" indicates the trial court anticipated future action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinette v. Bryant, supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 18 (\"The trial court neither granted nor denied Robinette's motion. Instead, it deferred the matter for later resolution pending Robinette's provision of supporting authority for the award. By not deciding the merits of the motion, the trial court failed to enter a final appealable order as defined by R.C. 2505.02.\") (internal citations omitted). We conclude that our reasoning is bolstered by the fact the trial court titled its entry a\n   \"Decision and Judgment Entry\" and did not indicate anywhere in the document that the entry was a final appealable order, nor did it include Civ.R. 54(B) language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Because the trial court's order specifically raised, but failed to fully determine the issue of damages, specifically attorney fees which were requested in Appellants' initial complaint, the judgment clearly contemplated further action by the court and therefore is not a final appealable order.\n   <em>\n    Fagan v. Boggs\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14 ; citing\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Assur. Inc, v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8 ; citing\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

We note, incidentally, that the trial court's entry also did not assess court costs. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal because we lack of jurisdiction to consider it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    APPEAL DISMISSED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Harsha, J.: Concurs with Concurring Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Hoover, J.: Concurs in Judgment Only.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-46\">\n   Harsha, J., concurring:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 17} I concur in judgment and opinion but conclude any language that can be construed as directly addressing the merits of the first assignment of error is purely dicta.
