We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . On June 2, 2016, the plaintiff\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a complaint in the Superior Court alleging that the defendant's negligence caused her to sustain injuries in a June 4, 2013, fall on the grounds of Boston Children's Hospital. Under Mass.R.Civ.P. 4(j), the plaintiff was required to serve the complaint upon the defendant within ninety days, on or before August 31, 2016. On August 8, 2016, plaintiff sent the summons and complaint to the Suffolk County sheriff's department (sheriff) for service; on August 17, the sheriff notified the plaintiff that she had improperly addressed the summons to herself. The same day, the plaintiff sent the sheriff the complaint and a corrected summons. The documents were accompanied by a letter requesting that the sheriff \"[k]indly effectuate service on the defendant as soon as possible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The sheriff did not serve the defendant until September 19, 2016, almost three weeks after the deadline. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(5),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20745\">\n    365 Mass. 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), which the judge allowed, reasoning that the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate good cause for the delay in service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . Rule 4(j) mandates dismissal of complaints served outside the ninety-day limit unless a plaintiff demonstrates \"good cause.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The determination of good cause is left to the motion judge's discretion. See\n   <em>\n    Shuman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stanley Works\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1418748\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/30/951/#p952\">\n    30 Mass.

The majority of the ninety-day period had elapsed before service was initiated. Two weeks before the deadline, the plaintiff was informed by the sheriff that the summons was not correct. After correcting the error and asking for service \"as soon as possible,\" the plaintiff did nothing more to inform the sheriff of the impending deadline, or otherwise ensure timely service. Mere reliance on a process server does not constitute good cause.
