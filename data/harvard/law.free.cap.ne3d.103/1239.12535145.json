L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ), for failure to comply with the citation requirements of G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2. Concluding that the Commonwealth failed to show a circumstance justifying the failure to issue a timely citation, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Under G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2, as appearing in St. 1985, c. 794, \u00a7 3, \"[a] failure to give a copy of the citation to the violator at the time and place of the violation shall constitute a defense in any court proceeding for such violation, except [1] where the violator could not have been stopped or [2] where additional time was reasonably necessary to determine the nature of the violation or the identity of the violator, or [3] where the court finds that a circumstance, not inconsistent with the purpose of this section to create a uniform, simplified and non-criminal method for disposing of automobile violations, justifies the failure.\" Here, there is no question that the first and second exceptions do not apply; the juvenile was present at the scene of the accident and received a citation for a marked lane violation and underage use of an electronic device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   When we apply the third exception, we consider \"the two fundamental purposes of the statute: (1) prevention of 'manipulation and misuse' of citations; and (2) 'prompt and definite notice' to the alleged violator of the nature of the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burnham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461233\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/90/483/#p485\">\n    90 Mass. App. Ct. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 485 (2016), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pappas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934215\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/384/428/#p431\">\n    384 Mass. 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 431 (1981). Here, both fundamental purposes weigh in favor of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Unlike in many cases in which we have applied the third exception, there was no oral notice to the juvenile that criminal charges were forthcoming. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Moulton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"626883\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/56/682/#p683\">\n    56 Mass.

We have previously held that the issuance of a citation for an infraction or a minor criminal charge does not by itself provide implicit notice of more serious charges.\n   <em>\n    Burnham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461233\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/90/483/#p485\">\n    90 Mass. App. Ct. at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, here the citation issued at the time of the accident would have led the juvenile to believe that this would be the extent of the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Similarly unavailing is the Commonwealth's contention that the injuries to the other driver sufficed to provide constructive notice to the juvenile that criminal charges were forthcoming. To be sure, \"[t]he risk that a putative defendant will remain unaware of a transient traffic offense and will be unprepared to defend against it unless the incident is 'called immediately to [his] attention' has little relevance when applied to more serious crimes.\"\n   <em>\n    Pappas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934215\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/384/428/#p431\">\n    384 Mass. at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Giannino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"320402\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/371/700/#p703\">\n    371 Mass. 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 703 (1977).
