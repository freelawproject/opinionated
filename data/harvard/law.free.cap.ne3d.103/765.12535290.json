Velez, appeals from his convictions of violation of an abuse prevention order and assault and battery on a household member. On direct appeal, the defendant makes no argument of trial error. Accordingly, the judgments are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The only issue briefed by the defendant is that a judge of the District Court abused his discretion in denying a posttrial motion for funds for additional investigative work prepatory to the filing of a motion for new trial. The defendant has filed no appeal from the denial of the motion, and consequently there is no matter before us to act upon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Judgments affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
