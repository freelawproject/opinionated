We agree with the judge that the plaintiff's claims for negligence, gross negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress fail because the plaintiff failed to establish that any of the defendants owed him a cognizable legal duty. See\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Westwood Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"826186\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/420/739/#p742\">\n    420 Mass. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 742 (1995) (\"Before liability for negligence can be imposed, there must first be a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff\"). Furthermore, contrary to the plaintiff's assertions, the defendants did not owe him a duty to act simply because they were family.

Here, the undisputed proof established that the plaintiff's parents \"intentionally refused [the p]laintiff's offer to pay for rent.\" Therefore, the plaintiff did not establish a tenancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Further, because none of the negligence claims survives dismissal, the judge also properly dismissed the plaintiff's claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. See\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Abbott Labs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"906571\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/386/540/#p557\">\n    386 Mass. 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 557 (1982) (\"[I]n order to recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress [the plaintiff] must prove ... negligence\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Intentional infliction of emotional distress\n   </em>\n   .

The plaintiff's claim for conversion, relating to the possessions that remained in the house from the time of his removal on February 23, 2015, until the time the Housing Court gave him an order for their retrieval also does not lie because the plaintiff has failed to show that his parents \"intentionally or wrongfully exercise[d] acts of ownership, control or dominion\" over his possessions during that time.

However, the statute excludes from its reach the leasing of \"a single dwelling unit in a two family dwelling, the other occupancy unit of which is occupied by the owner as his residence.\" G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(11)(3), inserted by St. 1983, c. 628, \u00a7 3. In addition to having failed to establish the existence of a tenancy, the plaintiff's claim fails because it does not fall within the scope of the statute. Because the plaintiff has not identified a civil right that the defendants violated, the plaintiff's claim under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, alleging violations of his civil rights, also fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    Fraudulent concealment/misrepresentation\n   </em>\n   .
