L. c. 152, \u00a7 23, bars the plaintiff's negligence claim. We conclude that it does and, therefore, affirm the judgment entered by a Superior Court judge dismissing the plaintiff's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The plaintiff, Jose Faria, claims that he was hired as an independent contractor in his profession as a chef by the defendant, The Portuguese American Civil League of Lowell (the League). On January 27, 2015, Faria was entering the League's function hall when he slipped and fell on an accumulation of ice, causing him to suffer a displaced trimalleolar fracture of his right ankle. As a result of the injury, Faria incurred more than $28,000 in medical expenses, lost wages, \"permanent impairment, [and] pain and emotional anguish.\" Following the injury, Faria filed a worker's compensation claim against the League, asserting that he was an employee. The League denied liability, claiming, among other things, that Faria was an independent contractor, not an employee. Eventually, the parties agreed to settle the case for a lump-sum payment under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48. The settlement agreement states in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-8\">\n   \"In view of the significant issues as to liability, specifically whether or not an employer/employee relationship existed, as well as additional issues raised as to credibility and [average weekly wage], it was determined that it would be in the employee's best interest to settle his case rather than to proceed with litigation with the associated risks and uncertainties. Settlement will provide Mr. Faria with some certainty and allow him to put this matter behind him and move forward with his life. It should be noted that this settlement is on a no liability basis and that the insurer will not be responsible for the payment of future medical treatment related to the injury. The insurer has, however, agreed as part of this settlement to pay for reasonable, necessary and related medical treatment incurred by Mr. Faria as of the date of the approval of this settlement.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After Faria brought the present negligence action against the League, the League filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20754\">\n    365 Mass. 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), arguing that Faria's claim is barred by the \u00a7 48 settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that follow, the motion to dismiss was properly allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 23, as amended by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 34, provides, in relevant part: \"[i]f an employee accepts payment of compensation under this chapter on account of personal injury or makes an agreement under section forty-eight, such action shall constitute a release to the insured of all claims or demands at common law, if any, arising from the injury.\" Although Faria accepted payment of compensation on account of personal injury and made an agreement under \u00a7 48, he argues that his negligence claim is not barred by \u00a7 23 because it was not determined in the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) proceedings whether he is an employee or independent contractor. However, \u00a7 23 bars Faria's claim even though his employment status was not determined (or admitted to) in the worker's compensation proceedings.
