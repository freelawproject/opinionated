The defendant is unhappy with the noise coming from the plaintiff's apartment and believes that the plaintiff intentionally bangs on the wall to disturb him. In response, he has repeatedly called the police to complain about the noise. The plaintiff did not specify in her testimony the number of times that the defendant called the police, but her affidavit (which the judge considered without objection) stated that the police responded to her apartment four times in an unspecified timeframe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no evidence that the defendant at any point made any misrepresentations of fact to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On February 7, 2017, both parties appeared in Boston Municipal Court seeking harassment prevention orders against each other. After hearing from both parties, the Boston Municipal Court judge denied the instant defendant's complaint and granted a six-month harassment prevention order to the instant plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case is controlled by\n   <em>\n    Gassman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461184\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/90/1/\">\n    90 Mass.
