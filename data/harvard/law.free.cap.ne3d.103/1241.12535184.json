On the day of the incident, however, the defendant was not speaking to the victim. They were fighting on the way home from work when the defendant, who was driving, pushed the victim's face against the car window. He then parked the car and tried to pull the victim out by the hair. He called her \"a no-good slut, dirty whore.\" As they wrestled on the ground beside the car, he grabbed the victim's telephone from her hands and put it in the trunk so she could not call 911. By the end of the incident the defendant had nearly torn all of the victim's clothing off of her body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The challenged evidence concerned the defendant's relationship with the victim and prior altercations between them. The victim testified that their once happy relationship had deteriorated to the point that the defendant regularly called her \"whore\" and \"slut.\" If she greeted their dogs in the morning before saying good morning to the defendant, he would refuse to speak to her for the rest of the day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After one prior argument inside a parked car, the defendant tried to physically remove her and pushed her head against the side of the car. In another argument that took place at their home, the defendant pushed some items off a home entertainment center, smashing them on the floor, and then smashed the victim's telephone in the driveway. On this occasion, she tore at his clothes and ripped his shirt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The judge properly exercised her discretion to admit testimony about the conduct described above, and to exclude other conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Evidence of prior abuse or violence in a relationship may be relevant for several permissible purposes.

We discern no error or abuse of discretion in the admission of the individual bad acts or in the judge's determination that their combined admission did not constitute \"piling on\" that results in the risk of unfair prejudice outweighing probative value.
