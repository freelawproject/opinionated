The plaintiffs claim that the arbitration provision contained in the parties' agreement is unenforceable and that the agreement itself is an unenforceable contract. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The record reflects the following facts. Tough Mudder is a company that organizes athletic endurance events consisting of mud-filled obstacle courses designed to test participants' physical and mental strength. In 2014, Tough Mudder advertised a \"Mudderella Boston\" event scheduled to take place in Haverhill on September 6. The plaintiffs are all Massachusetts residents who used Tough Mudder's online Web site to sign up for the event and to pay the registration fee. When registering for the event, Tough Mudder presented each plaintiff with a \"participant assumption of risk, waiver of liability, and indemnification agreement\" (agreement) on the Web site in a scroll box displaying a portion of its text; scrolling through the box allowed registrants to read the full text of the agreement. A check box beneath the scroll box declared \"I agree to the above waiver.\" In order to register for the event, the plaintiffs needed to check this box.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Prior to the date of the event, officials in Haverhill declined Tough Mudder's request for a permit. Tough Mudder immediately moved the event to nearby Amesbury. However, just a few days before the event, Tough Mudder learned that Amesbury could no longer serve as host. Tough Mudder then secured a third, out-of-State location for the event in Westbrook, Maine, approximately eighty miles from the original Haverhill location. Due to this increased distance, the plaintiffs were unable to attend the event.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Subsequently, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Superior Court, alleging breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment. They also claimed that Tough Mudder's policy of refusing refunds for any reason violated the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, G. L. c. 93A. The plaintiffs also presented class action allegations. After removing the case to Federal court, where it was later remanded back to the Superior Court, Tough Mudder moved to dismiss or to stay and to compel arbitration. Following a hearing, the judge allowed the motion. In dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint, the judge adopted Tough Mudder's arguments and ruled that the plaintiffs' allegations \"are plainly subject to the [a]rbitration agreement provisions of the parties' contracts and must be mediated first, and then, if unsuccessful, arbitrated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . In assessing Tough Mudder's motion to compel arbitration, which is properly treated as one for summary judgment, we must determine whether the parties agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cotter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855726\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/448/671/#p676\">\n    448 Mass. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676 (2007).

Courts have a very limited role in matters involving arbitration. When a motion to compel arbitration is met with the argument that the entire agreement is unenforceable, our only task is to determine whether the arbitration provision itself is enforceable.

If we determine that the arbitration provision is enforceable, then questions surrounding the formation of the agreement itself, such as whether the consideration offered was illusory, or questions about other specific provisions, are left to the arbitrator.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3873284\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/379/762/#p766\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3873284\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/379/762/#p766\">\n    . at 766-768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The plaintiffs allege that the arbitration provision is unconscionable for a number of reasons. They claim that the arbitration clause is not conspicuous, as it is \"not highlighted and is obscurely embedded deep in the [a]greement\" such that it creates \"unfair surprise\" to registrants. The plaintiffs also argue that certain terms within the provision are vague or undefined, which they again claim constitute \"unfair surprise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Historically, courts considered a contract unconscionable if it was \"such as no man in his senses and not under delusion would make on the one hand, and as no honest and fair man would accept on the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Hume\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5699541\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/132/406/#p411\">\n    132 U.S. 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 411 (1889), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Earl of Chesterfield\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Janssen\n   </em>\n   , 28 Eng.

Considering the setting, purpose, and effect of the arbitration provision here, we conclude that it was not unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Nothing in the setting of its execution suggests that the arbitration provision was procedurally unconscionable. The entire agreement is preceded by a conspicuous, clearly-worded, all-caps header stating: \"PARTICIPANTS: READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE SIGNING. THIS DOCUMENT HAS LEGAL CONSEQUENCES AND WILL AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND WILL ELIMINATE YOUR ABILITY TO BRING FUTURE LEGAL ACTIONS.\" The arbitration provision is titled \"Mediation and Arbitration,\" appears on the fourth page of the seven-page agreement, and is written in what appears to be the same size and font as the rest of the agreement. The provision itself is only one paragraph long and uses fairly clear language. There is nothing in the record suggesting that the plaintiffs were under pressure to read the agreement quickly or to not read it at all. The agreement also required an affirmative response from the plaintiffs by clicking the \"I accept\" button. See\n   <em>\n    Ajemian\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Yahoo!, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3849719\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/565/#p576\">\n    83 Mass. App. Ct. 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576 (2013). These factors all weigh against a finding of unfair surprise or oppressive formation. See\n   <em>\n    Swift\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zynga Game Network, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5903154\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/805/904/#p911\">\n    805 F.

Cal. 2011) (granting motion to compel arbitration where plaintiff had opportunity to review terms of service via hyperlink and clicked \"I accept\" button).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Similarly, nothing in the terms of the arbitration provision-its purpose and effect-suggests that it was substantively unconscionable. The purpose of submitting disputes to binding arbitration is heavily favored by statute and by case law. See G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 1 ;\n   <em>\n    Home Gas Corp. of Mass., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3880406\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/403/772/#p774\">\n    403 Mass. at 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The agreement was bilateral in that either party could invoke its provisions. All rights and remedies available in the courts were preserved for the arbitrator. On this record, there is no viable claim of unconscionability in the arbitration provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Scope of provision\n   </em>\n   . Finally, the plaintiffs argue that even if the arbitration provision is enforceable, their claims against Tough Mudder do not require arbitration because they do not fall within the scope of that provision. Specifically, they argue that the language in the agreement requiring that \"all disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of my participation in the Mudderella event shall be submitted to binding arbitration\" does not apply to them, because the plaintiffs never participated in the event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under the terms of the arbitration provision, the plaintiffs agreed that \"[i]n the event of a legal issue, [they] agree to engage in good faith efforts to mediate any dispute that might arise\" and that should mediation fail, \"all disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of [their] participation\" in the event should be submitted to arbitration. This language is somewhat unclear, because it first requires the parties to mediate \"any dispute that might arise,\" but if mediation fails, to submit to arbitration all \"disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of [their] participation\" in the event. However, the Commonwealth's policy in favor of arbitration generally instructs us that where, as here, a contract has an arbitration provision that is broad in its reach, there is a rebuttable presumption that a contract dispute is covered by the provision, and doubts whether a particular dispute comes within the scope of the provision should be resolved in favor of arbitration.
