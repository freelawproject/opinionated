L. c. 119, \u00a7 26. The judge provided for the child's visitation with the mother at the department's discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the mother primarily contends that two of the judge's factual findings are clearly erroneous, and the finding of the mother's unfitness is not supported by clear and convincing evidence. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We summarize the judge's findings of fact, supplemented where necessary by uncontradicted evidence from the record. The child was sixteen years old at the time of trial. He has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, autism, epilepsy, cortical vision impairment, developmental delays, and flat feet. He is nonverbal and communicates using a number of methods, including modified sign language and picture icons. The child takes medication for his seizure disorder. His developmental delays necessitate physical, speech, and occupational therapy, as well as applied behavioral analysis. Despite the child's medical complexity, he has developed a bond with the mother and, until his removal from her custody in 2015, had always resided with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The department became involved in this case in September, 2014, after mandated reporters filed two G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A, reports (51A reports). The 51A report dated September 25, 2014, alleged educational neglect by the mother based on the child's absence from school since September 16, 2014, and a long history of abrupt changes and gaps in the child's education due to the mother's \"distaste for schools and providers.\" Following an investigation pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B, the department found that the allegations of educational neglect were supported.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Undeterred by this finding, or by warnings that failure to send the child back to school would result in a care and protection petition, the mother continued to hold the child out of school through October and November. During this time, the mother, who had several criminal convictions and repeated involvement with the criminal justice system,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   was often verbally hostile toward department workers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 4, 2014, the department received a call from the child's neurologist \"expressing concerns for [the child's] safety due to reports that [the] [m]other was physically abusive towards [the child].\" It was reported to the department that in November of 2014, the mother \"threatened the [child's] neurologist stating that if he did not do what she wanted, she would not give her son his [seizure] medication.\" After the doctor refused, the mother left the appointment without allowing the doctor to evaluate the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On November 25, 2014, the department filed a care and protection petition. Following a preliminary hearing, the Juvenile Court judge granted the mother temporary custody, appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) for the child, and ordered the mother to cooperate with the department and send the child back to school. The mother initially complied with the order but quickly removed the child from school again in early December, 2014. Although her cited concerns with the school's services were addressed, she refused to send the child back to school. Eventually, after a home visit with the department in mid-December of 2014, the mother sent the child back to school. In January, 2015, the mother received her first service plan from the department. The plan required her to, inter alia, send the child to school daily, meet with the department once a month, refrain from aggressive behavior with service providers, engage in therapy, and ensure that the child is up to date with his medical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Over the next several months, the mother repeatedly violated the terms of her service plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In early January of 2015, she verbally accosted employees of the child's school, which led the school to serve her with a \"no trespass\" order. On the heels of this incident, she began to withhold the child from school yet again. Although the mother later agreed, following another hearing in March, to work with the department to facilitate a neuropsychological evaluation for the child and to find an alternative school placement, she subsequently failed to do either.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, in August, 2015, the child was placed in the temporary custody of the department because the mother continued to withhold the child from school.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   From January to August of 2015, the mother frequently refused to meet with department social workers and engaged in abusive communications with both department personnel and service providers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After being removed from the father's custody, see note 11,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the child was enrolled at the May Institute Residential School (May Center) in late September. When the child arrived, his medications were below therapeutic levels, and the May Center was concerned that they had not been administered properly prior to his placement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   After removal, the mother's behavior initially improved, but she soon reverted to her old pattern of disrupting the child's services. On one occasion, she aggressively shouted department workers off her property. Her interactions with the May Center staff became so inappropriate that, by April, 2016, the center felt compelled to discontinue on-site visits due to safety concerns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on this type of behavior, multiple witnesses-credited by the judge-testified that the mother is a hindrance to the child's education and care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"In care and protection cases, the judge's subsidiary findings must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence and will only be disturbed if clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Vick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456716\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/89/704/#p706\">\n    89 Mass.

A subsidiary factual finding is \"clearly erroneous when there is no evidence to support it, or when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    Custody of Eleanor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3903850\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/414/795/#p799\">\n    414 Mass. 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799 (1993) (quotation omitted). \"Taken together, these findings must then prove clearly and convincingly that the [parent is] currently unfit to provide for the welfare and best interests of [the child].\"\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Vick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Findings of fact\n   </em>\n   . The mother contends that two of the judge's subsidiary factual findings are unsupported by the evidence. Specifically, she disputes the findings that the child \"had problems with self-care\" when he arrived at the May Center, and that the child has made \"tremendous progress\" since his enrollment there. Neither finding is clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The record indicates that both findings are supported by the evidence, including witness testimony explicitly credited by the judge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Custody of Two Minors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"898038\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/396/610/#p618\">\n    396 Mass. 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 618 (1986) (\"[T]he judge's assessment of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses is entitled to deference\"). The mother's argument amounts to a claim that the judge improperly weighed the evidence. See\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Don\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993917\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/435/158/#p166\">\n    435 Mass. 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166 (2001). Contrary to her contention, even \"[w]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the fact finder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Olga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1250671\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/57/821/\">\n    57 Mass. App. Ct. 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 824 n.3 (2003) (quotation omitted). Thus, there is no indication that a mistake was committed as to either of these findings, see\n   <em>\n    Custody of Eleanor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and we therefore must accept them. See\n   <em>\n    Custody of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Unfitness\n   </em>\n   . The mother next contends that there is insufficient evidence to support the judge's ultimate finding of unfitness. We disagree. The judge's specific and detailed findings demonstrate, clearly and convincingly, that the mother is unfit and that the child's best interests will be served in the custody of the department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A parent is considered unfit if they have \"grievous shortcomings or handicaps that put the child's welfare much at hazard.\"\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Thomasina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833326\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/75/563/#p576\">\n    75 Mass. App. Ct. 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576 (2009) (quotation omitted). This determination is highly fact specific, and \"[t]he specialized needs of a particular child combined with the deficiencies of a parent's character, temperament, capacity, or conduct may clearly establish parental unfitness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833326\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/75/563/#p576\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833326\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/75/563/#p576\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). In this case, the record demonstrates that the mother is either unwilling or unable to provide for the child's specialized medical and educational needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It is well established that a parent's failure to obtain appropriate medical care for his or her child is a relevant factor in determining unfitness. See\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Ramon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1038724\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/41/709/#p717\">\n    41 Mass.

App. Ct. 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676 (2008). In this case, the mother's neglect of the child's medical needs put the child \"much at hazard.\"\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Thomasina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, the record reflects that the mother refused to let the child be examined during a neurology appointment and stopped bringing him to medical appointments altogether when she did not get her way; continued to cancel appointments even after telling a doctor that the child was having more seizures; allowed the child to fall below therapeutic levels of his seizure medication; and declined to sign off on a neuropsychological evaluation without justification. Although the evidence does not establish that the mother's behavior ever caused a medical emergency, courts need not \"wait for inevitable disaster to happen\" to protect a child.\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Katharine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1606231\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/42/25/#p32\">\n    42 Mass. App. Ct. 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32 (1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This court has also explained that the failure to meet a child's educational needs is relevant to the unfitness calculus. See\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Lillith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"511467\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/61/132/#p135\">\n    61 Mass. App. Ct. 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135 (2004) (noting relevance of mother's failure to send child to school and her inability to understand negative effects of such failure on child). Here, although the child had an individualized education plan (IEP) indicating that he was capable of benefiting from an education, the mother's disruptions caused him to miss over a year's worth of school, thereby putting his developmental growth at risk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"511467\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/61/132/#p135\">\n     ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"511467\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/61/132/#p135\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Additionally, apart from the medical and educational neglect, there are several other factors that support the judge's finding of present and future unfitness in this case. Those factors include the mother's repeated failure to comply with her service plan, see\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Rhona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582877\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/117/#p126\">\n    63 Mass. App. Ct. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126 (2005) ; her inability to work with professionals to face her considerable parenting challenges, see\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Thomasina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 575 n.22; her \"[v]iolence of temper,\"\n   <em>\n    Guardianship of a Minor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3944232\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/1/392/#p396\">\n    1 Mass.

Finally, the judge was also entitled to take into account the mother's undiagnosed mental health issues, her refusal to undergo a full mental health evaluation, and her refusal to engage in therapy. See generally\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Carla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"819038\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/416/510/#p519\">\n    416 Mass. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519 (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   All of these factors, taken together, clearly and convincingly demonstrate that the mother is currently unfit to parent the child. Furthermore, the evidence that the child has been brought medically up-to-date since his removal, and that he has made tremendous progress at the May Center, establishes that his interests will be best served in the custody of the department going forward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The judge also found the father to be unavailable.

Indeed, one of the child's doctors stated in July, 2015, that the child had not seen his pediatrician since October, 2014, or his neurologist since November, 2014.
