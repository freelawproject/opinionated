He thereafter sought relief from his guilty plea because Annie Dookhan was the confirmatory chemist for his case's drug analysis. The defendant argued that had he known of Dookhan's misconduct, there is a reasonable probability he would not have pleaded guilty. Before us now are his consolidated appeals from orders denying a motion for new trial and a reconsideration motion. Because the judge did not err in concluding that the defendant has not shown prejudice from Dookhan's involvement, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . a.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n   . In July, 2010, Lynn police received information that the defendant and an accomplice were selling oxycodone from an address in Lynn, and that the two of them had recently purchased a large quantity of oxycodone and would be transporting it in the defendant's vehicle. The police were also advised that the defendant's vehicle contained a hidden compartment. Police officers stopped and searched the defendant's car, finding the hidden compartment; inside the compartment were a total of 709 pills, separated into several baggies. Two cellular telephones and $262 were also obtained from the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The 709 pills were sent to the William A. Hinton State Laboratory Institute for testing. A sample of five of the 709 pills was found to contain oxycodone. On the November, 2010, certificate, chemist Daniela Frasca, as primary chemist, and Annie Dookhan, as confirmatory chemist, are listed as analysts for the sample testing. Primary chemist Frasca analyzed the pills, and prepared five sample vials for confirmatory testing. Frasca and Dookhan certified that the pills contained oxycodone, and that the net weight of all of the pills was 191.32 grams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendant was indicted for trafficking in opium or a derivative in the total amount of 100 grams or more, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Plea\n   </em>\n   . Pursuant to a plea agreement with the Commonwealth, on May 30, 2012, the defendant pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of possession of a class B substance (oxycodone) with intent to distribute, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A. At the plea hearing, the defendant admitted to the material facts, including that a search of the defendant's car revealed a hidden compartment containing a large quantity of pills that tested as oxycodone. The defendant received a sentence of four to five years in State prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Subsequent procedure\n   </em>\n   . In October, 2012, upon learning of Dookhan's misconduct,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the defendant filed his first motion for a new trial seeking to withdraw his guilty plea, questioning the accuracy of the drug analysis and arguing that he was deprived of his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. In March, 2013, the defendant filed an amended new trial motion (styled as an amended motion to vacate his guilty plea). On August 15, 2013, a special judicial magistrate issued proposed findings of fact and rulings of law denying the amended motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following the defendant's objection to the magistrate's proposed findings and rulings, a Superior Court judge initially disagreed with the magistrate and allowed the motion for a new trial. However, at a January, 2014, evidentiary hearing, the judge was presented with the remaining pills held in evidence by the Lynn police department, and examined their physical integrity. On January 31, 2014, the judge then reversed his previous decision and affirmed the special magistrate's decision denying the defendant's new trial motion. The judge found that \"the physical integrity of a very, very large number of the pills, and easily the majority is completely uncompromised. Thus, [the defendant] would not have altered his decision to plead guilty even if he were aware of Ms. Dookhan's misconduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 22, 2016, after the decisions in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317074\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/336/\">\n    467 Mass. 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), and\n   <em>\n    Bridgeman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4319858\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/465/\">\n    471 Mass. 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), the defendant sought to \"reopen\" his motion for a new trial, arguing based upon those decisions that prosecutorial misconduct was presumed, and that accordingly he had been denied due process. The motion, and a subsequent request for reconsideration, were each denied. The defendant appealed the latter denial on August 10, 2016, and we thereafter stayed the appellate proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 24, 2017, the defendant again filed a motion for a new trial seeking to withdraw his guilty plea. On March 23, 2017, the motion was denied because, inter alia, the defendant's case was not a \"typical Dookhan case,\" as the physical integrity of the oxycodone pills was uncompromised. The defendant appealed from the March 23, 2017, order, and his appeals have been consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The defendant claims that the motion judge abused his discretion in denying the defendant's motion for new trial.

In this case, as Dookhan was the confirmatory chemist on the sample submitted for testing, we must presume there was egregious government misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Here, however, the judge found that the defendant failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would not have entered the guilty plea had he known of Dookhan's misconduct. There were hundreds of pills seized from the defendant's car; the motion judge in 2014 found, based on his own observation, that the physical integrity of the majority of these pills was uncompromised. This finding was cited by the motion judge in one of the orders under review. The defendant has not argued, let alone shown, that this finding is clearly erroneous. As a result, the judge could permissibly conclude that the pills were available to be analyzed by chemists other than Dookhan, and the results presented at any trial. In deciding whether to accept the plea deal, the defendant would have had to take into account that the Commonwealth may have been able to prove the contents of these other pills.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   There was additional circumstantial evidence supporting the charges against the defendant.

A police informant identified the defendant as an oxycodone dealer and advised police about the hidden compartment in the defendant's car. The defendant's vehicle contained hundreds of pills in such a hidden compartment, and the police observed the defendant entering and driving the vehicle. Some or all of this circumstantial evidence, which tended to show that the defendant possessed and distributed oxycodone, also would have been available at any trial.

See\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317074\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/336/\">\n    467 Mass. at 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (motion judge may consider sentence reduction resulting from plea);\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Resende\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457187\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/1/#p18\">\n    475 Mass. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18-19 (2016). At the time of the plea, the defendant's original charge of trafficking in over 100 grams of opium or a derivative carried a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   ), as amended through St. 1992, c. 396, \u00a7 3.
