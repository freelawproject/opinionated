The issue before this court is whether, when the original mortgagor has been found to have waived the statute of limitations against a senior lienholder in a foreclosure action, subordinate lienholders are bound by that waiver and barred from raising the defense against the senior lienholder. For the following reasons, the judgment of the lower court is reversed and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On February 9, 2015, Christopher P. Hitchcock, Treasurer for Geauga County, Ohio, filed a Complaint in Foreclosure against Charles J. Imars and others, including appellee, Sylvia B. Imars, and appellants, Sherman F. Denison, E. Bruce Dunn, and Rebecca Dunn. Hitchcock sought the foreclosure of property owned by Charles Imars at 14656 South Cheshire Street, in Burton, for \"due and unpaid taxes, assessments, interest and penalties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On March 10, 2015, Sylvia Imars filed an Answer and Cross-Claim against Charles Imars. Sylvia alleged that she and Charles were divorced on March 6, 1996, and that he executed a promissory note to her in the amount of $20,000, secured by a mortgage on the property located at 14656 South Cheshire Street. According to the note, \"both principal and interest were due and payable thirty-six (36) months from December 5, 1996 or upon the earlier sale of the real property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On April 16, 2015, Denison and the Dunns filed an Answer, Crossclaims and Counterclaim. They asserted that they \"have a security interest in and lien against the real property and premises * * * pursuant to two Cognovit Demand Promissory Notes,\" executed on January 1, 2009, in the amount of $290,702.83 to Denison and $182,370.19 to the Dunns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On April 24, 2015, Charles Imars filed a Reply to Cross-Claim of Sylvia B. Imars, raising the affirmative defense of the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 21, 2015, Charles Imars and the Treasurer for Geauga County stipulated to judgment in favor of the Treasurer in the amount of $41,494.42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On February 29, 2016, Denison and the Dunns filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, asserting that the Cross-Claim of Sylvia Imars \"is time-barred by the statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 1303.16.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On April 19, 2016, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Denison in the amount of $496,657.03, and in favor of the Dunns in the amount of $309,694.68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On September 30, 2016, a hearing was held on the issue of lien priorities and whether Sylvia Imars' note was subject to the statute of limitations defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On December 30, 2016, the trial court ordered the foreclosure of the subject premises. With respect to Sylvia Imars' claim, the court ruled as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Mrs. Imars' Note provides, by its express terms, that the principal and interest is due and payable thirty-six (36) months from the date of the Note or upon sale of the subject property, whichever occurs first. Therefore, the latest that Mrs. Imars' Note would have been due and payable was December 5, 1999.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Absent an applicable defense to or exemption from its application, a claim to enforce Mrs. Imars' Note would be subject to the six-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 1303.16(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   This Court finds, however, based upon the testimony at trial, that Mr. Imars has waived the operation of R.C. 1303.16(A) with respect to his debt to Mrs. Imars and that such waiver is binding upon subordinate lienholders, including the Denison and Dunn Defendants. Therefore, Mrs. Imars' Note remains a valid and enforceable obligation of Mr. Imars.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The trial court's December 30, 2016 judgment further provides that, upon confirmation of the sale of the property, the proceeds of the sale shall be paid first to the Geauga County Clerk of Courts; second to the Geauga County Treasurer; third to Sylvia Imars; fourth to Denison and the Dunns; and fifth to Charles Imars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On January 25, 2017, Denison and the Dunns filed a Notice of Appeal. On appeal, they raise the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \"[1.] The trial court committed prejudicial error by entering judgment in favor of mortgagee Sylvia B. Imars against mortgagor Charles J. Imars, finding that Charles J. Imars waived his right to assert R.C. 1303.16(A) (the statute of limitations applicable to promissory notes), where there was no evidence in the record that Mr. Imars either expressly or impliedly waived the statute of limitations defense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} \"[2.] The trial court committed prejudicial error by holding that Mr. Imars' waiver of his statute of limitations defense prevented the Denison/Dunn Defendants from asserting the defense themselves, and by enforcing Mrs. Imars' promissory note as a valid claim and Mrs. Imars' mortgage as a valid lien with priority over the lien of the Denison/Dunn Defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} We will address the second assignment of error first, as it is dispositive of the entire appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Under the second assignment of error, Denison and the Dunns argue that the trial court erred \"in its holding that Mr. Imars' waiver of the defense of the statute of limitations was 'binding upon subordinate lienholders', thereby reviving Mrs. Imars' mortgage lien with priority over the mortgage lien of the Denison/Dunn Defendants.\" Appellants' brief at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The issue presented for review, whether the waiver of the statute of limitations defense by the maker of a promissory note secured by a mortgage is binding on third parties having an interest in the mortgaged property, is a question of law.

Sylvia testified she did not sue Charles prior to this case for several reasons. She said that between 1996 and 1999, he repeatedly told her he would pay his debt when he sold his property. She said that after 1999, she called him multiple times asking him to pay his debt. He said he still did not have the money, but would pay her when he sold his property. Finally, in 2008, Sylvia hired an attorney to send Charles a demand letter. In response, Charles' attorney sent her attorney a letter stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   I discussed the demand with Mr. Imars, who indicated that his financial situation\n   at the present time is such that he is unable to make any payment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   He does have his real estate listed for sale, and should he be able to find a buyer, it would enable him to meet his financial obligations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   I realize that this is not what you or your client would wish to hear, however, I do believe that\n   <em>\n    continued forbearance\n   </em>\n   in this matter would be the best course for all concerned.\" (Emphasis sic.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 33} \"A forbearance means 'a delay in enforcing * * * debts, * * * claims or obligations.' \"\n   <em>\n    HomEq Servicing Corp. v.

Otherwise stated, a forbearance is \" 'the refraining from doing something that one has a legal right to do. Giving of further time for repayment of [an] obligation or [an] agreement not to enforce a claim at its due date.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202151996\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , quoting Black's Law Dictionary 664 (7th ed.1999). Sylvia said that, based on the letter from Charles' attorney, she further delayed filing suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Sylvia testified that Charles never told her he did not owe her the money. Further, Charles testified that in 2008, when his attorney sent his letter to Sylvia's attorney, it was his (Charles') intention to pay the debt to Sylvia. In fact, Charles said he has always intended to pay this debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Following the presentation of the evidence, the trial court ruled from the bench:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Mr. Imars testified honorably: * * * He intends to pay his wife. And it's his debt. It's not the debt of the other lienholders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   And while in his answer to [Sylvia's] cross-claim his attorney raised the statute of limitations, Mr. Imars as the person who owes the debt said: I intend to pay that debt, so he has effectively waived his statute of limitations defense. And the Court is of the opinion that other lienholders cannot bring that up when the debtor himself says: I owe it and intend to pay it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   So I do find that Mr. Imars continues to be obligated to Mrs. Imars and that the timing of the mortgage and note grant Mrs. Imars * * * priority over the other parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The trial court's finding that Charles waived the statute of limitations was supported by competent, credible evidence. In reliance on his repeated promises to pay his debt when he sold his property, Sylvia delayed filing suit. Thus, Charles waived the defense based on prior agreements of forbearance to enforce the underlying note. The cases cited by appellants are inapposite because the mortgagors in those cases did not waive the limitations defense, thus allowing subsequent lienholders to assert the defense. In contrast, here, Charles waived the limitations defense before and after the limitations period ran on Sylvia's note and before appellants obtained their interests in his property. Thus, the trial court did not err in finding that Sylvia's interests had priority over appellants'. As a result, I would affirm and I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The appellate decision in\n    <em>\n     Curtis\n    </em>\n    does not provide further detail regarding the nature of the utility company's interest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Charles Imars has not challenged the finding that he waived the statute of limitations defense and is not a party to this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
