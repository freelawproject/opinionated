L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. The judge ordered summary judgment for the board, reasoning that the doctrine of infectious invalidity precluded the plaintiffs from obtaining the building permit. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the judge erred because they had cured any infectious invalidity prior to the permit application. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We summarize the material facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. See\n   <em>\n    Augat, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895508\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/410/117/#p120\">\n    410 Mass. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120 (1991). On March 12, 2004, the plaintiffs purchased real property at 27 Oak Avenue in the town of Lunenburg (27 Oak). At the time of purchase, the plaintiffs owned an adjacent parcel, 31 Turkey Hill Road (31 Turkey Hill). Both parcels had been improved by single-family homes. While 31 Turkey Hill complied with the Lunenburg zoning by-law in all respects, 27 Oak did not. The width of the 27 Oak lot was 140 feet, thirty-five feet less than required. However, 27 Oak predated the relevant zoning by-law and therefore qualified as a preexisting nonconforming lot. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The plaintiffs sought to create a third buildable lot (new lot) using land from both 27 Oak and 31 Turkey Hill. To this end, they deeded a five foot wide, 260 foot long strip (spur) from 27 Oak to 31 Turkey Hill, and installed a sewer line along the spur to connect to the municipal sewer system. This transfer further reduced the width of 27 Oak from 140 feet to 135 feet. The plaintiffs filed an approval not required plan (ANR plan) with the town, and subsequently sold 27 Oak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2008, the plaintiffs applied for a permit to build a single-family home on the new lot. In a decision affirmed by this court in\n   <em>\n    Cronin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Lunenburg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201112\">\n    79 Mass. App. Ct. 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (\n   <em>\n    Cronin I\n   </em>\n   ), the application was denied because the transfer of the spur from 27 Oak to the new parcel caused 27 Oak to lose its status as a lawful preexisting nonconforming lot. \"Under the common-law principle of 'infectious invalidity,' a property owner may not create a valid building lot by dividing it from another parcel rendered nonconforming by such division.\"\n   <em>\n    81 Spooner Road, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Brookline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272679\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/692/\">\n    461 Mass. 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 694 n.6 (2012). Accordingly, the doctrine of infectious invalidity rendered the new lot unbuildable, as its formation created a zoning violation at 27 Oak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Prompted by a footnote in\n   <em>\n    Cronin I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiffs transferred the spur to the new owners of 27 Oak in exchange for an easement over the land and its sewer connection infrastructure. They then recorded another ANR plan and reapplied for a permit to build on the new lot. Their application was again denied based on the doctrine of infectious invalidity. A Superior Court judge affirmed the board's decision and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

Therefore, at the time of the second building permit application, 27 Oak's lot width-a dimension including the width of the spur-violated the town's zoning by-law. The board could reasonably have concluded that increased use of this nonconforming portion of 27 Oak solely to support the creation of a new lot was a change to 27 Oak that aggravated its nonconformity, in violation of section 5.1.6.1 of the town's by-law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This increased invalidity \"infected\" the new lot and rendered it nonconforming as well.
