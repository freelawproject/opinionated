Where a single statute is involved, we must decide \"whether two ... discrete offenses were proved under that statute\" or whether the conduct at issue constituted a single continuing offense.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dykens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802402\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/635/#p640\">\n    473 Mass. 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640 (2016), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Traylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362193\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/260/#p268\">\n    472 Mass. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 268 (2015). For the first time on appeal, the defendant claims that counts 6 and 7 were part of a continuing course of conduct. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   A defendant's actions underlying two counts of indecent assault and battery can lead to separate convictions and punishments as long as the conduct supporting one count of indecent assault and battery was not incidental and necessary to the other.

App. Ct. 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 273-274 (2013) (defendant's lifting up victim's bra and licking her breast separate and distinct act from rape). Here, the defendant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault and battery stemming from his conduct on March 31, 2014. As the judge explained to the jury, the allegation underlying the first act (count 6) was the defendant's indecent touching of the victim's buttocks, and the allegation underlying the second act (count 7) was the defendant's rubbing his penis on the victim's vagina. In general, with respect to all the indictments, the judge instructed the jury that they must consider each charge separately.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Counts 6 and 7 called upon the Commonwealth to prove two separate and distinct actions. The defendant's touching of the victim's buttocks was not incidental and necessary to his rubbing his penis on her vagina. In other words, neither act was a necessary part of the other. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Howze\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"65563\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/58/147/#p152\">\n    58 Mass. App. Ct. 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 152-153 (2003) (moving victim's underwear to side was \"necessarily accomplished on the commission of the greater crime of rape\"). In particular, the defendant unfastened his pants and rubbed his penis against the victim's vagina, simulating intercourse. He then put his hands down the victim's pants and touched her buttocks with his hands. Thus, the defendant's two convictions on counts 6 and 7 were based on two separate and distinct indecent touchings of the victim's body, neither of which was bound up with or necessary to complete the other act.
