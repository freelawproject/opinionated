L. c. 30A, declaratory judgment, and certiorari relief pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. The defendant, the Sex Offender Registry Board (SORB), filed a motion to dismiss, which was allowed. Doe appeals, claiming that (1) the motion judge erred in ruling that the Superior Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Doe's motion before SORB to vacate his level three sex offender classification; (2) his due process rights were violated when SORB failed to provide notice of its intent to increase his sex offender classification from level two to level three; and (3) the increase in his classification was based on materially inaccurate information. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . In 2005, Doe pleaded guilty to rape of a child. In September, 2008, SORB notified Doe that it intended to recommend a level two classification. Doe did not object and the classification became final in October of 2008. In January of 2014, SORB sent a notice to Doe informing him that it intended to increase his classification to level three.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doe contends that because he did not receive this notice, he did not file an objection. As a result, the recommended classification became final in March of 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In May of 2016, Doe filed with SORB a motion to vacate the level three classification and alternatively to reinstate his hearing rights. The motion was summarily denied on June 20, 2016. Thereafter, Doe filed the complaint that is the subject of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A judge of the Superior Court, in allowing SORB's motion to dismiss, ruled that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the denial of Doe's motion to vacate because it did not result from an adjudicatory hearing. The judge also ruled that to the extent Doe did not receive SORB's notification of its intent to increase his classification level, any due process violation was waived by Doe's two-year delay in moving to vacate the increased classification. The judge did not address Doe's certiorari claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Subject matter jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   . General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 14, provides for judicial review of a final decision of an agency in an adjudicatory proceeding.\n   <em>\n    School Comm. of Hudson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Educ\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855785\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/448/565/#p577\">\n    448 Mass. 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577 (2007). However, if the agency decision is not made in an adjudicatory proceeding, a court lacks jurisdiction to review the decision under G. L. c. 30A.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855785\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/448/565/#p577\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855785\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/448/565/#p577\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Here, we agree with Doe that the denial of his motion to vacate the level three certification did arise from an adjudicatory proceeding\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, thus, the Superior Court judge erred in dismissing his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

Moreover, SORB's exercise of its inherent authority to reopen a classification proceeding is reviewable for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Soe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 395-396.\n   <em>\n    Doe No. 209081\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%20454\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%20454\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the circumstances, Doe's motion is so interconnected with the underlying reclassification that the proceeding is indeed adjudicatory.

SORB's summary denial of Doe's motion in this case makes difficult an evaluation of whether and how SORB exercised its discretion and, as a result, the judge was likewise unable to consider whether SORB abused its discretion. The administrative record is particularly silent as to whether SORB considered Doe's explanation for the delay in bringing the motion and as to how it weighed any prejudice suffered by Doe as a result of the absence of a reclassification hearing.
