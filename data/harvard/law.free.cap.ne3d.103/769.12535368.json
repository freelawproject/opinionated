L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, demonstrate that (1) the mother had over a decade-long history of serious abuse and neglect of her children;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) she lacks the necessary understanding of her children's special needs;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) she suffers from mental health disorders and substance abuse problems and fails to utilize services on a consistent basis; and (4) she lacks insight into her responsibility for why the children were removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We note, as did the judge, that the mother complied with much of her service plan. Specifically, the mother graduated from a twelve-week parenting class and attended two anger management classes. Additionally, the mother attended many of her scheduled parent-child visits and showed improvement in several areas. Nevertheless, the mother did not effectuate a substantial and material change in the actions and behavior that had led to a long history of involvement with the Department of Children and Families (DCF). Her testimony at trial consistently showed a lack of responsibility for and recognition of her actions that caused the abuse and neglect of the children. Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence to clearly and convincingly establish that the mother was unfit and that her unfitness would continue into the indefinite future to a near certitude. See\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Jacques\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3848001\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/82/601/#p606\">\n    82 Mass.

Here, in addition to the detailed and numerous findings of the mother's unfitness, the judge's conclusion that it was in the best interests of the five youngest children to terminate the mother's parental rights as to them was supported by the record. The judge carefully evaluated the best interests of each child individually as evidenced by her decision not to terminate the mother's parental rights as to the oldest child. See note 4,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The mother has a lengthy history of physically and emotionally abusing her children and refuses to take responsibility for her actions or show an ability to change. The mother continues to place her children at risk for further abuse by exposing them to dangerous living conditions and continuing to have relationships with violent and abusive partners. We therefore conclude that the judge's factual findings clearly support the determination that the termination of the mother's parental rights as to the five youngest children served their best interests. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Bruce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772196\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/44/758/#p761\">\n    44 Mass.

Ugo, who was fourteen years old at the time of the trial, independently appeals from the decree terminating the mother's rights as to him. He argues on appeal, as he did at trial, that his best interests lie in not terminating the rights of the only parent he has ever known, and that he should have continued access to the mother's support and \"consistent care.\" \"A judge should consider the wishes of the children in making custodial determinations.\"\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Nancy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276651\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/443/512/#p515\">\n    443 Mass. at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the judge gave Ugo's expressed wishes appropriate weight. The judge's findings explain that the plan for Ugo is to place him with his father once he is \"healthy and safe enough to leave residential care and maintain himself outside of care for a period of time.\" Based on the judge's findings of fact, the judge did not abuse his discretion when making this determination, especially when considering the mother's history of neglect of Ugo's substantial special needs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Vick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456716\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/89/704/#p710\">\n    89 Mass. App. Ct. 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 710 (2016) (\"The child's wishes, however, are neither decisive nor outcome dispositive, ... and must be considered against the backdrop of the mother's unfitness\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Posttermination and postadoption visitation\n   </em>\n   . The mother argues that the judge should have ordered visitation with the children to whom her parental rights were terminated. \"In determining whether to exercise the authority to order visitation, a judge must ask two questions: First, is visitation in the child's best interest? Second, in cases where a family is ready to adopt the child, is an order of visitation necessary to protect the child's best interest, or may decisions regarding visitation be left to the judgment of the adoptive family?\"\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Ilona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270871\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/459/53/#p59\">\n    459 Mass. at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the judge found that there was no significant bond between the mother and the three youngest children and that it would be in those children's best interests to leave the question of posttermination and postadoption contact to the discretion of their legal guardians. The judge also found that since another one of the children (Ugo's twin brother) did not want to have visits with the mother, \"any visits shall be left to the sound discretion of his father,\" who has permanent custody of that child. Finally, with regard to Ugo, the judge found \"that although there may be some evidence of a bond between Ugo and Mother, given his severe mental health issues, contact with Mother shall be left to the sound discretion of his legal guardian.\" We see no error in any of those findings. See\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Vito\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286807\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/431/550/#p563\">\n    431 Mass. 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563-564 (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   5.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    DCF's efforts\n   </em>\n   .

See\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Adoption of Ilona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 61 (\"Where a parent ... has cognitive or other limitations that affect the receipt of services, the department's duty to make reasonable efforts to preserve the natural family includes a requirement that the department provide services that accommodate the special needs of a parent\"). However, because the mother failed to raise a challenge until the termination proceedings, any claimed violation is not properly before us on appeal.
