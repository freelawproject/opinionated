For the following reasons, we affirm that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Toledo is the largest municipal corporation within Lucas County, Ohio. Toledo does not own or operate any type of detention facility. Individuals arrested in Toledo, who are denied bail or who are unable to make bail, are confined to the Lucas County Corrections Center (\"LCCC\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Sheriff operates the LCCC and has charge of all individuals confined in it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 341.01 (\"The sheriff shall have charge of the county jail and all persons confined therein.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Generally, if an individual is convicted of a misdemeanor offense by a court located in Toledo,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that individual serves any jail sentence imposed at the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio (\"CCNO\"). CCNO is the product of agreements between Defiance County, Fulton County, Henry County, Lucas County, Williams County, and the City of Toledo to construct and operate a multicounty-municipal correctional center. CCNO has operated under successive organizational and operational agreements since 1988. In 2011, the five member counties and Toledo entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Organizational and Operational Agreement for the Corrections Commission of Northwest Ohio's Multicounty-Municipal Correctional Center (\"Fourth Agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Under the Fourth Agreement, the Commission was tasked with the management, maintenance, operation, occupation, repair, and administration of CCNO. The Commission consisted of the sheriff and one member of the board of commissioners from each member county, and the Toledo chief of police and mayor. The Fourth Agreement required the Commission to appoint an executive director, who was in charge of CCNO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} As mandated by the Fourth Agreement and CCNO's fiscal agent, each member had to remit its share of CCNO's annual operating and capital costs on a quarterly basis. The amount owed by each member depended on the number of beds reserved by the member. Toledo reserved 228 beds, or 35.65 percent of the available beds. Thus, Toledo owed 35.65 percent of CCNO's annual operating and capital costs. Lucas County, which reserved 203 beds, owed 31.84 percent of the annual operating and capital costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The Fourth Agreement permitted the Commission to rent unused beds to members and non-members. The Commission charged a per diem rate for the rental of beds. If a member's unused beds were rented, that member received a credit based on its percentage of total unused bed space available on a monthly basis. The Commission entered that credit on the member's quarterly invoices as an off-set against the member's proportional share of the operating and capital costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Finally, the Fourth Agreement provided that it could be \"modified, amended or supplemented in any respect not prohibited by law upon the approval of the modification, amendment or supplement by a two-thirds roll call vote of the Commission representatives and by the governing bodies of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Members.\" (Commission's Ex. F, Fourth Agreement, Section 10.) Once approved, the modification, amendment, or supplement would become binding on the Commission and all members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In 1998, CCNO's executive director codified the billing rules CCNO used. However, neither the billing rules nor the successive organizational and operational agreements addressed how to divide between Lucas County and Toledo the cost of housing prisoners sentenced to a jail term by a court located in Toledo. In practice, offenders convicted in the Toledo Municipal Court filled beds Toledo paid for, while offenders convicted in the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas filled beds Lucas County paid for.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Toledo challenged this practice in 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Toledo's challenge began because, on October 15, 2014, Toledo's mayor directed the Toledo Police Department to stop charging alleged offenders under the Toledo ordinances if a comparable Revised Code offense existed. This directive constituted a sea change, as the Toledo Police Department had previously charged misdemeanors mostly under Toledo's ordinances. After mandating this change, Toledo's mayor initiated a campaign to alter CCNO's billing practices. Toledo's mayor urged CCNO's executive director to charge Lucas County with the cost of housing all prisoners convicted of a violation of the Revised Code, regardless of which Toledo-based court sentenced the prisoner. Under the rule proposed by Toledo's mayor, Toledo would only have the responsibility of providing for those few prisoners convicted of violating ordinances for which there was no Revised Code equivalent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The executive director capitulated. On October 27, 2014, the executive director adopted the rule that, \"[i]f the City of Toledo issues a criminal complaint under the Ohio Revised Code versus [the] Toledo Municipal Code[,] that charge is billed to Lucas County.\" (Commission's Ex. K, CCNO Ohio Billing Rules, Rule 13.) CCNO then began assigning beds based on the type of offense (i.e., an ordinance violation versus a state law violation), instead of the sentencing court (i.e., Toledo Municipal Court versus Lucas County Court of Common Pleas).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} As a result of the rule change, offenders who had once filled Toledo beds began occupying Lucas County beds instead. Lucas County soon developed a need for more beds than the 203 beds that it had reserved. Toledo, on the other hand, had numerous empty beds. CCNO began billing Lucas County thousands of dollars, in addition to its proportional share of\n   costs, for the rental of extra beds. At the same time, CCNO issued credits to Toledo for the rental of its empty beds to Lucas County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Lucas County resisted this cost transfer. At that time, an ad hoc committee was drafting the Fifth Amended and Restated Organizational and Operational Agreement for the Corrections Commission of Northwest Ohio's Multicounty-Municipal Correction Center (\"Fifth Agreement\"). As a result of Lucas County's efforts, the committee added to the draft a section stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   All Members which are a municipal corporation and operate a municipal court established in Section 1901.02 of the Ohio Revised Code bear the fiscal responsibility for the costs of incarceration of inmates/prisoners originating out of the jurisdiction of their municipal court, regardless of the criminal code for which the prisoner is held or sentenced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Commission's Ex. S, Fifth Agreement, Section 7(L).) This section was intended to reimpose on Toledo the obligation to pay the costs for all prisoners sentenced by the Toledo Municipal Court, no matter what the nature of the offense charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 13} At the Commission's May 27, 2015 meeting, the Commission adopted the Fifth Agreement. With the exception of one abstention, all of the five counties' representatives voted in favor of the Fifth Agreement. Toledo's mayor and chief of police cast the only dissenting votes. Subsequently, the boards of commissioners of the five member counties approved the Fifth Agreement. Toledo refused to approve the Fifth Agreement, and its director of finance did not certify that Toledo possessed, or was in the process of collecting, the amount required to meet Toledo's financial obligations under the Fifth Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On December 7, 2015, Toledo filed an action against the Commission; the Boards of Commissioners of Defiance County, Fulton County, Henry County, Lucas County, and Williams County; and the Sheriff. Along with other claims, Toledo sought declaratory judgments stating that: (1) Lucas County was responsible for the costs of housing state prisoners,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   regardless of what authority committed the arrest and what Toledo-based court imposed the sentence, and (2) the Fifth Agreement was not binding on Toledo. The Commission and each of the named Boards of Commissioners filed counterclaims against Toledo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The trial court ordered the parties to brief the issues raised by Toledo's claims for declaratory judgment. In its briefing, Toledo argued that it only had a statutory obligation to pay for housing individuals charged and convicted of violations of Toledo's ordinances. Toledo maintained that Lucas County was responsible for the costs of incarcerating those charged and convicted of state law misdemeanors. In response, the Board and Sheriff asserted that the statutory duty to pay for housing prisoners turned on the court that adjudicated the prisoners' cases, not the type of offense. The Board and Sheriff thus contended that Toledo had to pay to house those prisoners under the jurisdiction of the Toledo Municipal Court, while Lucas County had the responsibility to pay for housing prisoners under the jurisdiction of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} As to its second claim, Toledo argued that it was bound by the Fourth Agreement, but not the Fifth Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Commission\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserted that Toledo was obligated to perform under the Fifth Agreement, even though Toledo neither adopted it nor certified the availability of funds to meet the payment terms contained in it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In a judgment issued June 27, 2016, the trial court granted Toledo summary judgment on each of its claims. The trial court declared that, \"where a municipal police department arrests, detains and charges an individual pursuant to a violation of state law, it is the county who is financially responsible for the incarceration of that individual and the accompanying costs associated therewith.\" (June 27, 2016 Order at 5.) The trial court also declared that the Fifth Agreement did not bind Toledo, and instead, the Fourth Agreement delineated Toledo's contractual rights and responsibilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The Commission, Board, and Sheriff appealed the June 27, 2016 judgment. On appeal, the Commission assigns the following errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [1.] The Lucas County Court of Common Pleas erred when it granted Partial Summary Judgment to the City and determined the City was not bound to the Fifth Amended Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [2.] The Lucas County Court of Common Pleas erred when it granted Partial Summary Judgment to the City and determined that Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 307.93 requires unanimous consent of CCNO members to amend its Operating Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The Board assigns the following error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The trial court erred in entering partial summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee and against Defendant-Appellant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The Sheriff assigns the following error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The Common Pleas Court committed prejudicial error when it granted the City of Toledo's motion for summary judgment and when it denied the Sheriff's motion for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 21} We will begin our review with the Board's and Sheriff's assignments of error. Both of these assignments of error challenge the trial court's conclusion that, under Ohio law, Lucas County must pay the cost of incarcerating individuals charged with or convicted of state law misdemeanors, regardless of the court that adjudicates those individuals' cases. The Board and Sheriff argue that the trial court's conclusion is wrong because the court ignored R.C. 753.02(A). According to the Board and Sheriff, R.C. 753.02(A) imposes upon Toledo the duty to: (1) operate its own detention facility or contract with Lucas County to house prisoners, and (2) pay for housing all prisoners charged with or convicted of a misdemeanor in the Toledo Municipal Court. In response, Toledo asserts that R.C. 753.02(A) is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 22} To resolve the parties' dispute, we must construe the language of R.C. 753.02(A). A question of statutory construction presents an issue of law that appellate courts review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Lang v.

In determining that intent, courts first look to the statutory language and the purpose to be accomplished.\n   <em>\n    Hulsmeyer\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. When a statute's meaning is clear and unambiguous, courts apply the statute as written.\n   <em>\n    Summerville\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.

To discern that purpose, courts may consider several factors, including the object sought to be obtained, the legislative history, and the consequences of a particular construction. R.C. 1.49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In its entirety, R.C. 753.02(A) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The legislative authority of a municipal corporation shall provide by ordinance for sustaining all persons sentenced to or confined in a prison or station house at the expense of the municipal corporation, and in counties where prisons or station houses are in quarters leased from the board of county commissioners, may contract with the board for the care and maintenance of those persons by the sheriff or other person charged with the care and maintenance of county prisoners. On the presentation of bills for food, sustenance, and necessary supplies, to the proper officer, certified by the person whom the legislative authority designates, the officer shall audit the bills under the rules prescribed by the legislative authority, and draw the officer's order on the treasurer of the municipal corporation in favor of the person presenting the bill.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Initially, we see nothing in the plain language of R.C. 753.02(A) that requires a municipal corporation to either operate its own detention facility or contract with the county for the housing of prisoners. Outside of R.C. 753.02(A), the Revised Code contains multiple statutes governing municipal corporations' ability to establish and operate a detention facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 715.16(A) (\"Any municipal corporation may: (A) Establish, erect, maintain, and regulate jails, * * * workhouses, station houses, [and] prisons * * *.\"); R.C. 717.01(F) (\"Each municipal corporation may do any of the following: * * * Construct * * * prisons * * *.\"); R.C. 753.21(B) (authorizing the legislative authority of a municipal corporation to permit the use of certain types of structures as a minimum security jail). By the repeated use of the word \"may,\" these statutes permit, but do not require, a municipal corporation to found and run a detention facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smucker v. Levin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5806206\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/113/337/\">\n    113 Ohio St.3d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-2073\">\n    2007-Ohio-2073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=865%20N.E.2d%20866\">\n    865 N.E.2d 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14 ' \"May\" is generally construed to render optional, permissive, or discretionary the provision in which it is embodied.' \"). Nothing in R.C. 753.02(A) transforms this statutory authority to establish a municipal detention facility into a statutory mandate. Rather, the only mandate\n   in R.C. 753.02(A) is the provision of payment for the sustenance of certain prisoners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Moreover, R.C. 753.02(A) contains no requirement that a municipal corporation contract with the county for the detention of prisoners. If the municipal corporation leases space from the county for a prison or station house, then the municipal corporation \"may contract\" with the county for the sheriff to care for and maintain the prisoners housed in that space. R.C. 753.02(A). Due to the use of \"may,\" the statute leaves the option to contract to the municipal corporation's discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smucker\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. When the municipal corporation choses to enter such a contract, it must pay the county for the \"food, sustenance, and necessary supplies\" the sheriff provides to the prisoners. R.C. 753.02(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Given the plain language of R.C. 753.02(A), we reject the Board's and Sheriff's contention that the statute compels a municipal corporation to either operate its own detention facility or contract with the county to house and sustain prisoners. R.C. 753.02(A) does not address the establishment of detention facilities at all, and it permits, but does not require, a municipal corporation to contract with the county. Accordingly, we turn to the question of whether R.C. 753.02(A) requires Toledo to assume the costs of imprisoning individuals charged with or convicted of misdemeanors in the Toledo Municipal Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Indisputably, by the first clause of the first sentence of R.C. 753.02(A), the General Assembly imposes a duty on municipal corporations to pay the cost of sustaining prisoners. The statute, however, is less clear regarding which prisoners municipal corporations must provide sustenance. Pursuant to the plain language of the statute, municipal corporations must pay for sustaining \"all persons sentenced to or confined in a prison or station house.\" R.C. 753.02(A). If we read this language literally, we would necessarily conclude that municipal corporations have to shoulder the expense of sustaining all individuals held in any Ohio prison, including those institutions under the control of the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. This reading is implausible, and consequently, we must delve further into R.C. 753.02(A) to determine its meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The General Assembly first enacted the statutory language that now appears in R.C. 753.02(A) in 1869 as part of a comprehensive act providing for the organization and government of municipal corporations. For our purposes, three sections enacted in 1869 are relevant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Sec. 215.

It shall be the duty of the marshal or chief of police to provide all persons confined to such prison, watch or station houses, with necessary food during such confinement, and to see that such places of confinement are kept clean and made comfortable for the inmates thereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Sec. 217. The council shall provide, by ordinance, for sustaining all persons sentenced to or confined in such prison at the expense of the corporation; and on the presentation of bills for food, sustenance and necessary supplies to the proper officer, certified to by such person or persons as the council may designate, not exceeding forty cents a day, such officer shall audit the same under such rules and regulations as the council may prescribe, and draw his order on the treasurer of the corporation in favor of the officer presenting such bill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   66 Ohio Laws 185-86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 29} This historical context elucidates the meaning of R.C. 753.02(A). Section 217 of the 1869 act required a municipal corporation to pay for sustaining all persons sentenced to or confined in \"such prison,\" i.e., the prison the municipal corporation had the power to erect, establish, and maintain pursuant to Section 215. Thus, the statute, as originally passed, required municipal corporations to pay for the sustenance of prisoners sentenced to or confined in\n   <em>\n    municipal\n   </em>\n   prisons or station houses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Although much of the context that surrounded the 1869 statute has fallen away, the language of present-day R.C. 753.02(A) corresponds closely with its predecessor. Moreover, even today, the Revised Code permits municipal corporations to \"[e]stablish, erect, maintain, and regulate * * * station houses [and] prisons.\" R.C. 715.16(A). Given the consistency in the relevant statutory language, we conclude that R.C. 753.02(A) serves the same purpose it served when originally enacted. Thus, R.C. 753.02(A) requires a municipal corporation to pay the expense of sustaining those persons it holds in the prison or station house that it establishes or maintains.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Our conclusion is strengthened by the two cases that have reviewed R.C. 753.02(A) and determined its meaning. In\n   <em>\n    Univ. Hosps. v. Cleveland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6703523\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-misc/28/134/#p138\">\n    28 Ohio Misc. 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 138,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=276%20N.E.2d%20273\">\n    276 N.E.2d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.P.1971), the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas held that R.C. 753.02\"clearly provides that the municipal corporation shall provide for the sustenance of all persons sentenced to or confined in a\n   <em>\n    municipal\n   </em>\n   prison.\" (Emphasis added.) Likewise, the Ninth District Court of Appeals determined that R.C. 753.02(A) places upon a municipal corporation \"the responsibility of furnishing necessities to persons confined in\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   prison.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Akron City Hosp. v. Akron\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist.

Toledo does not possess a prison or station house. R.C. 753.02(A), therefore, does not impose any financial obligations on Toledo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The Board and Sheriff cite multiple cases that they characterize as supporting their argument that Toledo must pay for the care and sustenance of all prisoners charged with or convicted of misdemeanors\n   in the Toledo Municipal Court. These cases, however, conform with our interpretation of R.C. 753.02(A). A decision from this court,\n   <em>\n    St. Vincent Hosp. &amp; Med. Ctr. v. Shatzer\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist. No. L-85-150,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1986%20WL%201304\">\n    1986 WL 1304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan. 31, 1986) illustrates this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In\n   <em>\n    Shatzer\n   </em>\n   , a prisoner held in the Norwalk City Jail deliberately set a fire, which seriously burned him. The prisoner received medical treatment at St. Vincent Hospital, and the hospital sued the city seeking payment for the medical services it rendered to the prisoner. After quoting R.C. 753.02(A), this court held that Norwalk was liable for the costs of the prisoner's medical care because it had exerted actual, physical dominion and control over the prisoner at the time of his injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Under our interpretation of R.C. 753.02(A), a municipal corporation must pay to sustain the prisoners held in its prison or station house. In\n   <em>\n    Shatzer\n   </em>\n   , we required Norwalk to pay for the medical care of a prisoner because that prisoner was held in Norwalk's jail when he suffered injury. Our conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Shatzer\n   </em>\n   that care is incident to custody is completely consistent with a municipal corporation's duty, under R.C. 753.02(A), to assume the cost of providing sustenance for the prisoners it holds in its prison or station house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Finally, the rules of statutory interpretation preclude us from adopting the Board's and Sheriff's interpretation of R.C. 753.02(A). Both the Board and Sheriff construe R.C. 753.02(A) to obligate a municipal corporation to pay the cost of sustaining prisoners charged with or convicted of misdemeanors in the municipal court located in the municipal corporation. However, nothing in the text of R.C. 753.02(A) premises a municipal corporation's payment obligation on the kind of court that adjudicates prisoners' cases. Therefore, to interpret R.C. 753.02(A) as the Board and Sheriff advocate, we would have to add language to the statute. We cannot do this.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Application of Columbus S.

We, therefore, turn our attention to R.C. 1905.35, the statute that Toledo claims resolves how to divide imprisonment costs between it and Lucas County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Pursuant to R.C. 1905.35 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Imprisonment under the ordinances of a municipal corporation shall be in the workhouse or other jail of the municipal corporation. Any municipal corporation not provided with a workhouse, or other jail, may, for the purpose of imprisonment, use the county jail, at the expense of the municipal corporation, until the municipal corporation is provided with a prison, house of correction, or workhouse. Persons so imprisoned in the county jail are under the charge of the sheriff. Such sheriff shall receive and hold such persons in the manner prescribed by the ordinances of the municipal corporation, until such persons are legally discharged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \"Imprisonment,\" as used in R.C. 1905.35, means \"being imprisoned\n   under a sentence imposed for an offense or serving a term of imprisonment, prison term, jail term, term of local incarceration, or other term under a sentence imposed for an offense * * *.\" R.C. 1.05(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Under the plain language of R.C. 1905.35, a municipal corporation must pay the cost of housing persons convicted of a city ordinance, either by incarcerating those persons in its own detention facility or reimbursing the sheriff for maintaining such persons in the county jail. Moreover, by explicitly requiring municipal corporations to pay for the incarceration of ordinance violators, R.C. 1905.35 implicitly relieves municipal corporations from the obligation to pay for incarcerating state law violators.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Myers v.

Because that language does not limit the statute's application to imprisonment ordered by a mayor's court, we must reject the Board's and Sheriff's interpretation of R.C. 1905.35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 44} R.C. 1905.35, however, only provides a partial answer to whether Toledo or Lucas County must pay for housing prisoners charged with or convicted of a misdemeanor in a Toledo-based court. R.C. 1905.35 addresses postconviction imprisonment; it gives no guidance as to which governmental subdivision must pay for housing pretrial detainees. Fortunately, the Board has provided us with direction. The Board has conceded that, \"[w]hen a detainee is housed in the county jail, the sheriff has actual custody, and responsibility for the costs of confinement rests on the County without regard to any statute-ordinance distinction.\" (Board's Reply Brief at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 45} The Board's concession is consistent with the law governing the circumstances present in Lucas County. As we stated above, individuals arrested in Toledo for misdemeanor violations are housed in the LCCC if they are denied bail or cannot pay the bail amount set by the court. The Sheriff has charge of the LCCC and all persons confined there. R.C. 341.01. The Sheriff has the duty to \"keep * * * persons [confined in the county jail] safely, attend to the jail, and govern and regulate the jail according to the minimum standards for jails in Ohio promulgated by the department of rehabilitation and correction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under the standards applying to full-service jails, the Sheriff must provide a minimum level of security, sanitation, food, clothes, bedding, and medical services to LCCC inmates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 5120:1-8. Lucas County, therefore, must bear the cost of providing housing, food, clothes, bedding, and medical care to LCCC prisoners, including pretrial detainees with misdemeanor cases pending before the Toledo Municipal Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shatzer\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist.

The contract did not include an R.C. 5705.41(D)(1) certificate. Island Creek stopped paying under the contract, and Jefferson County sued it. In response, Island Creek argued that it was not bound by the contract because the contract lacked an R.C. 5705.41(D)(1) certificate.

Here, R.C. 5705.41(D)(1) imposes a mandatory obligation on subdivisions to attach a certificate from its fiscal officer to any contract it makes, with specifically enumerated exceptions. Those enumerated exceptions do not include contracts between two or more public subdivisions. Consequently, in the cases the Commission and Sheriff cite, the courts exceeded the boundaries of their discretion in applying an uncodified exception to the R.C. 5105.41(D)(1) requirement. For this reason, we cannot follow those cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Next, the Sheriff argues that R.C. 307.19 exempts the Fifth Agreement from compliance with R.C. 5105.41(D)(1). R.C. 307.19 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Sections 307.14 to 307.19, inclusive, of the Revised Code, do not repeal or abrogate other sections of the Revised Code authorizing contracts or agreements among particular classes of subdivisions, or modify or impair the force of such sections in respect of contracts or agreements entered into under such sections. Nor shall such other sections control or limit the making of agreements under sections 307.14 to 307.19, inclusive, of the Revised Code ; it being intended that such sections shall be applied as fully as though such other sections did not exist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Relying on the second sentence of R.C. 307.19, the Sheriff argues that no Revised Code sections, other than R.C. 307.14 to 307.19, control or limit the Fifth Agreement, which the parties made under R.C. 307.15. Thus, the Sheriff contends, the requirements of R.C. 5105.41(D)(1) do not exist as to the Fifth Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 58} The Sheriff misreads R.C. 307.19. The \"such other sections\" that do not control or limit agreements made under R.C. 307.14 to 307.19 are \"other sections of the Revised Code authorizing contracts or agreements among particular classes of subdivisions.\" To reach his interpretation, the Sheriff disregards the limiting phrase \"authorizing contracts or agreements among particular classes of subdivisions.\" The Sheriff interprets R.C. 307.19 as if the \"such other sections\" that do not control or limit agreements made under R.C. 307.14 to 307.19 were\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   \"other sections of the Revised Code.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 59} However, in interpreting a statute, courts cannot delete language used in the statute.\n   <em>\n    Cleveland Elec. Illuminating Co. v. Cleveland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1831057\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/37/50/\">\n    37 Ohio St.3d 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=524%20N.E.2d%20441\">\n    524 N.E.2d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988), paragraph three of the syllabus (\"In matters of construction, it is the duty of [a] court to give effect to the words used, not to delete words used or to insert words not used.\"). Read in its entirety, R.C. 307.19 does not exempt contracts made under R.C. 307.15 from all other Revised Code sections. Instead, R.C. 307.19 only exempts contracts made under R.C. 307.15 from other Revised Code sections \"authorizing contracts or agreements among particular classes of subdivisions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 60} R.C. 5105.41(D)(1) does not authorize contracts or agreements among particular classes of subdivisions. R.C. 307.19, therefore, does not preclude the application of R.C. 5105.41(D)(1) to the Fifth Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 61} In sum, we reject all the reasons the Commission and Sheriff offer for exempting the Fifth Agreement from R.C. 5105.41(D)(1)'s certification requirement. Because Toledo's director of finance did not attach an R.C. 5105.41(D)(1) certificate to the Fifth Agreement, that agreement is invalid and nonbinding as to Toledo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 62} As a final matter, we must address the Sheriff's argument that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the interplay between Sections 6 and 8 of the Fourth Agreement. After reviewing the\n   trial court's judgment, we conclude that the trial court engaged in no such interpretation. The trial court merely concluded that Sections 6 and 8 of the Fourth Agreement bound Toledo. Thus, the trial court did not err as the Sheriff has alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Having concluded that the Fifth Agreement does not bind Toledo, we find no error in the trial court's declaration. Accordingly, we overrule the Commission's first assignment of error and the remainder of the Sheriff's assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 64} By the Commission's second assignment of error, it argues that the trial court erred in determining that the Fifth Agreement was not binding because the parties did not unanimously consent to it. We have concluded that the Fifth Agreement does not bind Toledo for a separate, unrelated reason. The Commission's second assignment of error, therefore, is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Finally, we turn to Toledo's cross-assignment of error, by which Toledo argues that the trial court erred in ruling that Toledo was not entitled to reimbursement of the payment it made to the Commission at the end of the second quarter of 2016. This cross-assignment of error is not properly before this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Pursuant to App.R. 3(C) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (1)\n   <strong>\n    Cross appeal required.\n   </strong>\n   A person who intends to defend a judgment or order against an appeal by an appellant and who also seeks to change the judgment or order or, in the event the judgment or order may be reversed or modified, an interlocutory ruling merged into the judgment or order, shall file a notice of cross appeal within the time allowed by App.R. 4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (2)\n   <strong>\n    Cross appeal and cross-assignment of error not required.\n   </strong>\n   A person who intends to defend a judgment or order appealed by an appellant on a ground other than that relied on by the trial court but who does not seek to change the judgment or order is not required to file a notice of cross appeal or to raise a cross-assignment of error.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 67} Here, by its cross-assignment of error, Toledo seeks to reverse the trial court's ruling that denied it reimbursement. Thus, App.R. 3(C)(1) required Toledo to file a notice of cross appeal. Toledo did not do that. Accordingly, we cannot consider Toledo's argument, and therefore, we dismiss the cross-assignment of error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. Waidelich\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist.
