Kanaan, following a jury-waived trial. He contends that the plaintiff's claim for breach of contract is barred by the statute of limitations, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2.

The statute of limitations, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2, bars claims for breach of contract commenced six years after the cause of action accrues, see\n   <em>\n    OneBeacon America Ins.

Under the Massachusetts discovery rule, however, \"a claim accrues and the statute of limitations clock commences when a plaintiff knows, or reasonably should have known, 'that she has been harmed or may have been harmed by the defendant's conduct.' \"\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lorillard Tobacco Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275805\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/465/411/#p449\">\n    465 Mass. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 449 (2013), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Eli Lilly &amp; Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3890281\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/408/204/#p205\">\n    408 Mass. 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 205-206 (1990). Usually, this happens when a plaintiff is \"informed of facts that would suggest to a reasonably prudent person in the same position\" that such harm has occurred and was caused by the defendant's conduct.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tradition (N.

Here, the trial judge could find that the plaintiff did not know, nor reasonably could have known, that the defendant was capable of repaying the loan until after the plaintiff's visit in April, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275178\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/464/400/#p414\">\n    464 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   414 ;\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275805\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/465/411/#p449\">\n    465 Mass. at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The judge found that the contract required repayment only when the defendant was financially able to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Anesthesiologists in the United States earn significantly more than they do in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabian plaintiff, however, was unaware of this and had no reason to believe otherwise, especially based on the defendant's repeated misrepresentations of financial hardship. It was objectively reasonable to take the defendant's word without further investigation, see\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275805\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/465/411/#p449\">\n    465 Mass. at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , given that the loan was ostensibly made in good faith between family members accustomed to helping one another in this fashion.

The trial judge found that the contract did not contemplate payment on demand, but rather required payment only when the defendant was financially able to pay. This finding followed the plaintiff's testimony, and the trial judge was entitled to find the plaintiff credible. See\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275178\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/464/400/#p414\">\n    464 Mass. at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly immaterial is whether the contract contemplated installment payments; the judge credited the plaintiff's testimony that he had no knowledge of the breach until April, 2011. Accordingly, the claim accrued then under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2. See\n   <em>\n    Tradition (N. America) Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%2063\">\n    91 Mass. App. Ct. at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Moreover, we discern no error in the trial judge's finding that the fraudulent concealment doctrine requires the same result. Codified in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 12, the statute provides, \"If a person liable to a personal action fraudulently conceals the cause of such action from the knowledge of the person entitled to bring it, the period prior to the discovery of his cause of action by the person so entitled shall be excluded in determining the time limited for the commencement of the action.\" See\n   <em>\n    Hays\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ellrich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320314\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/592/#p601\">\n    471 Mass. 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 601-602 (2015). The trial judge found that the defendant's repeated misrepresentations as to his financial ability to repay the loan concealed his breach of contract until the plaintiff discovered otherwise in April, 2011. Section 12 thereby operates to toll the accrual of the plaintiff's cause of action until April, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under either theory, the statute of limitations pursuant to G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2, did not commence to run until the plaintiff first became aware of the defendant's ability to repay the loan in April, 2011. The action, commenced in 2015, was properly brought within the six-year period from the date the cause of action accrued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    During that visit to the defendant's home, the plaintiff observed that the defendant clearly enjoyed financial security and an affluent lifestyle, owning an expensive house and several expensive cars.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    On appeal, the parties do not dispute the existence of a valid contract or that payment was not required until the defendant was financially able to repay at least some portion of the loan.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
