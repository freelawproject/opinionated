We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Goff filed an amended complaint in the underlying tort action against Kim, Matthew Lavoie, Barbara S. Lavoie, and Richard J. Lavoie. The amended complaint alleges that on August 9, 2009, while at a party at the Lavoies' house, Kim struck Goff in the face with his fist, causing Goff serious and permanent injuries. Kim's father, Kyung Kim, was insured under a homeowners policy, and under a \"personal umbrella liability endorsement\" to that policy, issued by Quincy Mutual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2014, after being notified of the incident and pending lawsuit, Quincy Mutual filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no obligation to defend or indemnify Kim with respect to claims asserted by Goff arising out of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   We review the trial judge's findings of fact for clear error and review de novo rulings on questions of law.

The interpretation of an insurance contract presents an issue of law for the court.\n   <em>\n    Jefferson Ins. Co. of N.Y\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Holyoke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993550\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/23/472/#p475\">\n    23 Mass. App. Ct. 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 475 (1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On the basis of credible testimony by three witnesses, the trial judge found that Kim delivered three closed-fist punches to Goff's face, knocking him unconscious and causing him to strike his head on the pavement as he fell to the ground. Goff suffered serious injuries, including a fractured face, jaw, and skull, and developed a seizure disorder. The judge made specific and detailed findings that the incident was not an accident or an act of self-defense, but that Kim intentionally, without provocation, struck Goff in the face with the purpose of causing him injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The homeowners policy at issue here provides for coverage to an insured for bodily injury resulting from an \"occurrence.\" An \"occurrence\" is defined as \"an accident ... which results ... in 'bodily injury.' \" Personal liability coverage does not apply to \" 'bodily injury' ... [w]hich is expected or intended by the 'insured,' \" nor does it apply to \" 'bodily injury' ... [a]rising out of ... physical ... abuse.\" The personal umbrella liability endorsement also covers bodily injuries resulting from an occurrence. Under the umbrella coverage, an \"occurrence\" is likewise defined as \"an accident ... which results ... in ... '[b]odily injury.' \" Coverage is excluded for bodily injury arising out of \"criminal acts,\" or \"an act which is expected or intended by an 'insured' to cause 'bodily injury.' \" Since Kim was the perpetrator of an intentional attack, the judge concluded that the defendants did not prove the incident was an \"occurrence\" within the meaning of the policy and that coverage was precluded pursuant to the exclusions in the policy and endorsement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendants argue that because Kim did not specifically intend to cause the harm to Goff that resulted when his head hit the pavement, and it was not substantially certain that such harm would occur from punching Goff in the face, the injuries resulted from an accident and are not excluded by the intentional act provisions of the homeowners policy and umbrella endorsement. The argument fails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Judicial Court has observed that the very nature of some acts carry with them an intent to cause harm as a matter of law.
