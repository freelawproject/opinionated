Winsum contends that the judge erred in concluding that its right to enforce a parking prohibition on the south side of Hamilton Place, a private way in Boston, has been extinguished by Winter Street's adverse use of six parking spaces for a period greater than twenty years. Winter Street maintains that any rights that Winsum had to enforce a parking ban on the whole of Hamilton Place were granted through a restriction that expired in 1980. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We briefly summarize the evidence presented to the judge on Winsum's motion for partial summary judgment. In 1950, Loew's Boston Theaters Company (Loew's) and The Boston Real Estate Trust (BRE Trust) entered into an indenture in which BRE Trust granted Loew's easement rights \"to use [Hamilton] Place throughout its entire extent for purposes of travel on foot and with vehicles, and of light and air.\" In addition, the parties agreed that \"[n]either party shall permit vehicles to stand in Hamilton Place longer than necessary for loading and unloading.\" In 1994, Winsum acquired and became successor in interest to Loew's interest. In 2007, Winter Street acquired and became successor in interest to the Janelon Trust's (Janelon) interest, which had acquired its interest from BRE Trust. Both Winsum and Winter Street became bound to the rights identified in the 1950 indenture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Winsum's property presently houses the Orpheum Theatre and The Corner Mall, a twenty-tenant enclosed retail mall. Hamilton Place, which extends from Tremont Street, is the main access point to the Orpheum Theatre as well as a second access point to The Corner Mall. Members of the public use Hamilton Place to access both locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Since at least 1979, Janelon employees parked cars in six parking spaces on the south side of Hamilton Place-in direct conflict with Winsum's rights established in the indenture. In addition, any vehicle parked without Janelon's permission was towed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Janelon did not receive any complaints about the use of the parking spaces. Janelon used the spaces on a daily basis for itself and its guests from the time it acquired the property until it sold the property to Winter Street in 2007. Winsum's agent, Thomas Frawley,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   submitted an affidavit dated January 2016, asserting, however, that \"[r]ecently, Winter Street or its agents have allowed parking in Hamilton Place.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2015, the board of appeal of Boston (board) granted Winter Street a variance permitting three food trucks to use the north side of Hamilton Place (as opposed to the south side where Winter Street used the six parking spaces). Subsequently, Winsum brought the present action in the Superior Court, appealing the board's decision granting the variance and seeking declaratory relief to determine the parties' rights in Hamilton Place. The Superior Court judge allowed, in part, Winsum's motion for partial summary judgment. Separate and final judgment then entered pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20820\">\n    365 Mass. 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974).

Winter Street contends that the judge erred in concluding that the parking prohibition in the indenture was a feature of the affirmative easement not subject to the thirty-year limitation for restrictions set forth in G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 23. It maintains that Winsum no longer has the right to enforce the parking prohibition anywhere on Hamilton Place because the rights conferred in the indenture should be classified as a restriction that expired in 1980, thirty years after it was signed.

This right was of value given the nature of the commercial operations, which included a theater. The rights identified in the indenture are properly classified as an affirmative easement.

As a matter of law, the judge correctly determined that Winsum holds an affirmative easement and thus its rights established in the indenture are not subject to the thirty-year limitation set forth in G.

The Frawley affidavit states that \"[r]ecently, Winter Street or its agents have allowed parking in Hamilton Place.\" The affidavit not does raise a dispute of material fact because it fails to challenge the evidence of adverse, exclusive, and continuous use beginning in 1979.
