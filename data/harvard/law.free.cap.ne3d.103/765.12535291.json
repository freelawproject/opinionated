The May, 1929, deed expressly grants easement rights to \"[Daley], and\n   <em>\n    to those claiming under him\n   </em>\n   as their respective interests may appear as\n   <em>\n    appurtenant to the land\n   </em>\n   on Downer Avenue and Jarvis Avenue ...\n   <em>\n    conveyed to said Daley by George A. Cole by deed dated March 5, 1929\n   </em>\n   \" (emphases supplied). The grantor explicitly intended the easement to be appurtenant and to benefit the land on Downer and Jarvis Avenues conveyed in the March, 1929, Daley-Cole deed as the dominant estate. The easement runs with the land, and benefits all possessors of those lots. The May, 1929, deed also identifies the easement as granting recreational use of \"the beach and shore of Hingham harbor opposite the end of Melville Walk and Lot 1 on [the 1897 Plan]\" (the servient estate). Given that it would be inconsistent with the intention of the grantor to provide for the use of the beach while denying the necessary access to do so, it is well-established that the conveyance must include access rights through an implied easement. See\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Olsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582814\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/417/#p423\">\n    63 Mass.

All the plaintiffs in this appeal claim under Daley as owners of lots within the dominant estate, and thereby hold easement rights to access the beach as conferred by the May, 1929, deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Moreover, the fact that Daley conveyed lots presently owned by certain plaintiffs to Higgins, prior to the May, 1929, deed, does not invalidate the rights of those plaintiffs. This case does not involve a chain-of-title defect in the grantor of a purported easement, see\n   <em>\n    Dalessio\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Baggia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1250612\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/57/468/#p469\">\n    57 Mass. App. Ct. 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 469-472 (2003), as the defendants do not dispute that the Downer estate retained access rights in their predecessors' property at the time of the May, 1929, deed. Nor do the defendants claim a title defect such that the encumbrance imposed on their property could not be reasonably ascertained. See\n   <em>\n    Devine\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nantucket\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817720\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/499/#p507\">\n    449 Mass. 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 507 (2007). Indeed, the defendants were well aware that the May, 1929, deed subjected their property to easements at the time of its conveyance. Rather, the defendants argue that the easement's\n   <em>\n    grantees\n   </em>\n   cannot include those plaintiffs tracing title through Higgins because they are outside Daley's record title chain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appurtenant easements, however, are not required to be recorded in the grantees' title.\n   <em>\n    Cheever\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Graves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4009108\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/32/601/#p606\">\n    32 Mass.

Similarly, the grantee owner or successors in interest of the dominant estate need not be specifically or even correctly identified at the time of conveyance.

Rather, it is required only that the dominant and servient estates be reasonably ascertainable. See\n   <em>\n    Haugh\n   </em>\n   , 64 Mass. at 785. Likewise, \"[w]hether a way is appurtenant to land depends upon its relation to the land in respect of use, and not upon any correspondence with the title of the owner in respect of duration.\"\n   <em>\n    Dennis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2104144\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/107/591/#p594\">\n    107 Mass. 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594 (1871). Once the appurtenant property is identified, \"[a]n easement is to be interpreted as available for use by the whole of the dominant tenement existing at the time of its creation.\"\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Planning Bd. of Brewster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276160\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/72/456/#p465\">\n    72 Mass.

It is thus irrelevant whether the plaintiffs trace title through Daley or Higgins, because they all possess property comprising the dominant estate at the time of the May, 1929, deed and in relation to use of the beach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Implied easement rights\n   </em>\n   . \"[R]ights and appurtenant easements pass by grant without specific mention,\"\n   <em>\n    Cheever\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4009108\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/32/601/#p606\">\n    32 Mass.

Thus, as it is now established that the Downer estate retained an easement by implication in Melville Walk, the deed thereby conveyed the same easement by implication across the defendants' property to the lots now owned by the plaintiffs. Any subsequent conveyance included all rights belonging to those properties under G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 15, including the implied rights necessary to access the beach.

The implied access rights, therefore, were appurtenant to the lots now owned by the plaintiffs at the time of the easement's creation in 1917, when the Downer estate conveyed the last of its interest in Melville Walk and severed its common ownership of the dominant and servient estates. The subsequent conveyance to the plaintiffs' predecessors, claiming through the Downer estate, would by implication include those preexisting access rights.

The May, 1929, deed did not, then, improperly impose a new easement across property no longer owned by the Downer estate, but expressly conveyed one that already validly existed over the defendants' land and appurtenant to the plaintiffs' property from inception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Indeed, as both the deed and attendant circumstances here demonstrate, see\n   <em>\n    Labounty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304982\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/352/337/#p346\">\n    352 Mass. at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the plaintiffs' properties have at all relevant times comprised the dominant estate.

Thus, when the plaintiffs' predecessors purchased that property in 1924, it was part of the dominant estate in regard to the implied easement across the defendants' property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The May, 1929, deed confirms this intention by expressly granting use of the beach to those particular lots only months before the expiration of the nearly-identical rights conferred in the 1879 indenture. To now invalidate the implied easement would effectively extinguish all other rights in the beach, contrary to the express intent of the parties and rendering the plaintiffs' rights in the beach useless.

There, we reversed part of the initial decision issued by the Land Court judge regarding ownership of the fee interest in the beach and held that the Downer estate, at the time of the May, 1929, deed conveying rights to use and access the beach, possessed the rights that it purported to convey by that deed.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3840019\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/78/749/#p756\">\n      Id\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3840019\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/78/749/#p756\">\n     . at 754-755\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In the second revised decision, dated May 16, 2014, the Land Court judge held on remand that interpreting the May, 1929, deed required (1) determining the identity of the deeded rights plaintiffs; and (2) determining what rights they hold. The judge, however, concluded that both issues required the Downer estate as a necessary party and deferred further determination of the matter. On subsequent appeal, we vacated that portion of the decision and again remanded to the Land Court to determine (1) which of the parties claiming to be \"deeded rights plaintiffs\" actually had rights to access and use the beach; and (2) the scope of those rights.

O'Connell was dismissed as a party to the action prior to this appeal, and the plaintiffs no longer claim any right adverse to the Schwartz property. During the pendency of this action, moreover, the Stimsons conveyed their property to Cedric and Elizabeth Vanzura, who were substituted as defendants. The Vanzuras then sold that property to Thomas and Dawn Martel, who have been substituted for the Vanzuras with the permission of the Land Court and are current defendants in this appeal. Likewise, the Donahues conveyed their property to Andrew Schlosberg, who was substituted for the Donahues and is a current defendant in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    See\n    <em>\n     Taylor\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457234\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/682/#p686\">\n     475 Mass. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    685 n.11, quoting from\n    <em>\n     Southwick\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Planning Bd. of Plymouth\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660151\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/65/315/\">\n     65 Mass.
