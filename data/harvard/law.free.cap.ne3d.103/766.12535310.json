At trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence that the defendant would drink one-half gallon of alcohol daily and that he was drinking alcohol the night of the killing.\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369469\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/426/290/#p297\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369469\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/426/290/#p297\">\n    at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"At trial, evidence was presented that the defendant was a heavy drinker and had consumed up to one-half a gallon of alcohol a day for many months prior to April 1, 1994\"). Nancy Burns, a toxicologist employed by the Department of State Police, office of alcohol testing, testified at Ward's trial that the cognitive functions of an individual with chronic alcohol tolerance would be the least of the body's functions to be affected by alcohol and, after coordination and perception, the last functions to be lost because of drinking. Five years later, in a hearing on an unrelated case, Burns testified essentially to the opposite: that cognitive functions are the first to be affected by alcohol, and that in a chronic tolerant alcoholic, cognitive ability would be more affected than other functions. She testified that an individual's failure to exhibit obvious signs of intoxication does not mean that the person's cognitive functioning is unimpaired. During cross-examination at that hearing, Burns was confronted with her testimony in the case at bar. She then testified that her opinion had changed after Ward's trial based on her reading of additional literature in the field.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   To prevail on a motion for new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence, the defendant must satisfy a two-prong test. First, he must demonstrate that the evidence was unknown and not reasonably discoverable at the time of trial.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Shuman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2822391\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/268/#p271\">\n    445 Mass. 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 271 (2005). As the Commonwealth concedes, Burns's subsequent testimony indeed constitutes \"newly discovered\" evidence, and so this prong is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Second, where the new evidence at issue invalidates inculpatory evidence presented at trial, a defendant must demonstrate that the inculpatory evidence \"likely was a 'real factor' in the jury's deliberations such that its elimination would cast real doubt on the justice of the defendant's conviction\" (emphasis omitted).\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cowels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145255\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/607/#p618\">\n    470 Mass. 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 618 (2015), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308647\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/340/#p350\">\n    469 Mass. 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 350 (2014). We agree with the motion judge that here, where the defendant conceded manslaughter at trial, the relevant question is whether Burns's testimony on the effects of intoxication would likely have been a real factor in the jury's efforts to distinguish murder in the second degree from involuntary manslaughter. We conclude that it would not have been.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Murder in the second degree is an unlawful killing with malice.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sires\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901200\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/413/292/#p296\">\n    413 Mass. 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 296 (1992). Involuntary manslaughter is an \"unintentional, unlawful killing caused by wanton or reckless conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Earle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270436\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/341/#p347\">\n    458 Mass. 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347 (2010). \"The difference between the elements of the third prong of malice and wanton and reckless conduct amounting to involuntary manslaughter lies in the degree of risk of physical harm that a reasonable person would recognize was created by particular conduct, based on what the defendant knew.\"\n   <em>\n    Sires\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 303 n.14. For purposes of third prong malice a jury must consider whether, \"in the circumstances known by the defendant, a reasonably prudent person would have recognized that [his] conduct would create a plain and strong likelihood of death.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3897544\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/411/293/#p298\">\n    411 Mass. 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298 (1991).
