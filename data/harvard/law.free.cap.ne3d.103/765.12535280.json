The defendant argues that the judge erred in denying the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty, at the close of the Commonwealth's case, on the charge of assault and battery on a household member. The defendant contends that the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence that on the date of the defendant's assault and battery upon the victim, she was a \"household member\" for purposes of G.

First, McWhinnie testified that the defendant had introduced the victim to her as his \"girlfriend.\" Compare\n   <em>\n    Dustin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20Mass.%201003\">\n    476 Mass. at 1004, 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (sufficient evidence of substantive dating relationship where defendant and victim were in boy friend-girl friend relationship, although not living together).

Second, McWhinnie testified that, for at least the week during which she and her son had shared a two-bedroom apartment with the defendant, the defendant and the victim shared the other bedroom. Third, McWhinnie's testimony provided evidence of a domestic financial relationship between the defendant and the victim; she testified that she had received a phone call from the defendant, who was at his residence, sounded \"irate,\" and complained that the victim had \"shut off her social security benefits card.\" McWhinnie heard the victim in the background, \"yell[ing] into the phone, 'He broke my jaw. Call 9-1-1.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, McWhinnie's testimony was sufficient to permit a jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was in a \"substantive dating relationship\" with the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Intimidation of a potential witness\n   </em>\n   . The target of the alleged witness intimidation was McWhinnie, who the parties agree was, at the relevant time, at most a \"potential witness.\" The defendant argues, and the Commonwealth concedes, that the evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant of this charge. The Commonwealth contends, however, that, under the recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Muckle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%201001\">\n    478 Mass. 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), which postdated the trial in this case, the District Court had no jurisdiction in the first place over a charge of intimidating a potential (as opposed to an actual) witness, so that we should order the complaint dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Muckle\n   </em>\n   was called upon to construe the language of a District Court jurisdictional statute, G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26, which had been amended in 1996 to include the phrase \"intimidation of a witness or juror under [ G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B ].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%201001\">\n    478 Mass. at 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court held that \"[t]he plain language of G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26, ... confers jurisdiction in the ... District Court over intimidation of a witness or juror, but not over intimidation of any other person.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%201001\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%201001\">\n    . at 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . See G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B(1)(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   )(i), (iii). Accordingly, the District Court lacked jurisdiction over a charge of intimidating \"a person furthering a court proceeding,\" a separate category of persons protected by G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, and at issue in\n   <em>\n    Muckle\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%201001\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%201001\">\n    . at 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . See G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B(1)(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   )(iv). Similarly, the Commonwealth suggests here, District Court jurisdiction does not extend to the crime of intimidating \"a potential witness\" under G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B(1)(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   )(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The flaw in the Commonwealth's argument is that, even before the jurisdictional statute was amended in 1996 to give the District Court jurisdiction over the crime of intimidating a \"witness,\" see\n   <em>\n    Muckle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%201001\">\n    478 Mass. at 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the word \"witness\" in G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, had been interpreted as applying to \"potential witnesses.\" See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1035675\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/40/275/#p278\">\n    40 Mass. App. Ct. 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 278 (1996) (\"There was no error in the instruction that the word 'witness' included 'potential witness' \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus the 1996 amendment effectively gave the District Court jurisdiction over the crime of intimidating a potential, as well as an actual, witness. We hardly think the Legislature's 2006 codification of the interpretation in\n   <em>\n    Burt\n   </em>\n   , see note 4,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , somehow deprived the District Court of such jurisdiction, nor do we see anything in\n   <em>\n    Muckle\n   </em>\n   as precluding the recognition of such jurisdiction. Accordingly, here, rather than ordering a dismissal on jurisdictional grounds, we reverse the defendant's conviction on sufficiency grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Jury instructions\n   </em>\n   . For the first time on appeal, the defendant argues that the judge erred by (a) providing the jury with a written summary of the elements of each charge that did not include the elements of self-defense on the charge of resisting arrest, and (b) failing to provide the jury with a complete audio recording of his jury instructions. We review to determine whether any error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"201298\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/438/290/#p297\">\n    438 Mass. 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297-298 (2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   a. The judge did not err in omitting, from the written summary of the elements furnished to the jury, the elements of self-defense on the charge of resisting arrest. We are constrained by the Supreme Judicial Court's ruling that, where a judge furnishes a jury with a written summary of the crimes' elements, \"[t]here is no requirement that a judge provide an outline of the defendant's defenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Guy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"411793\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/441/96/#p109\">\n    441 Mass. 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 109 (2004).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant does not dispute that the judge properly instructed the jury on each element the Commonwealth was required to prove on the resisting arrest charge, including its burden to \"prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense.\" There was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   b. Nor did the judge err when, without agreement of the parties,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   he provided the jury with the written summary of the elements unaccompanied by an audio recording of the entire jury instructions. \"Whatever we may have said before, it is now time to recognize that reasonable steps to assist a jury in performing their function should be encouraged,\" and this includes \"provid[ing] a jury with an accurate statement of the elements of each crime charged.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DiBenedetto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310282\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/414/#p422\">\n    427 Mass. 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 422 (1998).
