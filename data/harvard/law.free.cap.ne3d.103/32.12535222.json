CANNON, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, Marque Daquan Brown, appeals from the entry of sentence issued by the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas on February 26, 2016, sentencing appellant to 22 years in prison on two counts of involuntary manslaughter. The trial court's judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part for the reasons stated below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Statement of Facts and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This case stems from an altercation that occurred between appellant and his girlfriend, Taisha Ramirez, on or about May 25, 2014. On that date, appellant and Taisha were 20 and 17 years old, respectively. Taisha was approximately seven or eight months pregnant with appellant's son. They resided together at the home of Taisha's mother, Marilyn Cedeno; Taisha's brothers, Jose Luis Ramirez, Andre Luiz Ramirez, Ismal Ruiz, and Kenny Gonzalez; and Taisha's 13-year old sister, J.R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The following is a summary of the testimony presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Taisha and J.R. went to bed in the same room around 10:00 p.m.; appellant was not home at the time. Around 3:00 a.m., the sisters were awoken by appellant knocking on the door; Taisha let him in the house. Appellant and Taisha went upstairs to the room they shared on the third floor; J.R. followed and remained on the stairs where she could see them. The couple then went to the mother's bedroom on the second floor; J.R. followed and stood in the doorway while the couple argued for about 20 minutes. The couple moved to the bathroom and closed the door for about 10 minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} J.R. opened the bathroom door when she heard Taisha screaming and crying. J.R. heard Taisha tell appellant not to punch her and observed Taisha on the ground, bleeding from her nose. J.R. saw appellant punch Taisha in the face with a closed fist three or four times. J.R. unsuccessfully attempted to get appellant away from Taisha. J.R. observed blood on the floor of the bathroom, and Taisha's nose appeared to be broken and her lips were cut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Ismal and Kenny heard their mother and J.R. screaming, and they entered the bathroom. Kenny and Ismal observed Taisha sitting on the floor, bleeding from her nose, and crying; her nose and mouth were swollen. Kenny observed blood on the floor, in the sink, and on the toilet. Ismal observed blood on the carpet, walls, floor, and toilet, in addition to the towels Taisha was holding to her nose to stop the bleeding. Ismal testified Taisha's nose and lips were swollen. Photographs of the blood in the bathroom and on the towels, and of the injuries to Taisha's face, were submitted as exhibits to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Kenny took appellant to the shower and punched him in the face; Ismal also hit appellant with his fist. The brothers took appellant downstairs; appellant was yelling that he was sorry and asking Taisha to forgive him. Ismal called the police. A recording of the call was played for the jury. J.R. testified she had to help Taisha downstairs because she was unable to walk on her own. By the time they made it downstairs, the police had arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Officer Daniel Gillespie, of the Ashtabula City Police Department, reported to the scene with another patrolman, at which time he heard yelling and screaming from inside the residence. Upon entering the residence, he observed multiple occupants focusing their anger at appellant, who was backing up towards the door with his hands up. Officer Gillespie placed appellant in his patrol car and went back inside to investigate. He then observed Taisha crying and bleeding heavily from her nose, which was disfigured and swollen; the towel she was holding to her face was soaked with blood. He testified that Taisha was initially reluctant to remove the towel from her face and talk to him, but that she eventually told him appellant had hit her while they were arguing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Officer Gillespie testified that, on the way to the station, appellant indicated he wanted to tell the officer what happened; therefore, Officer Gillespie advised appellant of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. Officer Gillespie testified that appellant reported arguing with Taisha, which involved a lot of yelling and screaming, and then he left. Appellant would not answer Officer Gillespie's question of how Taisha became injured. Appellant was booked on a charge of domestic violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} J.R. stayed at Taisha's side until an ambulance arrived. Kenny rode in the ambulance with Taisha. J.R. and Kenny remained with Taisha at the hospital. Kenny and J.R. testified they were only\n   there for about half an hour, no tests were performed, and the only treatment Taisha received was Tylenol. Kenny indicated Taisha did not appear to be \"healthy or feeling fine\" when she was discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Dr. Imrann Haniff was the emergency room physician on duty when Taisha arrived at Ashtabula County Medical Center (\"ACMC\") around 6:30 a.m. Dr. Haniff testified that Taisha reported she had been assaulted and hit in the face. He stated Taisha told him she was slapped in the face one time; he did not observe anything that contradicted Taisha's report of what happened. Dr. Haniff observed that Taisha's lip was swollen, she had blood coming from both nostrils, and she was pregnant. The nurse was able to detect a fetal heart tone at that time, which indicated the fetus was alive. Dr. Haniff did not find any fractures during his examination of Taisha, and he gave her an ice pack. He testified Taisha was in good condition when she was discharged around 7:30 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 12} When Taisha returned home from the hospital, Ismal observed that she was dizzy and weak and could not make it up the stairs to her third-floor bedroom. He helped her out of the car and up to the second floor with the assistance of another family member. J.R. stayed with Taisha in their mother's bedroom. She testified that Taisha started to bleed again from her nose, but she did not notice any injuries on Taisha's head. At approximately 9:15 a.m., Ismal called for another ambulance because Taisha was bleeding and foaming from her nose, she could not talk or move, her nails were turning blue, and she was unresponsive. A recording of the call was played for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Dr. Haniff again treated Taisha in the emergency room, who arrived this second time in cardiac arrest. The staff performed CPR, and Taisha was intubated; it was difficult to obtain a fetal heart tone. They were unable to revive Taisha.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Taisha and her unborn son both died that morning in the emergency room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Dr. Joseph Felo, Deputy Medical Examiner and Forensic Pathologist for Cuyahoga County, performed an autopsy on Taisha. He noted her pregnancy was in its third trimester and observed cuts, scrapes, and bruises caused by blunt trauma to her upper and lower lips. There were no fractures to her skull or her nose. He observed diffuse cerebral edema, i.e., swelling of the brain, and a subdural hematoma, i.e., bleeding on the surface of the brain, caused by blunt trauma to her head. He testified that one slap would not have caused the injury because there were three separate impact sights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Dr. Felo did not perform a separate autopsy on the child because he was not born alive. He did not find any birth defects during his external examination, however, and opined that the unborn child would have lived had Taisha not died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Dr. Pamela Lancaster, the Ashtabula County Coroner, investigated Taisha's death at ACMC, reviewed the autopsy report, and issued a death certificate. She testified that the cause of Taisha's death, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, was the subdural hematoma due to blunt impacts to the head. She ruled the manner of Taisha's death as a homicide. Because the child was not born alive, there was not a separate coroner's verdict or death certificate issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Detective William Felt, of the Ashtabula City Police Department, interviewed appellant on May 27, 2014, with Lieutenant Doug Hollis. Detective Felt testified as to his training in detecting deception, analyzing and determining whether a person is being truthful through physical and nonphysical cues, and assessing\n   the demeanor and behavior of an interviewee. He testified that appellant did not appear bothered by his arrest and that he seemed to lack emotion. The interview was played for the jury, during which appellant appeared to be crying. Detective Felt testified that there was a lack of congruence in appellant's behavior because he did not produce tears; in other words, appellant's physical reaction did not match his verbal reaction. During the interview, appellant admitted to arguing with Taisha until he was pulled away by Ismal and Kenny. Near the end of the interview, appellant admitted he punched Taisha.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On June 26, 2014, appellant was indicted on two counts of murder, unclassified felonies, in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B) ; two counts of involuntary manslaughter, first-degree felonies, in violation of R.C. 2903.04(A) ; and two counts of felonious assault, second-degree felonies, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1). Appellant pled not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellee, the state of Ohio, filed a motion in limine to preclude evidence or testimony of alleged medical negligence as an independent intervening cause, to which appellant filed a response in opposition. A hearing was held on the motion. The trial court granted the state's motion, finding the reports of appellant's expert did not establish that Taisha's medical care was an independent intervening cause of death as defined by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 21} A jury trial commenced February 2, 2016. One count of felonious assault, as against the unborn child, was dismissed at the state's request following trial. The defense renewed its request that the jury be instructed as to intervening cause, which the trial court denied. The jury found appellant guilty of two counts of involuntary manslaughter and one count of felonious assault; it found him not guilty of both counts of murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The trial court merged the felonious assault count into both involuntary manslaughter counts for purposes of sentencing. On February 26, 2016, the trial court sentenced appellant to 11 years in prison on each count of involuntary manslaughter, to be served consecutively, for a total term of 22 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Appellant now raises eight assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [1.] The State failed to present sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction against Appellant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [2.] Appellant's convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [3.] Appellant was denied a fair trial by the witness' improper comments while testifying.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [4.] The trial court erred by granting the state's motion in limine and by preventing Appellant to present a complete defense which would have included the alleged medical negligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [5.] The trial court erred and violated Appellant's right to a fair trial by permitting the State of Ohio to introduce victim impact evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [6.] Appellant was deprived of his fundamental right to testify in his own defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [7.] The trial court erred by ordering appellant to serve a consecutive sentence without making the appropriate findings required by R.C. 2929.14 and HB 86.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [8.] The trial court erred by ordering convictions and a consecutive sentence for separate counts because the trial court failed to make a proper determination as to whether those offenses are allied offenses pursuant to R.C. 2941.25 and they are part of the same transaction under R.C. 2929.14.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Motion in Limine\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} We begin our analysis with appellant's fourth assignment of error. Appellant initially argues the trial court erred when it precluded his expert, Dr. John R. Becker, Jr., M.D., from testifying at trial regarding alleged medical negligence as an independent intervening cause of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The state filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude evidence or testimony of alleged medical negligence as an independent intervening cause on the grounds that one who inflicts injury upon another is criminally responsible for that person's death, regardless of whether different or more skillful medical treatment may have saved her life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellant filed a response in opposition and a motion to present the testimony of Dr. Becker in relation to his expert opinion that \"timely intervention on the part of [ACMC] would have saved the life of Taisha Ramirez and her fetus.\" Two reports from Dr. Becker were attached and incorporated into the motion. Appellant asserted that Dr. Becker's testimony supported the defense of independent intervening cause because the lack of proper diagnosis and treatment broke the chain of causation and relieved him of liability for the deaths.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 27} \" 'It is a general rule that the expert witness is not required to be the best witness on the subject. * * * The test is whether a particular witness offered as an expert will aid the trier of fact in the search for the truth.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Subsequently we learn that patient developed a right subdural hematoma which if treated, would most likely have given patient Ramirez and her fetus, a greater than 50% percent chance of surviving. Therefore, staff at [ACMC] failure to diagnose or appreciate the severity of Taisha Ramirez's injuries and premature discharge from the Emergency Department did contribute to her death. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   In conclusion, it is my professional opinion, that [appellant's] assault on Taisha Ramirez at approximately 3:30-3:45am ultimately lead [sic] to her and her fetus' death at approximately 10:34am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   However, staff at [ACMC] had an opportunity to diagnosis [sic] and potentially arrange treatment that could have led to saving the life of Taisha Ramirez and her fetus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   If a competent evaluation had taken place patient would have been admitted to an intensive care unit where her and her fetus would have had a reasonable chance of survival.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Under the circumstances as presented in Dr. Becker's reports, any failure of medical personnel would not have amounted to gross negligence sufficient to break the causal connection between the injuries inflicted by appellant and the deaths of Taisha and her unborn child. This expert testimony amounted to an opinion that simple negligence had occurred. The fact that better medical care may have saved the life of Taisha and her unborn child is not dispositive. It does not constitute evidence that would have allowed the jury to make a factual determination that the causal connection had been broken between appellant's actions and the deaths.

The trial court must first make the threshold finding that consecutive sentences are \"necessary to protect the public from future crime * * *.\" The court must then proceed to make an\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   finding under (a), (b) or (c). The additional finding under subsection (c) requires the court to find that it is because of the offender's history of criminal conduct that consecutive sentences are \"necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b6 82} At the sentencing hearing, the trial court stated: \"The Court does find that consecutive sentences would be necessary to protect the public from future crimes and to punish the offender, and that considering two innocent lives were stolen from this family, that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and to the danger the defendant poses to the public.\" It did not, however, make a finding with regard to the factors listed in R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(a), (b), and (c). The trial court's judgment entry of sentence is similarly deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b6 83} The concurring in judgment only opinion suggests the trial court made a \"finding\" that it was appellant's prior criminal history that justified the imposition of consecutive sentences. We emphasize, however, that the trial court had not ordered a presentence investigation report. The prosecutor outlined the following allegations, which it referred to as a history of \"anger\": appellant was suspended from high school in 2008 for fighting; appellant had a disturbance with his mother in 2012, during which he damaged a door in their apartment; appellant assaulted one of Taisha's brothers in 2012, for which no charges were brought, after her brother confronted appellant about his relationship with Taisha; and appellant was arrested for aggravated robbery in 2014, a charge that was dismissed after the complaining witness did not appear before the court for the preliminary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b6 84} Although the prosecutor recited these prior instances of potentially criminal conduct, the trial court did not make a finding that this recitation satisfied the requirement under subsection (c). And while the trial court stated it had \"looked at the defendant's record,\" that record is not before this court. Therefore, without the finding and without the benefit of a presentence investigation report to aid our review, we cannot conclude that the imposition of consecutive sentences was based on a history of criminal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 85} Another potentially pertinent factor that could have been considered in this case is R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(b), specifically, whether \"the harm caused by two or more of the multiple offenses so committed was so great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of any of the courses of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender's conduct.\" The trial court stated it had not ordered a presentence investigation \"because it was clear, based upon the brutal beating [Taisha] took, that community control would not be acceptable.\" This is not sufficient for us to conclude the trial court engaged in the correct analysis to overcome the presumption of concurrent sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 86} Accordingly, we hold that the trial court failed to make the requisite findings at the sentencing hearing allowing for imposition of consecutive sentences. This matter must be remanded for resentencing. The trial court must either impose concurrent sentences or make the appropriate findings to justify the imposition of consecutive sentences on the record and\n   incorporate them into the judgment entry of sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 87} Appellant's seventh assignment of error has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   {\u00b6 88} The judgment of the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed in part and reversed in part.

The majority remands for re-sentencing; however, a remand is only necessary for the court to prepare a nunc pro tunc entry to incorporate the court's findings regarding consecutive sentences. For this reason, I concur in judgment only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   {\u00b6 90} The majority states the trial court failed to make findings under the alternative factors listed in R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(a), (b), and (c). However, the court made findings under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(c) (that \"[t]he offender's history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender\"). Contrary to the majority, the trial court made findings regarding appellant's criminal history. The prosecutor outlined that history. In 2008, while appellant was in a fight at school and the assistant principal tried to break it up, appellant punched him. In 2012, appellant caused a disturbance with his mother during which he kicked in and damaged the door of her home. Later that year, he assaulted the brother of the victim in this case. In 2014, just months before the instant crimes, appellant was arrested for aggravated robbery, the victim of which reported that appellant pistol-whipped him when he would not give appellant his tax-return money. After hearing appellant's criminal history, the court said it had \"looked at the defendant's record;\" noted that recidivism is likely; and found that consecutive sentences were \"necessary to protect the public from future crimes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   {\u00b6 91} It is worth noting that a plausible argument could be made that the court also made findings under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(b) (that at least two of the multiple offenses were committed as part of a \"course of conduct\" and the harm caused by the multiple offenses was so great or unusual that no single prison term would adequately reflect the seriousness of the offender's conduct). Here, the court found that the two counts of involuntary manslaughter involved two separate victims. Thus, it could be argued the trial court implicitly found appellant committed two separate crimes as part of a course of conduct. Further, the court found: \"The defendant took two lives, two innocent lives. It doesn't get any worse than that. It doesn't get more serious than that.\" Thus, it could be argued the court essentially found that no one sentence would adequately reflect the seriousness of appellant's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 92} In any event, since the trial court made the required findings under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(c) on the record, there is no need to remand for re-sentencing. However, because the court did not incorporate these findings into its sentencing entry, as\n   required by\n   <em>\n    Bonnell, supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 37, I would remand with instructions for the trial court to enter a nunc pro tunc entry incorporating the court's findings under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   {\u00b6 93} For these reasons, I respectfully concur in judgment only.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
