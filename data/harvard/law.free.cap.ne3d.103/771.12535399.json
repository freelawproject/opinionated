Jordan, appeals from Superior Court convictions on three indictments for armed assault with intent to murder, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18(\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ) ; three indictments for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A(\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ) ; and one indictment for unlawful possession of a firearm, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ), as an armed career criminal with three prior convictions, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   ), and from the trial judge's denial of his motions for new trial and for postconviction discovery. Concluding that (1) the limitations on cross-examination were within the trial judge's discretion; (2) the defendant has not demonstrated prejudice from the alleged delayed disclosure of exculpatory evidence; (3) trial counsel's failure to request a specific jury instruction on honest but mistaken identification did not deprive the defendant of a substantial, available defense; and (4) the motion judge properly found that suppression of the defendant's statements made while in custody after his arrest was not required, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . In the evening of September 13, 2002, through the early morning hours of September 14, 2002, a private bus driver dropped off a group of seven men, including the defendant, near the old Brockton Area Transportation terminal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that location, the three victims were serving as security for an after-hours party. After one of the victims removed the defendant from the line for entry, a violent altercation ensued. Ultimately, the defendant and another member of his group fired shots. One of the victims, Nawarrior Lewis, was struck by three bullets and remains paralyzed from the waist down. The other two victims were also struck by bullets and suffered less serious injuries. Two of the victims later identified the defendant as one of the gunmen. One was already familiar with the defendant, but Lewis was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   After the gunshots, the bus driver observed the defendant return to the bus and bang on the door while holding a black handgun. Another member of the group also had a gun. The driver let the group onto the bus, and the defendant instructed him to drive off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On October 11, 2002, Stoughton police officers arrested the defendant. During booking, officers provided the defendant with his Miranda rights, and he invoked his right to remain silent. When Brockton police officers, including Detective Dominic Persampieri, arrived soon after to transport the defendant to Brockton, the defendant became agitated and initiated a brief verbal exchange with Detective Persampieri. At the Brockton police station, officers booked the defendant and provided him with his Miranda rights again. The officers did not inform the defendant of his right to prompt arraignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In an interview room shortly thereafter, Detective Persampieri asked the defendant if he wanted to make any statements. The defendant refused to speak with Detective Persampieri, but instead requested to speak to Detective Ernest Bell, who was home sick at the time. Detective Bell eventually acquiesced to the defendant's request and arrived at the station to interview the defendant about the incident. The interview, in which the defendant denied involvement with the shooting, lasted from 8:15 P.M. to somewhere between 9:15 P.M. and 9:30 P.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prior to the defendant's second jury trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the defendant filed several motions to suppress statements made after his arrest, all of which were denied. A jury ultimately convicted the defendant on all counts. At a subsequent jury-waived trial, the trial judge found the defendant guilty as an armed career criminal with three prior convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Cross-examination\n   </em>\n   .

The defendant suggests that the bus driver provided biased testimony at trial on account of the defendant's alleged involvement in the murder of the witness's brother. This theory rests on the purported connection between the murder and certain individuals, supposedly associated with the defendant, motivating the witness to later target them while working with Federal authorities in otherwise unrelated criminal investigations. The record, however, does not provide factual support to link either the defendant himself, or even the targeted individuals, to the death of the witness's brother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The mere fact, moreover, that a witness may be biased against particular persons does not support the inference that the witness is also biased against anyone familiar with those persons. Thus, even if the defendant was familiar with those individuals, that fact would not provide the requisite factual basis to imply the witness was biased against the defendant. See\n   <em>\n    Sealy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317040\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/617/#p624\">\n    467 Mass. at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant's failure to sufficiently establish witness's motive to lie precluded further inquiry). To the contrary, the witness specifically testified that the Federal investigations, carried out years after the defendant's conviction, did not relate in any way, nor to any person involved in, the present case. The judge could thereby find that the defendant's argument fell into the realm of speculation. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Meas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317827\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/434/#p450\">\n    467 Mass. 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 450-451 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Delayed disclosure\n   </em>\n   . To require a new trial based on delayed disclosure of exculpatory evidence, a defendant must show \"how his trial tactics would have or should have changed, had he been aware of the [evidence] earlier.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stote\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343563\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/433/19/#p23\">\n    433 Mass. 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 23 (2000).

Without more, the defendant cannot show the requisite prejudice for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Molina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669953\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/454/232/#p236\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669953\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/454/232/#p236\">\n    at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (claim of \"late disclosure ... requires the defendant to show prejudice\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Ineffective assistance of counsel\n   </em>\n   .

They directed the jury to the \"witness's frankness or evasiveness,\" \"the reasonableness of the testimony,\" \"the\n   <em>\n    opportunity that the witness had to observe\n   </em>\n   what it is they're telling you,\" and \"the\n   <em>\n    accuracy of the witness's memory\n   </em>\n   \" (emphases supplied). This was sufficient to draw the jury's attention to the distinct issue of honest but mistaken identification in determining the reliability of eyewitness testimony. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276128\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/465/895/#p913\">\n    465 Mass. 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 913 (2013) (concluding that instruction pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337363\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/296/\">\n    378 Mass. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1979], was unnecessary where jury were \"informed that they could 'consider the ability, the opportunity, and the reliability of a witness to see or hear something in the past and then remember and later testify' \").

As noted in the Commonwealth's closing, multiple witnesses connected the defendant to the crime, including those familiar with him and at the scene of the crime, and the Commonwealth provided corresponding ballistic evidence. Significantly, the defendant's own incriminating and inconsistent statements provided the most substantial evidence of his guilt.

Despite all these unavoidable delays, nonetheless, the interview with Detective Bell began at approximately 8:15 P.M. , still within the six-hour window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Considering the convergence of logistics, timing, and the unforeseen illness, this is an unusual case requiring flexibility,\n   <em>\n    Siny Van Tran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271882\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/460/535/#p560\">\n    460 Mass. at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for reasons not attributable to the police, where \"the six-hour period should be tolled appropriately.\"\n   <em>\n    Rosario\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890332\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/422/48/\">\n    422 Mass. at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
