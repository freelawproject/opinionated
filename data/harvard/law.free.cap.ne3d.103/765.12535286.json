A Superior Court judge dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20755\">\n    365 Mass. 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), and judgment entered for the defendants. The plaintiff challenges the dismissal on appeal. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   It is the plaintiff's burden to provide us with a record that supports her claims on appeal.

Other than a copy of the motion judge's decision, which the plaintiff has appended to her brief, she has provided no record at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, the plaintiff has failed to provide a copy of her complaint. Without the complaint, we are unable to determine whether the plaintiff sufficiently stated facts that might plausibly entitle her to relief from the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Moreover, the plaintiff's brief does not adequately inform us of the nature and basis of her claims on appeal or the error, if any, purportedly made by the motion judge.
