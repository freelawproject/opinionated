(Suburban), seeking removal of certain encroachments on Paulini's land. After a bench trial, a Superior Court judge ordered the defendants to remove some of the encroachments,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   but declined to order the removal of a car-wash structure and a small portion of pavement. As to the car wash, the judge ruled that the encroachment was innocent and de minimis and that requiring removal would be oppressive and inequitable to the defendants while not necessary to protect Paulini's substantial rights. As to the pavement, the judge ruled that Suburban had acquired a prescriptive easement. The parties cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Paulini's appeal\n   </em>\n   . Paulini argues that the judge erred by not ordering the defendants to remove the car wash. We review the judge's findings of fact for clear error and his conclusions of law de novo. See\n   <em>\n    Cavadi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeYeso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269683\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/615/#p624\">\n    458 Mass. 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 624 (2011). \"We examine the judge's imposition of equitable remedies under an abuse of discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   ., quoting from\n   <em>\n    Demoulas\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Demoulas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651226\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/428/555/#p589\">\n    428 Mass. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 589 (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The judge's reasons for not ordering removal were sound. First, he was warranted in concluding that the encroachment was innocent based on evidence that Colbea's predecessor in title had the land surveyed before building the car wash in 1997. Paulini raises no serious challenge to the factual support for the judge's determination. Instead, Paulini argues that, even if the original encroachment was innocent, Colbea cannot claim innocence because it purchased the property in the middle of litigation and thus with knowledge of the encroachment. But Paulini cites no authority to support the proposition that an encroachment, made innocently, loses its innocence upon sale of the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paulini's conclusory claim does not rise to the level of adequate appellate argument. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=367%20Mass.%20921\">\n    367 Mass. 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Second, the judge properly found the encroachment to be de minimis. The encroachment is comparable in magnitude to that in\n   <em>\n    Capodilupo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vozzella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"123911\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/46/224/#p227\">\n    46 Mass. App. Ct. 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 227 (1999). Although Paulini contends that the encroachment here is greater, the judge found the differential to be \"marginal[ ],\" while Paulini's \"parcel of land is roughly [ten] times as large as the encroached-upon parcel in\n   <em>\n    Capodilupo\n   </em>\n   .\" These findings are not clearly erroneous. Moreover, as in\n   <em>\n    Capodilupo\n   </em>\n   , Paulini has made no plausible claim that the encroachment is denying it the beneficial use of its land.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"123911\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/46/224/#p227\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"123911\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/46/224/#p227\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Finally, the judge was warranted in finding that an order of removal would be oppressive and inequitable to the defendants and was not necessary to protect Paulini's substantial rights. A court of equity can refuse to require removal of an encroachment where \"the cost of removal by the defendant[s] would be greatly disproportionate to the injury to the plaintiff from [the] continuation\" of the encroachment.\n   <em>\n    Goulding\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890321\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/422/276/\">\n    422 Mass. 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 277 n.3 (1996), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Archambault\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3867819\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/361/91/#p93\">\n    361 Mass. 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 93 (1972). Here, the judge had evidence from which he could infer that the costs to the defendants of relocating or removing the car wash would be not insubstantial. Paulini, on the other hand, failed to articulate what injury it would suffer if the car wash remains where it is.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge appropriately balanced these equities and acted within his discretion in declining to order removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    The defendants' appeal\n   </em>\n   . The defendants first contend that the judge defined Suburban's prescriptive easement too narrowly and should have found that it extended \"to the edge of the car wash encroachment.\" But as the defendants agreed at trial, Suburban's claim to an easement depended on its proving that a fence located between the two properties had remained in the same location for twenty years. The judge found Suburban's proof to be insufficient, and the defendants acknowledge that this was not clear error. We therefore have no basis on which to reverse the judge's decision. Although the defendants now advance a theory that some unspecified \"documentary evidence\" supports a finding of a broader easement, we decline to consider that argument as it is unsupported by record citations and is different from the theory presented to the judge at trial. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4) ;\n   <em>\n    Williams Bros\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Peck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3898801\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/81/682/\">\n    81 Mass. App. Ct. 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 688 n.7 (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendants' next argument fares better. We agree that the judge should have concluded that Colbea acquired title by adverse possession to the encroaching portion of pavement, and not merely an easement by prescription. The judge found, and Paulini does not dispute, that Suburban \"made open, notorious, continuous and adverse use of this land for well over [twenty] years.\" Colbea was thus entitled to title by adverse possession of the same area. See\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Concord\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"47227\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/439/416/#p426\">\n    439 Mass. 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 426 (2003) (\"A person claiming title by adverse possession need not personally occupy the land for twenty years. He may rely on the possession of his tenants, whose possession is his own\");\n   <em>\n    AM Properties, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    J &amp; W Summit Ave., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20150\">\n    91 Mass.
