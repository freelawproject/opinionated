L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. The juvenile (represented by new counsel) filed a motion for new trial on the ground that his trial counsel provided him with ineffective assistance. After a hearing at which trial counsel testified, the motion judge, who was not the trial judge, allowed the juvenile's motion. The Commonwealth claims that the judge's allowance of that motion constituted error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We relate the facts the jury could have found. The alleged victim, whom we shall refer to as Michael,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   was a thirteen year old boy with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism. In January, 2010, a disagreement between Michael and his mother about discipline escalated to the point where Michael threatened suicide. Fearing for his safety, his mother took him to the hospital and then to the Brien Center, a psychiatric treatment facility for children and teenagers. That evening, the staff assigned Michael to a double room with the juvenile, who was asleep. Michael fell asleep, but awoke to see the juvenile get out of bed, take off his clothes, and enter Michael's bed. The juvenile grabbed Michael by the arms, got on top of him, and put his hands down Michael's boxer shorts. The juvenile then flipped him over, whereupon Michael passed out. The next day, Michael went home, where he disclosed to his mother, the first complaint witness, what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The motion judge agreed with the juvenile that his trial counsel was ineffective for eliciting cross-examination testimony from the mother and Michael-neither of whom counsel interviewed-and from other witnesses about Michael's repeated accusation of sexual assault, in violation of the first complaint doctrine. The motion judge also faulted trial counsel for failing to exploit discrepancies between the mother's trial testimony and her written statement taken by Detective Eason, when counsel unreasonably elected not to pose a single question to the detective about any of the discrepancies, which the mother had dismissed as \"mistakes made by the detective\" or his \"misunderstandings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n   .

In a futile attempt to impeach Michael-whom he had not interviewed-trial counsel cross-examined Michael regarding details of the assault that he told to the investigator. In addition, trial counsel elicited that Michael discussed the assault with \"a few different people\" shortly after it happened. Trial counsel did not seek to have these answers stricken, leaving the jury with seemingly consistent accounts of the assault told to persons other than the first complaint witness. By persisting in this line of cross-examination, trial counsel impermissibly permitted Michael to inform the jury that he consistently described the assault to multiple people. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2823323\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/217/#p243\">\n    445 Mass. at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Trial counsel also elicited testimony from the first complaint witness, the mother, that fell outside the scope of the first complaint doctrine. Trial counsel cross-examined the mother at length about her written statement to Detective Eason repeating what Michael relayed to her about the assault. Counsel also asked the mother about her communications about the assault with Detective Eason and members of the district attorney's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The mother's written statement, her testimony about the details of Michael's sexual assault set forth in that statement, and her testimony about her communications with police and members of the district attorney's office about Michael's report to her, all combined to suggest that the Commonwealth believed and gave weight to Michael's report in violation of the first complaint doctrine. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Aviles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273174\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/60/#p68\">\n    461 Mass. at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When a defendant alleges that counsel failed \"to pursue some obviously powerful form of impeachment,\" we look to determine whether \"a different approach to impeachment would likely have affected the jury's consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343593\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/433/340/#p357\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343593\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/433/340/#p357\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Here, beyond the multiple violations of the first complaint doctrine, the mother's trial testimony directly contradicted parts of her written statement to Detective Eason. In particular, her written statement recited that she read it before she signed it. Yet when cross-examined by trial counsel about contradictions of her statement she made during her testimony on direct examination, she put the blame on Eason for making mistakes and misunderstanding her, and claimed she signed it without reading it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the motion judge that trial counsel's failure to impeach the mother by not questioning Eason about any of the mother's contradictions of the statement she gave him exacerbated the harmful effect of the improper first complaint testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the motion hearing, trial counsel testified that he elicited testimony of what the mother told Detective Eason about the sexual assault, because he was planning to impeach her through Eason's expected testimony. Yet, when counsel called Eason to the stand, he never questioned Eason about any of the mother's contradictions of her written statement during her trial testimony. Although counsel testified that he chose not to question the detective about the mother's contradictions because he did not trust the detective, we conclude the motion judge correctly determined that this was not a reasonable course of action, because the result was that the mother's testimony in contradiction of her written statement stood unchallenged. We find no error in the motion judge's findings, and agree that these failures by trial counsel fell well below \"that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\" and \"likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n    366 Mass. at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Whether these errors warranted the allowance of the juvenile's motion for new trial depends, in part, upon the strength of the Commonwealth's case.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alphas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1157268\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/430/8/#p13\">\n    430 Mass. 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 13 (1999). Here, the strength of the case must be measured by the other evidence presented at trial, namely, the testimony of the other witnesses. Aside from Michael and the mother, none of the witnesses could testify regarding the facts of the alleged assault, as Michael and the juvenile were the only ones present.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was no physical, forensic, or scientific evidence presented at trial.
