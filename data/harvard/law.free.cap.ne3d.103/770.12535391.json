Bowen, guilty of one count of violating an abuse prevention order, three counts of threatening to commit a crime, and one count of making annoying telephone or electronic communications. On appeal, he challenges the convictions of violating the abuse prevention order and the two counts of threats in which his ex-wife was the target on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to show that he contacted or intended for his threats to be communicated to her. He also contends that text messages and Facebook posts were erroneously admitted in evidence without proper authentication.

Indeed, the conversation between Aikey and the defendant that preceded the defendant's threats concerned the defendant's apparent intent to move to Florida and to abandon the children. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1508487\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/59/280/#p283\">\n    59 Mass.

Indeed, in one of the texts to Aikey, the defendant suggested that he knew he would find Aikey at the victim's house: \"I have [the victim's address] in the GPS. You're the only reason I'm coming back. P.S. I'm gonna murder you. Have a good night.\" The jury could infer that the defendant knew that Aikey would be in the victim's proximity and would share information with her, especially information that involved the defendant, the victim's ex-husband. Contrast\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Furst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"626918\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/56/283/#p285\">\n    56 Mass.

In one of his first text messages to Aikey, the defendant wrote, \"You're going to die by my hands and this is a text message so everyone knows that that's how you died. I'm not hiding anything.\" Similarly, the defendant made his intentions public on Facebook, posting a message that said, \"Mike, I will murder you, nothing to hide here, when [M]ike Aikey turns up dead and murdered I did it.\" The jury could reasonably find that the defendant would have expected that this explicitly threatening message would be conveyed to Aikey and the victim by their mutual Facebook friends, as in fact it was. Most telling, shortly after Aikey received the first threatening message from the defendant, the victim contacted the defendant's girl friend, Anna Redden, who had accompanied him on the trip to Florida, to learn if they intended to return to Massachusetts. The defendant responded by texting Aikey, \"Keep messaging [Redden], you're both going to get it.\" This message explicitly suggests that the defendant intended Aikey to communicate with the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With respect to the no-contact order, the fact that Aikey initiated communications with the defendant does not excuse the defendant's subsequent, indirect contact with the victim.

Required to avoid direct or indirect contact with the victim, the defendant instead repeatedly threatened and harassed Aikey and, through him, the victim.

Aikey was available for cross-examination. The statements attributed to the defendant were not offered for their truth-that the defendant actually would kill Aikey and would rape and kill the victim-but rather as \"verbal acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Purdy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 452. Even if they were offered for their truth, they would be admissible as admissions of a party opponent.\n   <em>\n    Gilman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456721\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/89/752/#p758\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 757 n.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Judgments affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    We refer to the ex-wife as the victim, although Aikey too was a victim with respect to some of the convictions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    We reject the defendant's claim, raised for the first time on appeal, that the danger of prejudice from the post about the hatchet outweighed its probative value. In light of Redden's explanation of the photograph, and compared with the language and tenor of the defendant's threatening Facebook posts and text messages, any error would not have created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Likewise, there is no substantial risk that the jury would have understood, let alone be prejudiced by, the defendant's unexplained comment, \"I can't wait to move in with my dad.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
