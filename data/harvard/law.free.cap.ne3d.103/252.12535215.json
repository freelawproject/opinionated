Because Thompson has established that there are no issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On June 28, 2013, Harrigill was on her way to attend the state Special Olympics\n   games at Ohio Stadium on the campus of The Ohio State University (\"OSU\") with her daughter and two young grandchildren. The weather was sunny, clear, and dry. After parking her car, Harrigill and her daughter and grandchildren began walking down the sidewalk on West 11th Avenue when they encountered a marked construction site at the intersection of West 11th Avenue and Hunter Avenue. OSU was renovating the south high rise dormitory and adjacent areas near that intersection. This large renovation project involved a number of contractors, including Thompson. Thompson was renovating the sidewalks in the area. The sidewalk renovation was not yet completed. A several-inch deep channel remained to be filled where the curbs would be installed. To facilitate foot traffic to the event, Thompson installed two-by-four inch boards in the channel to create a level temporary pedestrian walkway. The channel and crosswalk were then marked off with orange barrels to guide pedestrians as they crossed the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} As Harrigill approached the intersection of West 11th Avenue and Hunter Avenue, she encountered a plywood board that had been laid over the two-by-four inch boards to create a ramp from the road to the sidewalk. Nothing obstructed her view of the plywood board and she admits that she saw it. As Harrigill attempted to step over/onto the plywood board, she caught her left toe on the edge of the board causing her to trip and fall. Harrigill broke her femur. She admits that nothing distracted her before she tripped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Apparently, the plywood board was not present at the site the previous evening, but was placed there by unknown persons sometime prior to Harrigill's fall. There were no Thompson employees performing any work at the construction site on the day of this accident. Nor were any Thompson employees on site at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Harrigill filed a complaint against Thompson asserting a negligence claim. Harrigill dismissed that action without prejudice. On July 6, 2016, Harrigill refiled her complaint against Thompson, again alleging a negligence claim. On November 21, 2016, Thompson filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Harrigill appeals assigning the following error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Trial Court Erred in Granting Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Summary judgment is appropriate under Civ.R. 56 when the moving party demonstrates that: (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion when viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\n   <em>\n    Hudson v.

Her own testimony, however, undercuts that contention. Harrigill testified that the weather was beautiful at the time of her fall. It was sunny, clear, and dry. Nothing obstructed her view of the plywood board. Harrigill admits she saw the plywood board and as she stepped over it her left toe caught the edge of the board causing her to trip and fall. Significantly, she also admitted that nothing distracted her before she tripped. She simply tripped on the edge of the plywood board that she admits she saw as she was walking.

For summary judgment to have been appropriate there must have been no genuine issues of material fact. I think there were genuine issues of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In June 2013, Ms. Harrigill fell when she stepped on a plywood board lying across a sidewalk. She broke her femur as a result of the fall. She filed suit against Thompson Concrete, Ltd. (\"Thompson Concrete\") who she alleged was responsible for placing the board on the sidewalk, thereby creating a hazardous condition. Counsel for Thompson Concrete responded to the lawsuit arguing that it had not been negligent in creating the condition because it owed no duty of care to Ms. Harrigill. Counsel argued also that the company was not liable due to a potential application of the so-called two inch rule in slip and fall cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Thompson Concrete has denied placing the plywood on top of the other boards in place to create a temporary crosswalk near Hunter and 11th Avenues in the Ohio State University area. However, there seems to be no doubt that the plywood was there and that Thompson Concrete was responsible for work on the sidewalks in the area. As a result, for purposes of a summary judgment motion, Thompson Concrete should be deemed the entity which was responsible for placing the plywood and/or the placement of the plywood. Thompson renovated the sidewalk at the intersection and placed wooden inlay board on the sidewalk. There was no indication that any other entity or individual was responsible for creating a temporary passage at that place and at that point in time. The trial court judge should have viewed the placement of the plywood as involving a genuine issue of material fact which should have been resolved in favor of the nonmoving party, Ms. Harrigill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The trial court also granted summary judgment based on a finding that it was not foreseeable that someone would be injured while traversing a piece of plywood that had an exposed edge of less than one inch. The trial court also found that the plywood was discoverable on ordinary inspection and readily appreciable by an ordinary person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The problem with the trial court's analysis is that Ms. Harrigill really had no choice but to go over the plywood. The crosswalk in the normal sense did not exist. Nothing was done to taper the edge of the plywood. A person who needs to cross had to cope with a sudden obstruction apparently three or more feet in length. Ms. Harrigill tried to step over the raised edge but her left toe got caught, resulting in her body being thrown forward. I view the length of the obstruction and the necessity to traverse it as attendant circumstances which did not automatically free Thompson Concrete from liability and responsibility for the fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Since the majority of the panel upholds the trial court's granting of summary judgment, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
