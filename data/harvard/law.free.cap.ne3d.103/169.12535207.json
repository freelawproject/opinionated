Because we conclude the portion of the judgment granting United's motion for judgment on the pleadings is not a final, appealable order, we dismiss the appeal to the extent it challenges that portion of the judgment. Further, because we conclude the trial court did not err by granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of DAS, we affirm that portion of the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} B.H. is an employee of the state of Ohio and receives health insurance coverage through his employer. R.H. is B.H.'s son and is also covered as a dependent through B.H.'s state employee health insurance plan. From July 11, 2012 until July 10, 2013, R.H. received mental health treatment at a residential treatment facility in Virginia. B.H. asserts that United denied insurance coverage for R.H.'s treatment at the residential facility in two letters issued on July 12 and August 8, 2012. B.H. claims that he and his wife paid the full cost of R.H.'s treatment, a total of $134,600, as a result of the denials of coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellants filed a complaint in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas on July 9, 2015, asserting they were entitled to a declaratory judgment because United and DAS had wrongfully denied insurance coverage for R.H.'s treatment. Appellants sought judgment against United and DAS for the amount that would have been paid under the insurance plan, which they asserted to be 60 percent of the total cost. Appellants asserted United and DAS breached their fiduciary duties by failing to provide a full and fair review of appellants' insurance claims. Appellants further asserted United and DAS were responsible to provide coverage for R.H.'s treatment pursuant to the terms of the insurance plan and state and federal statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} United filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting the common pleas court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims set forth in appellants' complaint. United argued appellants sought damages against the state, which was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims of Ohio. DAS also filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, similarly asserting the common pleas court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over appellants' claims. On September 30, 2016, the common pleas court issued a decision granting the motions for judgment on the pleadings filed by United and DAS. The court concluded that the Court of Claims had exclusive jurisdiction over the claims asserted in appellants' complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 6} We begin by considering whether this court has jurisdiction over the present appeal. Under the Ohio Constitution, courts of appeals have jurisdiction to review final orders of lower courts. Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 3 (B)(2). In the present case, the common pleas court held that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over appellants' claims because appellants sought money damages against the state. The court concluded appellants' claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims. Civ.R. 41(B)(4)(a) provides that a dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction \"shall operate as a failure otherwise than on the merits.\" \"Ordinarily, a dismissal 'otherwise than on the merits' does not prevent a party from refiling and, therefore, ordinarily, such a dismissal is not a final, appealable order.\"\n   <em>\n    Natl. City Commercial Capital Corp. v. AAAA at Your Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3618853\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/114/82/\">\n    114 Ohio St.3d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-2942\">\n    2007-Ohio-2942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=868%20N.E.2d%20663\">\n    868 N.E.2d 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8. Moreover, the trial court expressly provided in the judgment that the complaint was dismissed without prejudice. Dismissal without prejudice generally constitutes an adjudication otherwise than on the merits because it places the parties in the same position they were before they filed the action.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. H &amp; M Auto Serv.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 07AP-123,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-5794\">\n    2007-Ohio-5794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%203148981\">\n    2007 WL 3148981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7. Additionally, dismissal without prejudice is generally not a final, appealable order if a party is able to refile within the applicable statute of limitations or pursuant to the savings statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%203148981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Jurisdiction over the appeal of judgment on the pleadings in favor of United\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On appeal, appellants argue their claims against United are independent of their claims against DAS and arise from United's alleged breach of fiduciary duty. Because the trial court dismissed the complaint without prejudice, to the extent appellants assert claims against United that are independent from their claims against DAS, appellants may be able to refile their complaint in the common pleas court asserting those independent claims against United.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, because the trial\n   court dismissed the claims against United without prejudice, that portion of the judgment is not a final, appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal to the extent it challenges the grant of judgment on the pleadings in favor of United. Because appellants' first assignment of error challenges the grant of judgment on the pleadings in favor of United, we dismiss the first assignment for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Jurisdiction over the appeal of judgment on the pleadings in favor of DAS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Although appellants' claims against DAS were also dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, we conclude the portion of the judgment granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of DAS is a final, appealable order. As noted above, generally, a dismissal otherwise than on the merits or without prejudice is not a final, appealable order. However, such a dismissal may be a final, appealable order if the plaintiff cannot refile the suit because the applicable statute of limitations has lapsed and the plaintiff cannot take advantage of the savings statute.\n   <em>\n    Brownfield v. Krupman\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.

R.C. 2743.16(A). The denials of insurance coverage alleged in appellants' complaint occurred on July 12 and August 8, 2012, and materials submitted by United indicate that external reviews of the denials of coverage were completed on August 24, 2012, and March 17, 2014. Appellants filed their complaint on July 9, 2015. The trial court did not make any conclusions regarding the accrual date of appellants' claims against DAS and whether those claims were filed within the statute of limitations. Accordingly, we decline to decide the issue in the first instance. However, if it is later determined that appellants' original complaint was untimely, appellants would be unable to rely on the savings statute when refiling their claims against DAS. In that event, the order granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of DAS would have the effect of a final, appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Additionally, we previously held that a similar dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction by the common pleas court was a final, appealable order. In\n   <em>\n    George v. State\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 10AP-4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-5262\">\n    2010-Ohio-5262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%204264417\">\n    2010 WL 4264417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court considered consolidated appeals by individuals and entities who sought to sue the State of Ohio, the director of the Ohio Department of Public Safety, and various other state officials and employees in both the common pleas court and the Court of Claims. The Court of Claims dismissed some, but not all of the claims that were asserted, but the dismissal order did not contain language providing that the order was final and appealable in compliance\n   with Civ.R. 54(B). Therefore, this court held that the dismissal order from the Court of Claims was not a final, appealable order.\n   <em>\n    George\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. The common pleas court, by contrast, dismissed all the claims, some based on failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and others for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The common pleas court expressly held that certain dismissals were without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. While acknowledging that dismissal for lack of subject-matter is treated as a failure \"otherwise than on the merits\" under Civ.R. 41(B)(4)(a), this court concluded the common pleas court's order was final and appealable:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   While such a dismissal [for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction] does not bar refiling in a different forum, presumably the correct one with jurisdiction over the matter, it certainly would make futile any attempt by the plaintiff to refile in the same forum the same claims even if the dismissal was labeled without prejudice. Thus, while such a dismissal is nominally without prejudice to refiling, it essentially precludes a refiling in the initial forum. \"[A] dismissal without prejudice does not guarantee that a case can be refiled.\"\n   <em>\n    Brubaker v. Ross\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 01AP-1431,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002-Ohio-4396\">\n    2002-Ohio-4396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%201938422\">\n    2002 WL 1938422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], \u00b6 15. Nor, even if the case could be refiled, does a dismissal without prejudice permit subsequent appellate review of some aspects of the case. If the dismissal is not a final appealable order because it is without prejudice, but the case is refiled in the same forum, it could only, by operation of res judicata, be again dismissed on the same grounds, and there would never be the opportunity for subsequent appellate review of such rulings in a final order from that forum. There would be in such cases no mechanism to review the trial court's determination that it lacked jurisdiction over the matter in the first instance; the only remaining appeal would be from a determination in a refiled matter in another forum, which appeal would likely not permit useful review of the initial court's determination that it lacked jurisdiction. Both judicial economy and fundamental fairness would seem to argue for immediate appellate review of such a dismissal. Even if designated as without prejudice, a dismissal may have \"practical consequences,\"\n   <em>\n    Mihalcin v. Hocking College\n   </em>\n   (Mar. 20, 2000), 4th Dist.

Analysis of Whether the Common Pleas Court Had Jurisdiction Over Appellants' Claims Against DAS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of DAS based on its conclusion that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over appellants' claims because they sought money damages against the state.

In the present case, appellants' complaint sought declaratory judgment that they had been wrongly denied insurance coverage and damages of $80,600, plus interest, along with attorney fees and costs.

In the present case, the basis for appellants' claim for financial compensation is B.H.'s health benefits plan-i.e., his employer-provided insurance coverage, which is effectively a contract. Although appellants' complaint and briefs cite to various statutes, including the Ohio and Federal Mental Health Parity Acts, those statutes simply require that employer-provided insurance plans must provide equal coverage benefits for mental illness diagnosis and treatment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   R.C. 3923.281(B) (\"Notwithstanding section 3901.71 of the Revised Code, and subject to division (E) of this section, every policy of sickness and accident insurance shall provide benefits for the diagnosis and treatment of biologically based mental illness on the same terms and conditions as, and shall provide benefits no less extensive than, those provided under the policy of sickness and accident insurance for the treatment and diagnosis of all other physical diseases and disorders, if [certain specified conditions apply].\"). Appellants fail to demonstrate any statutory provision creating a private right of action or statutory entitlement to compensation that would support their claim for financial compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Appellants argue that this court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Windsor House\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Interim HealthCare\n   </em>\n   support their argument that they seek equitable relief. However, we find those cases to be distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Windsor House\n   </em>\n   , a nursing home operator filed a complaint in the Court of Claims seeking payment from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services for capital costs and services provided to residents of the nursing home.\n   <em>\n    Windsor House\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1. The Court of Claims dismissed the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the nursing home operator sought reimbursement of compensation due under a statute, not money damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206296623\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On appeal, this court affirmed, concluding that the nursing home operator's claims for unjust enrichment, negligence, promissory estoppel, and false pretenses were based on a statutory right to reimbursement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. Although the complaint also included a claim for breach of contract, the court concluded that the only relevant contract did not provide for reimbursement of capital costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the only basis for the nursing home provider's claims was equitable recovery pursuant to statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In\n   <em>\n    Interim HealthCare\n   </em>\n   , a nursing home provider filed a complaint in the Court of Claims seeking declaratory judgment to interpret a statutory provision relating to external review of insurance coverage denials.\n   <em>\n    Interim HealthCare\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. The Court of Claims dismissed the complaint, concluding the proper remedy was within the administrative process and, potentially, an appeal to the common pleas court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. On appeal, this court affirmed, holding that although the nursing home's complaint sought to recover unpaid interest in addition to the declaratory judgment claim, the claim for unpaid interest was not a claim for money damages sounding in law because it sought statutory interest to which the nursing home provider would have been entitled if timely payment was not made under the statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. Thus, \"[t]hat a favorable determination would entitle plaintiff\n   to recover money damages [did] not change the basic character of plaintiff's cause of action from a specific remedy to monetary damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Unlike\n   <em>\n    Windsor House\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Interim HealthCare\n   </em>\n   , appellants have not established any statutory entitlement to recovery. The statutes appellants cite provide for the creation and maintenance of an employee health benefit fund, and require that mental health coverage be provided on an equal basis, but they do not create a statutory cause of action for denial of appellants' claims. The fundamental basis for appellants' claims is the alleged breach arising from denial of their insurance claims, and compensation for that breach is a claim for money damages sounding in law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Moreover, we note that appellants also sought pre- and post-judgment interest. This court has previously held that \"[t]he payment of interest 'is the almost universal measure of damages for mere delay of payment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Zelenak\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24, quoting\n   <em>\n    Midwest Properties Co. v.
