L. c. 244, \u00a7 35A ; and that their claim under G. L. c. 140D was brought within the statute of limitations. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . Carlos De Oliveira\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   purchased a home at 16 Bellevue Avenue, Oak Bluffs, on April 9, 2007. On that same day, he granted a promissory note to First National Bank of Arizona (FNBA) and a mortgage on the property to Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) as nominee for FNBA. On September 6, 2011, MERS assigned the mortgage to FNBN1, and recorded the assignment at the Dukes County registry of deeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In early 2011, the De Oliveiras defaulted on the mortgage. Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC, servicer to FNBN1 (servicer), sent Carlos a right to cure letter dated March 14, 2011, in accordance with G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 35A. The servicer also sent Carlos three successive notices of default; the last was dated July 12, 2011. The De Oliveiras failed to cure the default, and a foreclosure sale was held on April 25, 2012. FNBN1 recorded a foreclosure deed on July 25, 2012, and on September 17, 2012, initiated a summary process action in the Edgartown District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In June, 2013, a District Court judge allowed FNBN1's motion for summary judgment in the summary process action and judgment for possession entered in favor of FNBN1. In July, 2013, Carlos appealed that decision to the Appellate Division of the District Court, which affirmed the judgment some three and one-half years later, on February 23, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   While that appeal was pending, on April 22, 2014, the De Oliveiras filed this action in the Superior Court challenging the 2012 foreclosure. Judgment for FNBN1 entered on December 7, 2016; the judge ruled in the De Oliveiras' favor on their request for an accounting and for FNBN1 on the remainder of the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

In the Superior Court, the De Oliveiras argued that FNBN1 wrongfully foreclosed on their home because the notices of default did not strictly comply with paragraph 22 of the mortgage as required by\n   <em>\n    Pinti\n   </em>\n   , and that FNBN1's failure to provide an adequate right to cure letter under G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 35A, rendered the foreclosure fundamentally unfair. The judge ultimately concluded that the De Oliveiras had waived the\n   <em>\n    Pinti\n   </em>\n   issue by failing to raise it on appeal from the summary process judgment. We agree, and further conclude that both the\n   <em>\n    Pinti\n   </em>\n   claim and the \u00a7 35A claim are barred by principles of issue preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The term 'res judicata' includes both claim preclusion and issue preclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Kobrin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Registration in Med\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"985748\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/444/837/#p843\">\n    444 Mass. 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 843 (2005). \"Claim preclusion makes a valid, final judgment conclusive on the parties and their privies, and prevents relitigation of all matters that were or could have been adjudicated in the action.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   ., quoting from\n   <em>\n    O'Neill\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    City Manager of Cambridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651290\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/428/257/#p259\">\n    428 Mass. 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 259 (1998). \"Similarly, issue preclusion 'prevents relitigation of an issue determined in an earlier action where the same issue arises in a later action, based on a different claim, between the same parties or their privies.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   ., quoting from\n   <em>\n    Heacock\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Heacock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"820826\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/402/21/\">\n    402 Mass. 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 23 n.2 (1988). \"A party is precluded from relitigating an issue where '(1) there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior adjudication; (2) the party against whom preclusion is asserted was a party (or in privity with a party) to the prior adjudication; and (3) the issue in the prior adjudication was identical to the issue in the current adjudication,' was essential to the earlier judgment, and was actually litigated in the prior action.\"\n   <em>\n    DeGiacomo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Quincy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462656\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/38/#p42\">\n    476 Mass. 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 42 (2016), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Kobrin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"985748\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/444/837/#p843\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"985748\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/444/837/#p843\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As to the first element, final judgment on the merits of the summary process action entered in June, 2013, almost a year before the De Oliveiras filed their Superior Court complaint.

Here, Carlos's interest in preventing FNBN1 from gaining possession was clearly aligned with Miriam's. Binding her to the prior judgment does not offend due process or common-law principles of fairness, as she was aware of the summary process action\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, in any event, Carlos adequately represented the relevant interests of all of the property's occupants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lastly, as defenses in the summary process action, Carlos asserted that FNBN1 was not entitled to possession because it did not comply with paragraph 22 of the mortgage or with G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 35A. Thus, the issues in the prior adjudication were identical to those raised in the Superior Court complaint and were actually litigated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the issues were essential to the earlier judgment, as resolution in Carlos's favor would have precluded judgment of possession for FNBN1. See\n   <em>\n    Federal Natl. Mort.

Rather, the preservation of claims in this manner is the exclusive province of the court hearing the action.\"\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank Natl.

App. Ct. 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 693 (2016). The De Oliveiras contend that\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided because it failed to take into account that under Rule 5 of the Uniform Summary Process Rules, \"Counterclaims shall not be considered compulsory; that is, they shall not be considered waived for the purpose of a separate civil action or actions if not asserted in a summary process action.\" Here, however, Carlos\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   assert his\n   <em>\n    Pinti\n   </em>\n   and \u00a7 35A claims in the summary process action, they were decided against him, and he expressly waived them on appeal. The De Oliveiras cannot relitigate these claims in a subsequent action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Chapter 140D claim\n   </em>\n   . The De Oliveiras contend that the judge erred in determining that their G. L. c. 140D claim was time barred. \"The Massachusetts Consumer Credit Cost Disclosure Act (MCCCDA), G. L. c. 140D, \u00a7\u00a7 1 - 35, governs the rights and duties of creditors and obligors (borrowers or consumers) engaged in consumer credit transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    May\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    SunTrust Mort., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317408\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/756/#p756\">\n    467 Mass. 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 756 (2014). Carlos executed the note and mortgage on April 9, 2007. The De Oliveiras filed the Superior Court complaint more than seven years later. The statute of limitations for all claims under the MCCCDA is four years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The De Oliveiras argue that the discovery rule tolled the statute of limitations because they are not fluent in English and were not represented by counsel at the closing. The discovery rule does not apply in these circumstances. Any alleged defects in the loan documentation were not concealed; they were apparent on the face of those documents. The De Oliveiras' alleged c. 140D claim was not inherently unknowable; it could have been discovered at any time with the exercise of reasonable diligence.
