The City assigns the following error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   I. The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant by affirming part of the arbitrator's award because the arbitrator exceeded his powers and also so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter of the arbitration was not made because he issued an arbitration decision that was arbitrary and capricious, and, thereby, dispensed his own brand of industrial justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Having reviewed the record and pertinent law, we affirm the decision of the trial court. The apposite facts follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On November 29, 2012, over 100 police officers in 58 patrol cars as well as several unmarked police cars were involved in a 23-minute pursuit of a speeding vehicle, which culminated in the shooting deaths of Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams. Two investigations\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the incident\n   revealed that 13 Cleveland police officers fired more than 137 bullets into the vehicle, when the pursuit ended in a parking lot in East Cleveland. According to the investigations, Russell and Williams were unarmed. At least 25 of the officers involved in the pursuit, nine of whom fired their weapons, were under the command of Cleveland Police Sergeants Randolph Daley, Patricia Coleman, Brian Chetnik, and Matthew Putnam (collectively \"the Grievants\"). The investigations determined that, in general, the Grievants failed to supervise their subordinates and failed to comply with various police department policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On June 11, 2013, the City suspended without pay Coleman for 20 days; Daley for 15 days; and Putnam for ten days. On June 13, 2013, the FOP filed grievances pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement (\"the CBA\") between the City and the FOP on behalf of Coleman, Daley, and Putnam requesting the following relief: that the suspensions be rescinded; that the sergeants be \"made whole\" for time lost due to the suspensions; that disciplinary records related to the suspensions be removed from the sergeants' files; and that \"the division\" publicly notify the City's police force that the sergeants have been cleared of the allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On July 18, 2013, the City suspended Chetnick without pay for ten days. On July 22, 2013, the FOP filed a grievance pursuant to the CBA on behalf of Chetnik, requesting relief identical to that requested for Coleman, Daley, and Putnam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On August 7, 2013, the City denied all four grievances, finding that \"[m]anagement acted in a proper manner and no clause of the [CBA] was violated.\" The FOP invoked the arbitration provision of the CBA, and on March 19 and 20, 2014, an arbitrator held hearings on the grievances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On May 24, 2015, the arbitrator issued an award finding that the City did not have \"just cause\" to discipline any of the Grievants. The award revoked Coleman, Daley, Putnam, and Chetnik's suspensions in full and permanently removed \"all departmental records of these respective suspensions\" from the City's files. On August 18, 2015, the City initiated this case by filing a motion to vacate or modify the arbitration award. In turn, the FOP filed an application to confirm and enforce the arbitration award. On March 14, 2017, the court issued an opinion enforcing the arbitration award in part and vacating the award in part. Specifically, the court granted the City's motion to vacate the award regarding the removal and destruction of the disciplinary records from the Grievants' files and granted the FOP's motion to enforce the award revoking the suspensions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Put another way, the court upheld the arbitrator's conclusion that the City did not have just cause to take any disciplinary action against the Grievants. In addition, the court found that the arbitrator lacked authority to purge the Grievants' disciplinary files. It is from this order that the City appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Courts review arbitration awards under the limited standard found in R.C. 2711.10, which states, in pertinent part, as follows: \"the court of common pleas shall make an order vacating the award * * * if * * * (D) The arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\" Generally, an\n   arbitrator has not exceeded his or her authority when an arbitration award \"draws its essence\" from the underlying contract.\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Edn. of Findlay City School Dist. v.

Article XX, Section 4 states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   In the event a grievance goes to arbitration, the arbitrator shall have jurisdiction only over disputes arising out of grievances as to the interpretation and/or application and/or compliance with the provisions of this [CBA], including all disciplinary actions and in reaching his decision, the arbitrator shall have no authority (1) to add or subtract from or modify in any way the provisions of this [CBA]; (2) to pass upon issues governed by law; or (3) to make an award in conflict with law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} During the arbitration in the case at hand, the City alleged that the Grievants failed to supervise their subordinates and failed to comply with various departmental policies, including \"failing to determine the location and actions of all patrol officers assigned to them during the * * * pursuit\" and shooting. The City specifically refers to the Grievants' failure to use \"communication and tracking resources to evaluate and control\" the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The FOP, on the other hand, argued during arbitration that the City did not have \"just cause\" to discipline the Grievants, as required by Article II, Section 2, Subsection (e) of the CBA. According to the FOP, none of the Grievants had prior disciplinary action taken against them, and they all \"held the understanding that they were dealing with mobile active shooters.\" The FOP further argued that the Grievants acted according to \"custom and practice\" regarding a vehicle pursuit, and \"[t]he physical assets and/or training available to the [Grievants] on November 29, 2012 were deficient or non-existent * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The arbitrator concluded that, in some instances, the Grievants did not violate department policy, and that, in other instances, malfeasance occurred but was excused \"given the exigent circumstances and chaotic incident and its aftermath.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For these reasons, the arbitrator found that the City lacked just cause to discipline the Grievants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    The City's Arguments on Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On appeal, the City alleges that the \"award is clearly beyond the arbitrator's authority, is beyond the essence of the agreement, and denies the parties the benefit of their agreement.\" As support for its position, the City compares this case to\n   <em>\n    Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 8 v. Cleveland\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102565,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-4188\">\n    2015-Ohio-4188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205867410\">\n    2015 WL 5867410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which this court affirmed the two-year demotion imposed by an arbitrator regarding Cleveland Police Sergeant Michael Donegan for his role in the same November 29, 2012 pursuit. Donegan held the same departmental rank as the Grievants in the case at hand and was also accused of failing to supervise and violating departmental polices during the pursuit. Therefore, according to the City, under the CBA, it is arbitrary and capricious if the Grievants are not subject to the same or similar discipline as Donegan. However, the discipline resulting from the two arbitrations is quite different: Donegan received a two-year demotion with loss of pay and the Grievants in the instant case received no discipline. This, the City argues, is arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Furthermore, the City argues that the arbitrator's thought process in finding no just cause for discipline was arbitrary and capricious. For example, the arbitrator found that the \"systemic failure\" of the Cleveland Police Department during this incident should be applied to police members with rank of lieutenant and above, which does not include the Grievants, who are sergeants. In weighing this \"escalating authority\" argument, the arbitrator found as follows: \"I * * * do not choose to lay 'fault' at the feet of Sgt. Coleman or any of the other sergeants reviewed herein for either their judgment or conduct connected with this approximately twenty-five minute vehicle pursuit and apprehension.\" According to the City, the arbitration award is ripe with biased statements, and the arbitrator dispensed \"his own brand of industrial justice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 18} For example, the arbitrator concluded the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   While the [City] is no doubt rankled by the number of responding units and patrolmen who \"self-dispatched\" themselves to the chase it cannot by shear will affix blame to the [Grievants] for what [their] responding officers undertook on their own. Had this transpired earlier in the platoon's tour for that night and the [Grievants] went on for, say, two (2) or three (3) hours without knowing the whereabouts of [their] charges or the strength of their self-deployment I'd have a different view.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In addition, as to whether Cleveland Police Deputy Chief Williams issued a particular order at the scene, the arbitrator noted that \"I would have appreciated hearing that from Chief Williams.\" The arbitrator also noted that the Grievants were subject to \"a great deal of public scrutiny and media attention\" as a result of this incident. The arbitrator concluded that \"I cannot escape a fairly pervasive feeling that these disciplinary decisions were designed to play to a different audience rather than to correct and rehabilitate in the labor-management sense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    The FOP's Arguments on Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The FOP argues on appeal that there is no basis to vacate the arbitration award, because it draws it essence from the CBA and the arbitrator properly reviewed the parties' arguments, facts, and evidence. According to the FOP, the arbitration award \"resolved the precise issues that the [p]arties put before [the arbitrator] in accordance with the CBA * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The FOP further argues that the Donegan arbitration outcome-upholding his demotion under similar circumstances-is \"completely irrelevant\" to the case at hand. Additionally, the trial court's statement that it \"likely would have reached a different result and found that some measure of discipline for just cause existed\" \"has absolutely no bearing on the propriety of the [award in the instant case] whatsoever.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Upon review, we find that the arbitrator acted within his authority when revoking the Grievants' suspensions. The arbitration concerned disputes over disciplinary actions, which are expressly authorized in the CBA. Thus, the arbitration award \"draws its essence\" from the CBA. Furthermore, although it may be hard to reconcile a two-year demotion for one actor and no discipline for other actors, we cannot say that this award is arbitrary or capricious. Arbitrary is defined as \"founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   125 (10th Ed.2014). Additionally, capricious means \"contrary to the evidence or established rules of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205867410\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The arbitrator in the case at hand wrote a detailed rationalization of why, in his opinion, the City failed to show just cause for suspending each of the Grievants.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Were the arbitrator's decision to be subject to reversal because a reviewing court disagreed with findings of fact or with an interpretation of the contract, arbitration would become only an added proceeding and expense prior to final judicial determination. This would defeat the bargain made by the parties and would defeat as well the strong public policy favoring private settlement of grievance disputes arising from collective bargaining agreements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.
