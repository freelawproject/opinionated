L. c. 209A. He argues that (1) it was abuse of discretion for the judge to construe a Facebook \"like\" as a threat of imminent physical harm; (2) it was error for the judge to enter the order without evaluating whether it was reasonably necessary to protect the wife; and (3) it was error for the judge to enter the order without referencing the wife's burden of proof or making an explicit finding regarding the wife's credibility. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The wife sought to make permanent an abuse prevention order she had obtained against the husband in 2015. In support, she supplied an affidavit that laid out the verbal, physical, and emotional abuse she had suffered at the hands of the husband during their marriage. The affidavit included details of a Facebook post the husband wrote in 2015, in which he described in dramatic narration how someone with the wife's birth date would die. In 2016, a few days prior to the abuse prevention order extension hearing, the husband posted that he \"liked\" a birthday greeting that someone else had left on the wife's Facebook timeline. In addition to her affidavit, the wife testified during the hearing that she was afraid of the husband and worried that the husband would try to kill her. The judge entered a permanent abuse prevention order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   A person seeking an extension of an abuse prevention order based on \" 'fear of imminent serious physical harm' must always show that he or she is currently in fear of imminent serious physical harm, and that such fear is reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229432\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/85/369/#p374\">\n    85 Mass.

However, the husband ignores the fact that the judge was entitled to interpret the husband's \"like\" by reference to the totality of the circumstances. See\n   <em>\n    Iamele\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Asselin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"985785\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/444/734/#p740\">\n    444 Mass. 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 740, 739 (2005) (\n   <em>\n    Iamele\n   </em>\n   ) (judge is to look at totality of circumstances when deciding whether extension of 209A order is necessary to protect plaintiff \"from the likelihood of 'abuse\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   ' \"). Those circumstances were such as to entitle the judge to interpret the husband's \"like\" as a threat. The wife stated, both in her affidavit and at the hearing, that she remained in fear not only that the husband would physically harm her, but also that he would kill her. When determining whether that fear was reasonable, the judge was entitled to consider the years of escalating emotional, verbal, and physical abuse the wife described. The judge was also entitled to consider the husband's Facebook post from the year before, which laid out in grim detail the death of a person with the wife's same birth date. The judge could find significance in the timing of the posts as well, and could reasonably infer that the timing of the \"like\" would stand as a reminder to the wife of the alarming Facebook post from the previous year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The husband also argues that the judge was required to articulate the wife's burden of proof and to make an explicit finding regarding her credibility; we disagree. What must be clear from the record is that the judge knew the correct standard for deciding whether to extend an abuse prevention order.
