(\"Giant Eagle\"), appeals from the trial court's order entering the jury verdict in favor of plaintiff-appellee, Barbara Rieger (\"Rieger\"), and awarding Rieger $121,000 in compensatory damages and $1,198,000 in punitive damages. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the compensatory damages award and modify the $1,198,000 punitive damages award by remanding to the trial court to enter an order setting the\n   total amount of punitive damages awarded to $242,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This appeal arises from injuries Rieger sustained as a result of a December 2012 accident in a Giant Eagle store with Ruth Kurka (\"Kurka\"). Both Rieger and Kurka were shopping at Giant Eagle at the time. Rieger was standing in front of the bakery counter with her shopping cart when her shopping cart was hit by a Giant Eagle motorized cart driven by Kurka. This collision caused Rieger's shopping cart to hit Rieger who then was knocked to the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In February 2014, Rieger filed a negligence action against Giant Eagle and John Doe. Rieger amended her complaint in May 2014. In her amended complaint, she alleges causes of action for negligence and negligent entrustment against Giant Eagle. She also alleges a negligence cause of action against Kurka, who passed away during the litigation. In June 2015, a suggestion of death was filed, and the Kurka Estate settled with Rieger for $8,500. Rieger dismissed Kurka from the lawsuit in April 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The matter then proceeded to a jury trial against Giant Eagle. The following evidence was adduced at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On the date of the accident, Rieger and Kurka and her husband, George Kurka (\"George\"), went grocery shopping at Giant Eagle. George helped his wife into a motorized cart and then parked his car. When he arrived at the bakery section, he observed his wife on the motorized cart and Rieger on the floor. He asked Kurka what happened, but she said she did not know. Rieger testified that she was standing in front of the bakery counter with her shopping cart when she was knocked to the ground. She was hit by her shopping cart, which was hit by a Giant Eagle motorized cart driven by Kurka. Rieger was not able to stand after the accident, and was taken to the hospital by ambulance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} According to George, Kurka had never been trained on how to operate the Giant Eagle motorized cart and Kurka had been diagnosed with dementia prior to the December 2012 accident. A Giant Eagle corporate representative testified that the safety warnings placed on Giant Eagle motorized carts were for the safety of the driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Rieger presented evidence of 179 incidents involving motorized shopping carts at Giant Eagle stores. These incidents occurred between February 2004 and November 2015 (which was three years after Rieger's incident). Of the 179 incidents, 117 of them occurred prior to the December 2012 incident involving Rieger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} At the close of Rieger's case, Giant Eagle moved for directed verdict on the issues of negligence, negligent entrustment, and punitive damages, which the trial court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} After the conclusion of the trial, the jury awarded Rieger $121,000 in compensatory damages and $1,198,000 in punitive damages. Rieger then filed a combined brief in support of her proposed journal entry on the jury verdict and a brief in support of her motion to determine R.C. 2315.21 unconstitutional as applied. Rieger noted the parties stipulated that any compensatory judgment awarded to Rieger would be offset by the prior Kurka settlement of $8,500. As a result, Rieger was entitled to $112,500 in compensatory damages from Giant Eagle. Rieger further noted that under R.C. 2315.21, her punitive damages award was limited to two times the compensatory damages award, which is $242,000. However, Rieger argued that R.C. 2315.21 is unconstitutional as applied to her case and the punitive damages of $1,198,000, as awarded by the jury to Rieger,\n   should not be reduced. The trial court conducted a hearing on the pending motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Following the hearing, the trial court granted Rieger's motion to find R.C. 2315.21 unconstitutional as applied. The court found that \"the [j]ury's punitive damage award of $1,198,000.00 is within a constitutionally acceptable range and is not excessive; and, is within the confines of the legislative purpose of punitive damages which is to deter and punish.\" The trial court then entered a judgment awarding Rieger $112,500 in compensatory damages and $1,198,000 in punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Giant Eagle now appeals, raising the following five assignments of error, which shall be discussed together where appropriate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error One\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court erred by failing to grant [Giant Eagle's] motion for directed verdict on [Rieger's] claim for punitive damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Two\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court erred by finding that R.C. 2315.21, which limits punitive damages to twice the award for compensatory damages, was unconstitutional as applied in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Three\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court erred by failing to grant Giant Eagle's motion for a directed verdict on [Rieger's] claim alleging that Giant Eagle negligently provided motorized shopping carts to its customers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Four\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial court erred by failing to grant Giant Eagle's motion for a directed verdict on [Rieger's] claim alleging that Giant Eagle negligently entrusted [Kurka], a customer, with one of its motorized carts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Five\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The trial court erred by admitting 179 incidents involving a motorized shopping cart at a Giant Eagle store between 2004 and 2015 without any showing of similarity or other indicia of relevancy between these incidents and the accident in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Directed Verdict\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In the first, third, and fourth assignments of error, Giant Eagle challenges the trial court's denial of its motion for directed verdict regarding Rieger's claims for punitive damages, negligence, and negligent entrustment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Civ.R. 50(A) governs motions for directed verdict and reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   When a motion for a directed verdict has been properly made, and the trial court, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party, the court shall sustain the motion and direct a verdict for the moving party as to that issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at (A)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 14} A trial court's decision on a motion for directed verdict presents a question of law, which an appellate court reviews de novo.\n   <em>\n    C4 Polymers, Inc. v.

Therefore, we do not find Rieger proved by clear and convincing evidence that Giant Eagle's conduct was so reprehensible that the application of the punitive damages cap to the instant case is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Having found that Rieger did not satisfy the first\n   <em>\n    Gore\n   </em>\n   factor, we need not address the remaining factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 40} We are mindful that there is no magic formula for determining the proper amount of punitive damages. Rather, the amount that should be awarded is the amount that best accomplishes\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   the twin aims of punishment and deterrence as to that defendant. We do not require, or invite, financial ruination of a defendant that is liable for punitive damages. While certainly a higher award will always yield a greater punishment and greater deterrent, the punitive damages award should not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its goals. The law requires an effective punishment, not a draconian one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    Dardinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002-Ohio-7113\">\n    2002-Ohio-7113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"709595\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/98/77/\">\n    98 Ohio St.3d 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=781%20N.E.2d%20121\">\n    781 N.E.2d 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 178.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 41} In light of the foregoing, we find that the $1,198,000 punitive damages award is unconstitutionally excessive.

There, the court considered admissibility of prior accident evidence in a products liability action concerning an alleged defective Skil saw. The plaintiff attempted to introduce answers to interrogatories regarding prior personal injury accidents involving the Skil saw. The answers did not indicate how the injuries occurred or whether they resulted from defective lower blade guards. Plaintiff contended that the interrogatory answers were admissible on Skil's knowledge of prior accidents relevant to the duty to warn, to establish evidence of the existence of defect, causation, and negligent design, and to attack the credibility of the defendant's expert witness.

Her argument referenced the 117 incidents involving motorized carts that occurred prior to Rieger's December 2012 accident.
