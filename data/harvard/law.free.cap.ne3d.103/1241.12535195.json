We discern no cause to disturb the judgments and affirm, addressing the defendant's claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Ineffective assistance of counsel\n   </em>\n   . We review the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the familiar two-prong\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   test. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n    366 Mass. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96 (1974).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The trial transcript demonstrates that trial counsel stipulated to facts that the Commonwealth could, and did, prove at trial in support of a strategy to preserve for appeal the defendant's claim of error in the denial of his motion to suppress evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the evidence seized in execution of the warrant to search the defendant's residence was outcome determinative, counsel's strategic decision to pursue an appeal of the suppression issue was not manifestly unreasonable. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3656909\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/453/40/#p44\">\n    453 Mass. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 44 (2009). The evidence seized during the execution of the search warrant, as well as the testimony and other evidence offered by the Commonwealth, overwhelmingly established the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt based on the evidence, particularly including the evidence obtained by means of the warrant, and the fact that the procedure preserved the defendant's right to appeal the order denying the motion to suppress, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ramsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224316\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/466/489/\">\n    466 Mass. 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 496 n.8 (2013), counsel's stipulations did not deprive the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Motion to suppress\n   </em>\n   . The defendant separately contends that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause. In particular, the defendant contends that the affidavit submitted in support of the application for the warrant, citing information provided by a confidential informant (CI), did not satisfy the veracity prong of the\n   <em>\n    Aguilar\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After reviewing the supporting affidavit of Detective Joseph King and Special Agent Peter Kelley, we conclude that the affidavit, read as a whole, contained sufficient indicia of the CI's veracity. The CI had during the immediately preceding two months provided officers with information about a number of suspected gun and drug dealers. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alfonso A\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"201333\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/438/372/#p375\">\n    438 Mass. 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 375-376 (2003) (that informant was not \"an untraceable, unknown source ... weighs in favor of reliability\"). The CI also had a reliable track record with the officers. The affidavit details two controlled narcotics purchases conducted by the CI, at the direction of the officers, from individuals who had been identified by the CI as drug dealers and from which the police ultimately recovered and positively field-tested illegal narcotics.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Desper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"823740\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/419/163/#p168\">\n    419 Mass. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 168-169 (1994) (information detailing controlled purchases of narcotics are adequate means to establish CI's reliability). Moreover, the CI's veracity was bolstered through independent police corroboration of the CI's disclosures regarding the defendant, confirming his physical description and name by reference to Registry of Motor Vehicles data, and confirming the defendant's residence through surveillance. Such corroboration by police of details given by the CI supports the conclusion that the CI was reliable in the particulars provided.

One of the officers also testified that based on \"what was recovered at the search warrant location with the digital scale, the cutting agent, the packaging materials, and then also the statements that [the defendant] made to me, personally, that the money inside that location was received as payment for drugs sales, I would say yeah, that's what these drugs were intended for.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    See\n    <em>\n     Aguilar\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Texas\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165107\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/378/108/\">\n     378 U.S. 108\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1964), and\n    <em>\n     Spinelli\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11317375\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/410/\">\n     393 U.S. 410\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1969).
