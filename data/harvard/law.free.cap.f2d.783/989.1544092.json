We, therefore, vacate and remand for further proceedings in light of <em>United States v. Romero-Galue, </em>757 F.2d 1147 (11th Cir.1985) and <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>776 F.2d 931, 933 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-17\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1073-18\">HATCHETT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AK6\">specially concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-19\">I specially concur, as I have done previously in the <em>Romero-Galue </em>line of cases. Based on <em>Romero-Galue, </em>757 F.2d 1147 (11th Cir.1985), the court has now decided in at least three other cases that informal communication, by radio, teletype, or the like, constitutes an \u201cother arrangement\u201d within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(j). <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>776 F.2d 931 at 933 (11th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Bent-Santana, </em>774 F.2d 1545, 1548 (11th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Salvat, </em>779 F.2d 58 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-20\">Because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 955a(c), the statute under which these defendants were convicted, incorporates the definition of customs waters in section 1401(j), this circuit\u2019s construction of \u201cother arrangement\u201d has become the basis for sustaining indictments against drug smugglers apprehended pursuant to informal agreements by the Coast Guard with their flag countries. Under this circuit\u2019s law, if the officer of a Coast Guard vessel is able to reach some official in a foreign country who will give consent to jurisdiction over a foreign vessel, the waters around the vessel instantly become \u201ccustoms waters.\u201d Under the same rationale, if communications difficulties should frustrate the effort to establish contact with someone in the foreign country, the waters around the vessel presumably would never be transformed into \u201ccustoms waters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-21\">In my special concurrence in <em>Gonzalez, </em>I described my reasons for concluding that Congress did not intend the criminal jurisdiction of the United States to depend on occasional consent by representatives of foreign nations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-22\">In urging this circuit to consider more carefully congressional intent in enacting section 955a(c), I respectfully note my disagreement with the statement in the recent case, <em>Bent-Santana, </em>that \u201cat least four other circuits ... have held that verbal or written consent conveyed by the country of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>the vessel\u2019s flag constitutes an agreement sufficient to place [a] vessel in the customs waters of the United States.\u201d At 1549. In <em>United States v. Loalza-Vasquez, </em>735 F.2d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1984), the court affirmed two conspiracy counts on a holding that a reasonable-minded juror could conclude from the evidence that the destination of the vessel involved was the United States. On the possession count, the court held that the district court did not commit clear error in admitting testimony that a teletype was received and allowing the government to submit certified copies of two of the messages to show consent. 735 F.2d at 157. Concededly, the court refers to \u201cthe ultimate issue of jurisdiction\u201d and affirms the convictions. 735 F.2d at 158. But the vital issues of statutory construction were apparently not raised. Thus, <em>Loalza-Vasquez </em>cannot fairly be said to stand for a well-considered decision by the Fifth Circuit to construe \u201cother arrangement\u201d as this circuit has. The treatment in <em>United States v. Streifel, </em>665 F.2d 414 (2d Cir.1981) of this issue is acknowledged in the <em>Bent-Santana </em>opinion to be <em>dictum. See Bent-Santana, </em>At 1549. Both <em>United States v. Green, </em>671 F.2d 46, 51 (1st Cir.1982) , <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1135, 102 S.Ct. 2962, 73 L.Ed.2d 1352 (1982), and <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>604 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1014, 100 S.Ct. 664, 62 L.Ed.2d 644 (1980), involve another statute. These two cases construe the meaning of \u201cspecial arrangement\u201d in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(h), which authorizes boarding and search to enforce the laws of the United States, but which does not independently create criminal liability, as does section 955a(c). Moreover, a \u201cspecial arrangement\u201d is a means for searching vessels <em>\u201cwithout </em>the customs waters of the United States.\u201d <em>Green, </em>671 F.2d at 52 (citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1587(a)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">No other circuit has had the issue of the proper construction of section 955a(c) placed squarely before it. I urge the en banc court to take the lead in providing a sound construction of the meaning of \u201ccustoms waters\u201d in section 955a(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
