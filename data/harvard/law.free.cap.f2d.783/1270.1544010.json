The district court granted summary judgment in favor of LSU. On appeal, this Court affirmed in part and remanded in part, <em>Berry v. Board of Supervisors, </em>715 F.2d 971 (5th Cir.1983). The Court directed the district court to consider on remand Berry\u2019s Title VII and Equal Pay Act claims. After a partial summary judgment on the Title VII claim and a trial on the merits of the Equal Pay Act claim, the district court entered judgment for the defendants. Finding that plaintiff Berry fails to establish that the district court erred in following this Court\u2019s mandate, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-8\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-9\">Berry was' hired as an associate professor of guidance counseling in the Department of Education at LSU.- Her initial appointment, at a salary of $17,000 per year, was for two academic years from August 20, 1975, to May 21, 1977. On October 14, 1976, Berry was notified that her contract would not be renewed when it expired the next semester.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Berry initiated internal review proceedings of her termination which were unavailing. On October 12, 1977, Berry filed a charge of sex discrimination against LSU with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and on August 4, 1978, she commenced her federal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-13\">Berry\u2019s complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that she was assigned an excessive workload of eighteen to twenty-one hours per semester in addition to her responsibilities of research and development of a doctoral program in the field of guidance counselor education. Berry acknowledged that her base salary was equal to that of her male counterparts but alleged that her excessive workload prevented her from teaching extramural courses for extra pay, as did at least some of her colleagues who taught graduate students. She also alleged that she was not given adequate assistance in her work and that her successor, Dr. Thomas Hosie, was given such assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-14\">Prior to the first appeal, the district court dismissed Berry\u2019s claim under the Equal Pay Act for failure to state a cause of action, concluding that the Act applied \u201conly when males and females are paid different wages for equal work.\u201d The district court dismissed her Title VII claim because she failed to file her charge within 180 days of the \u201calleged unlawful employment practice,\u201d <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(d), which the district court considered to have occurred on October 14, 1976, the date Berry received notice that she would not be rehired. The trial court also found Berry\u2019s section 1983 action barred by the Louisiana prescription statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-15\">On appeal, this Court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. On the Equal Pay Act claim, the Court discerned that Berry\u2019s arguments could be broken into two areas: (1) that she was assigned an excessive workload compared to her male counterparts; and (2) that her excessive workload prevented her from teaching extramural courses for extra pay. The court found that the second stated a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>cause of action under the Equal Pay Act. The Court noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-4\">Berry\u2019s allegation that she carried an extra heavy regular course load while male professors, who did not, were able to teach additional courses for extra pay is susceptible of the construction that the plaintiff was paid less money for \u201cequal\u201d work in terms of the number of hours taught and other relevant factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">715 F.2d at 974. The Court emphasized that on remand Berry must meet the statutory requirements of proving her claim under the Equal Pay Act. <em>Id. </em>at 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">As to Berry\u2019s Title VII claim, the Court agreed with the district court\u2019s holding that Berry\u2019s discharge was time-barred since it \u201cwas a discrete act of discrimination, and Berry was obliged to seek relief from it within the statutory 180-day period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 980. The Court, however, noted that Berry\u2019s claim of workload discrimination might have been a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d which extended into the actionable 180 day period. The Court therefore conducted an exhaustive study of the theory of \u201ccontinuing violation,\u201d suggested three factors that courts should consider, and remanded the case to the district court to consider these factors in determining whether Berry\u2019s charge of workload discrimination was a continuing violation. The Court explicitly stated that the trial court should determine, in the first instance, whether summary judgment was appropriate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-7\">On remand, the district court granted partial summary judgment on the Title VII claim, holding that Berry\u2019s claim of discrimination of a heavier instructional load did not fall within the 180 day period preceding the filing of her claim with the EEOC. The district court then proceeded to hear Berry\u2019s Equal Pay Act claim. After a three day trial, the district court entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that Berry\u2019s work assignment was not comparable under Equal Pay Act standards with that of the five male professors with whom she sought comparison. The plaintiff timely appealed from the district court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-10\">II. THE MERITS-</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-11\">We first examine Berry\u2019s claim that the district court erred in holding that her Title VII claim of discrimination of a heavier instructional workload was time-barred for failure to file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 180 days of the \u201calleged unlawful employment practice.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(d). As the Court noted on the first appeal, 715 F.2d at 980 n. 13, Berry filed her charge with the EEOC on October 12, 1977. Berry, therefore, was required to allege a violation of Title VII within 180 days preceding that date, or approximately April 12, 1977. The Court noted that since Berry\u2019s work at LSU continued until May 21, 1977, Berry might be able to establish a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d that reached into the actionable period between April 12 and May 21 and which would therefore comply with the 180 day filing requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-12\">In order to guide the district court and the parties on remand, the Court undertook a careful study of instances in which the theory of a continuing violation \u201crelieves a plaintiff ... from the burden of proving that the entire violation occurred within the actionable period.\u201d 715 F.2d at 979. The Court noted that mere continuity in employment with the defendant was insufficient to relieve the plaintiff\u2019s burden. <em>See United Airlines, Inc. v. Evans, </em>431 U.S. 553, 558, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 1889, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977); <em>Delaware State College v. Ricks, </em>449 U.S. 250, 257, 101 S.Ct. 498, 504, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980). Rather, the Court discussed the difficulty in distinguishing related acts of discrimination constituting a continuing violation and discrete acts \u201cwhich must be regarded as individual violations.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>715 F.2d at 981. The Court then suggested the approach to be followed by the trial court on remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-4\">This inquiry, of necessity, turns on the facts and context of each particular case. Relevant to the determination are the following three factors, which we discuss, but by no means consider to be exhaustive. The first is subject matter. Do the alleged acts involve the same type of discrimination, tending to connect them in a continuing violation? The second is frequency. Are the alleged acts recurring <em>(e.g., </em>a biweekly paycheck) or more in the nature of an isolated work assignment or employment decision? The third factor, perhaps of most importance, is degree of permanence. Does the act have the degree of permanence which should trigger an employee\u2019s awareness of and duty to assert his or her rights, or which should indicate to the employee that the continued existence of the adverse consequences of the act is to be expected without being dependent on a continuing intent to discriminate?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 981 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">On remand, the district court held that Berry\u2019s workload assignment for the spring semester of 1977 did not constitute a continuing violation. Relying on affidavits submitted by defendants, the district court noted that faculty work assignments were finalized at the beginning of the semester in January 1977:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-7\">The allegedly discriminatory act, the assignment of work responsibility, occurred in January of 1977 when assignment of the spring semester duties was finalized. No changes were made thereafter. What allegedly followed thereafter and about which plaintiff complains (deprivation of income, etc.) were results and consequences of the alleged discriminatory act, not new discriminatory acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">The trial court then applied the three factors suggested on the first appeal. The trial court noted that faculty work assignments are more in the nature of an \u201cisolated work assignment\u201d since they are made at the beginning of a semester. The trial court also noted that such assignments are \u201cpermanent\u201d in that \u201cthe continued existence of the adverse consequences of the act is to be expected without being dependent on a continuing intent to discriminate.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>715 F.2d at 981. The district court, therefore, held that Berry failed to meet the 180 day filing requirement under Title VII on her workload discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-9\">On appeal, counsel for the plaintiff does not attempt to address how plaintiff\u2019s argument of a continuing violation of workload discrimination fits within the <em>Berry </em>framework. Rather, plaintiff draws on generalities from previous continuing violation cases without addressing this Court\u2019s concerns explicitly stated in the prior appeal. Nor does plaintiff attempt to dispute the district court\u2019s holding that the work assignments, were finalized at the beginning of the 1977 spring semester. Instead, plaintiff attempts five distinctions which plaintiff feels establishes a continuing violation extending into the actionable period of April 15 to May 21, 1977:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-10\">(1) No release time from instructional responsibilities for program development, scholarly activities and service projects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-11\">(2) Inability to accept extramural teaching;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-12\">(3) Failure to receive paychecks for extramural teaching;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-13\">(4) Advisement of undergraduate students in late April 1977; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-14\">(5) Replacement of plaintiff by a male on August 24, 1977.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-15\">Without any explanation as to their relevance to the <em>Berry </em>factors, we see no substantial merit to these arguments. The first three relate solely to Berry\u2019s work assignment, which was finalized in January 1977 before the actionable period. The fourth, although possibly a source of a continuing violation, fails in that the record establishes that such assignments of aca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>demic advisement were routine. Finally, plaintiffs assertion that she was unaware of LSU\u2019s discriminatory conduct until she learned she was replaced by Dr. Hosie is belied by this Court\u2019s prior holding that she was aware of the alleged discrimination as early as January 16,1977. <em>Berry, </em>715 F.2d at 982. In sum, plaintiff\u2019s failure to address the mandate of this Court dooms its Title VII argument on this second appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">Turning to Berry\u2019s Equal Pay Act claim, the Court on the first appeal noted that plaintiff stated a claim insofar as she alleged that \u201c[bjecause of her exceptional and heavy work load, Plaintiff was unable to teach extramural courses for pay as her male colleagues could do and, in fact, did.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 974. The Court emphasized that \u201cBerry will be required to demonstrate [on remand], <em>inter alia, </em>that the work was in the same \u2018establishment\u2019 and was \u2018equal work on jobs\u2019 requiring \u2018equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions____\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 975 (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d)(1) (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">On remand the district court noted that the plaintiff sought to compare herself with five of her colleagues to show that her heavier instructional workload prevented her from teaching extramural courses. The district court also found that, unlike Berry, these five \u201ccomparators\u201d were assigned primarily administrative duties. This finding of fact is subject to the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See Hodgson v. First Victoria National Bank, </em>446 F.2d 47, 48 (5th Cir.1971) (per curiam); <em>Marshall v. Dallas Independent School District, </em>605 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1979). <em>See also Spaulding v. University of Washington, </em>740 F.2d 686, 697 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 511, 83 L.Ed.2d 401 (1984). Once again, plaintiff does not present an argument specifying how this finding was so erroneous. Nevertheless, the Court has examined the record in detail as to the work assigned Berry and her colleagues and finds no such error. <em>See Spaulding, </em>740 F.2d at 698 (plaintiff\u2019s evidence should \u201cadequately evaluate the actual work performed by various faculty members\u201d). Therefore, it cannot be said that the district court erred in holding that Berry\u2019s Equal Pay Act claim failed after a trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1355-10\">. This Court supplements the facts stated in the court\u2019s opinion on the first appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1355-11\">. In her original complaint, Dr. Berry contended that her termination at LSU violated Title VII and \u00a7 1983. The Court found Berry\u2019s assertion regarding her termination time-barred under both statutes. <em>See Berry, </em>715 F.2d at 980, 982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1356-8\">. The Court also held that the Louisiana prescription statute of one year for \u201coffenses and quasi-offenses\" applied to Berry's claim under \u00a7 1983. The Court held that, based on a letter that Berry wrote alleging sex discrimination on January 16, 1977, Berry was aware of the alleged discriminatory practices. The Court held that her \u00a7 1983 action accrued on this date and that her \u00a7 1983 claim, filed over a year later, was time-barred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1356-14\">. The plaintiff also sought to maintain her suit as a class action. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of this motion for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s memorandum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
