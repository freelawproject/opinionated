Arizona\n   </em>\n   ; Motion to Suppress Involuntary Statements by Defendant; Request for Hearing Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203501\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , filed March 1, 2017 (Doc. 184)(\"Motion to Suppress\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court held evidentiary hearings on April 13, 2017, and May 4, 2017. The primary issue are: (i) whether the Court should suppress statements that Defendant Chris Garcia made during an interrogation with Nathan Lerner -- a sergeant with the Bernalillo County Sherriff's Department -- and FBI Special Agent Joe Sainato, because Garcia invoked his right to counsel before the interrogation by telling Lerner \"My attorney is Robert Gorence\"; and (ii) whether the Court must exclude all of Garcia's statements from the interrogation under\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p444\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 444,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p444\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p444\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966) (\"\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   \") and\n   <em>\n    Missouri v. Seibert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    542 U.S. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (\"\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   \"), because Sainato did not give Garcia a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning until sixteen minutes into the interrogation. The Court concludes that Garcia did not invoke his right to counsel before the interview, because Garcia was not yet subject to custodial interrogation, as required to trigger\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   protections. The Court will, accordingly, not suppress Garcia's statements on those grounds. The Court will also not suppress the testimony obtained after the late\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning, because Sainato did not deliberately issue the warning late. Rather, the evidence suggests it was a good-faith mistake. The Court will suppress, however, the statements Garcia made before the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning, because, once questioning began, Garcia had been subjected to custodial interrogation. The Court, accordingly, grants in part and denies in part the requests in the Motion to Suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court takes its background facts from the Second Superseding Indictment, No. 15-4268, filed March 9, 2017 (Doc. 947)(\"Indictment\"). The background facts are largely unchanged from those that the Court provided in its Memorandum Opinion and Order,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=323%20F.R.D.%20672\">\n    323 F.R.D. 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.M. 2017) (Doc. 1585). The Court does not set forth these facts as findings or the truth. The Court recognizes that the factual background largely reflects the United States' version of events and that the Defendants are all presumed innocent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This case deals with crimes that the Syndicato\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   de Nuevo Mexico (\"SNM\") allegedly\n   committed through its members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 2. SNM, through its members, operated in the District of New Mexico at all relevant times, and its members engaged in acts of violence and other criminal activities, \"including murder, kidnapping, attempted murder, conspiracy to manufacture/distribute narcotics, and firearms trafficking.\" Indictment at 2. SNM constitutes an enterprise \"as defined in Title 18, United States Code, Section 1959(b)(2), that is, a group of individuals associated in fact that engaged in, and the activities of which affected, interstate and foreign commerce.\" Indictment at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   SNM is a violent prison gang formed in the early 1980s at the Penitentiary of New Mexico (\"PNM\") after a violent prison riot at PNM during which inmates seriously assaulted and raped twelve correctional officers after taking them hostage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 3. During the riot, thirty-three inmates were killed, and over 200 were injured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 3. After the PNM riot, SNM expanded throughout the state's prison system and has had as many as 500 members at one time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 3. SNM has approximately 250 members now and is led by \"a 'panel' or 'mesa' (Spanish for table) of leaders who issue[ ] orders to subordinate gang members.\" Indictment at 3. SNM controls drug distribution and other illegal activities within the New Mexico penal system, but it also conveys orders outside the prison system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 3. Members who rejoin their communities after completing their sentences are expected to further the gang's goals; its main goal is controlling and profiting from narcotics trafficking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 3-4. Members who fail \"to show continued loyalty to the gang [are] disciplined in various ways, [ ] includ[ing] murder and assaults.\" Indictment at 4. SNM also intimidates and influences smaller New Mexico Hispanic gangs to expand its illegal activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 4. If another gang does not abide by SNM's demands, SNM may assault or kill one of the other gang's members to show its power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 4. SNM's rivalry with other gangs also manifests itself in beatings and stabbings within the prison system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 4. SNM further engages in violence \"to assert its gang identity, to claim or protect its territory, to challenge or respond to challenges, to retaliate against a rival gang or member, [and] to gain notoriety and show its superiority over others.\" Indictment at 4. To show its strength and influence, SNM expects its members to confront and attack any suspected law enforcement informants, cooperating witnesses, homosexuals, or sex offenders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 5. To preserve its power, SNM uses intimidation, threats of violence, assaults, and murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 7. SNM as an enterprise generates income by having its members and associates traffic controlled substances and extort narcotic traffickers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 8. SNM's recent activities in a conspiracy to murder high-ranking New Mexico Corrections Department Officials, including Wayne Santistevan and Gregg Marcantel, inspired the Federal Bureau of Investigation's present investigation.\n   <em>\n    SeeUnited States v.

He rallies four arguments in favor of suppression.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Motion to Suppress at 5-10. First, he argues that Lerner and Sainato took his statements without a proper\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    waiver.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Motion to Suppress at 6. Garcia asserts that he never signed a written waiver form, despite the United States' representations to the contrary.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Motion to Suppress at 6. He also argues that his oral waiver \"was a mere recitation of a document\" placed in front of him \"rather than a meaningful question-and-answer,\" and, thus, cannot constitute proper oral waiver. Motion to Suppress at 6-7.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Second, he argues that any waiver obtained is invalid, because Sainato gave a \"midstream\" or mid-interview\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning. Motion to Suppress at 7 (citing\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     542 U.S. 600\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     124 S.Ct. 2601\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2004) ). According to Garcia, a midstream\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning is proper only if the surrounding circumstances indicated to Garcia \"that the warnings presented a meaningful opportunity for him to terminate the interrogation.\" Motion to Suppress at 8. Garcia contends that the circumstances surrounding his\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning did not indicate\n    to him that he could stop the questioning and ask for an attorney, because Sainato and Lerner \"treated the second portion of the interrogation as continuous with the first.\" Motion to Suppress at 7. Garcia adds that Sainato presented the warning as \"a brief, cursory interruption to the line of questioning\" and that Garcia was \"clearly intoxicated and confused.\" Motion to Suppress at 8. He concludes, therefore, that his\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    waiver was not knowing and voluntary.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Motion to Suppress at 8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Third, Garcia asserts that being intoxicated independently demonstrates that his\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    waiver was not knowing and voluntary.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Motion to Suppress at 8-9. According to Garcia, he was \"highly intoxicated,\" because he had \"ingested significant quantities of Hydrocodone and Xanax\" before the interview. Motion to Suppress at 2, 8. He contends that his state of intoxication is apparent from his \"rambling and disjointed\" answers. Motion to Suppress at 9. He adds that he stated during the Agent's preamble to the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning: \"I still don't understand.\" Motion to Suppress at 9.

It asserts that Sainato's\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning was proper, because Sainato and Lerner did not purposefully avoid reading Garcia his rights in an effort to obtain a pre-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning confession, as the law-enforcement agent had done in\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Response at 4-5 (citing\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     542 U.S. at 605-06\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     124 S.Ct. 2601\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).

It explains that, over the course of a three-hour interview, Garcia was able to \"recall old events, discuss the SNM, give his opinion of the SNM, all while not making very incriminating statements as to specific crimes.\" Response at 6. The United States asserts that, when compared to other recordings it has of Garcia, it is clear that Garcia was not intoxicated during the December 3, 2015, or at least not so intoxicated as to nullify Garcia's waiver.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Response at 6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Finally, the United States asserts that, under the totality of the circumstances, Garcia's waiver was voluntary.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Response at 6. Namely, the United States argues that the waiver was voluntary, because: (i) Garcia was forty years old with \"numerous previous contacts with law enforcement\"; (ii) he was not handcuffed; (iii) he was provided water; (iv) the agents never threatened Garcia; (v) the \"nature of the interview ... indicate[s] that [Garcia] knew what he was talking about, and how not to incriminate himself\"; (vi) Sainato gave Garcia a\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning, which Garcia acknowledged with a signed affirmation; and (vii) the interview was \"conversational and respectful.\" Response at 6-7.

Garcia also asserts that the interrogation after the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning overlapped those subjects as the interview covered \"numerous gang-related incidents.\" Reply at 3. Garcia also contends that the Court should suppress Garcia's statements under\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    , because \"there was no gap between the pre-and post-Miranda interrogations,\" \"Garcia was not moved to a different location,\" and \"the same personnel continued the interrogation post-Miranda.\" Reply at 3 (citing\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     542 U.S. at 615\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     124 S.Ct. 2601\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Garcia next argues that the United States impermissibly shifted the burden to Garcia when it argued that Garcia had no issue with the lack of an initial\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reply at 3.

Garcia concludes that the Court should suppress Garcia's\n    statements under\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    and disregard the United States' arguments to the contrary.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reply at 4.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    <strong>\n     4.\n     <em>\n      The May 4, 2017, Hearing\n     </em>\n     .\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The Court held a hearing on May 4, 2017.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    May Tr. at 141:3 (Adams). Garcia argued that the Court should suppress the entire interrogation, because\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    's five factors weigh toward suppressing the statements.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    May Tr. at 141:3-4 (Adams)(citing\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     542 U.S. at 615\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     124 S.Ct. 2601\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (listing the five factors as: (i) the completeness and detail of the pre-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    interrogation; (ii) the overlapping content of the pre- and post-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    statements; (iii) the timing and setting of the pre- and post-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    statements; (iv) the continuity of police personnel; and (v) the degree to which the interrogators treated the post-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    statements as continuous to the pre-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    statements). He argued that the pre-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    round of interrogation was complete and detailed, because Sainato and Lerner covered many SNM topics with Garcia.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    May Tr. at 141:9-142:7 (Adams). He contended that the two rounds of questioning overlapped, because Sainato admitted that everything asked after the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning \"had been based off the building blocks\" of the first round of questioning. May Tr. at 142:12-17 (Adams). Garcia added that the timing, the setting, and the continuity of the police personnel weighs toward suppression, because the setting and the law-enforcement agents never changed -- both Sainato and Lerner stayed with Garcia at the parole office for the interview's entirety.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    May Tr. at 143:12-21 (Adams). Finally, he averred that Sainato and Lerner treated the post-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    statements as continuous with the pre-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    statements, because the post-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    questioning immediately reverted to a pre-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    topic -- an SNM member nicknamed \"Styx.\" May Tr. at 144:6-16 (Adams).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The Court observed that Garcia's statements do not give \"any sort of clean admissions on himself,\" but give a lot of general information about SNM. May Tr. at 145:6-9 (Court). It asked how the content of Garcia's statements might affect the suppression analysis.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    May Tr. at 144:25-145:18 (Court). Garcia responded that the relevant question is whether \"Miranda [had] been faithfully complied with\" and that the Court should not do any \"guesswork on what was in somebody's state of mind.\" May Tr. at 145:25-146:3 (Adams). He contended that, although \"it sure does look like Garcia was ready to talk,\" the United States \"shouldn't be able to get the benefit of that by choosing how and when to work around the strict requirements of Miranda.\" May Tr. at 147:6-9 (Adams).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The United States then took the podium and contended that Sainato had made a good-faith mistake when he gave a late\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    May Tr. at 154:3-6 (Armijo). It added that an officer's state of mind is relevant under\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    given the Supreme Court's emphasis in that case on the officers' intentions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    May Tr. at 154:9-16 (Armijo). The Court agreed that it appeared as if Sainato did not intend to delay the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning, but it expressed concern that Lerner behaved as if the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning was \"something to be overcome rather than something to be given to assure that the statements are voluntary,\" and that the interrogation immediately reverted to talking about \"Styx.\" May Tr. at 155:13-24 (Court). The United States rejoined that Garcia's voluntariness is apparent from Garcia's comment: \"I can even say on the recording that I understand what happened. And everything is fine. I'm not against it. You know what I mean.\" May Tr. at 156:12-15 (Armijo). The United States continued that this statement demonstrates that, even if the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning had been given in the car\n    or at the beginning of the interview, Garcia would have talked.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    May Tr. at 157:4-7 (Armijo). The United States argued that Garcia's voluntariness is also apparent from his desire to continue the interview even as Sainato and Lerner tried to end it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    May Tr. at 158:2-5 (Armijo). The United States contended that Garcia's desire to tell everything is relevant under\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    's completeness factor.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    May Tr. at 158:12-14 (Armijo).

He contends that the totality of the circumstances demonstrate that he clearly invoked his right to counsel.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Supp. Motion at 5. He states that: (i) he was arrested in the early morning at his house; (ii) many law-enforcement officers were present; (iii) he was cuffed and placed in a marked police car; (iv) Lerner told him the FBI was going to interrogate him; and (v) in response to learning that he was going to be questioned, Garcia stated: \"My attorney is Robert Gorence.\" Supp. Motion at 5.

Garcia later stated, after Sainato expressed some dismay at failing to read Garcia's\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    rights initially, that \"I can even say on the recording that I understand what happened and everything is fine. I'm not against it. You know what I mean?\" Int. Tr. at 21:20-23 (Garcia). Garcia was forty years old in December, 2015.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Patient History at 1.

In that case, the Tenth Circuit held:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n    The record likewise demonstrates Smith's waiver of his rights was voluntary. When Smith waived his\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    rights, he was nearly 21 years of age and had completed the tenth grade. Smith waived his rights after he had been informed of them both orally by Agent Sayegh and in writing through the advice of rights form. Prior to waiving his rights, Smith had been under arrest for approximately three hours but had not been questioned. The interview took place in a room large enough to accommodate adequately the interviewers. Smith was not handcuffed during the interview.

The Court sees no reason to diverge from that holding, and concludes that Garcia knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    rights after Sainato gave him the warning.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    Garcia contends, however, that his waiver could not have been voluntary, because he was intoxicated on Xanax and Oxycodone.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Motion to Suppress at 2, 8.\n    <footnotemark>\n     27\n    </footnotemark>\n    Although intoxication bears on the waiver analysis, \"[t]he state of intoxication does not automatically render a statement involuntary.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

While the record supports that Garcia used the two drugs at some point before the interview, it does not reveal how much he ingested and it suggests that Garcia took them on December 2, 2015 -- the day before the interview.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Intake Screen at 1 (noting that Garcia had ingested Xanax and Oxycodone two days before December 4, 2015). Both Lerner and Sainato affirmed that Garcia was lucid for the interview.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    April Tr. at 177:14 (Lerner)(\"He was coherent, yes, he was.\"); May Tr. at 119:23-120:4 (Armijo, Sainato). After listening to the interview's tape recording, the Court agrees with Lerner and Sainato. Before the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning, Garcia speaks in a thick, throaty voice, which might indicate intoxication -- or merely the early morning hour -- but at almost all times Garcia responds quickly and responsively to questions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Interview Recording 0:01-15:37 (Garcia, Lerner, Sainato). Based on that responsiveness, the Court credits Lerner's and Sainato's testimony and concludes that whatever amount of Oxycodone or Xanax was in Garcia's system did not \"impair[ him] to a substantial degree.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v. Augustine\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071102\" index=\"416\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1258/#p1265\">\n     742 F.3d at 1265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    Garcia also argues that the Court must suppress his statements after the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning, because they were obtained using an improper two-step\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    process.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Motion to Suppress at 7.

Moreover, the Court concludes that it is unlikely that either Lerner or Sainato intended to employ a two-step strategy as they do not ask Garcia about the information they want most -- Garcia's connection to the gun -- until well after reading Garcia his\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    rights.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Int.

Indeed, in addition to the factors already analyzed, the Court notes that Garcia is talkative during almost the entire interview suggesting that his statements throughout were voluntary.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     generally\n    </em>\n    Int.

As already detailed briefly, the pre-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    interrogation was not complete, nor did the pre- and post-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    interrogations significantly overlap. The pre-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    questioning was fifteen minutes of a three hour interview. It covered how Garcia became involved in SNM and what he might generally know about its leadership.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Int.

In contrast, the remaining two hours and forty five minutes post-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    was far more invasive and exhaustive. Most importantly, Lerner and Sainato questioned Garcia extensively about his connection to and possession of a gun, which was to be used later by Mario Montoya in the murder or murders of senior New Mexico Department of Corrections staff.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Int.

Lerner and Sainato did not mention the gun at all before the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning. Their post-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    interrogation also covered what Garcia knew about several unsolved homicides; also another topic not touched upon pre-warning.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Int. Tr. at 137:23-140:2 (Garcia, Sainato);\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at\n    147:9-17 (Garcia, Lerner);\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 174:16-177:20 (Acee, Garcia, Lerner, Myers, Sainato);\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 179:1-181:9 (Garcia, Lerner, Myers, Sainato). Although both the pre- and post-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    interviews encompass roughly the same general topic -- SNM -- the Court concludes that the general similarity does not amount to the \"overlapping content\" that the\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    plurality carved out as a factor.\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"441\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     542 U.S. at 615-16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"442\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     124 S.Ct. 2601\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (concluding that the first round of interrogation was complete and overlapping with the second round when the unwarned interrogation's \"questioning was systematic [and] exhaustive....

The first two factors, therefore, weigh toward admissibility.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    The timing, setting, and the continuity of the police personnel, however, weigh toward suppressing the statements. There was no meaningful break in the interview.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     generally\n    </em>\n    Int. Tr. at 3:1-214:8.

Tr. at 22:2 (Lerner)(\"Let's get back to Styx.\"). The Court concludes, however, that this factor only weighs slightly toward suppression. In\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    , the plurality concluded that the final factor weighed toward suppression, because the officer made repeated \"references back to the confession already given,\" making it \"unnatural\" for the suspect to \"refuse to repeat at the second stage what had been said before.\"\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"444\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     542 U.S. at 616\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"445\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     124 S.Ct. 2601\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That situation is not what occurred here. Apart from resuming discussion of \"Styx,\" Lerner and Sainato did not repeatedly refer back to the pre-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    interrogation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     generally\n    </em>\n    Int. Tr. at 21:24-214:8. Accordingly, the Court determines that Garcia would not have felt locked into a previous confession. The Court concludes, thus, that the final factor weighs only slightly toward excluding the statements.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    Although three factors weigh toward excluding the statements, the Court will not exclude the statements. The plurality's factors inform an ultimate test: \"whether it would be reasonable to find that in these circumstances the warnings could function effectively.\"\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"446\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     542 U.S. at 611\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"447\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     124 S.Ct. 2601\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court concludes that, considering all the factors, a\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning could still have effectively informed Garcia of his rights such that he could make a voluntary decision. The plurality was most worried that a\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning would not operate effectively if the suspect had confessed to most everything before the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning: \"Upon hearing warnings only in the aftermath of interrogation and just after making a confession, a suspect would hardly think he had a genuine right to remain silent, let alone persist in so believing once the police began to lead him over the same ground again.\"\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"448\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     542 U.S. at 613\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"449\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     124 S.Ct. 2601\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . With that in mind, the first two factors bear more heavily on the Court's analysis here. Garcia had not \"given up the game\" during the interview's first fifteen minutes. He may have divulged some incriminating statements\n    about himself -- membership in SNM, for example -- but giving up his membership would not have reduced Garcia to \"bewilderment\" about \"the reason for discussing rights at that point.\"\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"450\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     542 U.S. at 613\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"451\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     124 S.Ct. 2601\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Garcia had not confessed to a murder and then been warned as the suspect had been in\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"452\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     542 U.S. at 604\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"453\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     124 S.Ct. 2601\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Indeed, Lerner and Sainato immediately signaled to Garcia that they already knew he was an SNM member,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Int. Tr. at 3:12-14 (Sainato)(\"I know you saw your other boys around here, so it's kind of an ongoing investigation on the S.\"), so Garcia would not have thought he was giving up much, if anything, by admitting his involvement with SNM. Given that context, and considering the factors, the Court concludes that the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning did not fall on deaf ears. Therefore, under the\n    <em>\n     Seibert\n    </em>\n    plurality, it will not suppress the post-\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    statements.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    <strong>\n     IT IS ORDERED\n    </strong>\n    that the requests in the Defendant Christopher Garcia's Sealed Motion to Suppress Statements by Defendant Obtained in Violation of\n    <em>\n     Miranda v.

For example, if a suspect is arrested and placed in an interrogation room by himself, there is likely an interrogation under\n     <em>\n      Bautista\n     </em>\n     and\n     <em>\n      Kelsey\n     </em>\n     , but no interrogation under\n     <em>\n      Rhode Island v.

The \"imminence\" test may also greatly erode the\n     <em>\n      Rhode Island v. Innis\n     </em>\n     test, because questioning is almost always imminent after an arrest. From this observation, and the other Tenth Circuit precedent discussed above, the Court concludes that\n     <em>\n      Bautista\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <em>\n      Kelsey\n     </em>\n     , and\n     <em>\n      Santistevan\n     </em>\n     do not control this case.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"24\">\n    <p id=\"p-256\">\n     Although the Supreme Court has suggested that express questioning from an officer after custody is enough to equal \"interrogation,\"\n     <em>\n      Rhode Island v.

Asking \"how's it going?\" is a far cry from \"where were you on the night of the murder?\" ... Thus, although asking a question is relevant to determining whether an interrogation occurred, it is neither sufficient nor necessary.

Thus, the Tenth Circuit has taken the disjunctive test from\n     <em>\n      Rhode Island v. Innis\n     </em>\n     and collapsed it into one inquiry.
