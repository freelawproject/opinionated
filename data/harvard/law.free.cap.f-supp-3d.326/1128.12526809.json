Leighton, United States District Judge\n   THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. # 32]. Plaintiffs are descendants of the historic Chinook Indian tribe and bring suit against the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in an effort to compel those agencies to add the Chinook Indian Nation (CIN) to the list of federally acknowledged tribes. Plaintiffs also challenge regulations promulgated by Defendants which prohibit the CIN from re-petitioning the federal government for tribal acknowledgment. Finally, Plaintiffs seek access to funds from a 1970 Indian Claims Commission judgment currently held in trust by the DOI for the Lower Band of Chinook and Clatsop Indians. Defendants move to dismiss all claims, arguing that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to confer federal acknowledgment on the CIN. Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the re-petition ban, and that the CIN's claims regarding the funds held in trust is not a final agency action which can be challenged under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The Court heard oral argument on May 8, 2018. For the reasons that follow, the Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Similar to the present case, members of the Shinnecock Indian Nation brought suit against the Secretary of the Interior seeking to compel the inclusion of the Shinnecock on the list of federally acknowledged tribes.

The Court in no way diminishes what members of the CIN understandably view as an inconsistent process that lacks transparency. Yet, this Court is bound to adhere to the well-established legal principle that the issue of federal acknowledgment of Indian tribes is a quintessential political question that must be left to the political branches of government and not the courts. Absent a clear delegation of authority from Congress, the Court cannot bypass the existing federal acknowledgment\n    process and bestow federal recognition upon the CIN. Plaintiffs' first claim for relief presents a non-justiciable political question that is outside of this Court's subject matter jurisdiction.

Specifically, Plaintiffs assert that the ban violates the APA's arbitrary and capricious standard (Claim 2); the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (Claim 3), the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment (Claim 4); and the Petition Clause of the First Amendment (Claim 5). Dkt. 24 at \u00b6\u00b6 161-91.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Addressing all four of the re-petition claims together, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the re-petition ban. Standing is the determination of whether a specific plaintiff is the proper party to bring a matter to federal court for adjudication.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Chemerinsky,\n    <em>\n     Federal Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 2.3 at 55.

Plaintiffs argue that if the OFA applied the same standard that was used to evaluate the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe's petition for acknowledgment, it would allow the CIN to more easily demonstrate recent prior acknowledgment by the United States, thereby bolstering evidence of the CIN's Indian Identity and Political Influence. Dkt. 37 at 23. Plaintiffs highlight additional revisions in the 2015 regulations impacting how the OFA considers various types of evidence including: (1) a petitioner's self-identification as an Indian tribe; (2) evidence of children being placed into Indian boarding schools; (3) evidence of a petitioner's relationship with other federally recognized tribes; (4) evidence of land being set aside by a State for a petitioner; and (5) evidence of a continuous line of entity leaders.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2083.10\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2083.10\">\n     at 24-25\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In a strikingly similar situation to the present case, the district court considered whether the Burt Lake Indian plaintiffs, who had their petition for federal acknowledgment denied in 2006, had standing to challenge the re-petition ban contained in the 2015 regulations.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524692\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/304/70/\">\n     304 F.Supp.3d 70\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Just as it does in the present case, the DOI made the identical argument that the \"prohibition was already put in place by regulations adopted in 1994, so the 2015 regulations did not injure plaintiff as they merely continued the pre-existing bar on re-petitioning.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524692\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/304/70/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524692\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/304/70/\">\n     at 77\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But the Court found this argument to be \"completely irrelevant, since the agency undertook a rulemaking process in 2014 that proposed a new rule that would allow tribes to re-petition, and it is the agency's rejection of this provision in its final rule that plaintiff challenges.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524692\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/304/70/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524692\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/304/70/\">\n     at 80\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

First, Plaintiffs' counsel clarified during oral argument that members of the CIN, like the Burt Lake Indians, had also commented on the proposed changes to the acknowledgment regulations in support of limited re-petitioning. Dkt. 44. This would seem to undercut Defendants' distinction and put the CIN on the same footing as the\n    <em>\n     Burt Lake\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs, having formally engaged in the notice and comment process and encouraged the BIA to permit tribes previously denied acknowledgment the ability to re-petition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Next, Defendants argue that under the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     Loritz v.

Defendants suggested at oral argument that the absence of a case like\n    <em>\n     Loritz\n    </em>\n    in the D.C. Circuit sets this case apart from\n    <em>\n     Burt Lake\n    </em>\n    . This argument is flawed for two reasons. First, there is nothing other than counsel's statement at oral argument to suggest that the D.C.

Dkt. 32 at 19; Dkt. 41 at 5. The Court disagrees that the CIN's situation is on par with an inmate whose efforts to overturn his conviction have been adjudicated unmeritorious at every step. For reasons discussed in the next section, the Court need not address the merits of a potential re-petition here. Simply put, there is far more substance to the CIN's arguments regarding a more favorable landscape for a petition for acknowledgment under the\n    2015 regulations than the situation the Ninth Circuit addressed in\n    <em>\n     Loritz\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' argument regarding the likelihood of a successful re-petition addresses the merits of Plaintiffs' claims, not whether Plaintiffs have standing to sue.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Defendants assert that there is no likelihood that the CIN will be able to satisfy Part 83.7(a)'s \"continuous identification,\" Part 83.7(b)'s \"distinct community,\" or Part 83.7(c)'s \"political influence or authority\" criteria that they were deemed not to satisfy in the 2002 Reconsidered Final Determination Against Acknowledgment. Defendants conclude \"[b]ecause the amended complaint lacks any specific factual allegations that establish any basis to believe that a new CIN petition is likely to succeed under the 2015 regulations, plaintiffs have failed sufficiently to allege that this Court can redress plaintiffs' purported injury.\" Dkt. 32 at 25.

To be sure, the injury that Plaintiffs allege in Claims 2-5-the deprivation of the opportunity to re-petition for acknowledgment-is redressable by a favorable decision in this case.

At this juncture, however,\n    the Court must construe the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and accept as true all well-pleaded allegations of material fact. Accordingly, the Court will not dismiss Plaintiffs' claims challenging the re-petition ban at this stage of the litigation.

Defendants argue that all three claims related to the funds held in trust should be dismissed because they are \"purely hypothetical.\" Dkt. 41 at 13.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs are not required to exhaust their administrative remedies where the agency's position is already set.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Defendants argue that Claim 6 must be dismissed because Catherine Rugen's letter is not a final agency action which can be challenged under the APA.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11. According to Defendants, the DOI cannot take any final agency action until Plaintiffs formally request \"access to those funds pursuant to the administrative processes established by OST for that purpose.\" Dkt. 32 at 26.

Thus, where the agency's position on the question at issue 'appears already set' and it is 'very likely' what the result of recourse to administrative remedies would be, such recourse would be futile and is not required.\"). Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to show that Defendants have an \" 'already set' position on the question of plaintiffs' legal entitlement through proof of other ties to the funds.\" Dkt. 41 at 13 n.8. But having determined that the CIN is not entitled to so much as an account statement, Defendants cannot credibly argue that Plaintiffs might be able to gain access to and even spend the trust funds if only they make a formal application.

Plaintiffs articulate a plausible claim that Defendants have forfeited funds from the ICC judgment to which Plaintiffs have a valid property interest. Claims 7 and 8 are also sufficiently tethered to Plaintiffs' re-petition claims that the Court declines to dismiss them at this time.
