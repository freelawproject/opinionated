Mathiasen (\"Mathiasen\"), largely agrees with Laudrup's explanation of Danish law, stating that \"Trans-Tec's attempt to incorporate its General Terms in the Bunker Sale Contract between Trans-Tec and Copenship Bulkers A/S seems to be in accordance with the above-mentioned conditions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mathiasen also states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [h]owever, it should be stressed and strongly emphasized that under Danish law the terms of the Bunker Sale Contract only apply to and bind the contracting parties, i.e. Trans-Tec and Copenship Bunkers A/S.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   There is nothing in the available documentation to suggest that the owner of the Vessel (Chartley World Incorporated) is a party to the Bunker Sale Contract (e.g. by way of dealings by the master of the Vessel) or in any other way is bound by the provisions of the Bunker Sales Contract, including the General Terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mathiasen's latter opinions go beyond the issue of whether the contracting parties themselves validly incorporated into the contract Clause 17 with its choice-of-law provision and are therefore beyond the scope of the Court's inquiry into Denmark's law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In a similar case involving questions of Swedish law, a claimant's expert attacked the plaintiff's expert's testimony on incorporation by reference by \"focusing on the opinion that [the vessel's owner] had not entered an agreement with Plaintiff and on the nonexistence of maritime liens for bunkers under the law of Sweden.\"\n   <em>\n    Topoil AB v.

Tex. Sept. 26, 2016) (Lake, J.). The court rejected this argument, explaining that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [p]ursuant to the Fifth Circuit's analysis [in\n   <em>\n    Bulk Juliana\n   </em>\n   ], these issues are beyond the scope of consultation of the law of Sweden. The Fifth Circuit was concerned with whether choice-of-law provisions are enforceable under the law of Sweden and whether the method of incorporation met its legal standards. On\n   those points, Hoglund's testimony does not raise a fact issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205373029\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, here, Mathiasen's testimony, which focuses on the separate issue of whether Chartley was a party to the contract or can be bound thereby, does not raise a fact issue as to whether the choice-of-law provision contained in Clause 17 of the General Terms was in fact incorporated into the contract. On the latter point, Mathiasen's opinion is forthright that \"Danish law recognizes the contracting parties' freedom to contract and chief among that the parties' ability to formulate their agreement by incorporating provisions from other documents.... Furthermore, Danish law recognizes the right of the contracting parties to select the law that will govern their agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because the uncontroverted summary judgment evidence is that under Danish law, the General Terms, including the United States choice of law provision, were validly incorporated into the contract, United States law controls the remaining issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bulk Juliana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055645\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/766/#p767\">\n    822 F.3d at 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that because \"the General Terms, including the U.S. choice-of-law provision, were valid and enforceable under Singapore law and were validly incorporated into the contract[,] [t]he remainder of our analysis, contrary to Bulk Juliana's arguments, relies on United States law\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Under United States law, charterers are presumed to have authority to bind the Vessel by the ordering of necessaries.\n   <em>\n    Triton Marine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4033991\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/409/#p414\">\n    575 F.3d at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is a fundamental tenet of maritime law that '[c]harterers and their agents are presumed to have authority to bind the vessel by the ordering of necessaries.' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Trans-Tec\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555345\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/1120/#p1124\">\n    518 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1127-28 ).
