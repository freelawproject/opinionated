The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Docs. 67, 70. Defendants have also filed a motion for attorneys' fees. Doc. 64.

Background.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted. Plaintiff works in the field of sports psychology and performance. In 1982, he authored and published a book titled\n   <em>\n    Winning Isn't Normal\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiff describes the target audience for the book as \"[a]nyone who wants to perform better or out-perform the competition.\" Doc. 68-3 at 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff holds a valid copyright registration for the book and continues to offer the book for sale through Amazon.com and his website, keelpublications.com. Doc. 10-1 at 6; Doc. 71-2 at 2-3; Doc. 71-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Moawad Group is a mental consulting firm based in Scottsdale, Arizona, owned by Trevor Moawad. The firm does business under the name Moawad Consulting Group (\"MCG\"). MCG maintains social media accounts with Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Mr. Moawad testified that MCG uses the accounts \"as a way for people who followed [MCG] to get to unique insight or inspirational thought[.]\" Doc. 68-4 at 4. The MCG Twitter page contains a link to MCG's website and the following description: \"In the field of Mental Conditioning we work with the world's most elite talents in sport, business, military, and life to maximize their potential.\" Doc. 68-1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 11, 2016, MCG posted an image on each of its social media accounts containing the following passage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Winning isn't normal. That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with winning. It just isn't the norm. It's highly unusual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Every competition has only one winner. No matter how many people are entered (not to mention those who failed to qualify), only one person wins each event.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Winning is unusual. As such, it requires unusual action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In order to win you must do extraordinary things. You just can't be one of the crowd. The crowd doesn't win. You have to be willing to stand out and act differently. Your actions need to reflect unusual priorities and values. You have to value success more than others do. You\n   have to want it more. Now, take note! Wanting it more is a decision you make and act upon -- not some inherent quality or burning inner drive or inspiration. And you have to make that value a priority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   You can't train like everyone else. You have to train more and train better. You can't talk like everyone else. You can't think like everyone else. You can't be too willing to join the crowd, to do what is expected, to act in a socially accepted manner, to do what's \"in\". You need to be willing to stand out in the crowd and consistently take exceptional action. If you want to win, you need to accept the risks and perhaps the loneliness ... because WINNING ISN'T NORMAL!!!!!\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Doc. 10-1 at 24-28. The image was accompanied by the caption \"Great Minds 'Behave' Differently.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties agree that the passage in the image is substantially similar to language on page eight of\n   <em>\n    Winning Isn't Normal\n   </em>\n   . Doc. 68 \u00b6 3; Doc. 71 \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 10-1 at 4. The image does not contain an attribution to Plaintiff or a copyright symbol or notice. Mr. Moawad testified that he found the image by conducting a Google images search on his phone using the keywords \"winning is unusual.\" Doc. 68-4 at 5, 18. He recalled hearing this phrase many years earlier when he worked at IMG Academies in Florida.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. He testified that he had never seen the passage before or heard of Plaintiff, and his image search did not produce any indication that the image or its contents were copyrighted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9, 26-27. After finding the image, Mr. Moawad sent it to MCG employee Sean Quinn, who posted it on MCG's social media accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 13; Doc. 68-8 at 2. Mr. Moawad thought of the caption \"great minds behave differently\" because it \"went well with the statement winning is unusual.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants submit screenshots of the results produced by a Google images search for \"winning is unusual\" and assert that such a search continues to reveal no indication that the passage is connected to Plaintiff. Doc. 68-5. Plaintiff disputes this, asserting that Defendants' screenshots actually contain an image displaying the passage with proper attribution. Doc. 71-2 at 17. Plaintiff submits screenshots of Google searches that he performed for the same keywords, which return both images and links that immediately indicate Plaintiff's association with the phrase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants did not modify the image before posting it. Doc. 68-4 at 27; Doc. 68-9 at 4. Defendants estimate that the image reached about 3,500 social media accounts based on the number of \"followers\" MCG has.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 5-1 at 3. It also appears that the post was \"shared\" by at least one MCG follower who has about 100,000 followers of his own.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 71-3 at 13-16. Mr. Moawad testified that Defendants derive no income from their social media accounts, and they derived no income from posting this particular image. Doc. 68-4 at 29-30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 68-9 at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff testified that the passage displayed in the image \"has proven particularly influential in the athletics and other high-performance communities[,]\" and the passage \"went semi-viral\" in 2015 when thousands of unauthorized users posted it on various social media sites. Doc. 71-2 at 3; Doc. 68-3 at 25, 32. The passage is available to read for free on Plaintiff's website. Doc. 68-3 at 14. Plaintiff has not contacted Google or other search engines to request removal of images containing the passage, but he has pursued individual infringers. Doc. 68-3 at 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff testified that he saw MCG's posts containing the image \"within a few days.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. On December 5, 2016, Plaintiff's counsel sent Defendants a letter\n   notifying them that the image contained copyrighted material.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. Defendants removed the post from each social media account immediately after receiving the letter. Doc. 68-4 at 29; Doc. 68-9 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff asserts a claim for willful and intentional copyright infringement in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 501.

Alternatively, Defendants seek summary judgment on three issues, arguing that (1) Defendants did not willfully infringe, (2) Plaintiff's statutory damages should be limited to $200 because Defendants are innocent infringers who caused no actual damages, and (3) Mr. Moawad is not personally liable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    at 6-9, 12-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

And Mr. Moawad acknowledged that the accounts \"could be seen as a reflection of\" MCG's brand. Doc. 71-1 at 37-38.

This weighs in favor of finding fair use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   But the parties present differing opinions as to whether the work is creative or informational. Defendants argue that the book is informational because it is non-fiction and \"discusse[s] general concepts about sports psychology and motivation that are not separately copyrightable (e.g., 'winning is unusual').\" Doc. 67 at 11. Plaintiff counters that the work is creative because although it \"is non-fiction, Defendants believed it was unique, interesting, and motivational.\" Doc. 70 at 9 (citing Doc. 71-1 at 15-16; Doc. 71-5 at 16). Mr. Moawad described the passage as an \"interesting insight into ... a way to succeed,\" and he viewed it as \"more motivational\" than informational. Doc. 71-1 at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff's work cannot neatly be characterized as creative or informational. It has elements of both. The work is non-fiction and the passage contains some general information known in the field of sports psychology, but it also reflects creative thought and the statement of ideas in a way that is memorable, appealing, and motivational.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harper &amp; Row\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206269\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/539/#p562\">\n    471 U.S. at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206269\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/539/#p562\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[N]o author may copyright facts or ideas[,]\" but the \"[c]reation of a nonfiction work, even a compilation of pure fact, entails originality.\").

Third Factor: Amount of Copyrighted Work Used.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The third factor asks whether the \"amount and substantiality\" of the portion of the work used are reasonable \"in relation to the purpose of the copying.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"234489\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/569/#p577\">\n    510 U.S. at 586-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"234489\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/569/#p577\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and character of the use[.]\"). Defendants argue that the use was reasonable because they shared only 219 words of a 72-page book. Doc. 67 at 11.

Plaintiff has identified no specific business he lost as a result of Defendants' posts (Doc. 71-3 at 12), and he testified that he does not have records of all of his book sales (Doc. 68-3 at 20). Nor does the record contain evidence regarding Plaintiff's poster or t-shirt sales or revenue from his consulting work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Nonetheless, if Plaintiff can show that the use was commercial, it might be appropriate to presume likely market harm under the circumstances of this case - where Defendants' use amounted to wholesale copying of a memorable passage of Plaintiff's book and publishing it without attribution for commercial gain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Disney Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266357\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/848/#p861\">\n    869 F.3d at 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because the district court concluded that [the defendant's] use was commercial and not transformative, it was not error to presume\n   likely market harm.\").

Fair Use Conclusion.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendants used an almost verbatim passage from Plaintiff's copyrighted book without altering or adding to the passage in any significant way. But the passage was widely available online, Plaintiff presents no evidence of actual market harm, and there is a dispute of fact as to whether the posts were for a commercial purpose.

The Court also agrees that Defendants have presented strong evidence supporting a finding of innocence. But based on the evidence discussed above regarding Defendants' practice of not investigating possible copyright protections, a factfinder could conclude that Defendants had \"reason to believe\" that publicly posting an unattributed creative passage that they did not write may have infringed on someone's rights.
