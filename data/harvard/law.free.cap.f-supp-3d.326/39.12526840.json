ECF No. 5-1 at 14. Therefore, the Court will confine its analysis to that claim. The Court will first consider whether Ms. Edwards has made the requisite showing for injunctive relief on her Medicaid Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Contentions of the Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ms. Edwards argues she is likely to succeed on her Medicaid Act claim because Defendant's termination of PPSAT from South Carolina's Medicaid program violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A), which provides \"any individual eligible for medical assistance ... may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required ... who undertakes to provide him such services....\" Ms. Edwards asserts it is uncontested PPSAT is a medically and professionally qualified provider, and \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) therefore guarantees her the right to choose PPSAT as her provider. She explains \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) prohibits Defendant from excluding PPSAT from South Carolina's Medicaid program merely because PPSAT provides abortions outside the Medicaid program. Ms. Edwards further maintains \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) creates a private right of action for Medicaid beneficiaries enforceable through\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In support of her contentions, Ms. Edwards notes the overwhelming majority of courts that have considered these issues, including the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuit Courts of Appeals, have held \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) creates a private right of action and prohibits a State from terminating qualified providers from its Medicaid program for reasons unrelated to professional competency to perform the services at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant responds Ms. Edwards is unlikely to succeed on her Medicaid Act claim because \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) fails to create a private right of action enforceable through \u00a7 1983. Defendant posits\n   \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A), when read in context of \u00a7 1396a(a) as a whole, is meant to protect patients in the aggregate, not to confer an unambiguous right upon individuals such as Ms. Edwards. Accordingly, Defendant asserts the remedy for a violation of \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) is the termination of federal funding to an offending State's Medicaid program as opposed to a private action. Defendant acknowledges the majority of courts to consider this issue have held \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) does confer a private right of action upon patients, but Defendant relies upon\n   <em>\n    Does v.

Defendant further avers Ms. Edwards' interpretation of \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) is overly broad, and, under\n   <em>\n    O'Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189721\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/773/\">\n    447 U.S. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189721\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/773/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189721\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/773/\">\n    65 L.Ed.2d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980), the right outlined in \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) is the right to choose among the pool of providers determined to be qualified by a State, not the right to have a particular provider deemed qualified. Defendant also claims Ms. Edwards is unable to maintain her Medicaid Act cause of action because she has failed to exhaust state administrative remedies available to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant insists that, even if Ms. Edwards were able to maintain her Medicaid Act claim, the claim lacks merit. Defendant posits \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) does not define the term \"qualified,\" and \u00a7 1396a(p)(1) permits a State to exclude providers from its Medicaid program for any reason established by State law. Defendant argues it may therefore terminate PPSAT from South Carolina's Medicaid program because PPSAT performs abortions, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2043-5-1185\">\n    S.C.

Although there is no controlling precedent on this issue, the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuit Courts of Appeals have considered this question, and all of those courts except the Eighth Circuit have held \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) does confer a private right of action.\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Kan. v.

The Court agrees with the well-reasoned analysis of the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuit Courts of Appeals and holds \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) confers a private right of action on Medicaid beneficiaries such as Ms. Edwards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To create a private cause of action enforceable through \u00a7 1983, a federal statute must unambiguously confer a federal right, not simply a benefit or interest.\n   <em>\n    Gonzaga Univ. v.

ECF No. 5-2 at 3.

Section 1396a(p)(1) provides a\n   State may exclude a provider from its Medicaid program for any reason the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services may exclude a provider, \"[i]n addition to any other authority.\" Although \u00a7 1396a(p)(1) gives States broad authority to exclude providers from their Medicaid programs,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Andersen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515917\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1205/#p1224\">\n    882 F.3d at 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it does not provide States with \"unlimited authority to exclude providers for any reason whatsoever,\"\n   <em>\n    Comm'r of Ind.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632434\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/962/#p972\">\n    699 F.3d at 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, a State's ability to exclude a provider is limited by \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) and its requirement that Medicaid patients be afforded the freedom to choose any qualified and willing provider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275893\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/445/#p457\">\n    862 F.3d at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Thus, contrary to Defendant's suggestion, \u00a7 1396a(p)(1) does not permit a State to pass a law deeming a provider unqualified for reasons unrelated to professional competence to perform the services at issue and then to exclude the provider from its Medicaid program on the basis of that law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Comm'r of Ind.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632434\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/962/#p972\">\n    699 F.3d at 979-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To hold otherwise would render the right conferred in \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As explained above, Defendant's termination of PPSAT from South Carolina's Medicaid program was not based on any alleged incompetence or inability of PPSAT to perform the medical services at issue. Rather, it was based on the fact that PPSAT performs abortions outside the Medicaid program. Because it is undisputed PPSAT is professionally competent to perform family planning services, Defendant's termination of PPSAT from South Carolina's Medicaid program violates \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A). Accordingly, the Court holds Ms. Edwards is likely to succeed on the merits of her Medicaid Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Ms. Edwards asserts she will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief because she is being deprived of her statutory right under \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) to have the qualified and willing provider of her choice. She avers she is also suffering irreparable harm in the form of disruption of and reduced access to health care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant claims Ms. Edwards will suffer no harm without a preliminary injunction because she has no right to receive Medicaid services from a provider deemed unqualified by the State, such as PPSAT. Defendant reiterates its contention Ms. Edwards is unable to maintain a cause of action challenging Defendant's determination PPSAT is unqualified to provide Medicaid services. Defendant further suggests Ms. Edwards will suffer no harm because she can still obtain Medicaid services from PPSAT's physicians as long as they bill for such services outside of PPSAT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court has no trouble concluding Ms. Edwards would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction because she would be deprived of her statutory right to select the qualified and willing provider of her choice. Ms. Edwards is insured through Medicaid, ECF No. 5-3 \u00b6 2, and she wants to continue receiving care from PPSAT, ECF No. 5-3 \u00b6 17. Defendant's termination of PPSAT from South Carolina's Medicaid program is depriving Ms. Edwards of her statutory right to choose PPSAT as her provider, and deprivation of this right constitutes irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant's arguments regarding Ms. Edwards' alleged lack of irreparable harm are without merit. As set forth above, the Court holds \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) provides Medicaid patients such as Ms. Edwards a private right of action enforceable under \u00a7 1983, and Defendant's termination of\n   PPSAT from South Carolina's Medicaid program violates \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A). Thus, the Court rejects Defendant's contention Ms. Edwards will suffer no irreparable harm because she has no right to receive Medicaid services from PPSAT and no ability to challenge Defendant's termination of PPSAT from the State's Medicaid program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant's claim Ms. Edwards may still obtain services from PPSAT's physicians as long as they bill for her services outside of PPSAT is likewise lacking in merit. Section 1396a(a)(23)(A) affords Ms. Edwards the right to obtain services from any qualified \"institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person.\" Thus, Ms. Edwards has the right to choose PPSAT, not just its physicians, as her provider, and Defendant's termination of PPSAT from the State's Medicaid program deprives her of that right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly, the Court holds Ms. Edwards has demonstrated she is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Balancing of the Equities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Ms. Edwards insists the balance of the equities tips in her favor because she will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction, and Defendant would suffer no injury if the Court were to issue a preliminary injunction. She explains Defendant would suffer no injury because the State would simply continue to reimburse PPSAT for Medicaid services as it has done for years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant disagrees the balance of the equities tips in Ms. Edwards' favor. Defendant claims Ms. Edwards and other PPSAT Medicaid patients can seek health care services elsewhere in the absence of injunctive relief. Furthermore, Defendant maintains he would in fact suffer an injury if injunctive relief were granted because, as revealed by Governor McMaster's Executive Order No. 2017-15 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2043-5-1185\">\n    S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the State has a compelling interest in ensuring no State funds are used to pay for abortions or are provided to physicians or medical practices affiliated with abortion clinics. Defendant claims States funds would be used to subsidize abortions at PPSAT if Plaintiffs' requested injunction were issued, and, as evidence of this, Defendant cites to the testimony of PPSAT's CEO that PPSAT might have to reduce services and hours at its health centers without Medicaid reimbursements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court holds the balance of the equities tips in Ms. Edwards' favor. As stated above, Ms. Edwards, as well as other PPSAT patients insured through Medicaid, will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction because they will be deprived of their statutory right to the qualified provider of their choice. This harm is significant and can have substantial negative effects, including a potential lack of access to health care. Contrary to Defendant's suggestion, it is immaterial whether Ms. Edwards can seek health care from another provider because she is entitled to the qualified provider of her choice under \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court agrees with Ms. Edwards the State would suffer no harm if injunctive relief were granted. As Ms. Edwards points out, the State would simply have to continue to reimburse PPSAT for Medicaid services as it has done previously. Defendant's argument injunctive relief would force it to subsidize abortions is without merit. As explained above, South Carolina's Medicaid program does not cover abortions except in narrow circumstances required by law, and PPSAT is reimbursed for Medicaid services on a fee-for-service basis. ECF No. 24-1 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. Thus, PPSAT's inclusion in South Carolina's Medicaid program does not cause the\n   State to subsidize abortions, and the fact PPSAT might have to reduce services and hours if it loses Medicaid patients fails to prove otherwise. Moreover, Defendant can have no legitimate interest in perpetuating circumstances contrary to law, and Defendant's termination of PPSAT from the Medicaid program violates \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Ms. Edwards argues a preliminary injunction would serve the public interest of ensuring continued access to crucial health services for Medicaid patients. Defendant claims injunctive relief would be adverse to the public interest because it would require the State to subsidize abortions in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2043-5-1185\">\n    S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court has already rejected Defendant's claim a preliminary injunction would require the State to subsidize abortions, and the Court therefore rejects Defendant's argument injunctive relief is adverse to the public interest. The Court holds Plaintiffs' requested preliminary injunction would serve the public interest by preserving the statutory right of Ms. Edwards and other PPSAT patients insured through Medicaid to have the qualified provider of their choice. Injunctive relief further serves the public interest by helping to ensure affordable access to competent health care by some of South Carolina's neediest citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In accordance with the above discussion, the Court holds Ms. Edwards has demonstrated she is likely to succeed on the merits of her Medicaid Act claim, she is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief, the balance of equities tips in her favor, and her requested injunction is in the public interest. The Court will therefore issue a preliminary injunction enjoining Defendant from terminating the Medicaid enrollment agreement of PPSAT during the pendency of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Because the Court holds preliminary injunctive relief is appropriate and warranted for Ms. Edwards' Medicaid Act claim, the Court declines to analyze whether preliminary injunctive relief is appropriate for PPSAT's claim. The Court likewise declines to address the remaining arguments of the parties, as the Court's holdings articulated above are dispositive of Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Karsten v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan of Mid-Atl. States, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521750\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/8/#p11\">\n    36 F.3d 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11 (4th Cir. 1994) (\"If the first reason given is independently sufficient, then all those that follow are surplusage; thus, the strength of the first makes all the rest\n   <em>\n    dicta.\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Wherefore, based on the foregoing discussion and analysis, it is the judgment of the Court Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . Defendant and his employees, agents, successors in office, and all others acting in concert with him in his official capacity as Director of the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services are hereby enjoined from terminating the Medicaid enrollment agreement of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic during the pendency of this action. Plaintiffs are directed to post security in the amount of $1,000 with the Clerk of Court for the District of South Carolina by Tuesday, September 4, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
