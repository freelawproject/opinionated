In\n   <em>\n    Irvin v. Southern Snow Manufacturing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was a Louisiana-based manufacturer of shaved-ice machines, one of which injured the plaintiff, a Mississippi resident, in Mississippi.\n   <em>\n    Irvin v. S. Snow Mfg., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 517 F. App'x at 230. Like the Polar defendants, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Irvin\n   </em>\n   had no direct connection with the plaintiff; rather, the defendant had sold the machine to a third party in Louisiana, who then sold it to the plaintiff in Mississippi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff relied on the defendant's business contacts with a number of other Mississippi residents to establish the defendant's \"minimum contacts\" there under a stream of commerce theory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 231.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While the Court did not address whether the machine that had caused the plaintiff's injuries exited the stream of commerce after the initial sale, it \"assumed without deciding that ... [the defendant] purposefully availed itself of the privilege\n   of doing business in Mississippi by making a substantial percentage of its overall sales to customers in that state.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 232. The Court then concluded that-despite this assumption-jurisdiction was improper because the plaintiff could not show a sufficient \"nexus\" between the defendant's contacts with Mississippi and the machine that injured her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Without that nexus, she could not satisfy the second prong of the specific jurisdiction inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Stewart's stream of commerce argument is similar to the one the plaintiff made in\n   <em>\n    Irvin\n   </em>\n   . He contends that the Polar defendants' contacts with Louisiana-which are unrelated to the accident forming the basis of his complaint-suffice to subject them to the Court's jurisdiction.

The\n   <em>\n    Perkins\n   </em>\n   defendant had moved its office into the forum state temporarily; it was conducting 100% of its business there. Marathon, by contrast, cannot be said to conduct 100% of its business in Louisiana because it conducts a significant percentage of its operations outside of Louisiana. For example, compared to its operations in the rest of the United States, in 2016-the year the trailer exploded-Marathon had 3% of its offices in Louisiana; 9% of its employees were based in Louisiana; and less than 3% of its terminals were located in Louisiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Ultimately, while Marathon maintains significant business operations in Louisiana, Stewart has not established a\n   <em>\n    prime facie\n   </em>\n   case for jurisdiction. \"[I]n-state business ... does not suffice to permit the assertion of general jurisdiction over claims ... unrelated to any activity occurring in [the forum state].\"\n   <em>\n    BNSF\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604332\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1549/#p1558\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In their supplemental brief, the Polar defendants stress that they are distinct legal entities. R. Doc. No. 97, at 7. For the reasons discussed herein, the Court concludes that it does not have personal jurisdiction over Polar Tank Trailer, which has significantly more contacts with Louisiana than Polar Corporation. If the Court does not have jurisdiction over Polar Tank Trailer, it certainly does not have jurisdiction over Polar Corporation. As the Polar defendants note, there is no evidence to show that Polar Corporation has any independent connections to Louisiana whatsoever. R. Doc. No. 102. Regardless, because treating them collectively does not change the jurisdictional outcome, the Court will generally refer to the two Polar defendants as one entity for the sake of clarity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    R.

Doc. No. 80, at 4. Stewart argues that the Polar defendants should not be allowed to avoid liability when their trailers cause injury somewhere other than where they are manufactured simply because the trailers are sold \"free on board\" (\"FOB\"). Selling a trailer FOB means that, once the trailer passes from the seller to the buyer, title to and liability for the goods transfers to the buyer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    First, an FOB contract term covers liability for the merchandise being transported, and Stewart is not seeking damages for lost or damaged goods. Furthermore, the issue currently before the Court is not whether the Polar defendants are liable for the explosion, but whether the Court may properly exercise jurisdiction over them. Even if the contract for sale of the trailer had not included an FOB term, the Polar defendants still would not have made direct contact with Louisiana because the buyer was not a Louisiana company, and the accident did not occur in Louisiana. Hence, the Court considers the FOB discussion irrelevant to the jurisdictional inquiry.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    R. Doc. No. 33-1, at 5; R. Doc.
