CONCLUSION...1074\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This case arises from an elderly woman's fall while using an allegedly defective plastic stepstool to reach an item on a shelf in an upper cabinet in her kitchen. The injured woman seeks damages for her injuries from the manufacturer of the stepstool on theories of products liability and breach of warranties, and her husband seeks damages for loss of consortium. The plaintiffs now seek leave to amend their complaint to assert a claim for punitive damages, while the defendant seeks summary judgment on the plaintiffs' claims and exclusion of the testimony of the plaintiffs' liability expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This statement of the factual background does not necessarily set out all the parties' factual allegations in support of and resistance to the pending motions. Rather, it focuses on the key facts to put in context the parties' arguments on those motions. Unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. The parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The plaintiffs in this action are Idaho citizens Shirley Glenn and her husband, William Glenn. Defendant B &amp; R Plastics is a Colorado corporation not licensed to do business in Idaho. B &amp; R manufactures, inspects, and markets certain plastic housewares, including the 9-inch \"E-Z\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Foldz Folding Step Stool\" (stepstool) at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Mrs. Glenn is 76 years old, 5 feet 2 inches tall, and weighed about 100 lbs. at the time of her accident on December 3, 2014. She contends that, prior to the accident, she was in good health and was able to walk up to two miles per day. In contrast, B &amp; R contends that Mrs. Glenn had a \"complex\" prior medical history, including arthritis in her right knee and lower back, asthma, osteoporosis, and injuries from a motorcycle accident in 2009. B &amp; R argues that Dr. Ronald Kristensen, an orthopedic surgeon, who performed an \"independent\" medical examination of Mrs. Glenn and studied her records, opines that Mrs. Glenn's medical history shows that she was \"at high risk\" for a dizzy or syncopal (fainting) episode at the time of the accident, because of recent diarrhea, which can cause dehydration, hypotension, and dizziness; because she was also taking several medications known to cause dizziness and/or low blood pressure; and because of what Dr. Kristensen opines is \"a history of seizure disorder.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Mrs. Glenn does not recall ever being diagnosed with epilepsy or a seizure disorder and denies experiencing any \"dizziness, lightheadedness, vertigo or any other concerning signs or symptoms\" when being treated at St. Luke's Hospital on the day of the accident. She asserts that the last time she fell was approximately fifteen years ago. She also contends that her treating physician and non-retained expert, Dr. Michael T. Daines, also an orthopedic surgeon, can corroborate that her medical records from December 3, 2014, lack any indication that dizziness caused her fall. She also points out that Dr. Daines believes that an internal medicine specialist can comment more properly on the potential impact of her general medical history than an orthopedic surgeon, such as Dr. Kristensen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. The accident\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The parties apparently agree that Mrs. Glenn bought the folding stepstool, made by B &amp; R, on which she was standing just before her accident, for $9.99 from Walmart in 2005. She used the stepstool in her home kitchen once or twice a week, opening it each time, then closing it, and storing it in the pantry behind the door. She had never previously had problems or incidents with the stepstool and it had never malfunctioned, been damaged, slipped, or broken. When purchased, the stepstool had two or three warning decals, which Mrs. Glenn testified she read and heeded. Raised plastic letters at each end of the stepstool, still readable, state, \"Always lock before use.\" Mrs. Glenn stated that her usual procedure was to take out the stepstool, set it down, make sure the sides were locked out, then \"[t]ake it, the top, push it down, make sure it's locked good.\" At the time of the accident, two of the four guide-and locking-tabs on the stepstool were broken, and all four of the vinyl adhesive \"feet\" were missing. However, prior to the accident, Mrs. Glenn did not know of these problems with the stepstool or how they occurred. Mrs. Glenn stated that she only used the stepstool on smooth hard surfaces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On December 3, 2014, about 1:00 or 1:30 p.m., Mrs. Glenn attempted to get a 5-or 6-pound ceramic bowl from a shelf in her kitchen cabinet about 7 feet above the floor. She got out the stepstool, placed it on the hickory hardwood floor about 6 inches from the base of the counter under the cabinet, opened the stepstool, and made sure its sides were locked. She testified that she stood on the stepstool, flat-footed, evenly distributing her weight and not shifting it, and without leaning against the counter. As she reached up and touched the bowl, however, she suddenly found herself on the floor. She had not\n   heard any noises before her fall or noticed any indications of instability of the stepstool. The stepstool was broken in pieces, and the parties now agree that Mrs. Glenn fell on it, breaking it, rather than the stepstool breaking first and causing Mrs. Glenn to fall, but Mrs. Glenn did not know that at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. The liability experts' opinions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Glenns' liability expert, Dr. Robert Stephens, is a mechanical engineer and professor of mechanical engineering, who specializes in fatigue and fracture of metals. As mentioned, above, B &amp; R seeks exclusion of Dr. Stephens's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Dr. Stephens was retained to identify the mechanism of failure and to evaluate the stepstool from a mechanics and materials standpoint. He has never designed stepstools, and this is his first case involving a 9-inch plastic stepstool. He did not interview the Glenns prior to rendering his opinions, but relied on their depositions, instead. He also did not review Mrs. Glenn's medical records, interview her treating physician, Dr. Daines, read any witness interviews, inspect the scene of the accident, or learn the height of the cabinet or counter near which the accident occurred. Dr. Stephens did not do a direct accident reconstruction or use computer software for accident reconstruction. He did, however, inspect the stepstool in July 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   B &amp; R points out that Dr. Stephens first did what B &amp; R calls undocumented \"extreme standing\" tests with an exemplar stepstool. Dr. Stephens admits that these initial undocumented tests were unscientific and characterized them as \"playing around,\" but he said in his deposition that he did not want to call them \"extreme.\" He did not photograph these initial tests, measure forces, or document them in any way, and B &amp; R points out that he admitted that he intentionally did not do so to avoid cross-examination on this sort of accident reconstruction process. Dr. Stephens explained that these undocumented tests involved stepping on one edge of the stepstool, then another, and purposely trying to kick out the stepstool from under him. Dr. Stephens is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 170 lbs., so that he is both taller and heavier than Mrs. Glenn was at the time of the accident. Dr. Stephens did these undocumented tests some thirty or forty times on the vinyl floor in his kitchen, not on a hickory hardwood floor like the one in the Glenns' kitchen. The undocumented tests dealt primarily with tipping, not sliding, and tipping turned on where Dr. Stephens positioned his feet on the stepstool and the location of the lateral force, specifically, whether he was pushing on the wall, on the counter, or on the cabinet. Dr. Stephens explained that he succeeded in kicking the stepstool out from under him, but the distance it traveled varied with the way in which and the location where he applied forces. He did not collect data on the direction of the stepstool's travel, where it came to rest, or the amount of force he had applied in each repetition. Dr. Stephens contends that he did not rely on these undocumented tests in reaching his opinions, but B &amp; R disputes that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Dr. Stephens did a documented coefficient of friction test, which showed that some 17 to 19 pounds of horizontal/lateral force would be required to cause the stepstool to slide sideways while vertically loaded with 119 lbs. The Glenns clarify that Dr. Stephens also concluded that 15 lbs. of horizontal/lateral force would be required to shift, tip, or slide the stepstool with a 100 lb. load, which is what Mrs. Glenn weighed at the time of her accident. Dr. Stephens hypothesizes that, to create that lateral force, Mrs. Glenn was pushing on the counter and/or pushing on the cabinet. He adds that reaching up and forward\n   necessarily changed Mrs. Glenn's center of gravity, so that lateral forces, not just vertical ones, were at play. He also performed three videotaped tests that show the stepstool sliding, tipping, and buckling, although those videotaped tests did not involve any recording of forces. The Glenns assert, however, that Dr. Stephens explained how to duplicate those tests in his Rebuttal Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   From Dr. Stephens's 30 years of mechanical engineering experience, his observations of the subject stepstool and exemplar stepstools, and the tests he performed and documented, he opines, to a reasonable degree of engineering certainty, that \"Mrs. Glenn fell because the folding step stool was defective in design.\" Dr. Stephens opines that the stepstool had a design defect that focuses on (a) the width and height of the plastic tabs underneath the top of the stepstool, which guide the opening maneuver, and (b) the \"feet\" material attached to the bottom of each of the four legs. One of Dr. Stephens's proposed alternative designs is the one that B &amp; R actually used in and after 2010, which has strengthened tabs and different material for the \"feet.\" Dr. Stephens does not criticize the polypropylene material from which the stepstool was made and does not opine that there is a manufacturing defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   B &amp; R's expert is Dr. Jericho Moll, a specialist in polymer science and materials chemistry. She conducted tests with 10 exemplar stepstools and modified them to match the stepstool at issue. Through an independent, third-party laboratory, she tested the stepstools with a load of 300 lbs. for five minutes on a level hickory floor. Five stepstools had side panels in the proper fully-locked position, and five were only partially extended, but all passed the test. Dr. Moll agrees with Dr. Stephens that the \"feet\" had been missing from Mrs. Glenn's stepstool a fair amount of time, but neither expert knows how or when they came off, and whether they came off separately or all at the same time. Dr. Moll opines that the broken tabs and missing feet constituted a \"damaged state,\" and the stepstool should not have been used, but she also opines that the missing tabs and feet do not compromise the stated load capacity of the stepstool (300 lbs.) in a manner that would have caused it to break apart or collapse under Mrs. Glenn's weight of approximately 100 lbs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Additional factual allegations may be relevant, in the analysis of other specific issues or if I reach the question of whether or not the Glenns should be allowed to amend their Complaint to seek punitive damages. For now, however, I turn to the procedural background of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. The Complaint and the Answer\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Glenns filed their Complaint against B &amp; R on November 23, 2016, seeking damages on seven causes of action. Their causes of action are the following: (1) \"negligence,\" alleging that \"B &amp; R negligently failed to remove/recall the defective Original Step Stool from Defendants' distributors\" and that \"B &amp; R negligently designed, tested, manufactured, inspected, marketed, distributed, and/or promoted the Original Step Stool and its component parts, and failed to exercise reasonable care in designing, testing, manufacturing, inspecting, marketing, distributing, and/or promoting the Original Step Stool and its component part,\" Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17; (2) breach of \"express warranty,\" premised on B &amp; R's alleged breach of a warranty that \"the Original Step Stool was 'sturdy' and 'stable,' that it had a '300 lbs. capacity,' that it was meant to be used for reaching items on high shelves in kitchens, that it was fit for the ordinary purposes for which it was marketed, sold, and/or distributed, that it was reasonably safe, that it was merchantable quality, and that it was reasonably\n   fit for the purpose of being stood upon to elevate its user,\" Complaint at \u00b6 23;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26; (3) breach of \"implied warranty,\" premised on B &amp; R's alleged breach of warranty that \"the Original Step Stool was fit for the ordinary purposes for which it was sold, was reasonably safe, was of merchantable quality, and reasonably fit for the purpose of being stood on to elevate its user,\" Complaint at \u00b6 32;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35; (4) \"strict liability,\" premised on B &amp; R's alleged designing, testing, manufacturing, inspecting, marketing, distributing, and/or promoting the Original Step Stool, which was \"defective and unreasonably dangerous for reasons including, but not limited to, (a) the sidewall tabs, hinges, and ramps of the Original Step Stool as manufactured were not safe for use; (b) the sidewall tabs, hinges, and ramps of the Original Step Stool as manufactured deviated from reasonable design, manufacture and/or performance standards in that they did not provide the stability and support needed by Plaintiff Shirley Glenn; and (c) Defendants failed to warn and/or gave inadequate warnings regarding the hazards of using the product,\" Complaint at \u00b6 38; (5) \"joint and several liability\" of B &amp; R and \"Defendant Doe,\" \"in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%206-803\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 6-803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5),\" Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 42-44; (6) \"willful and reckless\" conduct by B &amp; R, Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 45-49; and (7) \"loss of consortium,\" Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 50-51. B &amp; R filed its Answer on February 14, 2017, denying the Glenns' claims and asserting various defenses. On November 17, 2017, B &amp; R filed an Amended Answer asserting two additional statutory defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. The pending motions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On April 26, 2018, the Glenns filed the first motion now before me, their Motion For Leave To Amend Complaint To Include A Claim For Punitive Damages, pursuant to IDAHO CODE \u00a7 6-1604. B &amp; R filed its Opposition to that motion on May 17, 2018, and the Glenns filed their Reply on May 31, 2018. On May 21, 2018, B &amp; R filed the second motion now before me, its Motion For Summary Judgment. The Glenns filed their Opposition on June 11, 2018, and B &amp; R filed its Reply on June 22, 2018, along with additional evidence and objections to some of the Glenns' evidence. On May 25, 2018, B &amp; R filed the third and last motion now before me, its\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   Motion In Limine To Exclude Engineer Stephens. The Glenns filed their Opposition on June 15, 2018, and B &amp; R filed its Reply on June 29, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   By Order filed June 1, 2018, I set telephonic oral arguments on these three motions for June 26, 2018. At the oral arguments on June 26, 2018, however, B &amp; R requested that I delay oral arguments on its\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   Motion until after it had filed its Reply concerning that Motion. Therefore, I heard oral arguments on June 26, 2018, only on the Glenns' Motion To Amend and B &amp; R's Motion For Summary Judgment. I heard separate telephonic oral arguments on B &amp; R's\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   Motion on July 2, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   All three motions are now fully submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Throughout this litigation counsel on both sides have been a pleasure to work with. They have been extremely well prepared, consummate professionals, always demonstrating extraordinary civility with each other and me. They are a model of how lawyers should work to together while still being zealous advocates for their clients. Their depositions are also a model of efficiency with zero obstructive objections or conduct and nothing but super courteous conduct towards the deponents and each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   I will consider, first, the last motion filed, B &amp; R's Daubert Motion In Limine\n   To Exclude Engineer Stephens, because it is determinative of whether I can consider the challenged expert's opinions in ruling on the Motion For Summary Judgment. I will then consider B &amp; R's Motion For Summary Judgment, because it will not be necessary to consider the Glenns' Motion For Leave To Amend Complaint To Include A Claim For Punitive Damages if the Glenns' claims do not survive summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cedillo v.

Arguments of the parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   B &amp; R argues that Dr. Stephens's testimony is not reliable, because, in forming his opinions, Dr. Stephens conducted \"extreme standing\" tests, but collected no data and made no documentation of those tests, did not replicate them, and admits that they were not consistent with the facts of this case. Therefore, B &amp; R contends that Dr. Stephens's theory underlying the undocumented tests has not been properly tested, cannot be recreated, and is not reliable-and his assertion that he did not rely on those undocumented tests shows that even he does not consider them sufficiently reliable to be the basis for an expert opinion. B &amp; R contends that the undocumented tests also fail to meet relevant and accepted scientific standards. Furthermore, B &amp; R argues, the undocumented tests are based on impermissible speculation and conjecture about the circumstances in which the accident occurred. In short, B &amp; R argues that Dr. Stephens's report is nothing more than a conclusory recitation of the Glenns' various ad hoc and competing theories, dressed up in the authority of an expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Next, B &amp; R contends that Dr. Stephens's testimony is not relevant, because it is unduly speculative and unsubstantiated by facts in the record, so it will not assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact at issue. B &amp; R acknowledges that Dr. Stephens conducted a coefficient of friction test, to determine the amount of lateral force required to slide the stepstool, but only after it was clear that the stepstool did not \"collapse,\" as the Glenns originally alleged. B &amp; R argues that Dr. Stephens's opinions on sliding and tipping, however, are also not relevant, because they are built entirely on possibilities and conjectures about what happened contrary to Mrs. Glenn's testimony concerning her lack of contact with a counter or cabinet. Thus, B &amp; R labels this theory mere\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, B &amp; R contends that Dr. Stephens's testimony is prejudicial, misleading, and confusing. It is prejudicial, B &amp; R argues, because of the tendency jurors have to give undue weight to expert testimony. B &amp; R argues that Dr. Stephens's testimony is also misleading and confusing, because it is based on facts not in, and sometimes contrary to, the record, or based on no evidence at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In opposition, the Glenns assert that Dr. Stephens is well-qualified to render an expert opinion, an issue that B &amp; R did not dispute. The Glenns also argue that Dr. Stephens's methodology and opinions are proper, because he drew on his education, training, and 30 years of experience in the field of mechanical engineering, as well as his experience and expertise in biometrics and applying materials to design a product capable of fulfilling its purpose. The Glenns assert that, contrary to B &amp; R's contention, Dr. Stephens incorporated and\n   relied on multiple studies when formulating his opinions, including a coefficient of friction test and a stability study in which he stepped on and pushed down on the stepstools to see deflections, after modifying exemplar stepstools to match the condition of Mrs. Glenn's stepstool. The Glenns also point out that Dr. Stephens inspected the subject stepstool as part of his analysis. They argue that Dr. Stephens also relied on depositions of the Glenns and others, as well as B &amp; R's records of consumer complaints, lawsuits, and design modifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As to the undocumented standing tests, the Glenns argue that Dr. Stephens merely \"qualitatively alluded\" to them, but adequately explained that he did not document them, because they were outside the bounds of what he needed to show to provide his opinions on a design defect, and he expressly stated that he did not rely on them in formulating his opinions. The Glenns argue that what Dr. Stephens describes from his documented testing is consistent with what is shown in his videotapes of those tests and that he concluded that a re-enactment or a reconstruction was unnecessary to, and would not have changed, his opinions. They also argue that Dr. Stephens used \"collapse\" as a generic term for failure of the stepstool, not as specifically indicating that the stepstool broke apart causing the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Glenns argue that, because Dr. Stephens's theory that the stepstool shifted, tipped, or slid, causing Mrs. Glenn to fall, is supported by the facts of the case, it is relevant. They argue that, as Dr. Stephens explained, Mrs. Glenn's testimony reflects that she was reaching up and forward when she touched the cupboard, which would have caused her center of gravity to shift and would have applied horizontal or lateral forces to the stepstool; thus, his theories and opinions are not so speculative as to be irrelevant and inadmissible. In particular, the Glenns argue that Dr. Stephens's expert testimony is relevant, because it identifies the design defects associated with the stepstool and explains how those design defects more likely than not contributed to Mrs. Glenn's fall. Finally, they argue that Dr. Stephens's testimony is not more prejudicial than probative, where they have shown its relevance and the sufficiency of its foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In reply, B &amp; R reiterates that Dr. Stephens's opinions fail all of the relevant factors for admission of expert testimony, because he failed to provide scientific or measurable data, quantification, or analysis, to support his \"could have\" theories of \"shifting,\" \"tipping,\" or \"sliding.\" B &amp; R argues that Dr. Stephens's examination of the stool yielded no reliable opinions; his videotaped \"tests\" are unmeasured, unquantified, and unhelpful to the trier of fact; and his \"extreme standing\" tests are admittedly unscientific. Even Dr. Stephens's coefficient of friction tests, B &amp; R argues, are irrelevant, because they do not identify the source of any lateral force, just more speculation that Mrs. Glenn could have applied such lateral force, and his \"center of gravity\" theories are not based on any baseline center of gravity. In short, B &amp; R argues that Dr. Stephens has just presented theories based on speculation about what could have happened, not reliable expert opinions about what did happen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

The Glenns' argument that the documented tests and resulting conclusions about sliding, shifting, tipping, and buckling grow naturally out of Dr. Stephens's education, training, and 30 years of experience in the fields of mechanical engineering, biometrics, and applying materials to product designs is not enough, in this case, in light of all the other missing factors of reliability.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wells\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266195\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/900/#p933\">\n    879 F.3d at 933-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering whether an expert's testimony has a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of the relevant discipline);\n   <em>\n    Wendell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276709\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1227/#p1232\">\n    858 F.3d at 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (identifying a relevant factor as whether the expert is\n   testifying about matters growing naturally out of his or her own independent research).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Indeed, the application of the \"principles\" cited by Dr. Stephens to this case relies on little more than\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Stephens resorts to speculation, in his reports, declarations, deposition testimony, about how various forces or circumstances \"could have\" existed and \"could have\" resulted in the accident. For example, as B &amp; R contends, Dr. Stephens's opinions that Mrs. Glenn stood at the edge of the stool and inadvertently applied lateral force by pushing against the counter or cupboard is contrary to Mrs. Glenn's own testimony that she was standing flat-footed on the stepstool, evenly distributing her weight and not shifting it, and without leaning against the counter. I note that there is or may be a \"hole\" in the sequence of events in Mrs. Glenn's testimony about what happened between when she stood on the stool and reached up for the bowl and the point at which she found herself on the floor.

Similarly, in their Memorandum In Opposition, the Glenns describe their case as \"a products liability case alleging design defect(s).\" On the other hand, the Glenns argue that they have also asserted failure to warn and failure to properly test and inspect, as well as design defect claims and breach of warranty claims. They argue that B &amp; R's Motion For Summary Judgment attacks only their design defect and breach of warranty allegations, but does not directly address their failure to warn claim or their failure to test and inspect claim. Plaintiffs' Memorandum In Opposition To Defendant's Motion For Summary Judgment, 18. Thus, the Glenns expressly argue that the Motion For Summary Judgment does not encompass all their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   B &amp; R does not respond in its Reply to the Glenns' contention that the Motion For Summary Judgment does not encompass all the Glenns' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.

The Glenns do not assert that claims based on a manufacturing defect or failure to properly market, distribute, promote, and/or recall the stepstool would survive summary judgment.

B &amp; R argues that it is entitled to summary judgment for \"three primary reasons\": (1) the Glenns \"have failed to establish a prima facie case of products liability based on circumstantial evidence because they have not proved the absence of evidence of abnormal use and reasonable secondary causes\"; (2) the Glenns' \"evidence is largely inadmissible, irrelevant, and insufficient to support their claims\"; and (3) \"with regard to [the Glenns'] warranty claims, [the Glenns] are not in contractual privity with [B &amp; R] and do not assert third party beneficiary status.\" The bulk of B &amp; R's arguments appear to address the Glenns' design defect claim, with relatively limited arguments concerning the warranty claims.

Arguments of the parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   B &amp; R argues that the Glenns have not addressed at all potential misuse or abnormal use of the stepstool with regard to the four missing feet; at most, B &amp; R argues, they have asserted that the stepstool underwent \"normal usage,\" without accounting for the missing feet. B &amp; R points out that Dr. Stephens concedes, in an opinion now excluded, that he does not know how or when any feet came off, but B &amp; R asserts that, if less than all the feet were off, the stepstool would have been noticeably unbalanced or wobbly. B &amp; R argues that, to the extent the Glenns did not voluntarily modify the stepstool by removing the remaining feet to fix a wobble-which they deny doing-the Glenns must have used the stepstool in a manner that scoured off all four feet at the same time. B &amp; R also argues that two of the four tabs on the Glenns' stepstool were broken sometime before Mrs. Glenn's fall. B &amp; R contends that, although the Glenns suggest that the missing tabs might have been responsible for the fall under some of their theories, they do not show that the tabs were broken in normal use from normal wear and tear, nor do they eliminate the possibility of abnormal use, let alone show that the missing tabs resulted from a design defect. B &amp; R then argues that the damaged condition of the stepstool was the result of abnormal use. B &amp; R contends that the Glenns cannot show otherwise, because they have admitted the pre-existing damage and Dr. Stephens conceded that the stepstool's material is strong, tough, and durable. B &amp; R also argues that Dr. Stephens's undocumented \"extreme\" testing was abnormal use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The Glenns seem to suggest-and B &amp; R understands them to argue-that Mrs. Glenn will testify that the Glenns only used the stepstool in normal ways and did\n   not abuse it. The Glenns expressly reject B &amp; R's contention that the fact that the tabs were broken and the feet were scoured off shows abnormal use, because that argument is contrary to their own contention that defects with the stepstool were that the tabs broke easily, allowing remaining tabs to fall into the wrong cavities and falsely appear properly locked, and that the feet were prone to fall off on their own, wear out, and fail over time, making the stepstool more prone to skidding or sliding. The Glenns argue that B &amp; R's contention that the stepstool must have been noticeably wobbly if less than all the feet had come off is absurd, because the feet were very thin-indeed, mere fractions of an inch-and compressed when weight was applied. The Glenns also contend that evidence of other complaints that the feet fell off, that the tabs broke, and that the remaining tabs would fall into the wrong cavities, all in normal use, and observations of those defects with the stepstool in normal usage by B &amp; R employees including Mr. Kulzer, who ran B &amp; R's plant, also support their claims that there was no abnormal use of their stepstool. Thus, the Glenns contend that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they put the stepstool only to proper and ordinary use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In reply, B &amp; R argues that the Glenns' contention that there are genuine issues of material fact as to abnormal use is an admission that there is evidence of abnormal use, but the Glenns must show that there is a complete absence of evidence of abnormal usage. B &amp; R also argues that the Glenns' contentions that an average user might not be aware that the stool was locking into an improper position implies that normal usage involves ignoring warnings and instructions. B &amp; R also contends that the Glenns' argument is disingenuous in light of Mrs. Glenn's clear awareness and understanding of the proper usage of the stool and inconsistent with the standards for summary judgment, which require admissible specific record evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ii. Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Decisions of Idaho courts are remarkably unhelpful on what might constitute absence of evidence of abnormal use. Federal courts applying Idaho law are only slightly more helpful. For example, in an unpublished decision, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that \"the government's use of Oust in accordance with its label, and with DuPont's active advice and participation, was not abnormal use.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

On a motion for summary judgment, however, I conclude that the question is whether, on the evidence in the record, a reasonable jury could find that the Glenns have shown the absence of abnormal use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Med.

Second, the focus of the court's analysis in the pertinent part of\n   <em>\n    Mortensen\n   </em>\n   was on the absence of evidence of reasonable secondary causes, not the absence of evidence of abnormal use.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4430515\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/107/836/#p839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even so, the court considered only reasonable secondary causes for which there was evidence in the record, not mere speculation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4430515\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/107/836/#p839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Here, the Glenns certainly have not yet proved that there is no way the malfunction of the stepstool occurred in the absence of any abnormal use of the stepstool, either prior to or at the time of Mrs. Glenn's accident.

B &amp; R contends that the Glenns have not addressed the multiple possible reasonable alternative causes for Mrs. Glenn's fall. B &amp; R argues that these reasonable alternative causes include Mrs. Glenn's complex medical history; the combined effects of her prescribed medication; and/or the likelihood that Mrs. Glenn's fall was simply an accident, where people, and especially senior citizens, fall in everyday life. As to the first two points, B &amp; R relies on Dr. Kristensen's opinions to show that there are reasonable secondary causes in Mrs. Glenn's medical history and the medications she was using. As to the third point, B &amp; R points out that, as people age, the risk of injury from falling increases dramatically. B &amp; R relies on\n   <em>\n    Murray v. Farmers Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2359499\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/118/224/\">\n    118 Idaho 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2359499\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/118/224/\">\n    796 P.2d 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), as supporting its position. B &amp; R argues that, in\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs introduced evidence of the new condition of their vehicle and testimony of a single expert, who had been retained to survey only the type of damage that the vehicle had sustained, but not to conduct an accident reconstruction, that a possible broken tie rod was the cause of the accident, but the court found such evidence insufficient to negate other causes. B &amp; R then reiterates that the burden is on the Glenns to eliminate all reasonable alternative explanations for Mrs. Glenn's fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The Glenns counter that there is simply no other reasonably likely cause of Mrs. Glenn's fall. Rather, they contend that Dr. Kristensen's opinions are simply speculative and contrary to the evidence, from Mrs. Glenn and her treating physician, who will both testify that Mrs. Glenn did not suffer any dizziness or fainting the day of her accident and that she does not recall ever being diagnosed with a seizure disorder. The Glenns contend that, if nothing else, the disagreement between the medical experts generates a genuine issue of material fact on reasonable secondary causes. The Glenns argue that B &amp; R's theory that Mrs. Glenn simply fell, because she is old, is even more speculative and unsupported by any actual evidence. They point out that their record evidence shows that Mrs. Glenn was in good health and active prior to the accident and that her last fall had been fifteen years earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   In reply, B &amp; R reiterates that it is not enough for the Glenns to show that the cause they rely on is more likely responsible for Mrs. Glenn's accident than other causes. Rather, B &amp; R argues, the Glenns must show that there is no evidence of other reasonable causes, so that if there is evidence in the record that would support the inference of a secondary cause, or only generate genuine issues of material fact as to the cause, the Glenns lose. B &amp; R argues that the Glenns cannot demonstrate the unreasonableness of B &amp; R's secondary causes-dizziness or fainting from recent diarrhea or medications and the possibility that Mrs. Glenn fell simply because she is elderly-because B &amp; R points to reports and records from the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) including statics showing that falling is a commonly known and leading cause of injury and death among Americans over 65.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   B &amp; R argues that the Glenns' case is ultimately a tautology: The stepstool was defective (or malfunctioned) because Mrs. Glenn fell, and she fell because the stepstool was defective (or malfunctioned).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ii.

There are two facts in the record which would tend to establish a defect. First, the fact that the car was new, with less than 8000 miles on the odometer at the time of the accident. The second is the statement by an investigator retained by Vasseur, Mel Stewart. Stewart, who was not an accident reconstruction or mechanical expert, was retained to survey the type of damage sustained by the vehicle. In the course of a short description of the external damage, Stewart noted that the front wheels were at an odd angle, \"indicating the possibility of a broken tie rod.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   On the other hand, there is ample evidence in the record which would support the inference that the accident was not due to a defect in the automobile.

The police report stated that Murray had said he was unfamiliar with the front wheel drive of the car, which was primarily used by his wife. Murray told the investigating officer, as reflected in the police report, that he felt a loss of traction, as compared to his testimony on the record that he lost control of the steering.

Dr. Kristensen's possible cause, based only on speculation, is not a \"reasonably likely cause.\" At an even greater degree of generality is B &amp; R's reliance on statistics from the CDC showing that falling is a commonly known and leading cause of injury and death among Americans over 65. Those statistics,\n   however, rely on only a single factor, Mrs. Glenn's age, without considering any of her other personal characteristics or the circumstances of the accident. At best, Mrs. Glenn falling because of her age is a \"possible cause,\" but the CDC statistics do not establish that, as to Mrs. Glenn or any other specific person over 65 in any specific circumstances, falling is a \"reasonably likely cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Although I have not yet addressed whether the Glenns can prove that a defect in the stepstool was a cause of Mrs. Glenn's accident-a matter I will take up in the next section-I conclude that B &amp; R is not entitled to summary judgment on the products liability claims on the ground that the Glenns cannot show that there is no evidence of any reasonable secondary causes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5. Insufficient evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   B &amp; R's remaining ground for summary judgment is that the Glenns' \"evidence is largely inadmissible, irrelevant, and insufficient to support their claims.\" The Glenns also resist summary judgment on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. Arguments of the parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   B &amp; R argues that Dr. Stephens's opinions do not preclude summary judgment, for the reasons set out in more detail in B &amp; R's\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   Motion-and I did exclude Dr. Stephens's testimony, above. B &amp; R argues that, even if they were admissible, Dr. Stephens's theories about shifting, tipping, and sliding are inadequate and, indeed, are different from their pleaded claim that the stepstool \"collapsed.\" B &amp; R argues that the Glenns' sole physical evidence is that the tabs on the stepstool were broken and the feet were missing, but both conditions occurred long before the accident, so B &amp; R argues that physical evidence actually disproves the Glenns' defect allegations. B &amp; R argues that the Glenns resort to evidence of subsequent design improvements, which is inadmissible under IDAHO CODE \u00a7 6-1406 ; evidence of other incidents and complaints, which is inadmissible hearsay and inadmissible under Rules 402 and 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence ; and evidence of other manufacturers' recalls of similar products, which is also inadmissible under Rules 402 and 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   In contrast, the Glenns argue that the stepstool is direct evidence of a product defect, because the jury will be able to see that two tabs were broken, that the remaining tabs can fall into the wrong cavity preventing the stepstool from locking properly, and that the feet are missing, so that the stepstool would slide more easily. They point out that the effect of these flaws is confirmed not just by Dr. Stephens's opinions but by the testimony of Mr. Kulzer, who ran B &amp; R's facility. Putting all this together, the Glenns argue, the jury will be able to see that the stepstool is defective in that its integrity is compromised when it does not lock properly, because tabs have broken off, and slides more easily, because feet are missing, and that tabs may break and feet may go missing in normal use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The Glenns argue that their circumstantial evidence includes Mrs. Glenn's testimony that the stepstool malfunctioned, Dr. Stephens's opinions, customer complaints and lawsuits about broken tabs and missing feet, and B &amp; R's modifications to make the stepstool safer after its own employees, including Mr. Kulzer, observed that tabs could break and feet could go missing in normal use. They argue that Dr. Stephens's testimony is admissible for the reasons stated in their opposition to B &amp; R's\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   Motion, but I have rejected their arguments that Dr. Stephens's testimony is admissible. They also argue that the evidence of complaints, lawsuits, and recalls of similar stepstools by other manufacturers\n   is relevant and admissible, because it is not hearsay where such evidence is not being offered for the truth of the statements in them, but to show that B &amp; R had knowledge that its customers were reporting that tabs were breaking and that feet were falling off in normal use, leading to potential injuries. Moreover, the Glenns argue, B &amp; R modified the design of its stool several times to make it safer, which involved using thicker, more generous tabs and better feet. They contend this evidence is admissible, because it also speaks to the timing and severity of B &amp; R's conduct and impeaches B &amp; R's statement that it had no knowledge that its older model stools were defective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   In reply, B &amp; R argues that the Glenns have not generated genuine issues of material fact that the stepstool was defective. B &amp; R contends that there is no evidence that the stepstool collapsed or disintegrated suddenly under Mrs. Glenn, which was the Glenns' originally pleaded claim that the stepstool was defective. B &amp; R also argues that the undisputed facts do not support a slip or tip theory. The majority of B &amp; R's reply consists of renewed challenges to Dr. Stephens's testimony, which I have now excluded. B &amp; R argues that the Glenns rely on disjunctive and inconsistent theories, none of which are supported by evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.

Thus, in each of the claims that the Glenns assert, a product defect and injury caused by that defect must be proved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Even though I must take the evidence and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the Glenns and decide if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the Glenns,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Med.

This is so, because even if there is a jury question on whether the product was defective, the Glenns have presented no evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that the alleged defects caused Mrs. Glenn's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   As to proof of a defect, in either design, or warning, or failure to inspect for a defect that rendered the stepstool unreasonably dangerous, the Glenns have shown that there is evidence that two of the four tabs on the stepstool were broken and that the feet were missing at the time of the accident. Although the tabs were not broken and the feet were not missing at the time that the stepstool left B &amp; R, the manufacturer,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Massey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4192886\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/156/476/#p482\">\n    156 Idaho at 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4192886\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/156/476/#p482\">\n    328 P.3d at 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (last element), the Glenns have pointed to evidence, including evidence from Mr. Kulzer, that the weakness of the tabs as designed made them prone to breakage in normal use and that the design of the feet made them prone to come off in normal use, which were defects that existed when the stepstool left B &amp; R's control. Erring on the side of caution to draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the Glenns, I conclude that a jury would be able to see that the stepstool is defective in that its integrity is compromised when it does not lock properly, if tabs have broken off, and slides more easily, if feet are missing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The problem for the Glenns is that they have not pointed to any admissible evidence that the alleged defect caused Mrs. Glenn's injury. Although they assert that Mrs. Glenn testified that the stepstool malfunctioned, her testimony is that she does not recall any indication that the stepstool was about to fail, or that it slipped or tipped or became unstable, and, in fact, she does not recall anything between reaching up for the bowl on the shelf and finding herself on the floor. Thus, her testimony shows only the occurrence of an accident, and the Idaho Supreme Court has made clear, \"the plaintiff will not carry his burden of proof [on a products liability claim] by merely proving the fact of the occurrence of an accident.\"\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4424840\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/97/742/\">\n    97 Idaho at 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4424840\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/97/742/\">\n    553 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1313 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2359499\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/118/224/\">\n    118 Idaho at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2359499\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/118/224/\">\n    796 P.2d at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   ). The Glenns also offered Dr. Stephens's opinions about how the alleged defects caused Mrs. Glenn to fall, but I have excluded Dr. Stephens's opinions. Their other evidence of causation is equally problematic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   As to \"other incidents and complaints\" evidence to show defects and causation, B &amp; R argues that such evidence lacks foundation and substantial similarity and is hearsay. As to B &amp; R's hearsay objection, the Glenns argue, in one breath, that evidence of \"other incidents and complaints\" demonstrates both defect and causation, but in the next breath, argue that such evidence is not hearsay, because it is offered to show that B &amp; R had notice that tabs could break off and that feet could come off the stepstool in the course of normal use, not for an impermissible purpose, such as the truth of the claims in the \"other incidents and complaints\" evidence. It is only the truth of the claims in this \"other incidents and complaints\" evidence, however, that would establish a defect in the stepstool or that any defect caused injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   In their resistance to summary judgment, the Glenns expressly address only B &amp; R's hearsay objection to the \"other incidents and complaints\" evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Memorandum In Opposition To Defendant's Motion For Summary Judgment at 9, but in footnote 3, they refer me to their Reply Memorandum in support of their Motion To Amend for further argument about the admissibility of this evidence. In the cited Reply, the Glenns assert that this evidence is relevant to the presence of defects (albeit sometimes identified as manufacturing defects, which I found, above, was a claim that the Glenns have abandoned), causation, and notice to B &amp; R, and that \"any potential prejudice from lawsuits or complaints that [are] not 'substantially similar' to [the Glenns'] is significantly outweighed by their probative\n   value.\" They add that at least some of the \"other incidents and complaints\" arise from substantially similar circumstances, because those incidents and complaints alleged broken tabs, missing feet, and people falling off stools and injuring themselves.

Based on the Glenns' response, neither I nor a reasonable juror could make the kind of detailed assessment of the extent of the similarity between this case and any other incidents that were undertaken, for example, by the trial court in\n   <em>\n    Sliman\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4449866\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/108/379/#p382\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In short, the\n   Glenns have not pointed to any admissible evidence of \"other incidents and complaints\" to prove a defect or any other element of their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   That leaves the Glenns' reliance on evidence of B &amp; R's modifications to make the stepstool safer. B &amp; R argues that this evidence is inadmissible for the purpose of proving a defect or causation pursuant to IDAHO CODE \u00a7 6-1406. The Glenns acknowledge that B &amp; R has attacked the admissibility of this evidence, but they argue that it is admissible, because it \"speaks towards the timing and severity of [B &amp; R's] conduct, and to impeach [B &amp; R's] statement that it had no knowledge that its older model stools were defective.\" Plaintiffs' Memorandum In Opposition To Defendant's Motion For Summary Judgment at 9. In footnote 4, they refer me, again, to their Reply Memorandum in support of their Motion To Amend for further argument about the admissibility of this evidence. In the cited Reply, they rely on the exception for admissibility of \"modification\" evidence in IDAHO CODE \u00a7 6-1406(2), but they argue only that the exception would allow \"modification\" evidence to show B &amp; R's knowledge of a defect, not to show a defect or causation. Plaintiffs' Reply Memorandum In Support Of Plaintiffs' Motion For Leave To Amend at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   IDAHO CODE \u00a7 6-1406 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   (1) Evidence of changes in (a) a product's design, (b) warnings or instructions concerning the product, (c) technological feasibility, (d) \"state of the art,\" or (e) the custom of the product seller's industry or business, occurring after the product was manufactured and delivered to its first purchaser or lessee who was not engaged in the business of either selling such products or using them as component parts of another product to be sold,\n   <em>\n    is not admissible for the purpose of proving that the product was defective in design or that a warning or instruction should have accompanied the product at the time of manufacture.\n   </em>\n   The provisions of this section shall not relieve the product seller of any duty to warn of known defects discovered after the product was designed and manufactured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   (2) If the court finds outside the presence of a jury that the probative value of such evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect and that there is no other proof available, this evidence may be admitted\n   <em>\n    for other relevant purposes, including but not limited to proving ownership or control, or impeachment.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   IDAHO CODE \u00a7 6-1406 (emphasis added). Thus, subsection (1) of the statute expressly bars use of the manufacturer's modifications to prove a \"defect\" and neither \"defect\" nor \"causation\" falls within the scope of the exception in subsection (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Because the Glenns have not cited any admissible evidence of a \"defect\" or \"causation,\" a flaw that goes to all of their claims, B &amp; R is entitled to summary judgment on all of the Glenns' claims. B &amp; R's Motion For Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   as to all of the Glenns' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

Although this was, perhaps, the most hotly contested of the motions now before me, I need not consider it, because the Glenns' claims do not survive summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cedillo v.

Nevertheless, I conclude that Dr. Stephens's testimony should be excluded and that the Motion For Summary Judgment should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   THEREFORE, upon the foregoing,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   1.

Nevertheless, the Glenns have not argued in opposition to summary judgment that B &amp; R's liability for Mrs. Glenn's injuries in this case can be premised solely on B &amp; R's failure to recall the stepstool. Thus, to the extent that the Glenns may have intended failure to recall the stepstool as a separate basis for liability, I find that they have abandoned such a claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Farmer\n    </em>\n    , the court explained,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n    A distinction need not be drawn between a 'defect' and a 'malfunction'.
