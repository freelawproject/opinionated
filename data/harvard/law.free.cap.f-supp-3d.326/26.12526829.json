PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Mirage Entertainment, Inc. (\"Mirage\") and Mariah Carey (\"Carey,\" and with Mirage, \"Counterclaim Defendants\") move to dismiss counterclaims asserted by FEG Entretenimientos S.A. (\"FEG Argentina\") and FEG S.A. (\"FEG Chile,\" and with FEG Argentina, \"Counterclaimants\") in this breach of contract action. Counterclaimants assert that Counterclaim Defendants breached three contracts between the parties by unilaterally cancelling two South American concerts without affording Counterclaimants an opportunity to cure. Counterclaimants also allege that a 2016 tweet (the \"Tweet\") that Carey posted to her Twitter account was defamatory. For the reasons that follow, Counterclaim Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The allegations in the Counterclaims are accepted as true on this motion. Counterclaimants are South American concert promoters. (Countercls. for Breach of Contract &amp; Defamation, ECF No. 14 (\"Counterclaims\") \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 10.) Mirage operates as Carey's \"loan out corporation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 6, 11.) In essence, Mirage contracts with others for Carey's live performances. (Counterclaims \u00b6 11.) Non-party United Talent Agency (\"UTA\") coordinates transactions between artists and concert promoters. (Counterclaims \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2016, FEG Argentina and Mirage contracted for Carey to perform in Buenos Aires, Argentina on October 28, 2016 (the \"Argentina Agreement\"). (Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 15-17.) FEG Argentina agreed to pay Mirage a fee of $575,000 in installments. (Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.) FEG Argentina executed the Argentina Agreement and delivered it to UTA in late September 2016. (Counterclaims \u00b6 18.) FEG Chile and Mirage also contracted for Carey to perform in Santiago, Chile on October 30, 2016 (the \"Chile Agreements,\" and with the Argentina Agreement, the \"Agreements\"). (Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 20-22.) In two separate contracts, FEG Chile agreed to pay Carey a fee of $425,000 and a net payment of $175,000 for airfare and travel. (Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22.) Like the Argentina Agreement, the Chile Agreements set schedules for installment payments. (Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) FEG Chile executed the Chile Agreements and delivered them to UTA in late September 2016. (Counterclaims \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under the Agreements, Carey had the right to cancel her performances if Counterclaimants\n   failed to make timely installment payments. (Counterclaims \u00b6 25.) But each contract provided a notice and cure provision: if Counterclaim Defendants believed that Counterclaimants were in breach, they agreed to provide written notification of the reasons for such breach and afford forty-eight hours to cure. (Counterclaims \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Counterclaimants' payments were due in full by either September 8, 2016 or September 15, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Jordan W. Siev in Supp. of Counter-Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 38 (\"Siev Decl.\"), Exs. 1, 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counterclaimants failed to make payments according to the installment schedules. As of October 25, 2016, they had \"wired a total of $703,100 to UTA ... nearly 75% of all funds due.\" (Counterclaims \u00b6 27.) In fact, Counterclaimants made late and/or deficient payments throughout late 2016 and never received objection from Counterclaim Defendants. (Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 30-32.) Counterclaimants allege that this was consistent with their business custom-installment schedules were rarely followed but \"artists were always paid in full.\" (Counterclaims \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 25, 2018, three days before the Argentina concert, Counterclaimants learned through media reports that Carey had cancelled the Argentina and Chile performances. (Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.) That evening, Carey tweeted \"Devastated my shows in Chile, Argentina &amp; Brazil\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   had to be cancelled. My fans deserve better than how some of these promoters treated them.\" (Counterclaims \u00b6 41.) The Tweet linked to an E! News tweet, which in turn linked to an E! News article titled \"Mariah Carey Cancels Part of her Latin America Tour Citing Promoter Negligence.\" (Counterclaims \u00b6 42.) In that article, E! News reported that Carey had been forced to cancel the South American leg of her tour due to \"promoter negligence.\" Mike Vulpo,\n   <em>\n    Mariah Carey Cancels Part of Her Latin America Tour Citing Promoter Negligence\n   </em>\n   , E! News (Jan. 10, 2017), https://www.eonline.com/news/804645/mariah-carey-cancels-part-of-her-latin-america-tour-citing-promoter-negligence. On October 26, 2016, Carey's production manager confirmed cancellation of the performances by email and UTA then returned more than $600,000 to Counterclaimants. (Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2017, Mirage sued Counterclaimants in California state court, asserting breach of contract. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Robert E. Allen in Supp. of Defs.' Notice of Removal of Action Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), ECF No. 1-1, Ex. A (\"Original Compl.\"); Ex. D, at 6-7.) In December 2017, Counterclaimants removed the action to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. (Defs.' Notice of Removal of Action Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), ECF No. 1, at 1-2.) In January 2018, Counterclaimants filed an unopposed motion to transfer to this district. (Defs.' Notice of Mot. and Unopposed Mot. to Transfer Venue, ECF No. 12, at 1-2.) While that motion was pending, Counterclaimants answered and asserted these counterclaims. Although the original claims were brought solely by Mirage, Counterclaimants added Carey as a counterclaim defendant. The Central District of California subsequently granted Counterclaimants' transfer motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Granting Defs.' Mot. to Transfer Venue to\n   the Southern District of New York, ECF No. 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In their motion to dismiss, Counterclaim Defendants contend that emails sent by UTA to Counterclaimants demonstrate that Counterclaimants were provided notice of breach and an opportunity to cure, meaning that Counterclaim Defendants did not unilaterally breach the Agreements. They also contend that Carey is an improper defendant for the breach of contract counterclaims. Finally, Counterclaim Defendants contend that the defamation counterclaim should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"To avoid dismissal, a complaint must plead 'enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hardaway v.

Rather, by linking to the E!

Viewed in context, Carey was not implying facts about Counterclaimants, but expressing her wish that her fans had been able to attend her South American concerts. Such an abstract desire is incapable of being termed defamatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   To the extent that Counterclaimants allege that the E! News article is in itself a defamatory statement attributable to Carey (an argument referred to in their briefing), such an allegation is insufficiently pled. A fair reading of the Counterclaims make clear that this counterclaim is based solely on the Tweet, not whatever statements Carey provided to E! News. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 63, 65-66 (\"Carey's Tweet, was defamatory ... The Tweet was published and broadcast through the Twitter Network to over 16.8 million followers.... The Tweet was false.\") No substantive allegations describe Carey's statements to E! News, what they were, when they were given, or how they damaged Counterclaimants. Instead, the Counterclaims' allegations all concern the Tweet. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counterclaims \u00b6 68 (\"The Tweet was a substantial factor in causing [Counterclaimants] to suffer financial loss ....\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In fact, Counterclaimants' sole reference to the E! News story is two assertions stating that \"Carey's Tweet linked to an 'Exclusive' story published by E! News .... That story further repeated and spread Carey's false statements ....\" (Counterclaims \u00b6 42.) These conclusory allegations are devoid of underlying facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (pleadings \"demand[ ] more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation\" and will not suffice \"if [they] tender[ ] 'naked assertion[s]' devoid of 'further factual enhancements' \" (citing\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 555, 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ). Accordingly, Counterclaimants fail to make out a separate defamation claim based on the E! News article.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rohn Padmore, Inc. v. LC Play Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3584784\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/679/454/#p460\">\n    679 F.Supp.2d 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 460 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (holding that the failure to state \"the time and\n   manner in which the publications were made\" was fatal to plaintiff's defamation claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, Counterclaimants' contention that the Tweet was defamatory by linking to the E! News article is without merit. Although one who republishes defamatory content may be liable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 578 (1977), \"[a] hyperlink ... does not duplicate the content of a prior publication; rather, it identifies the location of an existing publication,\"\n   <em>\n    Doctor's Data, Inc. v.

This can be contrasted with\n   <em>\n    Enigma Software Group USA v.
