Before the Court are (a) Ally's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 25) and (b) Ammons' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 69), both of which are fully briefed, including legal memoranda, exhibits, and an enormous amount of supplemental authority and related briefing. The Court also ordered additional briefing regarding the impact of\n   <em>\n    ACA International v. Federal Communications Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516351\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/687/\">\n    885 F.3d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   \"), on this case. These motions are now ripe for decision. For the following reasons, Ally's motion will be denied in full and Ammons' motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background and Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In April 2014, Ammons\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and her daughter purchased a Nissan Altima from Trinity Automotive dealership in Nashville, Tennessee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 35 at \u00b6 2.) The purchase had two components: a credit application (\"CA\") and a retail installment sale contract (\"RISC\"). First, Ammons (who was listed as the \"buyer\") and her daughter (who was listed as the \"co-buyer\") obtained financing for the purchase via the CA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) In the \"Applicant Information\" section of the CA, Ammons provided the cellular telephone number that is at issue in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The CA provided that: \"[b]y providing your cell phone number on this application, you are consenting to receive servicing and collection calls on your cell phone using an auto dialer or prerecorded message. This consent applies to the dealer, who is the originating creditor in this transaction, as well as any assignee who may purchase your credit contract from the dealer. \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.) The CA further stated that, \"by signing below, you certify that you have read and agree to the terms....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.) Trinity Automotive transmitted the CA to Ally, which processed and approved it. (Doc. No. 25-2 at \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Next, Ammons and her daughter executed the RISC with Trinity Automotive. (Doc. No. 35 at \u00b6 9.) Trinity Automotive then assigned its interests in the RISC to Ally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.) In the \"Servicing and Collection Contacts\" section, the RISC states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   You agree that we may try to contact you in writing, by e-mail, or using prerecorded/artificial voice messages, text messages, and automatic telephone dialing systems, as the law allows. You also agree that we may try to contact you in these and other ways at any address or telephone number you provide us, even if the telephone number is a cell phone number or the contact results in a charge to you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Doc. No. 35 at \u00b6 11.) The RISC also states that it \"contains the entire agreement ... relating to this contract. Any change to this contract must be in writing and we must sign it. No oral changes are binding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) Finally, the RISC states: \"You agree to the terms of this contract. You confirm that before you signed this contract, we gave it to you, and you were free to take it and review it. You confirm that you received a completely filled-in copy when you signed it.\" (Doc. No. 25-4 at 1.) The RISC contains a choice of law provision that dictates both \"federal law and the law of the state of Tennessee apply.\" (Doc. No. 35 at \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In July 2015, Ammons began receiving automated calls from Ally to her cellular phone number to discuss a delinquency in payments that were due under the RISC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16; Doc. No. 69-1 at \u00b6 9.) Based on her own testimony, Ally's call records and admissions, and her own non-exclusive, handwritten call logs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ammons alleges that Ally called her over 500 times between August 31, 2014 and January 24, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 89 at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8; 69-1 at \u00b6 15.) However, based on various records, Ally suggests that there was a dramatically lower number of calls. (Doc. Nos. 86-2 at 13-16; 86-1 at 8-12; 69-8; 102 at \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In her deposition, Ammons acknowledged that she didn't answer \"a lot\" of Ally's calls. (Doc. No. 86-1 at 37.) Ally's corporate representative, Diane Accurso, testified at her deposition that Ally \"made\" a substantially lower amount of calls than Ammons asserts, but conceded that this assertion only took into account calls where a representative actually spoke to Ammons or left a voicemail or text message. (Doc. No. 69-8 at 11.) In written discovery responses, Ally admitted that it \"initiated\" the following number of calls to Ammons' number using equipment with the capacity to operate as a predictive dialer: (a) after December 22, 2015: 518, (b) after September 22, 2016: 235; and\n   after December 16, 2016: 64. (Doc. No. 69-3 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties also plainly dispute if, how, and when Ammons instructed Ally's agents to stop calling her. (Doc. No. 89 at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9.) Ammons testified that \"from the beginning, [she] asked [Ally] to call [her daughter] instead of me.\" (Doc. No. 69-2 at 4.) But the calls kept coming, sometimes \"four and five times a day.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ammons testified that, in conjunction with directing Ally to her daughter, she told them \"don't call me\" on \"several, a lot of times.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Two key dates in the parties' disagreements on this subject are December 22, 2015, and September 22, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ammons contends that on December 22, 2015, she provided her daughter's information to Ally and asked Ally to stop calling her cell phone. (Doc. No. 69-1 at \u00b6 11.) Ally, on the other hand, argues that records of the December 22, 2015, communication could be interpreted as Ammons instructing Ally to call Ammons' daughter, but not necessarily to stop calling Ammons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 89 at \u00b6 7.) Likewise, Ammons contends that on September 22, 2016, she spoke to an Ally agent-Mr. Body-and asked him to put a note in her file that Ally should stop calling her and call her daughter. (Doc. Nos. 69-1 at \u00b6 12; 102 at \u00b6 23; 86-1 at 12.) Ammons maintains that Mr. Body agreed that Ally would no longer call Ammons and stated that he would \"put a flag on the account\" so that no further automated calls would be made. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Ally contends that (1) its records do not confirm that it spoke with Ammons (as opposed to, e.g., Ammons' daughter), (2) Ammons' evidence is fundamentally confused, and (3) the evidence suggests that Mr. Body volunteered to stop the calls in error rather than agreed to stop them in response to a demand from Ammons. (Doc. No. 89 at \u00b6 9.) Regardless, on September 22, 2016, a permanent note was entered on Ammons' account by Mr. Body that advised \"dnc buyer!!!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11; Doc. No. 69-6 at 58.) Accurso has stated that \"dnc\" means \"do not call.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 89 at \u00b6 12.) Again, Ammons has offered evidence that she received numerous calls after this date, but Ally has offered evidence that far fewer calls were made. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 26, 2016, another Ally agent entered a comment on Ammons' account that stated \"dnc buyer-in important note.\" (Doc. No. 69-6 at 26.) Ally contends that this was just the repeating of Mr. Body's September note; furthermore, Accurso testified that she would \"not agree\" that the person making this entry was under the impression that she should not be calling Ammons' telephone. (Doc. No. 86-2 at 19.) Ammons contends that Ally called her numerous times after this date, and, again, Ally disputes Ammons' account. (Doc. No. 89 at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 20, 2017, Ammons spoke to another Ally agent and reminded him\n   about Mr. Body's promise. (Doc. No. 69-1 at \u00b6 13.) In a recording of the January 20 call, Ammons can be heard saying: \"I talked to Mr. Body about two months ago, and he told me that you all would stop calling me, that he is going to put a (inaudible) on my account.\" (Doc. No. 86-1 at 12.) In her deposition, counsel for Ally asked Ammons: \"[D]o you feel like you clearly expressed to the agent that you did not want Ally to call your cell phone about the account ever again?\" Ammons responded, \"Yes. I mean, on that particular call, I do.\" When asked to explain \"why,\" Ammons replied: \"I mean, because I told him that I had asked the previous person to tell them not to call me. That meant all of them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ally's notes for the January 20 call states that Ammons \"doesn't want calls anymore ... says to call daughter.\" (Doc. No. 69-6 at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ally has policies and procedures for consumer account servicing and collections that govern customer requests not to be contacted on their cell phone. (Doc. Nos. 92 at \u00b6 4; 92-1 (Servicing Collection Policies and Individual Agreement).) According to Accurso, \"in the face of a verbal request from a customer not to receive calls at a cell phone number, agents are required to initiate a DNCC (Do Not Call Cell) workflow.\" (Docs. No. 92 at \u00b6 5; 92-2 (DNCC protocol).) The DNCC \"wizard\" requires multiple steps and, upon completion, is automatically updated in Ally's system for consumer accounts. (Docs. No. 92 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-8; 92-2.) Accurso also averred that, in conjunction with processing of a DNCC request, an Ally agent must also update the permission setting in the cell phone consent field associated with the cell phone number by changing that setting to \"N\". (Doc. Nos. 92 at \u00b6 9; 92-3 (Calling Rules).) According to Accurso, notes in a customer's account are not the same as a DNCC workflow, even if they state \"dnc buyer!!!\" (Doc. No. 92 at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 24, 2017, extensive notes were placed into Ammons' account, including Ammons' (1) description of how the dealership told her she could get the car out of her name in six months and (2) request that Ally cease its \"stressful\" calling. (Doc. Nos. 86-2 at 20-22; 69-6 at 12.) While not explaining how these notes were any different than multiple other prior notes, including Mr. Body's \"dnc buyer!!!\" note, Ally maintains that January 24, 2017, was \"the first time [Ammons] actually asked for calls to stop.\" (Doc. No. 102 at \u00b6 29.) Accurso testified that this was when \"the customer requested not to be called\" under Ally policies and that Ammons' \"request was honored.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, this Court will only consider the narrow question of whether there are \"genuine issues as to any material fact and [whether] the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The parties' dispositive motions primarily turn on the question of consent. However, the Court must address several other matters before reaching that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Threshold Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, Ally contests whether its predictive dialing system qualifies as the necessary ATDS under the TCPA. Second, Ally argues that its liability is limited because either (a) the harm to Ammons generally is not concrete or (b) the TCPA provides liability for only certain types of calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Whether Ally's Predictive Dialer is an Automatic Telephone Dialing System Under the TCPA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"The term 'automatic telephone dialing system' means equipment which has the capacity[ ] (A) to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator; and (B) to dial such numbers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 227(a)(1). To avoid the need for certain discovery in this case, the parties entered into a stipulation that the telephone calls made by Ally to Ammons were \"placed both manually and using a dialer. For only those telephone calls made using a dialer, the equipment has the capacity to operate as a predictive dialer.\" (Doc. No. 69-7.) This essential fact being undisputed, the pending motions debate whether Ally's predictive dialer qualifies as an ATDS within the meaning of \u00a7 227(a)(1). Ally argues that predictive dialers like the one it has conceded to using fall outside the ambit of the TCPA, or, at the very least, that triable issues of fact exist concerning the ability of its predictive dialer to use a random or sequential number generator. Ammons disagrees and contends that Ally's predictive dialer is an ATDS under applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Based on what appears at first blush to be unambiguous statutory language, \u00a7 227(a)(1) seems to dictate that the essential feature of an ATDS is that it uses \"a random or sequential number generator.\" But the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") has taken a different approach to interpreting \u00a7 227(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following\n   on the heels of a 1992 Order in which the FCC stated that it was rejecting definitions that fit \"only a narrow set of circumstances\" in favor of \"broad definitions which best reflect[ed] legislative intent [of the TCPA],\"\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Rules and Regulations Implementing the Tel.

The petitioner prompting the\n   <em>\n    2008 FCC Ruling\n   </em>\n   had argued, among other things, that (1) the FCC's \"determination that predictive dialers fall within the meaning of the statutory definition of 'automated telephone dialing equipment' was incorrect and conflicts with the language of the TCPA\" and (2) the FCC had erred in 2003 because \"debt collectors use predictive dialers to call specific numbers provided by established customers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 563, 566.

Summarizing and reaffirming the findings of the\n   <em>\n    2003 FCC Ruling\n   </em>\n   , the FCC added that the petitioner \"raise[d] no new information about predictive dialers that warrants reconsideration of th[o]se findings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 566-67. In 2012, the FCC clarified again that the TCPA's definition of an ATDS \"covers any equipment that has the specified capacity to generate numbers and dial them without human intervention regardless of whether the numbers called are randomly or sequentially generated or come from calling lists.\"\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the Tel.

In short, under the FCC's 2003 interpretation of \u00a7 227(a)(1), reaffirmed in the\n   <em>\n    2008 FCC Ruling\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    2012 FCC Ruling\n   </em>\n   , a system may qualify as\n   an ATDS by simply having \"the\n   <em>\n    capacity\n   </em>\n   to dial numbers without human intervention.\" 18 F.C.C. Rcd. at 14092 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In 2015, the FCC went further and took the position that this interpretation meant that an ATDS need only have the future capacity to dial random and sequential numbers, rather than the present ability to do so.\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the Tel.

Second,\n   <em>\n    Herrick\n   </em>\n   is internally inconsistent. After disavowing the FCC's 2015 guidance regarding the definition of an ATDS, the court engages in the very analysis that the FCC suggested in the\n   <em>\n    2015 FCC Order\n   </em>\n   -eventually concluding that the dialer at issue \"lacked the\n   <em>\n    capacity to become\n   </em>\n   a device that could randomly or sequentially generate numbers to be dialed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202229131\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, the\n   <em>\n    Herrick\n   </em>\n   decision really rests on the issue of \"human intervention.\" Curiously, regarding human intervention, the decision found that the FCC's prior pronouncements were still helpful and applied them.

In other words, Santander wanted the FCC to sanction its imposition of written revocation conditions, presumably in its consumer credit agreement-i.e., by contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galbreath v.

The FCC continued: \"Because the TCPA does not speak directly to the issue of revocation, the Commission can provide a reasonable construction of its terms. We agree with the Third Circuit that, 'in light of the TCPA's purpose, any silence in the statute as to the right of revocation should be construed in favor of consumers.'

Indeed, Ally disputes every aspect of this case, from whether Ammons \"clearly expressed\" her desire to stop receiving calls; to whether the phrase \"stop calls\" would have been reasonably understood to be Ammons' \"instruction\" versus an \"articulation of an animating reason\" for wanting to elude financial liability; to the meaning of Mr. Body's \"dnc buyer !!!\" entry; to the import of its own internal policies and procedures. Most obviously, of course, the parties disputes the facts surrounding the key interactions on December 22, 2015 and September 22, 2016, and the numbers of calls that followed thereupon. Ally's own call records provide evidence that could allow a reasonable jury to substantially question both Ammons' revocation or the number of inappropriate calls made by Ally. But, \"[t]o be sure, a jury might also find against Ally on the evidence.\" (Doc. No. 85 at 13) (Ally brief).)

To the extent Ally refers to the requirement that changes be only in writing and approved by Ally, this boilerplate requirement is not present in the CA. Furthermore, as discussed below, the Court finds that (a) consent to be called by an ATDS is not a material term of the RISC, and (b) such a generic provision can hardly be read to de-fang the entire TCPA. Put simply, the FCC has clearly admonished that \"the consumer is not limited to using only a revocation method that the caller has established as one that it will accept.\"\n    <em>\n     2015 FCC Ruling\n    </em>\n    at 7998.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The Court makes two preliminary observations about\n    <em>\n     Reyes\n    </em>\n    .

In\n    <em>\n     Reyes\n    </em>\n    , the consent clause of the lease agreement read as follows: \"You also expressly consent and agree to Lessor, Finance Company, Holder and their affiliates, agents and service providers may use written, electronic or verbal means to contact you.\"\n    <em>\n     Reyes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276104\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/51/#p56\">\n     861 F.3d at 53-54\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In this case, however, the RISC's consent clause is clearly modified by the phrase \"as the law allows.\" (Doc. No. 25-4.) Accordingly, Reyes entered into a different, open-ended, unlimited bargain with his lessor where Ammons explicitly reserved the benefit of recourse to relevant law (i.e., the TCPA). Second,\n    <em>\n     Reyes\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     '\n    </em>\n    basic characterization of itself as a \"contract case\" as opposed to a\n    <em>\n     Gager\n    </em>\n    -like \"consent\" case involving the \"unilateral\" providing of a phone number, is dubious.\n    <em>\n     Gager\n    </em>\n    (as here) involved a credit application that was returned with a grant of credit, so contractual arrangements were clearly involved.

(Doc. No. 44 at 2.) Nowhere does the TCPA require either of these things for a successful revocation of consent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     2015 FCC Ruling\n    </em>\n    at 7989-90 (\"A called party may revoke consent at any time and through any reasonable means.\"). It would be completely contrary to the purpose of the TCPA for Ammons to have to offer consideration to get Ally to stop calling her, or for Ammons to wait for Ally to decide to agree or decline her request. Additionally, in a brief accompanying supplemental authority, Ally argues that\n    <em>\n     Stevens-Bratton v.

LEXIS 183588\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5-9 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 6, 2017), the facts were somewhat distinguishable.\n    <em>\n     Rodriguez\n    </em>\n    involved a TCPA class action where the defendant, as part of the settlement, agreed to stop calling any class member who executed a \"Revocation Request.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *4. Those class members who did not do so remained subject to a settlement agreement that provided for compensation but ongoing calling by the defendant.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *5. The plaintiff did not sign a Revocation Request.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    The Court's ruling was dictated by\n    <em>\n     Reyes\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *5-9. Notably, the underlying settlement in\n    <em>\n     Rodriguez\n    </em>\n    contained a provision that stated: \"To the extent Congress, the FCC or any other regulatory authority promulgates different requirements under the TCPA, or any other law or regulation that would govern any conduct affected by the [ ] [s]ettlement, those laws and regulatory provisions shall control.\" Despite this language, the court rejected the\n    <em>\n     2015 FCC Ruling\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     's\n    </em>\n    pronouncement that \"a caller may not limit the manner in which revocation may occur\" in favor of\n    <em>\n     Reyes\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *8. A second New York district court followed\n    <em>\n     Reyes\n    </em>\n    just this month, with little analysis.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Schneider v.

June 7, 2018). The Court notes that a district court in this Circuit has recently cited\n    <em>\n     Reyes\n    </em>\n    with approval for the principle that \"the TCPA does not permit a consumer who agrees to be contacted by telephone as part of a bargained-for transaction to unilaterally revoke that consent.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Barton v.

At this point, the evidence does not unequivocally show that even that Ally is liable, let alone whether it \"willfully or knowingly\" violated the TCPA as a matter of law. Indeed, even Ammons' briefing only states that she \"strongly believes\" that all of Ally's calls were made willfully and/or knowingly. (Doc. No. 69 at 15.)
