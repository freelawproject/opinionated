DUFFIN, U.S. Magistrate Judge\n   <strong>\n    1. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Empire Medical Review Systems, Inc. develops and licenses medical billing software, including software called \"ClearingMagic\" (ECF No. 197, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3), which enables medical providers to submit claims for payment (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 3). CompuClaim assists school districts with getting claims submitted to state Medicaid agencies for reimbursement. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 1996 Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Pub.L. 104-191,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%201936\">\n    110 Stat. 1936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 5.) Relevant here is Title II of HIPAA and its \"Administrative Simplification\" provisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d - 1320d-8. Pursuant to Title II, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) promulgated certain uniform standards for the electronic representation of certain transactions (including financial transactions) within the healthcare industry. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The industry was given until approximately 2003 to become compliant with the new requirements of HIPAA, including the new ANSI standards that were being developed for the electronic submission of claims for payment. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 6.) The advent of the requirement for ANSI claims submission, and the complexity of the ANSI standards, created a market and demand for translation software that would enable users to take output in their current formats and translate it into the new HIPAA required ANSI formats. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In late 2005 and early 2006 Empire updated and modified its software \"to take into account the new formatting requirements created by HIPAA and other programs.\" (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 8.) In 2006 Empire began to refer to the product as ClearingMagic. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) ClearingMagic is designed to work with other Empire software products, including its EligibilityMagic software, which it created in 2009 and which makes electronic queries of insurance eligibility. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2010 CompuClaim approached Empire with its plan to create a website that would enable school districts to submit claims for payment to state Medicaid agencies. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 11.) In July 2010 CompuClaim and Empire entered into a Software License and Support Maintenance Agreement (hereafter referred to as the License Agreement). (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 12.) The License Agreement covered at least the ClearingMagic software; the parties dispute whether it covered other software, including EligibilityMagic. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 15.) Also in July 2010 the parties entered into an agreement entitled \"CompuClaim Web Portal Discovery Proposal\" whereby the parties agreed to explore what it would take to develop the sort of website CompuClaim envisioned. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2010 CompuClaim and Empire entered into a \"Web Integration Agreement\" (titled and hereafter referred to as \"Addendum B\"). (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 28.) In simplistic terms, under Addendum B Empire agreed to create the source code (referred to here as the CMWebSite source code) necessary for CompuClaim's website (referred to here as MeduClaim). (ECF No. 197, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.) Addendum B also extended the term of the License Agreement from three to five years. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 41.) However, CompuClaim ceased paying under the License Agreement\n   after three years. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 158.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To assist in the creation of the CMWebSite source code Empire hired Jeff Berg as an independent contractor. (ECF No. 191, \u00b6 31.) Empire delivered the operable website to CompuClaim in early 2011. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sometime between February and August 2011 Berg began working as an independent contractor for CompuClaim. (ECF No. 191, \u00b6 37.) Although working for CompuClaim, Berg continued to work out of Empire's offices until February 2012. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 74.) When Berg ceased to work at Empire's offices an Empire employee, Scott Strommen, removed Empire software from Berg's computer. (ECF No. 191, \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.) However, Strommen did not remove the CMWebSite source code from Berg's computer. (ECF No. 191, \u00b6 60.) Thus, Berg retained access to the CMWebSite source code and could modify it. (ECF No. 191, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the time MeduClaim was created it was for the ANSI 4010 format, but in 2012 electronic claim submissions had to comply with a new format, ANSI 5010. (ECF Nos. 191, \u00b6 52; 197, \u00b6\u00b6 108-10.) Empire charged CompuClaim for work to update the software to comply with the ANSI 5010 format (ECF No. 191, \u00b6 54) in accordance with a provision of the License Agreement regarding providing custom programming. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 111). CompuClaim paid for the work (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 123) but argues the update should have been included under the License Agreement as \"software maintenance,\" which the License Agreement defines to include \"[c]hanges to the software which are necessary as the result of changes in implementation guides published by centers for Medicare and Medicaid, CMS.\" (ECF No. 191, \u00b6 53.) CompuClaim's customers began to experience problems with the software in January 2012, which CompuClaim attributes to problems in the ANSI 5010 update. (ECF No. 191, \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After leaving Empire, Berg and a CompuClaim employee began to develop a replacement version of the website-related software, which CompuClaim launched in August 2012. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.) This replacement version was developed using the CMWebSite source code as a starting point. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 81.) CompuClaim admits that it never stopped using the CMWebSite source code but contends that it owns that code. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6\u00b6 82, 85, 86-91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Empire filed this action on November 13, 2013, alleging that CompuClaim breached the License Agreement in a number of ways, including by not paying license fees after July 2013. (ECF No. 1.) Empire also sought a declaration that CompuClaim had breached its obligations under the License Agreement and has a continuing obligation to perform until the end of the agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) CompuClaim filed a number of counterclaims. (ECF No. 7.) It also sought declaratory relief, requesting that the court declare that Empire had materially breached its obligations under the parties' various agreements and that the agreements were terminated and CompuClaim was relieved of its obligations under them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 17, 2015, Empire applied for and subsequently received a copyright registration regarding the CMWebSite source code. (ECF No. 197, \u00b6 68.) It then amended its complaint to add claims for copyright infringement and for violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). (ECF No. 60.) Because the five-year term of the license agreement had expired, Empire's amended complaint conceded that its request for declaratory relief was now moot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, CompuClaim added more counterclaims. (ECF No. 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 30, 2017, both parties moved for summary judgment. (ECF Nos. 162, 165.) Empire seeks summary judgment on its claims against CompuClaim as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   -CompuClaim infringed Empire copyright in the CMWebSite source code; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   -The length of the License Agreement is five (rather than three) years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Empire also sought summary judgment on all of CompuClaim's counterclaims (except for the tortious interference claim) on the ground that they are barred by a release previously provided it by CompuClaim. It also sought dismissal of several of the counterclaims on other grounds. CompuClaim sought summary judgment on all three of Empire's remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On June 6, 2018, the parties filed a Joint Notice of Settlement of Counterclaims. (ECF No. 213.) The notice states that the settlement is of CompuClaim's counterclaims only and that Empire's claims against CompuClaim remain pending. CompuClaim's counterclaims were formally dismissed by way of stipulation filed on June 18, 2018. (ECF No. 214.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Briefing on the parties' motions is complete. All parties have consented to have this court enter final judgment. (ECF No. 52, 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

(ECF No. 191, \u00b6\u00b6 69-72.) One such class was named:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ClaimsInInventoryQuery claimsInInventoryQuery = new ClaimsInInventory EmpireMedical.CMWeb.GUI.Compuclaim.

Berg, while employed by CompuClaim, changed this class name to \"CMWeb.GUI.Compuclaim.MWService.ClaimInvencoryMW\". (ECF No. 191, \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Empire asserts that \"EmpireMedical\" refers to the name of the author of the copyrighted software. Therefore, it is copyright management information under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). Empire alleges that each of the 149 instances on which Berg changed the class name in the source code was an individual violation of the DMCA, subjecting CompuClaim to statutory damages \"of not less than $ 2,500 or more than $25,000\" for each violation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201203\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B) ; (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 166 at 11-14 (all citations reflect the ECF pagination) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In moving for summary judgment, CompuClaim argues that Empire has not named a single witness (fact or expert) that will testify what alleged copyright management information was removed. (ECF No. 166 at 12-13.) In addition, it argues that Empire has no witness that will testify that software code that was altered was, in fact, copyright management information. (ECF No. 166 at 13-17.) It also alleges that \"EmpireMedical\" is not even Empire's name; there is a separate, unrelated Oregon corporation called \"Empire Medical.\" (ECF No. 166 at 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   With regard to Compuclaim's contention that Empire has no witnesses that will testify that the alleged copyright management information (i.e., references to EmpireMedical) was removed, Berg admits that he \"removed the 'EmpireMedical' reference at the beginning of the class name\" from the source code. (ECF No. 207, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.) And Empire employee Jereme Mills declares that \"EmpireMedical\" was removed from 148 different files, with one additional instance where CompuClaim removed \"Empire Medical\" from the source code. (ECF No. 207, \u00b6 3.) This evidence precludes granting summary judgment for CompuClaim on the basis that Empire has no witnesses that will testify as to what alleged copyright management information was removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As for CompuClaim's contention that Empire has no witness that will testify that the information removed by Berg was, indeed, copyright management information, CompuClaim asserts that the definition of copyright management information as including \"the name of, and other\n   identifying information about, the author of a work,\" requires more than just the name of the author; it requires the name of the author\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   \"other identifying information\" about the author. (ECF No. 206 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   CompuClaim does not cite to any authority supporting its reading of the statute. And the court disagrees with its reading. To read the provision identifying copyright management information as including \"the name of, and other identifying information about, the author of a work\" as protecting an author's name only if it is supplemented with \"other identifying information about the author of the work\" would be inconsistent with the policy and history underlying the DMCA whereby Congress sought broad and common-sense protection of copyrighted works.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IQ Grp. v. Wiesner Publ'g, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"962635\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/409/587/#p593\">\n    409 F.Supp.2d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593-98 (D.N.J. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It is not clear what \"other identifying information about the author of the work\" might even be. Works commonly state only a title, an author, and the name of the copyright holder, unaccompanied by any other \"information identifying the work\" or \"other identifying information about\" the copyright holder or author. Thus, under CompuClaim's reading of \u00a7 1202(c)(2), rather than broadly protecting copyrighted works, Congress protected works only in limited circumstances where creators add extraordinary information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   But the more reasonable reading-that \u00a7 1202(c)(2) protects both the name and other identifying information about the author, without requiring both to be included in the work-is consistent with Congress's goal of affording broad protection. The statute does not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   that the name of the author be supplemented by \"other identifying information about\" the author before it can be considered to be copyright management information; it simply states that,\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the author's name is supplemented by such other identifying information about the author, all of it is copyright management information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Thus, although circumstances for its application might be unusual, the provision nonetheless stands to serve a valuable role in protecting the intellectual property of authors. For example, if an author were identified as \"John Smith of Milwaukee, Wisconsin,\" it would be unlawful under \u00a7 1202(c)(2) for a different John Smith to delete \"of Milwaukee, Wisconsin\" or substitute his city and state if he had reasonable grounds to know it would enable him to claim he was the author of the work. Consequently, by also protecting \"other identifying information about[ ] the author,\" Congress did not limit the DMCA to a very narrow class of works where creators include extraordinary information but rather afforded expansive protection not limited to simply the author's name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bounce Exch., Inc. v.

(ECF No. 166 at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This, in the court's view, is a much closer question. CompuClaim argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Berg did not hide the fact that he was removing references to \"EmpireMedical.\" In fact, he made a note in the log for the MeduClaimWeb 2.0 project, making clear to anyone that had access to the source code that he had removed references to \"EmpireMedical\" from the class names. [Empire] does not allege that copies of the source code were distributed to the public with references to EmpireMedical removed, and no one outside of the context of this litigation was given access to the altered class names within the software. The only impact of shortening the class name and removing text, including \"EmpireMedical,\" was that it made the software more efficient and easier to modify in the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   (ECF No. 166 at 18-19.) But CompuClaim does not support these factual assertions in its brief with any citation to a proposed finding of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Citing to the declaration of Jereme Mills, Empire states that Berg's explanation for removing \"EmpireMedical\" from the code-to make it more efficient and easier to modify in the future-is pretextual because it did not result in any tangible improvement to the operation or efficiency of the code. (ECF No. 191, \u00b6 72.) Empire also notes its expert reported that in July 2013 Berg edited the source code with the following comment: \"Removal of all EmpireMedical references.\" (ECF No. 191, \u00b6 73.) Both of these assertions are set forth in response to CompuClaim's proposed findings of fact rather than as additional proposed findings of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ. L.R. 56(b)(2)(B)(ii). As CompuClaim correctly points out (ECF No. 207 at 1), that is not a proper way to introduce a new factual assertion because it denied CompuClaim the opportunity to state whether it agreed or disagreed and to submit evidence in support of its position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Thus, neither party has properly put before the court evidence that demonstrates whether CompuClaim made the change without the requisite knowledge. But even if the court were to consider the apparently undisputed (although improperly presented) fact that Berg explicitly noted that he was removing the references to \"EmpireMedical\" in the source code, the court would conclude it must still deny CompuClaim's motion for summary judgment. The record is insufficient to enable the court to conclude that recording the change in a change log necessarily demonstrates a lack of knowledge that the removal of \"EmpireMedical\" in the class name would \"induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement of any right\" under the United States copyright law. For example, the court is not told whether the change log is accessible to anyone reviewing the source code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In sum, the court finds that it must deny CompuClaim's motion for summary judgment with respect to Empire's DMCA claim. A genuine dispute of material fact exists both as to whether the reference to \"EmpireMedical\" in a class name within the source code is copyright management information and as to whether the removal was done with the requisite knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    3.2 Copyright Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Both parties move for summary judgment on Empire's contention that CompuClaim infringed on Empire's copyright regarding the CMWebSite source code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    3.2.1 CompuClaim's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This action is not the first dispute between Empire and CompuClaim. On April 16, 2012, CompuClaim and Empire entered into a settlement and mutual release agreement regarding a prior dispute. (ECF No. 168-8.) In the settlement agreement CompuClaim released Empire \"from all actions, claims or causes of action ... that [CompuClaim has] now, or in the future may have, against [Empire] arising out of events occurring prior to the execution of this Agreement.

Specifically, it argues that the \"event\" that the claim \"arises out of\" is Berg's departure from Empire's offices in February 2012, when he was allowed to retain the custom programming regarding the MeduClaim website. (ECF No. 166 at 23.) It points out that Empire alleges that its damages started on April 17, 2012, the day after the release. (ECF No. 166 at 21.) Because no new event happened on April 17, 2012, CompuClaim argues that this means that Empire's copyright claim necessarily existed before the release and is therefore barred. (ECF No. 166 at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In response to CompuClaim's motion, Empire contends that it is only advancing claims arising after the date of the settlement agreement-that is, after April 16, 2012. (ECF No. 190 at 10.) Empire argues that its copyright claim is based on acts of infringement occurring after the release date-namely, CompuClaim copying and creating derivative works from Empire's software. (ECF No. 190 at 13-14.) Empire says that Berg's access to the Empire source code is not the act of infringement that it sues on in this lawsuit. (ECF No. 190 at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Berg retaining the code might have been a link in the causal chain that led to Empire's copyright claim, but it was not an event that could be fairly said to have given rise to the claim. Simply because a party has the means of committing an unlawful act does not give rise to a claim. Therefore, the court rejects CompuClaim's argument that Empire's copyright claim is necessarily barred by the release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The fact that Empire asked its damages expert to use April 17, 2012, as the start date for calculating damages does not establish that the event that triggered the copyright infringement claim was Berg's departure in February 2012. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 166 at 122; ECF No. 191, \u00b6 75.) That merely represents a best-case-scenario assumption offered to assist an expert in shaping his opinion; it is not a concession or a statement that precludes Empire from proving at trial that the damages began to accrue at a later date as a result of copyright infringement occurring sometime after April 17, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Consequently, the court concludes that CompuClaim has failed to show that Empire's copyright infringement claim was released by the April 16, 2012 mutual release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    3.2.2 Empire's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \"A copyright 'vests initially in the author or authors of the work.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    Billy-Bob Teeth v.

According to CompuClaim, the distinction between the Software and the additional custom programming is underscored by the fact that custom programming and the Software are addressed separately in the License Agreement. Under the License Agreement,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Licensee may create custom features, options or reports which are to be added to the Software (hereinafter \"add-ons\") but only for Licensee's use in its business and not for sale or resale to others.

First, it notes that the website source code was not created by CompuClaim; the record is undisputed that Empire created the source code. Second, the website source code does not constitute an \"add-on\" under this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   According to CompuClaim, the fact that it paid Empire for the custom programming work is enough to make it an \"[a]dd-on[ ] created by Licensee.\" It asserts, \"The Licensing Agreement does not differentiate between add-ons created by CompuClaim by paying their own employees to code the add-ons, and add-ons created by CompuClaim by paying [Empire] to code the add-ons.\" (ECF No. 166 at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   There is some flexibility as to the specificity required in the written transfer.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ITOFCA, Inc. v.

Nonetheless, the provision is clear that it applies only to add-ons created by CompuClaim. Although CompuClaim tries to evade this caveat by contending that \"created by\" encompasses works CompuClaim paid someone else to create for it, the court rejects this argument as incompatible with a plain reading of the provision. At best the provision is silent as to add-ons created by Empire or third-parties.

Indeed, CompuClaim acknowledges as much when, in opposing Empire's motion, it quotes the above statement from\n   <em>\n    Shaver\n   </em>\n   that \"the existence of a license, exclusive or nonexclusive, creates an affirmative defense to a claim of copyright infringement.\" (ECF No. 196 at 7.) Although CompuClaim has filed three answers over the course of this litigation (ECF Nos. 7, 63, 131), it never alleged the affirmative defense of implied license.

Implied license was not one of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Nonetheless, finding forfeiture would be inappropriate. Although Empire alleges that, because CompuClaim did not raise implied license as an affirmative defense, it has not had a chance to engage in discovery related to whether it had an implied license, it has not explained what specific discovery it would have done. Its vague assertion that it has been deprived of an opportunity to respond to a license defense does not demonstrate that it was prejudiced by CompuClaim's failure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garofalo v.

Because Plaintiff was able to respond, the court will address this defense.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Thus, the court will consider the merits of CompuClaim's license argument. However, the nature of this argument is often unclear, at least insofar as CompuClaim may be alleging that it possesses an express license. CompuClaim opens its brief in support of its motion for summary judgment with this sentence: \"CompuClaim, Inc. is the target of a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\") claim that is unsupported by any evidence or testimony, is the target of multiple claims that were settled and released years ago, and is the target of one copyright claim over a work that it purchased\n   <em>\n    and has both an express and an implied license to use\n   </em>\n   , and two other copyright claims over unprotectable material.\" (ECF No. 166 at 2 (emphasis added).) Later, it asserts, \"Under both the express language in the Licensing Agreement and the standards for an implied license, CompuClaim has a right to all custom programming added onto the ClearingMagic Software.\" (ECF No. 166 at 3.) Similarly, it argues, \"However, if the Court does not find the Settlement Agreement bars EMRS's copyright claim, the undisputed facts show that CompuClaim purchased the custom programming that is the basis for the vast majority of CompuClaim's [sic] copyright claims, and has a license to use the custom programming based on the express language in the Licensing Agreement and the standards for an implied license.\" (ECF No. 166 at 25.) Finally, CompuClaim alleges that \"EMRS provided CompuClaim with and [sic] express and an implied license for the custom programing.\" (ECF No. 166 at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   However, beyond these assertions, CompuClaim never explains why it believes it obtained an express license regarding the custom programming. As quoted above, CompuClaim seems to suggest that its express license emerges from the License Agreement. But it does not develop this argument, leaving the court to speculate as to its basis. If there were an express license with respect to the custom programming, the court would suspect it to be found in the parties' agreement with respect to the CMWebSite source code,\n   which was set forth in a document entitled \"Addendum B,\" \"CompuClaim ClearingMagic/EligibilityMagic Web Integration Project.\" (ECF No. 168-1 at 23.) But, CompuClaim argues (by way of an inappropriate footnote,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540586,6504525\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/879/1509/\">\n    879 F.2d 1509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1513 (7th Cir. 1989) (argument raised in passing in a footnote deemed waived) ) (ECF No. 196 at 10, fn. 4) ), that the agreement governing the website source code (Addendum B) is not part of the License Agreement. If Addendum B, covering the custom website programming, is not part of the License Agreement, it is unclear how the License Agreement would grant CompuClaim an express license as to that custom programming. If CompuClaim's express license argument is simply that the copyright was assigned to it by virtue of the License Agreement, it fails as discussed above. Therefore, the court finds that CompuClaim has failed to demonstrate that it is entitled to summary judgment on the basis that it had an express license with respect to the custom programming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   As to the merits of CompuClaim's implied license argument, Empire's position is that the parties entered into an express license, memorialized in the License Agreement, which \"precludes finding an implied license between the parties.\" (ECF No. 204 at 6.) The court does not agree that the fact that the parties had an express license agreement as to ClearingMagic necessarily forecloses the possibility that Empire gave CompuClaim an implied license to use the CMWebSite source code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   An implied nonexclusive license need not be written.\n   <em>\n    I.A.E.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7632626\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/74/768/#p775\">\n    74 F.3d at 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, a factual dispute exists as to the scope of any implied license given to CompuClaim for the use of the CMWebSite source code, precluding the court from granting summary judgment in CompuClaim's favor with respect to this affirmative defense or in Empire's favor with respect to its copyright infringement claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    3.3 Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As with Empire's copyright claim, CompuClaim argues that Empire's breach of contract claim is barred by the settlement agreement's release because it arises out of events occurring prior to the execution of the settlement agreement. CompuClaim alleges that, although CompuClaim reserved a cause of action for breach of the license agreement, Empire did not. The settlement agreement included a standard integration clause: \"This Agreement shall form the entire agreement among the parties and shall supersede all prior negotiations, representations or agreements, either written or oral, unless expressly incorporated herein.\" (ECF No. 168-8, \u00b6 20.) In light of this provision, CompuClaim argues that the settlement agreement superseded any prior agreement between the parties. As such, Empire released CompuClaim of all claims, including a claim for breach of the License Agreement, arising out of events that occurred prior to April 26, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Empire argues that each failure to perform under the License Agreement (which it contends was not extinguished by the settlement agreement) after the date of the settlement agreement gave rise to a new breach of contract claim. \"Because CompuClaim had a continuing duty to perform its obligations (e.g., paying monthly royalty payments) under the Software License Agreement after the date of the Mutual Release, each failure by CompuClaim to perform its obligations after that date constitutes a new claim as to each separate breach.\" (ECF No. 190 at 14-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Empire acknowledges that the mutual release expressly refers to the License Agreement. (ECF No. 190 at 16.) However, it does so only in the context of CompuClaim's reservation of claims against Empire. (ECF No. 168-8, \u00b6 4.) Thus, at a minimum an ambiguity exists as to whether the License Agreement as a whole survives the release's integration clause or whether only Empire has continuing obligations under the License Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Neither party much develops its argument on this point. But the parties' undisputed post-release conduct supports the view that the parties intended the License Agreement to continue to impose mutual obligations. For example, CompuClaim continued to pay licensing fees to Empire, which is inconsistent with the notion that,\n   by virtue of the settlement agreement, CompuClaim was relieved of its obligations under the License Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Therefore, the court concludes that CompuClaim is not entitled to summary judgment on Empire's breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    3.4 Length of the Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Empire sought summary judgment that Addendum B extended the term of the License Agreement from three to five years. (ECF No. 173 at 19-22.) CompuClaim does not dispute that point. (ECF Nos. 196 at 10; 197, \u00b6 41.) Because there is no dispute of material fact that Addendum B extended the duration of the License Agreement from three to five years, Empire is entitled to summary judgment in its favor on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    3.5 Copyrightable Elements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \"In cases involving computer software, many courts analyze infringement with the 'abstraction-filtration-comparison' [ (AFC) ] approach first described in\n   <em>\n    Computer Associates International, Inc. v.

Sys. of Ill.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481804\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/344/#p349\">\n    585 F.3d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349 (7th Cir. 2009) ), stating merely, \"Rather than reargue the same points raised in its prior brief, CompuClaim simply stands on the arguments in its opening brief.\" (ECF No. 206, fn. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   But CompuClaim never addressed Empire's specific point in its initial brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The court agrees with the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit when it observed that, although the AFC \"test may provide a useful framework for assessing the alleged nonliteral copying of computer code,\" it is of little help and in fact may be misleading when applied to claims of infringement of literal elements.\n   <em>\n    Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416609\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/49/807/#p815\">\n    49 F.3d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 815 (1st Cir. 1995). Consequently, with regard to Empire's claim that CompuClaim infringed the literal elements of Empire's copyrighted work, Empire was not required to support this claim with expert evidence regarding the application of the AFC test. Accordingly, CompuClaim is not entitled to summary judgment regarding this aspect of Empire's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    4. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Aside from Empire's assertion that Addendum B extended the license agreement from three to five years, which CompuClaim concedes, the court finds it must deny the parties' motions for summary judgment. Factual disputes exist as to whether \"EmpireMedical\" in the CMWebsite source code was copyright management information and, if so, whether Berg removed it \"knowing, or ... having reasonable grounds to know, that it will induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement of any right under [Title 17 of the United States Code],\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Therefore, summary judgment in CompuClaim's favor is not appropriate with respect to Empire's DMCA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   CompuClaim has failed to show that Empire released its present copyright or breach of contract claims by virtue of the April 16, 2012 settlement and mutual release. Although the court agrees with Empire that the License Agreement did not transfer to CompuClaim ownership of the copyright in the CMWebSite source code, Empire is not entitled to summary judgment on its copyright claim because there exists a dispute of material fact as to whether CompuClaim's alleged infringement was authorized under an implied license. Nor is CompuClaim entitled to summary judgment on account of Empire's expert having failed to use the abstraction-filtration-comparison test to assess Empire's copyright claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the parties' stipulated motion to dismiss CompuClaim's counterclaims (ECF No. 214) is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   . Accordingly, Empire's motion for summary judgment with respect to CompuClaim's counterclaims is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Empire's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 162) is\n   <strong>\n    granted in part and denied in part\n   </strong>\n   . It is granted as unopposed with respect to the duration of the License Agreement. Addendum B extended the original term of three years to a term of five years. It is denied as to all of Empire's other claims against CompuClaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that CompuClaim's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 165) is\n   <strong>\n    denied.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
