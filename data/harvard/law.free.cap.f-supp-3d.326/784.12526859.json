Wright, United States District Judge\n   This matter is before the Court on Petitioner's motion for the return of seized property and Respondents' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. (Dkts. 10, 29.) As addressed below, Petitioner's motion is denied, Respondents' motion to dismiss is granted, and this case is dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petitioner Sophia Wilansky sustained serious injuries when an object exploded while she was protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota on November 21, 2016. After local doctors concluded that they could not adequately treat Wilansky's injuries, she was flown to Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where she underwent surgery. Surgeons removed a small piece of shrapnel from Wilansky's arm and sent it to HCMC's pathology department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), including Respondent FBI Special Agent Christian Gregory Freichels, arrived at HCMC the next day. The FBI agents sought Wilansky's possessions but did not have a warrant. Wilansky's father offered to permit the FBI to take Wilansky's possessions in exchange for a written agreement to give Wilansky access to the possessions for inspection in the future. After Special Agent Freichels signed an agreement to that effect with Wilansky's father, the FBI took possession of the clothing Wilansky had been wearing when she was injured. At some point thereafter, the FBI also obtained from HCMC the shrapnel that had been surgically removed from Wilansky's arm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Respondent United States of America immediately commenced an investigation into the circumstances pertaining to Wilansky's injury, and a grand jury investigation of the matter began in December 2016. Wilansky's father called the FBI on December 16, 2016, seeking information about when Wilansky could access her property. During this phone call, Respondent FBI Special Agent Brian James Vanoosbree refused to give Wilansky access to the property recovered from her during the investigation. In a letter dated January 20, 2017, Wilansky's father requested that the FBI either return Wilansky's property or permit an independent forensic scientist to conduct an analysis of the items. The FBI did not respond to this letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Approximately one month later, Wilansky's father called Respondent Gary Lee Delorme, an Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) for the District of North Dakota. AUSA Delorme told Wilansky's father that the United States intended to honor its agreement to return Wilansky's property to her. However, because the United States had not completed its investigation, the property would not be returned at that time. Wilansky's father called AUSA Delorme several times between April 2017 and September 2017, and during each conversation AUSA Delorme\n   stated that the United States had not yet completed its investigation. The United States remains in possession of Wilansky's clothing and the shrapnel removed from her arm. To date, criminal charges have not been brought in connection with Wilansky's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Wilansky commenced this action on February 2, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count 1 alleges, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g), that the United States has unlawfully deprived Wilansky of the seized clothing and shrapnel (collectively, \"the seized property\"). Count 2 alleges that Respondents deprived Wilansky of the seized property without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Count 3 alleges that Respondents continue to retain the seized property without a reasonable justification, in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The complaint seeks an order either requiring the United States to return the seized property to Wilansky or imposing conditions on the United States during its continued possession and use of the seized property. Wilansky subsequently filed the pending motion for the return of the seized property, and Respondents filed the pending motion to dismiss Wilansky's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Callous Disregard of the Fourth Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It is undisputed that Wilansky's father consented to the initial seizure of Wilansky's clothing and that the United States obtained the shrapnel through a grand jury subpoena. For this reason, Wilansky does not argue that the United States violated the Fourth Amendment when it initially took possession of the seized property.

Although the United States has held the seized property for a length of time considerably longer than the circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Black Hills Institute\n   </em>\n   , and comparable to the length of time in\n   <em>\n    Mr. Lucky\n   </em>\n   , both cases are distinguishable.

In support of this justification, the United States relies on the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   declaration of an FBI special agent, which describes the ongoing criminal investigation, including testing that has been performed on the seized property during the period in which the United States has possessed the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, it is undisputed that the United States obtained the seized clothing through written consent. Although the parties now dispute the scope of that consent, nothing in the written consent imposes a limitation on the length of time during which the United States may retain possession of the clothing. For these reasons,\n   <em>\n    Black Hills Institute\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mr. Lucky\n   </em>\n   are readily distinguishable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because Wilansky has not demonstrated that the United States has acted in callous disregard of her Fourth Amendment rights, this factor weighs against exercising equitable jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Wilansky advances three arguments as to the irreparable harm she will suffer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   First, Wilansky argues that forensic analysis of the seized property might provide valuable evidence to support her legal claims should she seek financial compensation for her injuries. Some of those legal claims have a two-year statute of limitations, Wilansky contends. But she neither specifies the nature of those legal claims nor provides any evidence or argument as to why she is unable to commence a timely civil action without first obtaining access to or possession of the seized property. Wilansky has not demonstrated irreparable harm on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Second, Wilansky contends that there is a risk that the seized property will degrade over time. In support of this argument, Wilansky relies on\n   <em>\n    Black Hills Institute\n   </em>\n   . But in\n   <em>\n    Black Hills Institute\n   </em>\n   , the appellants submitted affidavits to the district court and to the Eighth Circuit from experts who attested that \"the government's storage of [a seized] fossil in a machine shop ... is causing irreparable damage to the specimen.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519819\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/1237/#p1239\">\n    967 F.2d at 1239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Wilansky's unsupported speculation is insufficient to demonstrate irreparable harm on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Third, Wilansky asserts that she has an interest in accessing the seized property \"to vindicate herself in the public eye\" and to \"clear[ ] her name in the face of damaging public accusations.\" This argument appears to suggest that the threat of future criminal prosecution of her might cause irreparable harm to her public reputation. But the potential stigma of future criminal charges based on seized evidence\n   does not establish that irreparable harm will result if the seized evidence is not returned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    4801 Fyler Ave.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532732\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/879/385/#p389\">\n    879 F.2d at 388-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that \"the possible stigmatization of defending oneself in a criminal trial is an insufficient harm to justify the district court's use of its equitable powers\"). Wilansky has not demonstrated irreparable harm on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because Wilansky has not demonstrated that she will be irreparably harmed if she does not obtain access to or possession of the seized property, this factor weighs against exercising equitable jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Adequate Remedy at Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Wilansky argues that she lacks an adequate remedy at law because, if this Court does not exercise jurisdiction, she will have no opportunity to contest the United States' continued possession of the seized property. The Eighth Circuit has recognized that, in most situations, the remedy of a post-indictment motion to suppress is an adequate remedy.\n   <em>\n    Pieper v.

This legal remedy remains available for Wilansky to pursue if the United States were to criminally charge her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Wilansky nonetheless asserts that, if she \"does not recover the clothing and shrapnel in time to analyze them and use those analyses in her legal case against the perpetrators of her injury, she will have no remedy at law for whatever harm she suffers as a result of this loss of evidence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, as addressed above, Wilansky fails to explain why she is unable to commence a civil action against those responsible for her injury before she obtains access to or possession of the seized property. Moreover, if Wilansky commences a civil action, this will not foreclose legal mechanisms available to her, such as seeking access to the seized property through discovery or requesting a stay, if necessary, to permit the United States to complete its investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although these alternatives may not produce the immediate results she prefers, Wilansky cites no legal authority, nor is the Court aware of any, that supports the proposition that an adequate remedy at law must be immediately available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because Wilansky has not established that she lacks an adequate remedy at law, this factor weighs against exercising equitable jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Individual Interest and Need\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   When determining whether to exercise equitable jurisdiction over a claim for the return of seized property, a fourth factor that courts may consider is \"whether the party seeking return has an individual interest in and need for the property ....\"\n   <em>\n    Black Hills Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519819\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/1237/#p1239\">\n    967 F.2d at 1240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Wilansky asserts that she has an individual interest in and need for the seized property because it is evidence to support her future legal claims. The response of the United States suggests that Wilansky\n   must have an ownership or possessory interest to establish an individual interest or need. The United States maintains that Wilansky has an ownership interest in the clothing but not in the shrapnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The United States cites no legal authority in support of its position that one must have an ownership or possessory interest to establish an individual interest in and need for the seized property. In fact, the Eighth Circuit concluded in\n   <em>\n    Black Hills Institute\n   </em>\n   that the appellants-a geological research institute and a museum foundation seeking the return of dinosaur bones-\"clearly have an interest in preserving the fossil and studying it.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519819\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/1237/#p1239\">\n    967 F.2d at 1240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court reached this conclusion while also observing that \"[t]he ownership of these bones is not before this court\" and \"[l]itigation is ongoing as to the rightful owner of\" the bones.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519819\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/1237/#p1239\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1238 &amp; n.1. Similarly, whether Wilansky owns the seized property at issue here is not dispositive of this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Courts have recognized that the individual interest and need factor may not be satisfied if the seized property is \"contraband to which the movant was not legally entitled, or property for which the movant had no noteworthy need, such as bet slips or wager tickets.\"\n   <em>\n    Mr. Lucky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"836884\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/587/15/#p17\">\n    587 F.2d at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases). Notably, the United States does not argue here, nor does the record suggest, that any of the seized property is contraband. It also appears that Wilansky has demonstrated a legitimate need for the seized property-namely, for determining the cause of her injury and seeking redress for that injury. Because Wilansky has demonstrated that she has an individual interest in and need for the seized property, this factor weighs in favor of exercising equitable jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In summary, three of four relevant factors weigh against exercising equitable jurisdiction. In light of the caution and restraint with which a district court must exercise equitable jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Black Hills Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519819\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/1237/#p1239\">\n    967 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1239 ;\n   <em>\n    4801 Fyler Ave.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532732\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/879/385/#p389\">\n    879 F.2d at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Wilansky has not demonstrated that this Court should exercise equitable jurisdiction in this case. Accordingly, Respondents' motion to dismiss Count 1 of the complaint is granted. Count 1 is dismissed without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Constitutional Claims (Counts 2 and 3)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Respondents also move to dismiss Count 2 of Wilansky's complaint, which alleges that Respondents violated her Fifth Amendment right to due process, and Count 3 of Wilansky's complaint, which alleges that Respondents violated her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures. Respondents' argument is twofold: first, that the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over Wilansky's constitutional claims; and second, that Wilansky fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Wilansky's complaint fails to allege or establish either that Congress has waived sovereign immunity or that this Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over her constitutional claims. Wilansky also has not responded to any aspect of Respondents' motion to dismiss her constitutional claims. Based on the record before the Court, Counts 2 and 3 of Wilansky's complaint are dismissed without prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
