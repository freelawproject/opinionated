She asserts that defendant CMS's standard collection complaint falsely states the requirements of Nebraska County Court, misleads an unsophisticated consumer in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e and is unconscionable in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Briefly, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants' violated the FDCPA and NCPA in their standard complaints by characterizing their cause of action as one for providing goods and/or services in order to claim prejudgment interest and attorney fees under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-1801\">\n    Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 25-1801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , rather than as a cause of action on an account, which does not allow for the collection of prejudgment interest or attorney fees. She contends the defendants choose to ignore the fact that when these \"accounts\" are assigned to a collection agency, the claim is no longer based on goods or services provided, but is an ordinary account in default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff seeks summary judgment on the issue of liability-she seeks a determination that the defendants' collection complaints are false and misleading as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The dispositive question is whether the standard form complaint at issue contains false or misleading representations and whether collection of additional sums for prejudgment interest and attorney fees in a state court action is permitted by law. She relies on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Powers v. Credit Mgmt.

The court finds the least sophisticated consumer would be reasonably confused by the interchangeable use of the terms \"demand for payment\" and \"claim\" in connection with the \"presentment,\" as well as by the cursory reference to \"assigned account(s),\" without any mention of the nature of the goods or services provided or the dates on which they were provided. Without any special knowledge of the law, a layperson could not figure out, on the face of the collection complaint, what the claim was for or to whom he or she was indebted, much less comprehend his or her alleged liability for prejudgment interest, costs, or attorney's fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Powers,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20612251\">\n    2016 WL 612251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *14. (Emphasis added). Further, this court stated in Powers that \"[m]isrepresenting the nature of a debtor's debts as debts for materials or services rendered, rather than actions on accounts, in order to deceive state courts and debtors and collect impermissible fees and prejudgment interest is a violation of the FDCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20612251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (also stating that \"[t]he plaintiffs have shown they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of liability for FDCPA and NCPA violations in connection with allegations of entitlement to attorney's fees and prejudgment interest in CMS's standard-form complaints.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants oppose the plaintiff's motion and move for summary judgment in their favor.

They argue the amended statute is retroactive, is applicable to this case and dispositive of the issues. They question the plaintiff's reliance on \"the prior nonbinding (and distinguishable decision in\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   .\" Based on recent Eighth Circuit and District Court caselaw\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the amendments to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-1801\">\n    Neb. Rev.

FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The record shows Mrs. Bassett is a \"consumer\" as that term is contemplated in \u00a7 1692a(3) of the FDCPA. Credit Management Services, Inc., (hereafter \"CMS\") is a collection agency located in Grand Island, Nebraska. CMS is a \"debt collector\" within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). Defendant Jason Morledge is president of CMS. Defendant Jason Morledge operates and manages the day-to-day business of CMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On or about April 8, 2016, CMS sued James M. Bassett (now deceased) and plaintiff Kelly M. Bassett in the County Court of Dodge County, Nebraska for alleged medical debts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Credit Management Services, Inc. v. James Bassett &amp; Kelly Bassett\n   </em>\n   , Case No. CI 16-534. At the time CMS sued the Bassetts, its policy and practice was to file collection lawsuits in Nebraska County Courts and to serve alleged debtors with county court collection complaints in the form of Exhibit A attached to the plaintiff's complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 1-1, Ex. A, Complaint at 1-2. Exhibit A is a standard template with only the consumer specific information on names and amounts changed in each case. Defendant CMS used this standard form template complaint when suing Nebraska residents in Nebraska County Courts from March of 2016 through June/July of 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Kelly Bassett's alleged debts were incurred for personal, family, or household purposes, i.e., medical bills. In Dodge County Court, CMS sought and obtained an award of attorney fees and prejudgment interest under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-1801\">\n    Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 25-1801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . CMS was represented by in-house counsel in the action. The Bassetts were not represented by counsel. County Court collection pleadings are attached as Exhibit A to Plaintiff's Complaint herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During the period of time at issue in this action, CMS's standard form county court complaints stated the alleged debt arose from goods, services and/or labor provided. The CMS collection complaint sets forth a monetary amount as the \"the reasonable value or agreed amount of [the] services.\" Filing No. 1-1, Ex. A, Complaint at 1. The defendants use\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-1801\">\n    Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 25-1801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to demand payment of attorney fees and prejudgment interest in collecting these county court cases. Defendant CMS's routine practice was not to include any account number for the alleged services in the complaints. Also, it was CMS's routine practice not to identify the person who received the services or the date the alleged services were provided. Further, the subject complaints do not state a specific date when the demand required under the statute was sent to consumers, but states only \"on or before\" a date ninety days prior to the filing of the complaint in County Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   CMS used this standard form complaint in 3,800 Nebraska law suits against between 4,000 and 6,000 Nebraska residents because during the time frame at issue. In\n   each of those cases, the defendants' cause of action or theory of recovery was\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit.\n   </em>\n   CMS no longer uses the complaint in the form of Exhibit A to file lawsuits in Nebraska.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The debts on which CMS collects are assigned to it. Only claims on the alleged past due accounts are assigned. CMS is the named plaintiff in the Dodge County Court collection case filed against the plaintiff and her decedent. The record contains assignments from both creditor healthcare providers for the Bassetts' debts to CMS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Filing Nos. 54-4, and 54-6. On January 5, 2016, Fremont Area Medical Center executed an assignment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIM\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The undersigned executes this assignment on behalf of FREMONT AREA MEDICAL CENTER, (hereinafter \"Creditor\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The undersigned hereby states that she/he is authorized to execute this Assignment on behalf of the creditor and does hereby, on behalf of such Creditor, for valuable consideration, assign all of the Creditor's right, title, and interest in and to the following claim, to Credit Management Services, Inc., (Assignee) and vests in the Assignee the entire legal title of said claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   1.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 25-1801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to the original creditors. The money is deposited into the CMS general account and is not specifically directed to pay in-house counsel. CMS also expends substantial amounts on salaries, benefits, overhead and other expenses of its own attorneys employed in-house, as well as payments it makes to outside counsel who represent CMS from time to time in collection actions. CMS's general policy was to apply consumers' funds to post judgment costs, interest and attorney fees before the principal and before sending a payment to the original creditor for its share. As was its routine practice, CMS applied all the payments collected from Mrs. Bassett to statutory attorney fees and prejudgment interest first before paying the creditor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The record shows defendant Jason Morledge is the President of CMS. The plaintiff alleges he created, designed, directed, and supervised the practices of CMS and its in-house attorneys in requesting an award of attorney fees pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-1801\">\n    Neb.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The court first finds that the amended statute is not applicable to this action. The statute, as amended, has no application to the collection practices challenged in this action, which predate the 2018 statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. Accelerated Receivables Sols. (A.R.S.), Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:17CV56,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201954249\">\n    2018 WL 1954249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 n.2 (D. Neb. Apr. 19, 2018). The court rejects the defendants argument that the recent amendments to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-1801\">\n    Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 25-1801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   are a mere clarification of the law as it already existed at the time of the incidents that give rise to the plaintiff's complaint. First, the legislation does not state that it is retroactive. The court finds the 2018 amendments to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-1801\">\n    Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 25-1801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   are substantive. The amendments to the legislation work a substantive change in the law in that it expands the statute's coverage from certain specified causes of action to \"any action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the amendments create a right to prejudgment interest dating from the date the debt was incurred, and permit prejudgment interest on unliquidated claims, substantively expanding the entitlement to both attorney fees and interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (formerly, the statute allowed interest from the date of \"presentment\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   of the claim to the debtor and interest on written contracts was limited to liquidated claims). The changes expand the scope of the statute, creating new rights to recovery of prejudgment interest by creditors and imposing new obligations on debtors. The amendments were designed to, and did, alter the statute. In captioning and referring to the law, the Nebraska legislature expressly called it a \"change\" to the law. Review of the Judiciary Committee's and the Nebraska Legislature's debate on the legislation shows legislators discussed the ways the amendments would change the law, despite the bill's proponents characterization of the language as merely clarifying the statute. Accordingly, the court will apply the law and supporting authority in effect at the time the collection complaints at issue were filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Based on that authority, the court finds the defendants have not shown that they are entitled to a summary judgment of dismissal. The defendant argues points rejected by this court in\n   <em>\n    Powers,\n   </em>\n   in an apparent attempt to essentially \"undo\" that opinion. The means to challenge this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   would have been an appeal. They base other arguments on authority that is not applicable to this action and on supposed community standards and practices in Nebraska County Courts that are not relevant to the FDCPA determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants have not shown they are entitled to summary judgment and their motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The issue in this litigation is whether the standard collection complaint that the defendants used from March 2016 to June/July of 2016 is misleading or confusing as a matter of law in violation of the FDCPA and/or the NCPA. The gravamen of the plaintiff's complaint is that the defendant's characterization of its cause of action as one for goods and services rather than an action on an account is misleading and deceptive. That issue was squarely addressed and resolved against defendant CMS in the\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Powers,\n   </em>\n   No. 8:11CV436,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20612251\">\n    2016 WL 612251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10. CMS did not appeal this court's finding in\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   and is bound by this court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Recent Nebraska District Court findings to the contrary are not binding on this court and are of no consequence with respect to these defendants. The record shows that the standard collection complaints in the present case do not cure the infirmities noted in\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   and defendant CMS continued to violate the FDCPA in the complaint filed against the plaintiff in County Court and others like it. The court finds the plaintiff is entitled to a summary judgment of liability on her claim that the CMS standard form complaint at issue violates the FDCPA in that the characterization\n   of the cause of action is misleading, as is the defendants' failure to state the date of the services rendered or to identify the patient to whom such services were rendered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The record shows that CMS acknowledges it keeps all attorney fees and prejudgment interest it collects. Whether that practice amounts to imposition of an undisclosed collection fee was not addressed in the\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   case and remains an issue for resolution in the present case. Similarly, whether or not in-house counsel can collect attorney fees remains an issue. Also, the court makes no determination with respect to whether defendant Jason Morledge can be held liable as a \"debt collector\" within the meaning of the FDCPA under the theory of personal involvement in the conduct or by piercing corporate veil.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:11CV436,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20612251\">\n    2016 WL 612251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (involving individual defendants Micheal Morledge and Brady Keith).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   1.
