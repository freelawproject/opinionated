LAWSON, United States District Judge\n   Petitioner John Henry Ray is serving a life sentence for first-degree murder. He alleged in his habeas corpus petition, among many other things, that his Sixth Amendment rights were abridged when his lawyer was excluded from a critical stage of his state prosecution. His habeas corpus case returns to this Court following a remand by the court of appeals to consider two main issues: \"(1) whether there was an adjudication on the merits as to Ray's [\n   <em>\n    United States v.\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   [,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/\">\n    466 U.S. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) ] claim, and (2) whether Ray is entitled to relief [on that claim] under the appropriate standard of review.\"\n   <em>\n    Ray v.

The court also vacated and remanded for reconsideration this Court's decision denying relief on Ray's claim that his appellate attorney did not provide constitutionally adequate representation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=655%20Fed.%20Appx.%20301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=655%20Fed.%20Appx.%20301\">\n    at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While those questions were under consideration, the petitioner filed a motion for relief from judgment concerning his claim under\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), based on a newly disclosed unsealed transcript of the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   conference between the state trial judge and the prosecutor, which did not include defense counsel, and in which it was revealed that one of the State's principal witnesses against the petitioner had been employed by the police as a paid confidential informant, before and after the murders of which the petitioner was convicted. The state attorney general has not responded to that motion. The parties presented supplemental briefs, and the Court heard oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   With the perspective furnished by the court of appeals, and the revelations from the unsealed state transcript (which the attorney general failed to file with the initial batch of Rule 5 materials), it is apparent that the petitioner raised his\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   claim at an appropriate time in the state court, but the court evidently misunderstood the argument, and therefore never addressed it on the merits. This Court, therefore, must give it fresh review, and not apply the highly deferential standard prescribed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   conference was a critical stage of the state criminal proceedings. The petitioner's attorney was not allowed to attend. His appellate attorney's failure to raise that issue on direct appeal amounted to deficient performance, which prejudiced the petitioner. And the information revealed at that conference was exculpatory and material to the defense. The state prosecutor's failure to disclose that information violated clearly established constitutional requirements under Supreme Court jurisprudence, and that lapse undermines confidence in the outcome of the case. These flaws entitle Ray to a new trial, and, failing that, to release from state custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties are familiar with the facts, but they are repeated here as summarized in earlier opinions. John Henry Ray was convicted along with two codefendants, Juanita Michelle-Elam and Jairus Andrae Perkins, following a jury trial in the Wayne County, Michigan circuit court. Ray was convicted of two counts of second-degree murder, two counts of first-degree felony murder, one count of killing an unborn child, two counts of assault with intent\n   to do great bodily harm less than murder, two counts of armed robbery, one count of first-degree home invasion, one count of felon in possession of a firearm, and one count of possession of a firearm while committing a felony. He was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for the first-degree murder convictions and lesser prison terms for the other convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts of the case were summarized briefly by the Michigan Court of Appeals on the three defendants' joint direct appeal as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Perkins, aged twenty-one, his girlfriend, defendant Elam, aged twenty-eight, and defendant Ray, aged thirty-eight, were involved in the killing of a man, Deshone Douglas Moore, aged twenty-eight, and a pregnant woman, Amanda Zarbaugh, aged twenty, and her unborn child, during the course of an armed robbery at Zarbaugh's residence in Romulus, Michigan in July 2004. Defendant Elam was already in the house with the two victims when defendants Perkins and Ray arrived with guns. Defendant Perkins and Ray encountered Christopher Straughter and Ebonie Booker exiting the house when they arrived. Defendant Perkins ran into the house just prior to fatal shots being heard, and defendant Ray stayed outside and held the witnesses at gunpoint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    People v. Ray\n   </em>\n   , No. 260161,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201330320\">\n    2006 WL 1330320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Mich. Ct. App. May 16, 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Sixth Circuit added details, which were excerpted from the state trial court's opinion denying the petitioner's post-conviction motion for relief from judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   This case arises from the planned armed robbery of Christopher Straughter by Juanita Elam, her boyfriend Jarius Perkins and friend John Ray. Straughter was a robbery target because the defendants believed he was a dope dealer who carried large sums of cash.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant Ray (twenty one years old) and two co-defendants Elam (twenty eight) and Perkins (thirty eight) went to Amanda Zarbaugh's house to rob Straughter. Zarbaugh was pregnant with an unborn child and was in the house with Deshone D. Moore.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Elam knew both Straughter and Zarbaugh. Elam went to Zarbaugh's alone. Elam enticed Straughter via phone to come to Zarbaugh's house under the guise that she wanted to buy drugs and to talk business with him. Elam became insistent that Straughter come to Zarbaugh's house. She said she would remain there until Straughter arrived.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Elam then called Perkins' cell phone. The inference from that call is that Elam alerted Perkins and Ray to come to the house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Straughter came to the house and entered with Ebonie Booker. They spoke with Elam. Elam also spoke with Moore, who was in the house with Zarbaugh. Straughter and Booker headed out the front door. They encountered Perkins and Ray, who were waiting outside the house with guns. Perkins and Ray rushed Straughter and Booker with drawn handguns. Perkins and Ray robbed Straughter and Booker at gunpoint and forced them to the ground.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Ray stood over Straughter and Booker at gunpoint outside the house while Perkins went into the house. Elam, Zarbaugh and Moore were still inside the house. Shots were fired. Perkins and Elam came out of the house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Zarbaugh and Moore were discovered executed, as was Zarbaugh's unborn child. Cash was also taken.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Straughter and Booker were threatened as they lay on the ground. They overheard\n   discussions about killing them. They got up and ran. Straughter and Booker were shot at, but the guns did not discharge because they were either empty or jammed. Straughter and Booker continued to run from the scene. All three perpetrators, Elam, Ray and Perkins, fled the scene in Perkins' silver Explorer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Ray v. Maclaren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=655%20Fed.%20Appx.%20301\">\n    655 Fed.Appx. 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 303 (6th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ray's defense at trial centered on Straughter's credibility. Ray's attorney pointed out that Straughter had made several inconsistent statements about the incident. Defense counsel acknowledged that Ray was present at the house, but he asserted that Ray never possessed a firearm, there were no shots fired outside the house, and Ray had nothing to do with the robbery or the killings. He argued that Straughter's version was not worthy of belief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The jury was unconvinced. The petitioner's convictions were affirmed on direct appeal (although his convictions for second-degree murder were vacated, as duplicative of the first-degree murder convictions),\n   <em>\n    People v. Ray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201330320\">\n    2006 WL 1330320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the state supreme court denied leave to appeal,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=477%20Mich.%20941\">\n    477 Mich. 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=723%20N.W.2d%20824\">\n    723 N.W.2d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) (Table). The petitioner then filed a post-conviction motion for relief from judgment under Michigan Court Rule 6.500,\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   , which was denied by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    People v.

On July 9, 2014, the Court issued an opinion denying the petition, after finding that all of the claims were without merit. However, the Court issued a certificate of appealability as to the seventeenth ground for relief, in which the question raised was \"[w]hether the prisoner was deprived of counsel at a critical stage due to\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications between the trial court and prosecutor.\" The Sixth Circuit expanded the certificate of appealability to include a claim that the petitioner's appellate counsel was ineffective by failing to raise the\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   issue on direct appeal. The court of appeals concluded that \"the district court committed reversible error [by] failing to determine whether Ray's\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   claim was adjudicated on the merits before applying AEDPA deference to the state court decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=655%20Fed.%20Appx.%20301\">\n    655 Fed.Appx. at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court of appeals noted that, because the resolution of the ineffective assistance claim would depend on resolution of the\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   claim, it did not reach the merits of the ineffective assistance claim, and it also included that claim within the scope of the remand.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=655%20Fed.%20Appx.%20301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=655%20Fed.%20Appx.%20301\">\n    at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e also vacate the district court's denial of habeas relief on Ray's ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim, and remand to the district court to consider the claim in light of its resolution of Ray's\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   claim on remand.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After the case was remanded, and after the parties filed supplemental briefs on the issues noted above, the state trial court granted a motion by the Wayne County prosecutor to unseal the transcript of the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   conference between the state court trial judge and the prosecutor. Subsequently, based on information revealed in that transcript, Ray filed a motion for relief from judgment as to the denial of his thirteenth claim, in which the question\n   raised was \"[w]hether the prosecutor committed misconduct by withholding exculpatory evidence.\" The State did not file any response to that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The State raised certain procedural defenses in its answer to the petition. This Court found no need to address them, because they did not impose a jurisdictional bar and at the time no merit was found in any of the petitioner's eighteen claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ray v. Perry\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-11100,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203555968\">\n    2014 WL 3555968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (E.D. Mich. July 9, 2014). The State never challenged that approach on appeal, and never re-asserted those procedural defenses as grounds for affirming this Court's original decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ray v.

The statute includes several events that trigger the commencement of the one-year period, but the relevant starting time here is the date Ray's state convictions became final \"by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A).

The trial judge dismissed the motion without prejudice on June 19, 2007, but then reinstated the petitioner's motion for relief from judgment on February 12, 2008. The State contends that the limitations period was not tolled for the 237 days that elapsed between the dismissal and the reinstatement. Under that view, 261 days had elapsed on the one-year limitations period. According to the State, the petitioner had 104 days remaining after the Michigan Supreme Court denied his post-conviction appeal on September 9, 2010, to file his habeas petition, which calculates to December 23, 2010. The State insists that the March 14, 2011 filing came too late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It appears, however, that the post-conviction motion was \"dismissed\" so that the trial judge could appoint counsel for Ray, and that after a lawyer was appointed, the original motion was reinstated and supplemented. The question presented here is whether the original post-conviction motion remained \"pending\" during that interim. The Supreme Court has explained that \"an application is pending as\n   long as the ordinary state collateral review process is in continuance-i.e., until the completion of that process.\"\n   <em>\n    Carey v.

Ray raised his critical stage claim in his state habeas petition and a supplemental motion. Specifically, Ray argued in his Supplemental Motion for Relief that his \"defense was irretrievably lost by the trial court's failure to allow defense counsel's presence at the in-camera review, as well as the denial of the request for review of the record, as was requested by trial counsel.... A[nd] that period, moment, and event in the course of his criminal proceeding was a 'CRITICAL STAGE.' \" The Wayne County Circuit Court characterized this claim as follows: \"The court erred in failure to provide Straughter's relation with Romulus Police as an informant as revealed in an in-camera proceeding (raised in defendant's\n   <em>\n    pro per\n   </em>\n   supplemental motion, Oct. 16, 2008).\" It then denied Ray's claim without any discussion of\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Amendment, or critical stage jurisprudence. Instead, the state court rejected Ray's argument based on its conclusion that, as a matter of state evidentiary law, Straughter's relationship with the police was irrelevant. Relevance, however, is not the proper inquiry for a constitutional claim under\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   ; as mentioned above, the\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   analysis turns on whether an individual was denied counsel during a critical stage of trial. The state court's analysis of Ray's\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   claim, therefore, strongly suggests that the claim \"was inadvertently overlooked in state court.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

He did, however, raise a related\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim: in his Pro Per Supplemental Brief, Ray argued that the prosecution improperly withheld exculpatory impeachment evidence when it failed to disclose information about Straughter's relationship with the Romulus Police Department-information, Ray wrote, that the trial court had reviewed\n   <em>\n    in camera.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   The Michigan Court of Appeals-in paragraph B, on page *13 of its 2006 opinion-rejected this\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim.\n   <em>\n    Perkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201330320\">\n    2006 WL 1330320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13.

In the previous opinion, this Court denied relief on the\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   claim because there was no clearly established federal law holding that an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   conference, where defense counsel was excluded, constituted a critical stage of the proceedings. Relief could not be granted under AEDPA's rigid standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Now, however, the landscape has changed, not only because AEDPA's deferential review no longer applies to this issue, but also-and perhaps more importantly-because the substance of the secret conference has become known. In\n   light of that new information, Ray is entitled to a new trial under the rule of\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   , regardless of which standard of review applies. Under any of the formulations adopted by the Supreme Court to characterize a \"critical stage\" of the proceedings, this hearing certainly qualified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The State's main witness against Ray was Christopher Straughter. He put Ray at the scene and testified to the elements of the assault and robbery charges. Defense counsel challenged Straughter's credibility by attempting to show, among other things, that Ray had a relationship with the Romulus police department, the agency that investigated the murders. He was tipped off to that possibility by a note found in the discovery materials, written by a Romulus police detective, that read, \"Straughter continues to call [the detective] for money.\" Defense counsel's effort to follow that lead through a discovery demand is what prompted the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing. As noted, defense counsel was not allowed to participate in that hearing, and afterward the trial judge announced on the record that there was \"no relevant relation between this case and Mr. Christopher Straughter and the Romulus Police Department.\" Not satisfied with that ruling, defense counsel moved to exclude Straughter's testimony if the transcript of the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing were not disclosed to him. And bereft of concrete proof of Straughter's relationship with the police, defense counsel was left with the weaker argument that Straughter was lying about Ray's involvement to hide his association with the robbed drug house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   After the case was remanded to this Court, the transcript of the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing was unsealed by the trial court, upon the motion of the Wayne County prosecutor, and the State filed a copy of it as part of the supplemental Rule 5 materials. During that hearing, the following colloquy occurred between the state court trial judge and the prosecutor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   PROSECUTOR: .... The record should reflect that at the People's request the courtroom has been cleared and only present is the court staff, the [trial judge] and Detectives [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] Sergeant Mike Smith and Detective Mike St. Andre, both officers in charge of this case. Judge, the issue in discovery that was raised on behalf of counsel related to any relationship that complaining witness [Christopher Straughter] had with the Romulus Police Department. In following up with that inquiry it has come to my attention that Chris Straughter has in fact been used as a confidential informant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   THE COURT: In the past?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   PROSECUTOR: Yes, in the past.... Prior uses of him as a CI date back as early as August of '03. This date of offense for which he is a complaining witness [was] July 18th of '04.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. And then the defense has a motion to determine what the relationship with the police department was.... You're saying he was used as a confidential informant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   PROSECUTOR: In the days that [preceded] this shooting and at least twice since the day of the shooting....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. And what [the police log presented to the court shows is] a summary of things that [Straughter] has done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   PROSECUTOR: Correct, Judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   THE COURT: And consideration he's received.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   PROSECUTOR: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Hr'g Tr. at 4-7 (Nov. 5, 2004) (Pg ID 3015-18). The police detective who handled Straughter testified that Straughter was\n   used to conduct undercover drug buys on four occasions before the shooting and two dates after the shooting, but he asserted that the drug buys in question were \"totally unrelated\" to any of the defendants at Ray's trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9 (Pg ID 3020-21). The prosecutor also represented to the trial court that \"based on my information and belief none of [these CI contacts] involve any of these three defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (Pg ID 3024). The trial court ordered the transcript of the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing to be sealed,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (Pg ID 3027), and it is undisputed that the substance of the discussion on the record never was disclosed to Ray or any of his attorneys until the transcript recently was unsealed, upon the motion of the prosecutor, and filed in this Court as part of the supplemental Rule 5 materials after the case was remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   What was the impact of defense counsel's absence from that hearing? Critically, Ray's attorney was given no opportunity to contest the basis of the trial court's ruling that the exculpatory impeaching evidence of Straughter's employment as a paid informant should not be disclosed. The value of that information to Ray's defense was substantial. (More on that later.) But the loss of a chance even to make an argument for disclosure cut off that line of impeachment before it got started. This was, by any reasonable reading of the clear Supreme Court holdings on point, a proceeding in which an available avenue of defense was lost, the presence of counsel for the defendant was necessary to assure a meaningful defense, substantial prejudice to the defendant's rights inhered in the particular confrontation, and the presence of counsel would have helped to avoid the resulting prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   This Court's earlier denial of relief on this claim was made without the benefit of any information about what happened at the hearing, and in the face of the State's categorical (and categorically false) assertion in its response to the petition that \"[t]here is no indication that the prosecutor withheld anything, let alone that it was exculpatory.\" Resp. to Petition [dkt. # 7] at 62 (Pg ID 2403). The revelation that Straughter in fact was a paid confidential informant, who assisted police on at least six occasions-four before and two after the alleged crimes-puts this claim on a whole new footing. It is true that the Supreme Court never categorically has held that just any\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   contact between the court and prosecution is\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   a critical stage of the proceedings. But the conference here was far more than that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Moreover, if the Court considers this claim\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , then the case stands in an entirely different posture in the shadow of\n   <em>\n    United States v. Minsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11302678\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/963/870/\">\n    963 F.2d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 1992), where the Sixth Circuit, on remarkably similar facts, held as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Although there are circumstances where an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communication might be overlooked, the burden of proving lack of prejudice is on the government, and it is a heavy one. The\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   conference in the instant case occurred at a time when the defense was arguing that the FBI 302s were subject to disclosure under the Jencks Act and\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   . The release of this material would have allowed the defense to undermine the credibility of Brown, a key government witness. The government has proffered no explanation why the defense was denied an opportunity to participate in a conference at such a critical stage of the proceedings. We refuse to condone conduct that undermines confidence in the impartiality of the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   We hold that the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   sidebar conference violated Minsky's right to a fair trial and was a Sixth Amendment violation. Although this violation is sufficient alone to require the granting of a new\n   trial, in view of the related\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and Jencks Act claims, we shall address them as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Minsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11302678\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/963/870/\">\n    963 F.2d at 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Minsky\n   </em>\n   was a decision on direct review; it did not compel a ruling for the petitioner when AEDPA's deferential review standard applied. However, under a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review,\n   <em>\n    Minsky\n   </em>\n   is no longer merely persuasive or suggestive of an appropriate rule of law; it is controlling circuit precedent that is binding on this Court. Absent the strictures of deferential review, Ray's claim for relief on this ground is undeniable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, this case is sharply distinguishable from cases where an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   evaluation of government witnesses has been found not to be a critical stage, where counsel, although excluded from the hearing, was allowed ample opportunity to influence and contest the outcome.

Also, Johnson's counsel forcefully objected to the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   proceeding and was obviously knowledgeable about the nature of the proceeding. There is no suggestion in the record that she was not useful in helping Johnson understand what was going on. And the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearings involved a preliminary evidentiary question, not the merits of the charges. In these circumstances, neither Johnson's right to counsel nor his right to due process was violated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Fed.%20Appx.%20628\">\n    65 Fed.Appx. at 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He did not raise any issue about the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   proceeding, even though the trial record demonstrated trial counsel's robust and frequent objections to being cut off from that information.

The\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing earned no more that a three-line reference in the appellate brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The State argues that the omitted\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   issue was not obvious, inasmuch as counsel for the two codefendants apparently missed the issue as well. Certainly, that issue was not advanced by any of the defendants' attorneys on direct appeal. But Ray was not similarly situated with the other defendants. He never entered the house, either before or after the shots were filed. Defendant Elam was inside from the beginning, and Perkins entered the house right before the shots rang out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Straughter's identification of Ray, and his description of Ray's activity, would have been much more vulnerable to a credibility attack. And Straughter's relationship with the Romulus police was more significant to that line of defense. There was no secret that the trial judge held a hearing to address trial counsel's discovery request, or that trial counsel was excluded from that hearing. Curiosity alone, it seems, would propel the average lawyer to learn what happened at that hearing-perhaps by moving to unseal the record-and, failing that, to raise the issue on appeal. Second guessing appellate counsel is seldom a useful exercise, as the view of the case in hindsight is always different.\n   <em>\n    Caver v.

But when trying to stand in the shoes of appellate counsel looking forward, some issues present themselves as very significant and obviously deserving of review. This was one of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   There was clear Supreme Court precedent for the eponymous\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   issue. Ray was denied counsel during an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   hearing, which turned out to be a critical stage in his prosecution. And as the petitioner's present counsel points out, Ray's state appellate lawyer missed a similar issue on a state court criminal appeal years earlier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 349 n.6. One might think that the experience would have sensitized him to the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   issue certainly was stronger than the issues advanced, one of which was unpreserved and submitted under a plain error theory. The\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   issue, on the other hand, was well preserved by trial counsel's objection to the lack of access to the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing transcript. The state court did not hold a hearing on Ray's post-conviction motion, so appellate counsel's reasoning for omitting the issue remains unexplained. However, a letter in the record from the Michigan Appellate Assigned Counsel System to appellate counsel states that the appellate lawyer never met with Ray before filing the appellate brief; that lapse violated the System's minimum standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The state trial judge cited the appropriate federal precedent (\n   <em>\n    Evitts v. Lucey\n   </em>\n   ) when addressing this issue. However, he did not evaluate the\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   claim, probably due to oversight, as discussed above; and he did not parse any factors in determining whether appellate counsel's performance was defective. Because the performance obviously\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   defective, and \"there is [no] reasonable argument that counsel satisfied\n   <em>\n    Strickland's\n   </em>\n   deferential standard,\"\n   <em>\n    Harrington v.

So it is here. But for appellate counsel's deficient performance, the outcome of the state appeal probably would have been favorable to Ray.

It takes little imagination to see how a journeyman defense lawyer might have used the evidence in this case that Straughter was being paid by the Romulus police to conduct drug buys, both before and after the murders. Straughter's undercover work was earning him money, and he would have been highly motivated to keep that income stream flowing. The police maintained that they were not working with Straughter when he responded to defendant Elam's call to sell drugs at Zarbaugh's house. Freelancing other drug sales certainly would have damaged Straughter's reliability in the eyes of the police, conceivably terminating his paid informant role.

The information about the witness should have been disclosed, but it was not. As a result, Ray was unable to impeach one of two eyewitnesses against him at trial. Contrary to the State's position, that failure was not absolved by the mere fact that the petitioner \"admitted he was present,\" at the scene, because Straughter testified to far more than Ray's presence. He also testified that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   Ray stood over Straughter and Booker at gunpoint outside the house while Perkins went into the house.

That testimony was central to the State's theory of the case that Ray was not simply present at the scene, but also actively aided and abetted the crimes by seizing and\n   holding hostages at gunpoint, threatening them, and firing-or attempting to fire-shots at the witnesses as they fled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The State contended in its response to the petition that Ray failed to make an adequate showing of materiality under\n   <em>\n    Bagley\n   </em>\n   , because even without Straughter's testimony the remaining evidence given at trial-in particular the identification of the petitioner by the other eyewitness, Booker-was enough to secure a conviction. However, as the\n   <em>\n    Kyles\n   </em>\n   court emphasized, sufficiency of the evidence is not the standard for materiality in the context of a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.

A defendant need not demonstrate that after discounting the inculpatory evidence in light of the undisclosed evidence, there would not have been enough left to convict. The possibility of an acquittal on a criminal charge does not imply an insufficient evidentiary basis to convict. One does not show a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation by demonstrating that some of the inculpatory evidence should have been excluded, but by showing that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <em>\n    Kyles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p419\">\n    514 U.S. at 434-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p419\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.
