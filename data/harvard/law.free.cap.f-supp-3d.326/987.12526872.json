This action was consolidated and merged with\n   <em>\n    Lehr Bros., Inc. v. Etchegaray Farms\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    , LLC\n   </em>\n   , 1:17-CV-1762 AWI JLT, a case that was removed from the Kern County Superior Court. Currently before the Court is Etchegaray Farms' (\"Etchegaray\") motion to dismiss Lehr Brothers (\"Lehr\") and California Potato Sales' (\"CPS\") first and second causes of action for the common counts of open book account and money lent. Etchegaray moves to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), but alternatively moves for summary judgment under Rule 56.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 5. For the reasons that follow, the motion to dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part, the motion for summary judgment will be granted in part, but amendment will be permitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From Lehr/CPS's Complaint (\"Complaint\"), Etchegaray grows organic lemons. In 2011, Lehr contracted with Etchegaray for the packing and marketing of Etchegaray's lemons. CPS was given the right to sell lemons on behalf of Etchegaray. As part of these agreements, CPS periodically advanced money to Etchegaray to aid in the lemon harvesting process. These sums were intended and agreed to be repaid to CPS by deductions from any\n   future proceeds generated by the sale of Etchegaray's organic lemons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Within a year of October 2017, CPS discovered that beginning in 2013, the sums advanced by CPS to Etchegaray exceeded the proceeds generated by the organic lemon sales by the following amounts: 2013-$6,456.74; 2014-$409,403.79; 2015-$381,534.58; 2016-$18,064.66. Lehr and CPS discovered that their accountings and pack-out reports (some of which were provided to Etchegaray) erroneously reflected a higher percentage of fruit being packed per bin, greater numbers of bins being sold, and lower hauling costs incurred. These errors obscured the significant disparities between the actual and reported information, and served to create a misperception that the crop advances provided by CPS had been repaid by Etchegaray. Lehr and CPS's accountings and pack-out reports were so inconsistent with the actual numbers of fruit packed per bin, the numbers of bins sold, and the hauling costs, that the error should have been obvious to any person in the lemon/agriculture industry, including an experienced grower like Etchegaray. When Lehr and CPS discovered the erroneous accounts, they notified Etchegaray.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Also, beginning in January 2017, an employee or agent of Lehr and CPS purported to agree to purchase organic lemons from Etchegaray with payment terms that were remarkably different from the customs and prevailing practices in the industry and from the prior course of dealing between the parties, including terms related to hauling costs, bin guarantees, and \"ups\" (sale proceeds generated from the sale of lemons).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lehr and CPS now bring claims against Etchegaray for open book account, money lent, rescission, reformation, and declaratory relief. Under the first cause of action for open book, Lehr and CPS, after incorporating all prior paragraphs by reference, allege that, within the last four years, Etchegaray has become indebted to CPS on an open book account for money due in the sum of $726,456.22, but after CPS demanded payment, Etchegaray refused to pay. Under the second cause of action for money leant, after incorporating all prior paragraphs by reference, Lehr and CPS allege that Etchegaray has become indebted to them within the last four in the sum of $726,456.22, but after CPS demanded payment, Etchegaray refused to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     MOTION TO DISMISS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Legal Framework\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a claim may be dismissed because of the plaintiff's \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.

After each growing season, Etchegaray received a final accounting. Thus, the practice described by Lehr and CPS does not fit the definition of an \"open book account,\" rather what is described is a closed account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In reply, Etchegaray argues\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   that the Complaint is inconsistent in that it alleges an open book account balance due of over $700,000.00, but then also alleges that only within the last year did Lehr and CPS determine that Etchegaray owed money. If Lehr and CPS only recently determined that a balance was owed, then this is inconsistent with an open book account because the account would have shown a balance immediately and for a number of years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   With respect to money lent, Etchegaray argues that the facts and dates alleged in the Complaint show that the claims for money lent in 2013, 2014, and 2015 are barred by the two year limitation period of California Code of Civil Procedure 339(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Lehr &amp; CPS's Opposition\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Lehr &amp; CPS argue that they have pled a plausible book account claim. There does not appear to be a dispute that there was a book account agreement between the parties. The dispute is whether the account is open or closed, but the only distinction between an open book account and a closed book account is the running of the statute of limitations. The four year limitations period does not begin until the account is closed. The limitations issue is irrelevant here because the complaint only seeks sums that fall within four years of filing. If necessary, Lehr/CPS request leave to amend to allege a closed account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With respect to money lent, Lehr/CPS argues that the claim is subject to a four year statute of limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Under California law, \"common counts\" are general pleadings that seek to recover money owed without necessarily specifying the nature of the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Title Ins.

These allegations sufficiently identify the cause of action and the amount owed. The allegation regarding how the debt arose is also sufficient for the Court to infer that the debt and the records surrounding that debt were made within the regular course of business-Lehr and CPS marketed and sold the lemon crops and advanced money with respect to those crops.

The Complaint does not describe how the amounts were reflected or provided to Etchegaray, and it does not describe the existence of an actual book or some other reasonably permanent form of account.

The allegations in the Complaint show that the debt at issue arose from an express agreement between Etchegaray and Lehr/CPS. Thus, the Complaint's allegations have triggered the general rule.

The Court is not convinced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   First, the California rules of pleading do not apply in this case. No matter the basis of jurisdiction, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern the adequacy of a pleading in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hefferman v.

Mass. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, an inconsistency is not apparent. The Court understands Etchegaray to be arguing that, given the fact that no debt to Lehr/CPS was ever reflected in the relevant accountings, and the fact that the debt was not disclosed to Etchegaray until sometime in 2017, there is not a book account. However, the fact that the debt was not discovered or ultimately entered into a book account until recently is not necessarily fatal. \"Although normally entries in an account book must be made at or near the time of the transactions to which they relate and there should be no long delay without satisfactory explanation, an irregularity in that respect is not necessarily fatal to an action on a book account.\"\n   <em>\n    Warda v.

In order to recover, Lehr/CPS will have to convince a finder of fact that the accounting errors were reasonable in order to recover the $726,000.00.

At the end of the season, Lehr/CPS provided a final accounting, which included units sold, average price, total sales, and deductions for picking, packing, and hauling. Each final account stated the net settled amount that would be remitted to Etchegaray, and was prepared by Lehr\n   and CPS. The parties intend that the account would not be carried into the next year or have a continuing obligation into the next growing season. It was not until August 31, 2017, that Lehr/CPS provided Etchegaray with adjusted accounting for the 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 growing season.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With respect to money lent, Etchegaray argues that there are no written agreements prior to the 2016/2017 growing season. Therefore, oral agreements governed the 2013, 2014, and 2015 seasons, and the final accounting and final check for 2015 was received more than two years before Lehr/CPS filed their complaint. Under California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 339(1), claims for money lent based on the 2013, 2014, and 2015 growing seasons are time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Lehr &amp; CPS's Opposition\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Lehr/CPS's arguments are generally the same as those made in opposition to the motion to dismiss. There appears to be agreement that a book account existed, and whether the account is closed or open does not matter because a four year limitations period would govern and the Complaint only seeks to recover for claims that fit within four years of filing. Additionally, Lehr/CPS argue that there were numerous written agreements between the parties, but Etchegaray has not submitted any contract for analysis. The declaration of Steve Etchegaray does not state that he expressed any intent that accounts would be closed at the end of the year and not carried forward. Such unexpressed intent is irrelevant to interpreting written contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   With respect to money lent, Lehr/CPS argue that Etchegaray has not met its burden of demonstrating that a written agreement does not address the advanced monies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Relevant Declarations\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In pertinent part, Lehr/CPS officer Leslie Lehr declares:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   As a general practice, growing seasons and related accountings for such may overlap, therefore creating the need for an estimate towards anticipated future returns for that season. This can happen up until all the product is processed and paid for by outside customers. Outside customers receive product and remit funds upon acceptance by the final customer and take whatever necessary discounts, quality adjustments, and price adjustments warranted at that time. Any overage or shortfall of monies as applied to the prior estimates is normally adjusted within the next growing season. As growing seasons are completed and audits are performed, balances to the appropriate party would be satisfied. [CPS] and [Lehr] have never waived their rights to recover amounts that were reimbursed by the end of the season.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Between 2011 and 2017, the relationship between the parties was ongoing, with [CPS] continuing to provide crop advances to Etchegaray Farms for its growing operations, with reimbursement adjustments being made to the Etchegaray Farm ledger as crop harvest and sales came to fruition. [CPS and Lehr] did not consider the seasons \"distinct\" for purposes of determining whether additional advances would be made or whether there were outstanding amounts due by Etchegaray Farms to [CPS or Lehr].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   It is true that various accountings were performed. But it was never the express or implied agreement of the parties that any mistake or oversight in the number of bins, packout percentage, or hauling charges would result in a waiver or release by [CPS or Lehr] for\n   the recovery of the full amounts it advanced to Etchegaray Farms for growing operations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   There were miscalculations made as to accountings provided to Etchegaray Farms in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016.

In other words, Plaintiffs would account back to Etchegaray at the end of each season.

This is supported not only by the declaration of Steve Etchegaray, but also by the exhibits attached to his declaration. Etchegaray has submitted two documents from CPS and one document from Lehr that are single page accountings relating to the 2013, 2014, and 2015 lemon crops.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Steve Etchegaray Decl.

The exhibits do not reflect a balance forward, do not reflect a single account number, and do not indicate that further documents (other than a check) would be provided to Etchegaray.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Viewed in the light most favorable to Lehr/CPS, the opposition declaration of Leslie Lehr is not to the contrary. As quoted above, Leslie Lehr declared that, \"as a standard practice,\" growing seasons and related accountings may overlap.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Leslie Lehr Dec. \u00b6 4. However, she does not say that this actually occurred with respect to Etchegaray, and the documents submitted by Etchegaray do not indicate that any overlap occurred. Evidence of a standard practice that is dependent upon what may or may not happen does not undermine evidence concerning what actually happened. Etchegaray's evidence indicates that there was no overlap, and that no balances owed to Lehr/CPS were carried forward or intended to be carried forward into a new year. Lehr does not deny that no further adjustments (except for the alleged accounting errors that were discovered in 2017) were ever made or that final checks for the crops followed within 30 to 45 days of the single-page accounting documents in 2013, 2014, and 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As quoted above, Leslie Lehr also declares that there was an on-going relationship between the parties from 2011 to 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. However, she does not deny that new negotiations occurred with Etchegaray for each new season/crop, nor does she declare that the amounts to be advanced were to be continuously accounted for in one account as a series of related transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As quoted above, Leslie Lehr also declares that CPS did not consider the growing seasons distinct for purposes of determining whether to extend credit or for determining whether there were outstanding monies due from Etchegaray.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   However, these assertions miss the relevant issue. The issue is not whether or how CPS decided to advance money or determined whether Etchegaray owed money, the issue is how the actual advancement was treated or viewed by the parties and whether that agreed treatment was sufficient for purposes of a book account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As quoted above, Leslie Lehr also declares that it was never agreed that any \"accounting mistakes\" would result in waivers by CPS for the full amount advanced to Etchegaray. Again, this is not a relevant issue. Etchegaray has not argued that CPS waived any amounts that were advanced, rather Etchegaray is arguing\n   that no book account was ever formed for a period between 2011 through 2017. Waiver has nothing to do with the elements of a book account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal. Code Civ.

Again, whether Etchegaray recognized any errors or miscalculations is irrelevant to the issue of whether there is a book account between the parties. The accuracy of any entries in a book account is an issue that goes to the amount of money actually owed (if any),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Interstate Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2180132\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/174/700/\">\n    174 Cal.App.3d at 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=220%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20250\">\n    220 Cal.Rptr. 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it does not go the issue of whether a book account exists.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tsemetzin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"19534\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/57/1334/#p1343\">\n    57 Cal.App.4th at 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20726\">\n    67 Cal.Rptr.2d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (setting forth the statutory test for a book account).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Therefore, the evidence presented establishes that there is not a book account between the parties that spans 2011 to 2017. The evidence shows that each yearly growing season was separately negotiated, a final accounting was prepared for each growing season, a balance owed to Lehr/CPS was never presented as part of the final accounting, no balances forward were ever entered on the final accounting provided to Etchegaray, and money advanced for each growing season was a part of a separate and distinct agreement. Once the growing season ended, so did the agreement concerning that season. Therefore, there was no intent to maintain a single on-going book account that carried forward and spanned multiple years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the claim alleged in the Complaint is for a single book account that spans from 2013 to 2017, summary judgment on this claim is appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Money Lent\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The parties do not dispute that the statute of limitations for a claim of money lent based on an oral agreement is two years (pursuant to Civil Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 339(1) ), but the limitations period for a claim of money lent based on a written agreement is four years (pursuant Civil Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 337(1) ). The dispute is over which limitations period applies, Etchegaray contends the two year period applies and Lehr/CPS contend that the four year period applies. Lehr/CPS argue that summary judgment is improper because Etchegaray has not met its burden of demonstrating that no written agreements govern the advancement of money for the lemon crops. The Court cannot agree with Lehr/CPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Steve Etchegaray declared: \"As an Authorized Representative of Etchegaray my responsibilities include negotiating and contracting on behalf of Etchegaray. This includes negotiating terms with marketing agents, such as Lehr and CPS.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. As quoted above, Steve Etchegaray also declared that he has contracted with CPS and Lehr since 2010, and he never negotiated or executed a formal written marketing agreement on behalf of Etchegaray with Lehr/CPS relating to the marketing of lemons prior to the 2016 to 2017 season.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. These paragraphs clearly show that Steve Etchegaray has negotiated with Lehr/CPS on behalf of Etchegaray relating to Etchegaray's lemon crops since 2010, and that no written agreements were signed before the 2016/2017 season. That is, Steve Etchegaray's declaration demonstrates that the agreements between Etchegaray and Lehr/CPS between 2010 and 2015 were all oral agreements. This evidence is sufficient to shift the burden to Lehr/CPS to show that there is a genuine dispute about whether written agreements exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nissan Fire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11533921\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/1099/#p1105\">\n    210 F.3d at 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Lehr/CPS have not submitted any evidence that indicates a written agreement exists. As quoted above, Lehr/CPS did submit the declaration of Leslie Lehr in opposition to summary judgment. Leslie Lehr's declaration shows that she personally signed many of the advanced money checks on behalf of CPS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lehr Dec. \u00b6 3. At a minimum, it would have been very easy for Leslie Lehr or any other Lehr/CPS officer or employee to declare that written agreements with Etchegaray exist relating to the advancement of money for Etchegaray's lemon crop (and produce such agreements). The fact that no such declaration or any relevant evidence was submitted in response to Etchegaray's arguments (and in particular Steve Etchegaray's declaration) is extremely telling. The only reasonable conclusion is that Lehr/CPS cannot meet their burden because, as Etchegaray argues, no written agreements exist prior to the 2016/ 2017 growing season.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Based on the evidence submitted, claims related to money lent in 2016 and 2017 are subject to the \u00a7 337(1) four year limitations period. All claims related to money lent prior to 2016 are subject to the \u00a7 339(1) two year limitations period. More specifically, because Lehr/CPS filed their Complaint in the Kern County Superior Court on October 16, 2017, any claims for money lent that accrued prior to October 16, 2015, are time barred. Steve Etchegaray declared that a final accounting and final check were received from Lehr/CPS for the 2013 season in 2013, for the 2014 season in 2014, and for the 2015 season in\n   May 2015 and June 22, 2015 (the accounting was received in May and a check for $180,484.08 was received in June).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Steve Etchegaray Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 10-13. Etchegaray argues that any claim for money lent in 2015 accrued at the latest June 22, 2015, well before October 16, 2015. Lehr/CPS does not challenge this assertion. Therefore, summary judgment with respect to claims for money lent that accrued prior to October 16, 2015, which includes the sums identified for 2013, 2014, and 2015, is appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Further Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court has found that summary judgment on the book account claim as pled is appropriate. However, the briefing and evidence submitted does not rule out all claims concerning book accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   With respect to the briefing, Lehr/CPS argue that it does not matter if there is an open book account or, if Etchegaray is correct that there are a series of separate closed accounts, because the statute of limitations on a book account is four years from the date of the last entry. Lehr/CPS are only seeking damages from 2013 forward, i.e. damages that fall within a four year limitation period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This position not only accepts a single book account, but also accepts four separate accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   With respect to the evidence, the declarations of Leslie Lehr and Steve Etchegaray (which are consistent with relevant allegations in the Complaint) indicate that money was advanced by CPS to Etchegaray, and the advanced money was to be repaid through the sales of Etchegaray's lemon crop by Lehr/CPS. The declarations and the exhibits to Steve Etchegaray's declaration indicate that Lehr/CPS maintained records regarding the money advanced and the lemon crop, and then made a final yearly payment to Etchegaray for each crop. That is, the evidence could be consistent with four separate accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Court finds that the evidence and arguments suggest that there may be four separate books accounts for the 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 growing seasons. The Court is aware of no law that requires a book account to reflect every transaction between parties. In fact, by statute, a book account may memorialize either a single transaction\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   a series of transactions between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal. Code. Civ. P. \u00a7 337a (a book account is \"a detailed statement which constitutes the principal record of\n   <em>\n    one or more transactions\n   </em>\n   between a debtor and a creditor arising out of a contract....\") (emphasis added). At this early stage in the case, it is not clear that Lehr/CPS cannot viably pursue four separate closed book account claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore,\n   the Court will permit Lehr/CPS to file an amended complaint that alleges four separate closed book accounts, if they can do so consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11.

No. 11 at 7:18-19. Tellingly, no citation is provided in support of this assertion. The Court is unaware of Etchegaray admitting to \"numerous written contracts,\" rather the Court is only aware of Etchegaray's admission that there was a written contract for the 2016 to 2017 growing season. Counsel's unsupported assertion is not competent evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     British Airways Bd. v.

Furthermore, in the absence of a written contract, there is no written language for the Court to examine in order to determine the intent of the parties. The only evidence before the Court regarding the parties' intent is the declaration of Steve Etchegaray, and that declaration indicates new and distinct accounts that were negotiated for each season and that closed at the end of each season, without obligations carried forward.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Steve Etchegaray Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 4-9, 14. Leslie Lehr's declaration discusses standard practices based on what may occur in a particular season or circumstance, it does not specifically address Etchegaray's crops or agreements or the relevant negotiations with Etchegaray.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Leslie Lehr Dec. \u00b6 4. Her declaration is too general to adequately dispute Steve Etchegaray's declaration.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Lehr/CPS argue that summary judgment should be denied because of the early stage of this case and the absence of any discovery. This is a request for relief under Rule 56(d), which provides a mechanism for litigants to avoid summary judgment when they have not had sufficient time to develop evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Kitsap Physicians Serv.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9385819,9385855\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/314/995/\">\n     314 F.3d 995\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1000 (9th Cir. 2002). To obtain relief under Rule 56(d), a party must show: (1) that they have set forth in affidavit form the specific facts that they hope to elicit from further discovery, (2) that the facts sought exist, and (3) that these sought-after facts are essential to resist the summary judgment motion.\n    <em>\n     Midbrook Flowerbulbs Holland B.V. v. Holland Am. Bulb Farms, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265326\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/604/#p619\">\n     874 F.3d 604\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 619-20 (9th Cir. 2017). Lehr/CPS's counsel declares that no discovery has occurred, but that discovery would explore Etchegaray's knowledge of the erroneous accounting errors, and that the information discovered would defeat summary judgment on the book account claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Estrada Dec. PP 5, 6, 7. No other evidence or type of evidence is identified.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265326\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/604/#p619\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    However, as discussed above, while Etchegaray's knowledge of the accounting errors may be relevant to the issue of the amount of money owed, it is not relevant to the existence of a book account. Because the only evidence identified is irrelevant to the summary judgment motion, relief under Rule 56(d) is not warranted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The Court notes that, while Lehr/CPS requested relief under Rule 56(d) with respect to the book account claim, Lehr/CPS made no such request with respect to the money lent claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The Court agrees with Lehr/CPS's statute of limitations analysis.
