ECF No. 90. For the reasons noted below, Defendant's Renewed Motion for Judgment of Acquittal is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Counts Two, Three, and Four, but the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Count Five, and Defendant's conviction on Count Five is\n   <strong>\n    VACATED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Indictment, ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In September 2017, Eychaner entered a plea of not guilty and a jury trial was scheduled. The trial date was later continued to May 15, 2018. ECF No. 25. On May 13, 2018, the Government moved to dismiss Count One of the Indictment. ECF No. 62. The Court granted the motion the next day. ECF No. 70. After a four-day jury trial, on May 18, 2018, the jury returned guilty verdicts on each of the remaining counts of the Indictment. ECF No. 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Evidence Presented at Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The evidence at trial revealed that in December 2007, Eychaner pled guilty to Possession of Material Containing Child Pornography. In March 2008, he was sentenced to 120 months imprisonment and a term of lifetime supervision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Eychaner\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:07cr183 (E.D. Va. Mar. 13, 2008), ECF No. 30. As special conditions of supervised release, Defendant was prohibited from (1) possessing or using a computer to access any online computer services at any location without the prior approval of the probation officer and (2) from possessing or accessing pornographic material or any pictures of juveniles.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June 2016, Defendant began his term of supervised release. Shortly thereafter, Eychaner spoke to Probation Officer Stephanie Powers, who was supervising him at the time, and told her that he wanted to obtain a computer to conduct job searches. Eychaner agreed in writing that his computer would be monitored, and he signed forms advising him that the Probation Office would monitor his computer in a variety of ways through software provided by RemoteCOM, a third-party vendor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Waiver of Hearing to Modify Conditions of Supervised Release,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Eychaner\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:07cr183 (E.D. Va. July 15, 2016), ECF No. 40. He was also specifically advised that the monitoring software\n   could \"restrict and/or record any an[d] all activity on the computer, including keystrokes and Internet use history.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On August 8, 2016, RemoteCOM's monitoring software was installed onto Defendant's computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Later that August, Probation Officer Stephanie Powers received information from RemoteCOM about Defendant's suspicious computer activities. After being confronted about this information, Eychaner admitted to having performed an Internet search for images of clothed minors. At that time, he also told his probation officer that he had used a voice recognition program called Cortana\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to circumvent RemoteCOM's keystroke monitoring. Probation Officer Powers then instructed Eychaner to use his computer only to search for jobs, but she allowed him to keep his computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 17, 2016, utilizing his own computer, Defendant used his roommate's Wi-Fi to access the Internet in order to perform searches on Bing.com using the Cortana voice recognition program. Eychaner used many sexually explicit search terms\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that generated a large number of anime images depicting children engaged in sexual activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to his Bing.com searches, Defendant also went to the websites \"premiumhentai.site\" and \"premiumhentai.biz\" to find additional anime images. Defendant's online activities that evening lasted from 6:34 p.m. to 7:38 p.m., during which time RemoteCOM's monitoring software captured still screenshot images from Defendant's computer screen every ten seconds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the morning of November 18, 2016, Defendant called Probation Officer Candace Yost, who was then supervising him, and told her that he wanted to return his computer because the monitoring software was too expensive. Less than an hour later, he called back and stated that he had not been honest with her. He then confessed that he had accessed inappropriate images on his computer the night before, which he described as \"anime child pornography.\" Defendant also related that he had been able to access these images using the Cortona voice recognition program and that he believed that he had found a hole in the monitoring system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After hearing Eychaner's confession, Probation Officer Yost then went to Probation Officer Mako, who was in charge of\n   computer monitoring for the United States Probation Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. Probation Officer Mako examined Eychaner's computer activity and confirmed that, while there was no unusual activity in the keystroke monitoring section from the previous night, RemoteCOM had captured hundreds of screenshots showing that Eychaner had viewed explicit images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Probation Officer Yost then called Eychaner back and told him she needed to collect his computer. Eychaner replied that he was at work at the moment, but that he would be home later that day. He also told her that he had already taken his hard drive out of his laptop and thrown it down a storm drain on the way to work that day. Eychaner stated that he had done this because he was angry at his computer, which he described as \"the danger zone.\" Probation Officer Yost then told him that she would need him to collect all the remaining pieces of his laptop for her to retrieve later that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the early evening of November 18, 2016, Probation Officers Yost and Powers went to Eychaner's residence to collect his computer. At that time, Eychaner again confessed to having viewed images he described as \"anime child pornography\" the night before. He then gave the probation officers his computer mouse and power cord, and led them outside the residence to a trash can where he removed the remaining pieces of his broken laptop computer and his laptop's battery. The computer was missing its hard drive, and the hard drive was never recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Probation Officer Yost later took the pieces of Defendant's computer and gave them to FBI Task Force Officer Call, who then turned them over to Computer Forensic Analyst (\"CFA\") Jones for analysis. CFA Jones testified at trial that he could not conduct a forensic examination of the computer because of the missing hard drive. Officer Call and CFA Jones also testified about the steps that would have been taken in the investigation if there had been a hard drive to forensically analyze.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At trial, the Government published thirteen images to the jury from the complete screenshots captured from Defendant's Bing.com image searches.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In their unredacted\n   form, the screenshots show around 20 images from the results returned from Eychaner's Bing.com searches. The thirteen images published to the jury each show one image from a particular screenshot, with the remaining images all redacted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Exs. 14a-la, 14a-1b, 14a-1c, 14a-2, 14a-6a, 14a-6b, 14a-7a, 14a-7b, 14a-8, 14a-9, 14a-10, 14a-11, and 14a-12;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Special Jury Verdict Form, ECF No. 86 (listing image numbers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition to the thirteen images from the Bing.com searches, the Government also published five screenshot images from premiumhentai.site and premiumhentai.biz.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Exs. 14a-4, 14a-13, 14a-14, 14a-15, 14a-16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Special Jury Verdict Form, ECF No. 86 (listing image numbers).

The Government also submitted screenshots taken just after 8:00 p.m. on November 17 that show that Eychaner deleted his Bing.com search history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Ex. 12 at 80 (featuring a browser tab for \"Bing-Search History\" with a box stating \"Clear your history\" and \"You're about to delete your entire search history.

Dr. Cather was offered by the defense as an expert in modern Japanese literature, culture, manga, and anime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 283:6-291:16. Dr. Cather's testimony first covered the definitions of many of the key Japanese terms used throughout the trial, such as manga,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   anime,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   hentai,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   lolicon,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   shotacon,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and toddlercon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Cather also generally described manga's history, the stylization of characters featured in manga, and the literary and artistic value that manga can have in its many subgenres, including, in Dr. Cather's opinion, the serious value of works of lolicon, shotacon, and toddlercon.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    at 291:21-318:8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She concluded that, while she could not opine as to whether the images in question had serious artistic, literary, or political value based on the isolated portions of the works presented by the Government, the images at issue might have such serious value when viewed in the context of the original manga works.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    at 318:6-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Def.'s Acquittal Br. for Count Two, ECF No. 74. To convict Eychaner on this count, the Government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) Eychaner specifically intended to commit the underlying offense of Receipt of Visual Depictions that Depict Minors Engaging in Sexually Explicit Conduct and are Obscene, and (2) he took a substantial step towards the commission of that crime that strongly corroborates that intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, the underlying offense has the following elements: (1) that the defendant knowingly received a visual depiction; (2) that the visual depiction depicts a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct; (3) that the visual depiction is obscene; (4) that the defendant knew, at the time of such receipt, the sexually oriented nature of the visual depiction; (5) that the defendant knew at the time of such receipt that the visual depiction depicted a minor; and (6) that the visual depiction had been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1466A(a) (1) ;\n   <em>\n    Pattern Crim.

The Court addresses each element challenged in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1. There is Sufficient Evidence to Find that Eychaner Specifically Intended to Commit the Underlying Offense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Eychaner first challenges whether the evidence is sufficient to show that he acted with the specific intent to receive\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   the images in question. At trial, this issue was clearly and squarely presented to the jury, as Eychaner's main argument as to Count Two was that the evidence only showed a specific intent to\n   <em>\n    view\n   </em>\n   , as opposed to intent to\n   <em>\n    receive\n   </em>\n   , the images.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 503:3-508:6. While at times inartfully distinguishing between evidence that established the specific intent to commit the underlying offense versus the evidence showing a substantial step towards the commission of the underlying offense, the Government presented evidence that was sufficient for the jury to conclude Eychaner had the requisite specific intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 487:2-491:7, 526:3-528:4, 531:5-532:4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Opp'n Br. 5, 10 (noting the evidence showing that Eychaner took a substantial step to commit the underlying offense, but failing to explain the basis for the jury's finding for specific intent). Despite the Government's failure to distinguish clearly between the specific intent and substantial step elements in its response to the motion for acquittal during trial and in its post-trial response to the renewed motion for acquittal, the Court addressed this distinction at trial with the parties, noting the basis for its ruling as to each element in its denial of Eychaner's Rule 29 motion on Count Two.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 383:13-386:7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court notes at the outset the striking similarities between the facts here and those presented in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Groenendal\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-1143/1148, 2015 U.S. App. Lexis 23381 (6th Cir. Apr. 27, 2015) (unpublished order), in which the Sixth Circuit affirmed a conviction for attempted receipt of child pornography and attempted access with intent to view child pornography.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-2. Like Eychaner, Groenendal was on supervision from a prior conviction for possession of child pornography.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While on supervision, he persuaded his probation officer to allow him to have a computer on the condition that he would agree to computer monitoring.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Groenendal later conducted image searches on Bing.com for child pornography, the evidence of which was logged by the monitoring software in the form of screenshots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Groenendal's probation officer eventually received a report about his activities from the monitoring service, after which the defendant was prosecuted for the above-mentioned offenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At trial and on appeal, Groenendal argued that the evidence was insufficient to show that he specifically\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   to commit either of the charged offenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The district court denied the defendant's Rule 29 motion at trial, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9-10. On plain error review, the Sixth Circuit found that the following evidence was sufficient to show the defendant's specific intent to receive the images: (1) evidence of numerous pages of search terms that Groenendal entered into the Bing.com search engine which yielded images of child pornography; (2) evidence showing that Groenendal had scrolled through multiple pages of results and moved his mouse over certain images to enlarge them; (3) evidence that the defendant had used suggested search results from Bing.com to find further images of child pornography; (4) evidence that images had been stored in the defendant's temporary cache files; (5) Groenendal's admission to having conducted the searches; (6) and Groenendal's prior conviction for possession of child pornography.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The only meaningful difference between the above facts and those here is that Eychaner removed his hard drive and prevented any forensic analysis to determine whether his Internet cache file contained the images in question or whether he had actually affirmatively downloaded or saved the images.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   But because both this case and\n   <em>\n    Groenendal\n   </em>\n   involve the\n   <em>\n    attempted\n   </em>\n   receipt as opposed to actual receipt of these images, the Internet cache evidence is unnecessary to show that an attempted receipt of the images occurred. A review of the evidence here shows that every other category of evidence relied on by the\n   <em>\n    Groenendal\n   </em>\n   court for its finding of specific intent is present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The starting point for the jury's consideration was Eychaner's admission that the evidence \"certainly demonstrates that he had the specific intent to look at images on his screen.\" Def.'s Count Two Acquittal Br. 6, ECF No. 74. The jury thus only had to find that Eychaner's intent went beyond simply desiring to view the images to that of seeking to receive them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Here, the jury had many pieces of evidence before them establishing Eychaner's specific intent to receive the images in question. First, the jury could infer Eychaner's specific intent from the evidence of the search terms he used on Bing.com.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Groenendal\n   </em>\n   , 2015 U.S. App. Lexis 23381, at *9 (noting the defendant's search terms among the items that reflected his specific intent to receive the images);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Heiberg\n   </em>\n   , No. NMCCA 201000668,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205855535\">\n    2011 WL 5855535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. Nov. 22, 2011) (noting that an \"intentional search for child pornography\" can show a specific intent to receive such images). Examples of the terms he used include \"Lolicon 3D images,\" \"Shotacon 3d Little Girl,\" and \"Toddlercon Sex,\" all of which returned explicit anime images. Second, the jury could find that the evidence, that Eychaner had used some of the suggested search terms generated by Bing.com to pursue more images, suggested his intent to receive such images.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Groenendal\n   </em>\n   , 2015 U.S. App. Lexis 23381, at *9 (noting that Groenendal used Bing.com's suggested search terms). Third, the jury could infer Eychaner's specific intent from his admission to having searched for and viewed \"anime child pornography\" on his computer.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205855535\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting Groenendal's admission to having conducted the searches among the evidence that showed his specific intent to receive the images). Fourth, the Government produced evidence showing that Eychaner's activities went beyond passive viewing. As noted above, several screenshots published to the jury showed that Eychaner had clicked on and enlarged\n   the images.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov. Exs. 14a-4, 14a-16. While enlarging an image would not have been enough to show the receipt of such image, it does suggest that Eychaner's intent to interact with and control the images went beyond passive viewing.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Groenendal\n   </em>\n   , 2015 U.S. App. Lexis 23381, at *10;\n   <em>\n    Heiberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205855535\">\n    2011 WL 5855535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (noting that the defendant had clicked on and enlarged images and that this supported a finding of his intent to receive such images).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Fifth, the jury could infer an intent to receive the images based on Eychaner's prior conviction for possession of child pornography.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Groenendal\n   </em>\n   , 2015 U.S. App. Lexis 23381, at *10 (noting that Groenendal's prior conviction for possession of child pornography supported an inference that he intended to receive the images in question). Because of this conviction, the jury could infer that Eychaner was a person who was not content to merely passively view explicit images of children on the Internet. Instead, they knew that his viewing activities had been accompanied in the past by the receiving and possessing of such images, and that he had a history of collecting sexually explicit images of children.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Vosburgh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3922423\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/512/#p528\">\n    602 F.3d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 528 (3d Cir. 2010) (noting in the context of a challenge to a search warrant that \"persons with an interest in child pornography tend to hoard their materials and retain them for a long time ... Child pornography is illegal, and therefore difficult and risky to obtain. Presumably, once a child pornography collector gets his hands on such material he will not be quick to discard it.\"). As a result, the jury could infer that, when Eychaner viewed the images in question here, he had that same intention to receive or collect these images that he had displayed in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Sixth, the combination of Eychaner's repeated confessions to viewing the images at issue and the removal of his hard drive supports an inference that his activities did, in fact, go beyond mere viewing. If Eychaner truly only viewed the images, the question remains of what his purpose was in destroying the laptop and removing the hard drive. While Eychaner claimed that his actions simply reflected his anger at having failed at his attempt at abstinence once again, the jury could instead infer that whatever evidence was on the laptop revealed something worse than the viewing to which he confessed. To the extent the jury was persuaded that Eychaner was attempting to cover up the actual receipt of the images in question, they could surely find that he had specifically intended to receive such images and that all steps necessary for the completion of the crime had taken place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Seventh, the circumstances of the crime suggest a motive to download as opposed to merely view the images online. Eychaner was viewing images on a\n   <em>\n    monitored\n   </em>\n   system. While he could not know for certain how RemoteCOM's software worked, he reasonably could have concluded that he risked detection each time he used an explicit search term on Bing.com or went to a site like premiumhentai.site. Given the easily understood risk associated with each search, the jury could conclude that Eychaner thought he might as well download the materials rather than have to revisit them later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, the length of time that Eychaner lingered at the websites suggests more than mere viewing. As noted above, Eychaner was online conducting searches on Bing.com and visiting premiumhentai.site for over an hour. During that time, he scrolled through hundreds of images, at the very least stopping to hover over and enlarge many of them. The jury could thus infer that Eychaner's viewing activities were consistent with an attempt to seek\n   out a mass of images in order to receive a collection (either through caching or downloading) rather than merely to view the images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Based on the above and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Eychaner acted with the specific intent of committing the underlying offense of receipt of visual depictions that depict minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct and are obscene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    2. There is Sufficient Evidence to Find that Eychaner Took a Substantial Step to Commit the Underlying Offense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In addition to proving Eychaner's specific intent to commit the underlying offense, the Government had the burden of proving that Eychaner took a substantial step toward the receipt of the images at issue. A substantial step is a \"direct act in a course of conduct planned to culminate in commission of a crime that is strongly corroborative of the defendant's criminal purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3756969\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/405/#p419\">\n    676 F.3d at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is also \"more than mere preparation but less ... than completion of the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3756969\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/405/#p419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   At trial, the Government first produced evidence showing that Eychaner convinced his probation officer to allow him to have a computer in July 2016. In August 2016, Eychaner then tested the limits of the RemoteCOM software by using Cortana. These first two actions are best understood as potentially being the preparatory stage for his later crimes. The Government also produced evidence showing that on November 17, 2016, Eychaner: (1) logged onto his roommate's Wi-Fi; (2) navigated to Bing.com using Cortona voice recognition commands; (3) input dozens of explicit search terms on that site such as \"Little Girls Pervert Paradise\" and \"Animated Toddlercon Sex\"; (4) scrolled through the search results and enlarged several images; (5) then navigated to premiumhentai.site; and (6) searched through numerous pages on that site, including multiple pages with a button that would allow him to download a complete set of explicit images and videos. In addition to the direct evidence of Eychaner's online activity, the jury knew that Eychaner had removed his hard drive and confessed to viewing illicit images. As mentioned above, the jury could infer from this evidence that Eychaner's activities had gone beyond mere viewing. Based on the above, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Eychaner took multiple substantial steps towards receipt of visual depictions that depict minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct and are obscene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    3. There is Sufficient Evidence to Find that the Images Depicted Minors Engaged in Sexually Explicit Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant next challenges whether certain of the images published to the jury actually depict minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. In particular, Defendant argues that Government's exhibits 14a-2, 14a-4, and 14a-10 do not depict minors as opposed to youthful-looking characters, and that the minor depicted in Government's exhibit 14a-14 is not engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   There is little dispute that most of the images at issue depict minors. Many of the characters are identifiably minors based on their obviously prepubescent features.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Exs. 14a-1a, 14a-b, 14a-2, 14a-c, 14a-6a, 14a-6b, 14a-7b, 14a-8, 14a-11, 14a-13, 14a-14, 14a-15. Others can be identified as minors because of their sizes relative to the adults with whom they are engaged in sexual activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Exs. 14a-7a, 14a-7b, 14a-8, 14a-9, 14a-10, 14a-11, 14a-12,\n   14a-16. The details in the images, such as clothing or hairstyle, also suggest that several of the characters are minors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Exs. 14a-1a, 14a-1b, 14a-6a, 14a-6b, 14a-7b, 14a-8, 14a-11, 14a-14, 14a-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Turning first to Government's exhibit 14a-2, this image shows a youthful-looking female character with her legs spread in a lascivious display. While Defendant claims that her appearance is \"highly stylized\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the image is ambiguous as to whether she is a minor, the character's breasts and genitals appear to show that she is prepubescent. The jury thus could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that this image depicted a minor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As to Government's exhibit 14a-4, this image depicts a youthful-looking female character who is performing oral sex on a male. The female character is not identifiably a minor based on any visible prepubescent characteristics because only her shoulders and face are visible. The most identifiably childlike aspect of the character is that her hair is styled in pigtails. The male character is mostly out of view, but the female character's mouth is very small in comparison with his penis. Defendant contends that this image is ambiguous as to the age of the female character depicted because the character's pigtails alone do not give a sufficient indication of her age. While this may be true, a reasonable juror could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the character was a minor based on the combination of the character's youthful looks, her hairstyle, and the relative size of the female character's mouth in relation to the male's penis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As to Government's exhibit 14a-10, this image, titled \"denis the menace fucks his mom,\" depicts exactly what its title suggests. The Dennis the Menace character appears to be roughly the same size as his mother, and no other characteristic is visible to show that he is a minor. But the context of the picture, which depicts a famous character who is below the age of eighteen, would suggest to a reasonable viewer that the character depicted is a minor. Given the additional details known to the jury about Dennis the Menace, the jury had sufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the character depicted in Government's exhibit 14a-10 was a minor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Next, Defendant challenges whether Government's exhibit 14a-14, which consists of an image of a very young, nude male with his legs spread while lying on his back, actually constitutes a depiction of sexually explicit conduct. The Government contends that this image meets \u00a7 1466A's requirement that the visual depiction depict \"sexually explicit conduct\" because it constitutes a lascivious exhibition of the genitals under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202256\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (A) (v).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1466A(f) (2) (incorporating the definition of \"sexually explicit conduct\" from 18 \u00a7 2256(2) (A), which is defined as including the \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person\"). To determine whether an image constitutes a lascivious exhibition of the genitals, courts\n   in this district consider the six relevant but non-exclusive factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dost\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   1) whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child's genitalia or pubic area;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   2) whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   4) whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   5) whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   6) whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3868154\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/636/828/#p832\">\n    636 F.Supp. 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 832 (S.D.

Under the\n   <em>\n    Dost\n   </em>\n   standard, \"a visual depiction need not involve all of these factors to be a lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.\"\n   <em>\n    Whorley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1562023\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/400/880/#p883\">\n    400 F.Supp.2d at 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dost\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3868154\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/636/828/#p832\">\n    636 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   832 ) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The depiction in Government's exhibit 14a-14 contains almost all of the elements noted in\n   <em>\n    Dost\n   </em>\n   . First, the minor's genitals are the image's focal point. Second, the child is fully nude, with the only item of clothing visible being his underwear, which is dangling from his ankle. The impression given by the latter detail is that the character seems to have recently removed his underwear, apparently in anticipation of sexual activity. Third, the child is in an unnatural position. As noted above, the child is on his back with his legs spread, and he appears to be using his hands to pull on his legs in order to fully expose himself for sexual contact. Fourth, the character's pose appears to be highly sexually suggestive, as he seems to be offering himself for sex. Fifth, the character's depiction strongly suggests the minor's willingness to engage in sexual activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In addition to the five\n   <em>\n    Dost\n   </em>\n   factors mentioned above, one other notable detail about this image is that it is a part of an advertisement for another site, as it has a banner at the top stating \"Only Best Shotacon\" and a banner at the bottom stating \"Click Here to Visit.\" If this image did not, in fact, constitute a lascivious display of the genitals, it is hard to see how it could achieve its purpose of luring viewers to the advertised site. Given the above, the jury had sufficient evidence before it to conclude that Government's exhibit 14a-14 depicted a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct because the minor depicted was making a lascivious exhibition of the genitals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    4. There is Sufficient Evidence to Find that the Images Were Obscene\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendant's final challenge to his conviction on Count Two is whether the jury had sufficient evidence to conclude that the images are obscene. Whether a work is obscene is judged under the three-part test articulated in\n   <em>\n    Miller v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338628\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/413/15/#p24\">\n    413 U.S. 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24-25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338628\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/413/15/#p24\">\n    93 S.Ct. 2607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338628\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/413/15/#p24\">\n    37 L.Ed.2d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973).

At oral argument during trial on his motion for judgment of acquittal and his renewed motion for judgment of acquittal, Defendant challenged whether the images were obscene. Trial Tr. 258:23-259:16, 380:23-381:2. Defendant has not raised any new arguments or cited any new law in his post-trial Renewed Motion for Judgment of Acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As noted above, there was a disagreement at trial between the parties about what the proper scope of the \"work as a whole\" should be for the images published to the jury. The Government appeared to take the view that the \"work as a whole\" with respect to the Bing.com thumbnail images was either the individual thumbnail images or the full screenshot of the image search results.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 326:16-327:1 (arguing that the jury needed to see full screenshots of the Bing.com images in order to appreciate exactly what Eychaner viewed); Trial Tr. 530:4, ECF No. 98 (stating that, when the jury looked at the individual thumbnail images, they were looking at the \"work as a whole.\"). With respect to the images from premiumhentai.site, the Government seemed to believe that the individual images hosted on that site each constituted a \"work as a whole.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendant took a dramatically different view, arguing first that if an image looks as if it\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have come from a larger manga work, then the Government, in order to meet its burden of proof, has the duty to diligently search for the original work and present it in its entirety to the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 513:13-23 (noting that because the defense's expert believed the images looked as if they originally were part of a larger manga work, that the \"work as a whole\" should be the original manga work);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 539:1-20, 540:14-16 (stating defendant's position that the \"work as a whole\" for the Bing.com images was the original manga work). If the Government cannot find the original work, then, according to Defendant, no prosecution can occur for an image extracted from the original work. Defendant also appeared to offer another view under which, even if the original manga work was not the \"work as a whole,\" the Government had a duty to present the materials from the underlying websites from which the Bing.com image results came.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 513:24-514:18. Because the Government failed to produce evidence of the full context of the\n   <em>\n    underlying\n   </em>\n   websites for the Bing.com images, Defendant argued that the jury could not judge whether such images came from works that were, on the whole, obscene.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Notably, while Defendant offered much argument applicable to the thirteen images from the Bing.com searches, Defendant never explained why the Government's evidence regarding the five premiumhentai.site images was insufficient to show their obscenity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   At trial, the Court concluded that both the Government's\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Defendant's\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   views were incorrect for the \"work as a whole\" element. As noted above, the Court instructed the parties that, when a person takes isolated portions of otherwise non-obscene works and places those portions on a website in a manner that does not indicate to a viewer that they come from a larger work, the isolated portions become the new \"work as a whole\" to be analyzed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Extreme Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20113767\">\n    2009 WL 113767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-3 ;\n   <em>\n    Kahm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"241112\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/300/78/#p83\">\n    300 F.2d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83. Thus, the Court concluded that the images\n   or videos hosted on premiumhentai.site and the other pornography websites constitute the works as a whole to be analyzed for purposes of the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   There is no reasonable doubt that images depicting children engaged in sexually explicit conduct, like those at issue here, are obscene under the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   test if they are viewed in isolation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The relevant question now is whether the Government presented enough information, in addition to the images themselves, for the jury to have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that each \"work as a whole,\" when judged under the standard articulated above, was obscene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In order to convict Defendant on Count Two, the jury needed only to unanimously find that at least one of the visual depictions Eychaner attempted to receive was obscene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1466A(a) (1) (criminalizing, in relevant part, the attempted receipt of \"\n   <em>\n    a visual depiction of any kind\n   </em>\n   , including a drawing, cartoon, sculpture, or painting, that ... depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct ... and is obscene\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koegel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3835535\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/777/1014/#p1024\">\n    777 F.Supp.2d at 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the defendant was guilty under \u00a7 1466A because he possessed obscene anime cartoon images of the sexual abuse of children, but declining to state the number of images that qualified as obscene under the statute). Thus, because the jury was instructed that they had to unanimously find whether\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   image listed on the Special Jury Verdict Form was obscene,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 472:22-473:1, and they did find that each of the images was obscene,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Special Jury Verdict Form, ECF No. 86, Eychaner must show that the Government has failed to carry its burden with respect to each of the images in order to be acquitted on Count Two. To sustain the conviction, however, the Government need only show that at least one of the images was obscene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Here, based on the full range of information known to the jury about the relevant \"works as a whole,\" the jury clearly had a sufficient basis to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that at least the three images from premiumhentai.site (Gov.'s Exs. 14a-13, 14a-14, 14a-15) were obscene. With respect to the other fifteen images, there is also sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding as to those images' obscenity, but the Court will only address these other images at a summary level rather than on an image-by-image basis. This is because the Court has already ruled at trial that a reasonable juror could have found these images to be obscene, and Defendant has offered no new arguments with respect to either the premiumhentai.site images or any of the other fifteen images that warrants a more in-depth response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    Koegel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3835535\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/777/1014/#p1024\">\n    777 F.Supp.2d at 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting in its analysis of the evidence supporting the defendant's \u00a7 1466A conviction that the defendant possessed some images that were obscene, but only analyzing the images on a summary basis rather than image by image).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Turning to the three images from premiumhentai.site (Gov.'s Exs. 14a-13, 14a-14, 14a-15), the jury had five pieces of evidence before them that, when viewed together with the graphic images themselves, demonstrated that the images came from works that were, on the whole, obscene. First, the jury was aware that these images came from a pornographic website that catered to viewers interested in sexual manga depictions of children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Exs. 14a-13, 14a-14, 14a-15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 198:7-9, 202:9-11 (explaining that premiumhentai.site offers downloads for \"shotacon\" and \"lolicon\" sets of images, and that it includes categories such as \"lolicon,\" \"lolicon 3d,\" \"lolicon images,\" \"lolicon video,\" \"shotacon,\" \"shotacon 3d,\" \"shotacon video,\" \"straight shotacon\" and \"uncensored hentai\"). As noted earlier, the jury was aware that \"lolicon\" refers to sexual portrayals of young girls and that \"shotacon\" refers to sexual portrayals of young boys. Thus, based on their knowledge of the nature of the website \"premiumhentai.site,\" the jury could infer that the contents of particular images or sets of images found on that site were likely to be obscene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Second, the jury was aware that two of these images (Gov.'s Exs. 14a-13, 14a-15) were each a part of a \"set\" of images and videos available on that site. The description of one set that was included in a screenshot gives a glimpse of the contents of the \"sets\" available on premiumhentai.site:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   The newest lolicon 3d image set by Vinput in perfect picture quality. Horny little loll girls posing naked and taking huge cocks inside their tight wet little pussies. This set contains 25 seconds of bonus animation video with cute naked dancing little girl, enjoy! Also, don't miss the others [sic] volumes!\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Gov.'s Ex. 14a-14 (listing 19 images and one video in the set). The two images also include information about the type of images that are included in the set, the name of the set's \"author,\" and the number of images in the set.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Ex. 14a-13 (\"Type: lolicon images | Author: Pororin | 27 pics\"); Gov.'s Ex. 14a-15 (\"Type: lolicon 3D images | Author: Wayfarer | 41 pics\"). The jury could thus conclude that, at most, the \"work as a whole\" for these images consisted of either 27 or 41 images, and that these images were of \"lolicon.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Third, in two of the screenshots the jury could see the various \"tags\" listed in the screenshot that apparently describe each set.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Ex. 14a-13 (\"Tags: anal, CG set, cum, cum in mouth, cute girls, full color, group, hard, hardcore, lolicon, nude, posing, rape, sex toys, slutty, sperm, underwear\"); Gov.'s Ex. 14a-15 (\"Tags: loli, black, cute girls, hard, hardcore, licking, lolicon, nude, posing, rape, slutty, sucking, very cute\"). While these tags speak to the obscene nature of those particular sets, the very fact that premiumhentai.site includes such tags at all speaks to the types of content found on that site. A reasonable juror could have concluded that these tags are a clear indication that the contents available on premiumhentai.site are geared towards pedophiles who are interested in manga images depicting minors engaged in sexual activity, and that the sets available at that site do not contain full manga\n   works of serious artistic, literary, or political value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Fourth, the jury also knew of the obscene titles for one image and one of the sets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Ex. 14a-13 (listing the title of the image as \"cum-in-mouth\"); Gov.'s Ex. 14a-14 (listing the title of the set as \"Vinput Lolicon 3D Pack\"). They could thus infer that these titles give some indication of the nature of the complete set of images, and that the full set was likely to contain further obscene sexual depictions of children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Finally, the jury also knew that an image appeared on a particular page within premiumhentai.site that advertised another site offering \"Only Best Shotacon.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Ex. 14a-14. As noted above, the minor in the advertisement is a young male making a lascivious display of the genitals. Based on this advertisement, the jury could make two inferences. First, they could infer that, within the context of the \"works\" being offered on premiumhentai.site, terms like \"shotacon\" refer to graphically sexual images done in the \"shotacon\" style, and not to full manga works that potentially have serious artistic or literary value. Second, the jury could infer that, because the party who placed the advertisement on premiumhentai.site appeared to believe that persons visiting that site would also want to visit another site displaying pornographic images of \"shotacon,\" the contents available on premiumhentai.site must be similar in kind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Based on all of the above, the evidence submitted by the Government was sufficient to support the jury's verdict with respect to the three images from premiumhentai.site. For the two such images that were part of sets of images available on premiumhentai.site (Gov.'s Exs. 14a-13, 14a-15), the jury could reasonably have concluded that those images were part of obscene works based on the graphic nature of the images themselves, the nature of premiumhentai.site, the nature of the sets available at premiumhentai.site, and the tags used to describe the sets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Exs. 14a-13, 14a-15. Second, the third such image - the visual depiction in Government's exhibit 14a-14 that is an advertisement featuring the young boy mentioned above - does not appear to have been part of a set or any other larger \"work as a whole,\" and thus the jury had a sufficient basis for concluding that that image was obscene as well based on the image itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   After the Government met its burden of producing enough evidence for the jury to find that the three images mentioned above were part of works that were obscene, the Defendant had the opportunity to rebut the Government's case by showing that some part of each \"work as a whole\" gave it serious literary, artistic, or political value. Defendant elected not to produce any part of the \"works as a whole\" for the jury to analyze. Defendant relied solely on Dr. Cather's testimony that these images might have had serious artistic or literary value when viewed as a part of the original manga work. The jury heard and considered Dr. Cather's testimony on this issue, and apparently they rejected her conclusion that works that graphically depict sexual relations with children could have serious artistic, literary, or political value under the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   test. As noted above, outside of generally claiming that all the images should be\n   judged in relation to the original manga works they come from, Defendant has never specifically addressed why the Government's evidence is insufficient to show that the images from premiumhentai.site are obscene. Given these circumstances, the Court concludes that a reasonable juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the images from premiumhentai.site were obscene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   With respect to the other fifteen images that the jury found to be obscene, these images similarly include indicia of the nature of each \"work as a whole\" from which the jury could infer each work's obscenity. This evidence consists of (1) the obscene nature of the images presented to the jury that depict graphic sexual activity with children, which gives some indication that each \"work as a whole\" is similarly obscene,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Gov.'s Ex. 14a-1a (showing a female toddler, whose hands are bound, being penetrated by an adult male); (2) the nature of the websites that hosted the underlying videos or images, which were all largely pornographic,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Gov.'s Ex. 14a-7a (noting that video was hosted on \"xHamster.com,\" which the parties agreed was a pornographic website); (3) the titles of the underlying videos or images,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Gov.'s Ex. 14a-8 (listing the title of the video as \"3d cute loli fucked hard\"); (4) the brief duration of some of the underlying videos (which suggests that these videos did not contain the types of deep storylines of serious literary value described by Dr. Cather),\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Gov.'s Ex. 14a-10 (listing the length of the video titled \"denis the menace fucks his mom\" at three minutes); (5) and the search terms that were used to return the image results on Bing.com,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Gov.'s Ex. 14a-2 (listing the search term as \"show images of Lolita sperm\"). Based on these indicia, the jury could have found that the other images came from works that were, on the whole, obscene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In view of the above, Defendant's Renewed Motion for Judgment of Acquittal on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict with respect to Count Two is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .

To convict Eychaner on this count, the Government had to prove: (1) that Eychaner destroyed or mutilated a tangible object, specifically a computer hard drive; (2) that he acted knowingly; and (3) that he acted with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence an investigation within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United States Government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201519\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While Defendant contends that he acted for a purpose other than seeking to impede the investigation of his crimes by the United States Probation Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, the circumstances suggest that he reasonably should have anticipated that an investigation would occur. Defendant claims to have thrown away the hard drive while he was on the way to work on November 18, 2016, which was before he confessed to viewing \"anime\n   child pornography.\" At that time, though he could not know for sure that his activities had been detected, he knew that he had been engaging in prohibited activities on a monitored computer. He thus could reasonably surmise that there was a risk that there would ultimately be an official investigation. Having already been subject to a forensic analysis of his laptop during his prior prosecution for possession of child pornography in 2008, Eychaner would have known how critical his laptop's hard drive would be to proving the full extent of his criminal activities. Based on the above circumstances, a reasonable juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that when Eychaner removed and threw away his laptop's hard drive, he acted with the specific intent of impeding an investigation of his activities by the United States Probation Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Therefore, Defendant's Renewed Motion for Judgment of Acquittal for Count Three is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .

To convict Eychaner on this count, the Government had to prove: (1) that Eychaner altered, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed any record, document, or tangible object, specifically a computer, computer battery, and computer hard drive; (2) that he acted with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability in an official proceeding, specifically in a federal grand jury investigation; and (3) that Eychaner acted corruptly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (1) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

CFA Jones explained to the jury the types of information and evidence that ordinarily would be contained on a computer hard drive. Officer Call outlined the procedure that she would have followed if CFA Jones had been able to conduct a forensic analysis of Eychaner's laptop computer. The jury was also aware of Defendant's prior conviction for possession of child pornography, and they could infer that Eychaner knew that his laptop and hard drive would ultimately become subject to forensic analysis. Thus, the jury had sufficient evidence before them to determine that Eychaner had destroyed, mutilated, or concealed the laptop, the laptop's battery, and the hard drive to impair each object's availability at an official proceeding, and that he acted with a corrupt intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Therefore, Defendant's Renewed Motion for Judgment of Acquittal for Count Four is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .

In Count Five, Eychaner was charged with a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2260A, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Whoever, being required by Federal or other law to register as a sex offender, commits a felony offense\n   <em>\n    involving a minor\n   </em>\n   under section 1201, 1466A, 1470, 1591, 2241, 2242, 2243, 2244, 2245, 2251, 2251A, 2260, 2421, 2422, 2423, or 2425, shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years in addition to the imprisonment imposed for the offense under that provision.

At trial, Defendant moved for acquittal on Count Five on the ground that the term \"involving a minor\" requires the participation of an actual\n   <em>\n    person\n   </em>\n   who is under the age of eighteen, and that there was no evidence supporting a finding that such element was satisfied here. Def.'s Count Five Acq. Br., ECF No. 75. Defendant's motion, presented for the first time in the midst of trial, raised an issue of statutory interpretation to be analyzed at the conclusion of the Government's case-in-chief and again before submission of the case to the jury, and without the benefit of time for further reflection. The Court ultimately denied the motion based on the information presented by the parties at that time, but stated that, should Defendant renew his motion after trial, the Court would give it careful consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Court later instructed the jury that there are two elements to this offense: (1) that Eychaner committed a specified felony offense involving a minor, specifically a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1466A(a) (1) ; and (2) that at the time he committed the specified felony offense, Eychaner was required by Federal or other law to register as a sex offender.

Section 2256 (1) of Title 18 provides the relevant definitions for offenses involving the term \"minor\" under Chapter 110, including \u00a7 2260A. A \"minor\" is defined as \"any\n   <em>\n    person\n   </em>\n   under the age of eighteen years.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202256\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (emphasis added).

Black's Law Dictionary similarly defines person as \"[i]n general usage, a human being[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Person, Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (6th ed. 1990). Webster's Third New International Dictionary likewise defines \"person\" as primarily connoting an actual human being.\n   <em>\n    See Person, Webster's Third New International Dictionary Unabridged\n   </em>\n   (1993) (defining \"person\" as \"an individual human being,\" \"a human being as distinguished from an animal or thing,\" \"the individual personality of a human being: self,\" \"a human being, a body of persons, or a corporation, partnership, or other legal entity that is recognized by law as the subject of rights and duties\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The above definitions each favor a narrow reading of \"person.\" Because the term \"minor\" under \u00a7 2256(1) requires a \"person,\" and because the term \"minor\" in \u00a7 2260A is not qualified by the words \"virtual,\" \"imaginary,\" or another modifier, the dictionary definitions of \"person\" apply to the term \"minor\" in \u00a7 2260A. As a result, \"person\" is ordinarily or naturally understood to mean \"an individual human being\" or \"an individual with legal status.\" Hence, because \"minor\" is defined as a \"person\", and a \"person\" is an individual human being with legal status, the Court concludes that the word \"minor\" unambiguously means an actual person who is, or who is at least believed to be,\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   under the age of eighteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The Government has failed to explain how a fictional character can qualify as a \"person\" under the definition of \"minor\" in \u00a7 2256(1). The Government asserts that \u00a7 2256(1)'s definition of minor \"simply imposes an age cutoff in defining the term 'minor,' and that cutoff is satisfied here.\" Gov.'s Opp'n Br. 13, ECF No. 91. While it is true that \u00a7 2256(1)'s definition does impose an age cutoff, it also requires that the age cutoff be applied to a \"person.\" The Government simply ignores the word \"person\" in the definition of \"minor,\" as that term is used in the statutory offense ( \u00a7 2260A ), and then moves on to analyze the particular predicate offense under \u00a7 1466A. The Government points out that, because \u00a7 1466A criminalizes obscene\n   <em>\n    depictions\n   </em>\n   of minors regardless of whether the minors depicted actually exist, somehow this means that the term \"minor\" in \u00a7 2260A must be equally broad. Gov.'s Opp'n Br. 13. At the risk of stating the obvious, the term \"depiction of a minor\" is different from the term \"minor,\" standing alone. A depiction inherently carries with it the possibility that the subject of the depiction might not exist in the real world. The term \"minor\" has, as mentioned above, a default meaning referring to a person in the real world. If \u00a7 2260A used a phrase such as \"involving a depiction of a minor under Section 1466A\" instead of \"involving a minor,\" then the Government's point would be well taken. However, \u00a7 2260A, as written, requires the involvement of a minor, which, as defined, requires the participation of a \"person.\" That requirement is not met by the involvement of a cartoon character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Plain Meaning of the Term \"Involving a Minor\" in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2260A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Next, the Court notes that the specific context for the word \"minor\" in \u00a7 2260A is the clause \"[w]hoever ... commits a felony offense\n   <em>\n    involving\n   </em>\n   a minor[.]\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2260A (emphasis added). Dictionaries provide various definitions for the word \"involve,\" but the term primarily means to include or contain as a necessary element.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines \"involve\" as \"to have within or as a part of itself\" or \"to draw in as a participant.\"\n   <em>\n    Involve, Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged\n   </em>\n   (2003). The Oxford English Dictionary defines \"involve\" as \"to include; to contain, imply.\"\n   <em>\n    Involve, The Compact Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , (2d ed. 1991). Utilizing these definitions, the Court concludes that the phrase \"commits a felony offense involving a minor\" should simply be read as \"commits a felony offense that includes a minor as a part of the offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Read this way, there is no ambiguity to the phrase \"involving a minor.\" When this element of \u00a7 2260A is applied to an offense under \u00a7 1466A, a minor is \"involved\" in the offense when the minor is the subject of the visual depiction, such as when the visual depiction is a photograph of an actual child engaged in sexually explicit conduct. A minor might conceivably also be \"involved\" in the offense if the minor serves as an inspiration for a particular visual depiction. For example, if a defendant draws a sexually explicit picture of a minor with whom he had a sexual encounter in the past, one might argue that the minor is \"involved\" as the subject of the offense. A minor is not \"involved\" in the offense, however, when the depiction in question involves a fictional cartoon character with no relation to any actual person in the real world.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Broader Context of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2260A as a Whole\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Having considered the plain meaning of the phrase \"involving a minor\" and found it to be unambiguous, the Court now turns to the broader context of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2260A as a whole. In addition to \u00a7 1466A, \u00a7 2260A lists fifteen other predicate offenses that can potentially \"involve a minor\" for purposes of that section. All the other predicate offenses necessarily require the involvement of an actual person besides the defendant in order to commit the offense. Of the other predicate offenses, six always require the involvement of a minor as an element of the offense,\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   while nine can be committed with a minor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   For all of these offenses, however, a minor can only conceivably be \"involved\" as either the actual or the intended victim of the crime. Thus, because Congress specifically chose other predicate offenses for \u00a7 2260A where the term \"involving\n   a minor\" captures those offenses in which a minor either is or is intended to be the victim, one might infer that Congress intended that phrase to have the same application when \u00a7 1466A serves as the predicate offense. Because no minor is victimized when a defendant commits an offense under \u00a7 1466A involving a fictional cartoon character, this raises an inference that an offense under \u00a7 1466A involving a fictional cartoon character does not satisfy the \"involving a minor\" element of \u00a7 2260A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Also a part of the broader context of \u00a7 2260A is the specific predicate offense at issue, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1466A. In relevant part, \u00a7 1466A criminalizes the attempted receipt of \"a visual depiction of any kind, including a drawing, cartoon, sculpture, or painting, that ... depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct ... [and] is obscene.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1466A(a) (1). The Fourth Circuit has held that the \"depicts a minor\" element of the statute can be satisfied either by a depiction of an actual minor or by a cartoon representation of a minor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Whorley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051536\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/326/\">\n    550 F.3d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 336 (4th Cir. 2008). A cartoon representation qualifies under the statute because \u00a7 1466A states that \"[i]t is not a required element of any offense\n   <em>\n    under this section\n   </em>\n   that the minor depicted actually exist.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1466A(c) (emphasis added). The inclusion of this latter provision also leads to two inferences relevant to the Court's understanding of \u00a7 2260A. First, the very fact that Congress felt the need to include a statement in \u00a7 1466A clarifying that a minor need not exist to satisfy the requirement that the depiction \"depicts a minor\" suggests that the term \"minor,\" standing alone, would naturally refer to a minor that actually exists. Second, because Congress stated that the minor depicted need not exist for any offense \"under this section,\" Congress clearly indicated that \u00a7 1466A(c) should only apply to offenses under \u00a7 1466A. As 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2260A is not an offense under \u00a7 1466A, the Court finds no reason to believe that Congress intended that the term \"minor\" in \u00a7 2260A should be defined by \u00a7 1466A(c) to include \"minors\" who do not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In view of the above, the broader context of \u00a7 2260A as a whole does not establish that the phrase \"involving a minor\" in \u00a7 2260A is ambiguous. Because the language at issue in \u00a7 2260A, the specific context of that language, and the broader context of that language as a whole all lean toward the narrow reading of the word \"minor\" in \u00a7 2260A, the phrase \"involving a minor\" is not susceptible to two reasonable interpretations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342334\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/626/#p631\">\n    802 F.3d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631 (4th Cir. 2015), and it is therefore not ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Court Finds No Reason to Apply the Principle of\n    <em>\n     In Pari Materia\n    </em>\n    to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2260A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Government's primary remaining argument for finding that \u00a7 2260A's \"involving a minor\" requirement is satisfied here is based on a comparison of \u00a7 2260A with another criminal statute that uses the term \"actual minor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Opp'n Br. 14 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a) (3) (B) ). According to the Government, because Congress has proven able to use the term \"actual minor\" in other criminal statutes, then the failure to include a similar modifier like \"actual\" before the term \"minor\" in \u00a7 2260A suggests that Congress intended the term minor to include both actual and non-actual minors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342334\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/626/#p631\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Because the Government asks this Court to construe \u00a7 2260A in light of a separate statute to reach an understanding that is different from the plain meaning of \u00a7 2260A, it appears that the Government is asking this Court to apply the rule of\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   to \u00a7 2260A.

To illustrate why, consider the following example: Imagine that a director films a modern rendition of Romeo and Juliet that a reasonable person would find, on the whole, has serious literary and artistic value. Also assume that the director believes it is important to include a scene in which the lovers, who are played by young teenagers, actually have sex on screen. Under the\n    <em>\n     Miller\n    </em>\n    test, this sex scene would not render the whole film obscene because the work as a whole has serious artistic and literary value. If, however, this film were placed on a website, and the Bing.com search engine captured a thumbnail image from the sex scene, then that single image, standing in isolation, might be obscene. Under the Government's theory, it would potentially be proper to prosecute someone for attempting to receive that image if they view it in a Bing.com image search, even though the search result would clearly indicate to the viewer that the image comes from another larger work and that underlying work itself is not obscene.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    Adopting the Government's view would contravene the Supreme Court's repeated instructions that individual scenes from a work should not be viewed in isolation if those scenes are presented in connection with the larger work.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ashcroft v.

As the evidence showed a trial, image results from Bing.com are presented in connection with the underlying websites because they include a link in the images that informs the viewer that the image comes from the underlying website. Thus, because each image result on Bing.com is presented in connection with the \"work as a whole\" hosted on the underlying website, the obscenity of the image result should be judged in relation to the work presented on the underlying website.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    Defendant's theory - that the Government must always find and present the full original manga work in order to have a prosecution for any image related to the original work, even if an isolated portion is intentionally removed and placed on a website - is unsupported by caselaw and would effectively immunize defendants from prosecution for receiving and possessing certain obscene images. To illustrate the latter issue, consider the following examples: An artist creates an obscene manga work and uploads a few isolated images from that work to the Internet. The artist then locks the original work in a vault, never to be seen again. According to Defendant, no prosecution could ever occur for an offense related to those images because the Government would never be able to present the \"work as a whole\" to the jury. Thus, defendants would always be able to enjoy these obscene images free from worry of prosecution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    Or consider a second scenario: an artist draws a single obscene image that superficially looks as if it might have come from a larger work. According to Defendant's theory, because the image looks as if it might come from a larger work, the Government could only prosecute someone for receiving this obscene image if they found the underlying work, which does not exist. Thus, under this second scenario, Defendant's theory would once again set an impossible burden for proving that the \"work as a whole\" is obscene, and it would allow defendants to thwart Congress's clear intent to criminalize the receipt or possession of such obscene images.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    For example, assume that there is an original, non-obscene anime work that is two hours long, of which three minutes consists of an explicit sex scene involving children. If one were to take the three-minute sex scene and place it on a website in a manner that does not indicate to the viewer that the scene comes from a larger work, then that isolated scene would become the new \"work as a whole\" to be analyzed. If a search engine, say Bing.com, then captures an individual thumbnail image from that three-minute scene that later appears in a defendant's image search, then the correct \"work as a whole\" for that Bing.com image is still the three-minute video on the underlying website.

The Court engaged in this\n    <em>\n     in pari materia\n    </em>\n    construction primarily because the Court believed that the Eleventh Circuit had engaged in a similar construction in\n    <em>\n     Slaughter. See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Slaughter\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541719\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/1208/\">\n     708 F.3d at 1215-16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (engaging in an alternative\n    <em>\n     in pari materia\n    </em>\n    analysis, though not labeling it as such). While the Court has already held that an\n    <em>\n     in pari materia\n    </em>\n    construction of \u00a7 2260A is not warranted here based on its review of Fourth Circuit precedent, the Court notes now that, having had time to reflect on the matter, it would in any case reach a different conclusion about what inference could be drawn from a direct comparison between \u00a7 2260A and \u00a7 2252A(a) (3) (B). Section \u00a7 2252A(a) (3) (B) criminalizes various activities for materials that are or contain:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n    (i) an obscene visual depiction\n    <em>\n     of a minor\n    </em>\n    engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n    (ii) a visual depiction\n    <em>\n     of an actual minor\n    </em>\n    engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541719\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/1208/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (emphasis added). In the context of the statute, the inclusion of the phrase \"of an actual minor\" in \u00a7 2252A(a) (3) (B) (ii) makes sense when set off against the phrase \"of a minor\" in \u00a7 2252A(a) (3) (B) (i). When the two phrases are read together, it is clear that Congress intended the term \"minor\" to be broader than the term \"actual minor.\" The only clear inference to be drawn from this statute, then, is that when Congress explicitly uses the terms \"actual minor\" and \"minor\" in the same statute, then Congress intends the term minor to potentially include non-actual minors. If \u00a7 2260A had a similar structure, with phrasing such as \"involving a minor under Section 1466A, or involving an actual minor\" under the other predicate offenses, then the phrase \"involving a minor\" would be similarly broad. However, Congress did not write \u00a7 2260A with that phrasing, and thus the comparison to \u00a7 2252A is inapposite.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    The Court also notes that the Government has failed to point to any statute in which Congress has used the term \"minor,\" standing alone, to unambiguously refer to minors who do not exist. Given this context, the Court finds the Government's argument that the term \"minor\" in \u00a7 2260A includes fictional minors to be unpersuasive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
