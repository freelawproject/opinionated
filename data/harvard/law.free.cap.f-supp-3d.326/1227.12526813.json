[FS 744 p. 5] In October 2015, BLM approved an oil and gas lease sale for thirteen parcels of federal minerals covering 19,788 acres thereof. [Doc. 26 p. 11; BLM 10206, 10212] The parcels were reviewed by the USFS to ensure that leasing would be in conformance with the applicable SFNF plans and, after imposing certain stipulations, the USFS determined that it did not object to the parcels being leased. [BLM 11314-15] The thirteen parcels are located within the easternmost part of the San Juan Basin, which is one of the United States' largest natural gas fields-containing approximately 14,995 natural gas wells as of 2012. [Doc. 26 p. 11; BLM 13091, 10271, 15447]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A lengthy history involving various agencies studying, analyzing, and evaluating the impact of oil and gas leasing in the relevant portion of the SFNF precedes the agencies' decision to issue the thirteen leases that are the subject of Plaintiff's appeal. Briefly stated, with further discussion provided as necessary in the body of this Opinion, the following actions were taken beginning in 1987.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A 1987 land resource management plan (the \"Forest Plan\") for the SFNF that contemplated oil and gas leasing in the San Juan Basin was created. [FS 1030, 1099] Over time, the San Juan Basin became \"one of the most strategic gas producing basins to the U.S. economy[.]\" [BLM 13508] By 1999, oil and natural gas valued at $2.46 billion was produced from the basin. [BLM 13508] From 1998-2012, BLM received several expressions of interest from the oil and gas industry related to further oil and gas leasing in the SFNF; however, because the 1987 Forest Plan was outdated and was insufficient by NEPA standards, BLM could not issue new oil and gas leases. [Doc. 26 p. 11; FS 2719, 4734, 9029, 10097, 10098, 10100, 11736, 11740, 13742, 15860, 16165]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Therefore, in 2000, a \"core team\" of BLM, United States Bureau of Reclamation, and Forest Service staff began working to identify issues and develop project descriptions and alternatives to develop a resource management plan, examining, among other things, oil and gas leasing and development. [BLM 15447-48] In 2003, BLM issued the \"Farmington Resource Management Plan with Record of Decision\" (the 2003 RMP) and a \"Final Environmental Impact Statement\" (Final EIS)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   pertaining to the New Mexico portion of the San Juan Basin. [BLM 15433, 15447, 15439] Ultimately, because the 2003 RMP and the Final EIS did not satisfy Forest Service NEPA requirements, no new oil and gas leases were issued. [Doc. 26 p. 11-12; BLM 13091]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Since the 2003 RMP did not adequately address Forest Service NEPA requirements, and because the USFS had identified the need to update the 1987 Forest Plan, the Forest Service conducted a planning-level NEPA analysis in 2006. [Doc. 26 p. 12; FS 9489-90; BLM 13023] The 2006 analysis examined the potential effects of oil and gas development in the SFNF. [BLM 13091] In 2006, a draft EIS was produced, and notice of its availability was published in the Federal Register. [BLM 13023] After addressing and correcting a \"significant issue\" that affected the EIS, a Final EIS and Record of Decision was issued by the Forest Service in 2008. [BLM 13023-24]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   WildEarth Guardians (one of the Plaintiffs in this lawsuit) appealed the 2008 Record of Decision, and \"the USFS Appeal Reviewing Officer remanded the Final EIS to the USFS for additional work on air quality.\" [Doc. 26 p. 12; BLM 13024] After completing a supplemental analysis of air quality, the Forest Service issued a draft supplement to the Final EIS; this document was subject to a comment period ending in November, 2010. [Doc. 26 p. 12; BLM 13024] Then, in 2012, the Forest Service prepared a \"final supplement to the final environmental impact statement\" (FSFEIS) which analyzed air quality data from 2006-2011, and included data from a new air quality monitoring station. [Doc. 26 p. 13; BLM 13088] These analyses were used by the Forest Service in 2012 to amend the 1987 Forest Plan to permit oil and gas leasing. [Doc. 26 p. 13; BLM 13042-44]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In 2013, the Forest Service reviewed the 2008 Final EIS and the 2012 FSFEIS and concluded that they were \"adequate for offering lands for competitive leasing.\" [Doc. 26 p. 13; Doc. 22 p. 23-24; FS 16204] The Forest Service notified BLM of its decision and of stipulations applicable to each enumerated parcel of land. [Doc. 26 p.13-14; FS 16204] BLM, which served as a \"cooperating agency for the preparation\" of the EIS, adopted the FEIS, as supplemented, concluding that it was adequate under NEPA to issue oil and gas leases. [Doc. 26 p. 14; BLM 13016]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In 2015, BLM issued a \"Decision Record\" and Environmental Assessment approving for lease the 13 parcels of federal minerals at issue here subject to surface use stipulations mandated by the Forest Service. [Doc. 26 p. 14; BLM 10206] In so doing, BLM reviewed three alternative proposed actions-a \"No Action\" alternative denying or rejecting expressions of interest to lease during an October 2014 competitive oil and gas lease sale (Alternative A); a proposed action that would lease twenty-five parcels covering 23,325.4 acres (Alternative B); and Alternative C, the \"preferred alternative,\" which BLM ultimately selected. [BLM 10219-32] The proposed action encompassed within the preferred alternative was reviewed by BLM biologists and by USFS staff for its effects on:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   energy minerals; soils, watershed management and water resources; air quality; vegetation; wildlife; threatened and endangered species; cultural resources; visual resources; wild and scenic river eligibility; wilderness; social and economic resources; environmental justice; social environment; economics; recreation; rangeland and livestock grazing; fire management; public health; climate; geology; lithology, and cumulative effects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [BLM 10210] Native American tribes were notified of the proposed action, and continual tribal consultation is being conducted by the Forest Service. [BLM 10210]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Environmental Assessment included an analysis of the effects the proposed action would have on: wildlife, special status species, and migratory birds; air quality and climate; water quality; soil resources; dark sky resources; cultural resources and landscapes; socio economics; environmental justice; and the Old Spanish Trail. [BLM 10218, 10234-64] The Environmental Assessment tiered to and incorporated the Forest Service's 2003 RMP, the 2008 FEIS, and the 2012 FSFEIS. [BLM 10216, 10210; BLM 11317, 11325] BLM determined that preparation of an EIS was not warranted based on a FONSI concluding that \"[t]he impacts of leasing the fluid mineral estate in the [relevant areas] [were] analyzed in the 2003 RMP, [in a] 2002 Biological Assessment, and the Final EIS\" issued by the Forest Service in 2012. [BLM 10213; Doc. 26 p. 14] After denying several administrative protests of its decision, BLM issued the 13 leases.

It is currently not feasible to predict with certainty the net impacts from a proposed action on global or regional climate. That is, while BLM actions may contribute to climate change, the specific effects of those actions on global or regional climate are not quantifiable. Therefore, the BLM does not have the ability to associate an action's contribution in a localized area to impacts on global climate change. As climate models improve in their sensitivity and predictive capacity, the BLM will incorporate those tools into NEPA analysis at that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   [BLM 12623] The ARTR nonetheless describes various potential impacts of climate change which could occur in the southwest, including: a drier climate and soils; a change in the spatial range for cool season plant species; loss of habitat for animal species and a shift in their ranges; and less snowmelt and a potential impact on water resources and the species dependent on those resources.

The lack of scientific tools designed to predict climate change on regional or local scales limits the ability to quantify potential future impacts.

Air Quality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Plaintiffs make a three-part argument that BLM failed to take a hard look at the impact of the leases on air quality. [Doc. 22 p. 36-38] First, Plaintiffs argue that BLM \"fail[ed] to quantify the foreseeable direct emissions of criteria pollutants that will result\n   <em>\n    from the proposed action.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. 22, pp. 36-37] Second, without pointing to a particular failing, Plaintiffs argue that BLM's analysis of the cumulative impacts to air quality was insufficient, because \"the NAAQS are not the sole measuring standards for assessing whether lease development will significantly affect air quality.\" [Doc. 22, pp. 37-38] Finally, Plaintiffs argue that \"BLM failed to aggregate or model the cumulative air quality effects of the lease sale with all other actions impacting air quality in the planning area.\" [Doc. 22, p. 38] In making these arguments, Plaintiffs do not acknowledge that BLM's decision tiered to and incorporated the Forest Service's 2012 FSFEIS. [BLM 10234] The Court concludes that the 2012 FSFEIS conducts all of the analyses which Plaintiffs assert are lacking, and thus the Court cannot conclude that BLM failed to take a hard look at the effects of the leasing decision on air quality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The FSFEIS estimated emissions from development of new oil and gas leases in\n   the SFNF. [BLM 13107-11] Therein, the Forest Service examined impacts to air quality that are caused in the first 1-2 months during which new wells are developed, including the pollution that results from constructing roads, pipelines, and well pads; drilling wells; and completion fracturing. [BLM 13107-08] It also looked at emissions from later, day-to-day operations that will impact air quality. [BLM 13108] It analyzed \"modeling studies\" to assess potential impacts and concluded that \"[d]ue to the small number of wells that may be developed ... it was impractical to directly model the emissions[.]\" [BLM 13109] These analyses looked specifically at the likely emissions produced under a maximum development scenario, of 20 wells, for all six criteria pollutants. [BLM 13110-11] The Forest Service also compared the predicted construction emissions to WRAP 2006 and 2012 estimates\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   for all criteria pollutants. [BLM 13111] Utilizing various modeling studies, the Forest Service concluded that constructing and operating the wells was not likely to lead to an exceedance of current national or New Mexico air quality standards, however, if the standard for ozone was reduced, the emissions could have a significant effect of contributing toward an exceedance of the standard. [BLM 13112-13] In the Record Decision, BLM concluded that \"[t]he potential amounts of ozone precursor emissions of NOx and VOCs from the proposed lease sale on not expected to impact the current design value for ozone in San Juan County under either of the action alternatives.\" [BLM 10269] The Forest Service also concluded that the \"impacts from 20 wells would be less than significant even at nearby San Pedro Parks Wilderness.\" [BLM 13111] The Court concludes that the analysis above, inclusive of the 2012 FSFEIS, to which the Record Decision was tiered, meets the \"hard look\" requirements of NEPA with regard to the impact of the action on criteria pollutants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that the cumulative impact analysis was insufficient with regard to air quality. [Doc. 22, pp. 37-38] They argue that \"the NAAQS are not the sole measuring standards for assessing whether lease development will significantly affect air quality.\" [Doc. 22, pp. 37] However, Plaintiffs point to no particular factor or impact which BLM failed to consider in its cumulative air quality impact analysis, nor does this Court find any such failure. In the 2012 FSFEIS, the Forest Service stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   Emissions from oil and gas well operation sources could disperse for long distances downwind and contribute to cumulative visibility impacts in PSD Class I areas and/or ozone impacts in areas nearing ozone nonattainment. Even though the contribution of impacts from this project is small and less than significant within the study area, the impact could become significant on a cumulative basis if it would cause or add to a new or existing problem of visibility degradation or ozone nonattainment. If the ozone NAAQs were to be lowered at any time in the next 20 years, any additional contribution of these pollutants could become a significant impact. Cumulative impacts could be reduced with application of recommended mitigation measures, but these would be far more effective if applied across the basin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   [BLM 13113] The Forest Service determined that the cumulative effects from development of 20 wells would be \"adverse, but less than significant, in that\n   their development would not result in [exceedances] of State or Federal air quality standards, nor increases in visibility degradation at nearby Class I areas.\" [BLM 13113] Given this analysis, the Court cannot find that BLM arbitrarily failed to consider the impact of non-criteria air pollutants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that \"BLM failed to aggregate or model the cumulative air quality effects of the lease sale with all other actions impacting air quality in the planning area.\" [Doc. 22, p. 38] However, considering the tiered to FSFEIS and incorporated ARTR, the Court rejects this argument. The FSFEIS observed that the area is not a \"high density well area\" but that even if it were, modeling \"indicated that (1) maximum modeled impact concentrations would be less than national or New Mexico ambient air quality standards and (2) risks from exposure to hazardous air pollutants would be less than significant.\" [BLM 13112] Between this analysis and the analysis in the EA accounting for an additional 20 wells, the Court concludes that BLM adequately considered the cumulative air quality effects of the lease sale along with all other actions impacting air quality in the planning area. The Court concludes that BLM did not fail to take a \"hard look\" at the air quality impacts of its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Water Resources\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the agencies failed to analyze the impacts of the leasing decision on water quantity, groundwater quality, and surface water quality. [Doc. 22 p. 39-42] The Court considers these arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Water Quantity\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   BLM identified the primary aquifers in the area and described their depth, formation, thickness, recharge areas, transmissivity, and quality. BLM also noted that ground water is \"readily available\" in most of the planning area but that its quality is \"fair to poor.\" [BLM 10251-52] With regard to potential water use by oil and gas wells, BLM stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   [F]racturing fluid is typically more than 99 percent water and sand, with small amounts of readily available chemical additives used to control the chemical and mechanical properties of the water and sand mixture.... Because the fluid is composed mostly of water, large volumes of water are usually needed to perform hydraulic fracturing. However, in some cases, water is recycled or produced water is used.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   [BLM 10293] Finally, with regard to the potential impact of hydraulic fracturing on water quantity, BLM stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   [t]he water used for hydraulic fracturing in the Farmington Field Office generally comes from permitted groundwater wells, although surface water may occasionally be used. Because large volumes of water are needed for hydraulic fracturing, the use of groundwater for this purpose might contribute to the drawdown of groundwater aquifer levels. Groundwater use is permitted and managed by the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, and these water rights have already been designated. In addition, the use of water for hydraulic fracturing is one of many uses of groundwater in the Farmington Field Office. Other uses include irrigation, industrial mining operations, and domestic and livestock use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   [BLM 10276] In addition, in letters denying protests, BLM explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   The amount of water used during well development is highly dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to: vertical or horizontal well, length of well bore, closed-loop or reserve pit drilling system, type of mud, type of stimulation used (e.g. hydraulic fracturing or acidizing), formation being\n   fractured, and use of recycled water or inert gases. Therefore the amount of water that could actually be used is too speculative to reasonably quantify at the leasing stage. When an [application for a permit to drill] is received a quantitative analysis can be completed....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   In response to the high demand for and the lack of availability of water in the San Juan Basin, operators have successfully developed fracturing techniques that use considerably less water by substituting inert gases such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide as the carrier of the fluid for the frack. These can replace up to 95 percent of the water used for the frack fluids. The BLM encourages operators to utilize this new technology to lessen the impact of oil and gas development on the water availability in the area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   [BLM 11323, 11341]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that BLM's failure to quantify how much water will be required for the development of the thirteen leases and to drill and fracture each well fell short of the \"hard look\" requirement imposed by NEPA. [Doc. 22 p. 39] Plaintiffs also argue that BLM's consideration of the issue of water quantity is arbitrary because \"[t]here is no discussion of how the groundwater drawdown from lease development will impact the land, forests, wildlife, livestock, or human communities in the planning area, or how these impacts are further compounded in a drought-stricken southwest, which is poised to worsen in the face of climate change.\" [Doc. 22, p. 40] In their brief, Defendants do not rely on the reasoning in the EA-that ground water is managed by the State Engineer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, consistent with their protest responses, Defendants argue that BLM determined that the amount of water well operators may use is too speculative to quantify at the leasing stage, but a quantitative analysis would be possible at the permitting stage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. 26, p. 26]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \"[A]ssessment of all 'reasonably foreseeable' impacts must occur at the earliest practicable point, and must take place before an 'irretrievable commitment of resources' is made.\"\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3643558\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/683/#p716\">\n    565 F.3d at 715, 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted) (concluding that sufficient information was available at the leasing stage to determine how many wells would be built based on production levels of existing nearby wells and that \"BLM acted arbitrarily by concluding without apparent evidentiary support that impacts on the Aquifer would be minimal\").

[BLM 10253] Based on these analyses, the Court concludes that BLM met the hard look requirement by examining the current state of the water, the potential risks associated with its leasing decision, mitigation measures, and the prospective monitoring of water quality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Surface Water\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that BLM failed to discuss the severity of potential impacts to surface water and failed to address mitigation measures to reduce such impacts. [Doc. 22 p. 32]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   In regard to the impacts of its leasing decision on surface water quality, the 2008 FEIS recognized that the development of new oil and gas wells has the potential to affect surface water quality owing to the surface-disturbing activities inherent in well development and use. [BLM 13323] The effects include potential contribution to degradation of streams downstream from the new developments, primarily through sedimentation. [Id.] To mitigate the potentially harmful effects on surface water of new well development and use, no surface occupancy stipulations apply \"on steep, unstable soils and would minimize surface-disturbing activities that interfere with natural drainage and vegetative cover, resulting in the potential for minimal erosion and sedimentation[.]\" [BLM 13322] As well, BLM stated that it would impose \"[t]iming limitations on drilling operation and construction activities [which] would also reduce the risk of accidental spill or leakage into streams during winter and spring[.]\" [BLM 13322] Under the lease terms, surface occupancy or use is subject to \"special operating constraints\"-particularly requirements that facilities be located at least 100 meters away from drainages and riparian areas that access roads and drainage crossings include site-specific mitigation to control sedimentation. [BLM 13478] Finally, BLM explained in its letters denying protests, that spills and leaks \"are rare and unforeseeable events, [therefore] it would be inappropriate to quantitatively estimate the volumes of oil or brine leaks and spills, and their environmental consequences.\" [BLM 11323] Based on these analyses, the Court concludes that BLM met its obligation to take a hard look at the impact of the proposed action on surface water quality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Cumulative Impact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   In their final \"hard look\" argument, Plaintiffs argue that BLM failed to take a hard look at the cumulative impact of lease development on specific resources. [Doc. 22 p. 43] Based on the Court's holdings above, BLM will need to conduct a new cumulative impacts analysis. Accordingly, the Court does not address this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Additional Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Plaintiffs also make the following arguments: BLM failed to provide a convincing statement of reasons to justify its decision to forego preparation of an environmental impact statement [Doc. 22, p. 45]; BLM unlawfully issued the leases causing prejudice and limiting the choice of alternatives in the pending resource management plan amendment [Doc. 22, p. 50]; and the Forest Service failed to take a hard look at oil and gas leasing and failed to consider new\n   significant information and circumstances [Doc. 22, p. 53]. Given that this matter must be remanded for BLM to conduct a new analysis of the proposed action on various environmental impacts, the Court deems it unnecessary and unwise to address these arguments, which may become moot based on BLM's revised analysis or based on changes in circumstances after the EA and leases were issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Relief\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   In their\n   <em>\n    Petition\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs seek the following relief: that this Court declare that \"Defendants' leasing decisions violate NEPA and its implementing regulations\"; that this Court vacate and remand the leasing decisions; that this Court enjoin Defendants from any further leasing authorizations pending \"full compliance with NEPA and its implementing regulations\"; that this Court retain jurisdiction over this matter until Defendants remedy the violations of law; and fees, costs, and expenses under the EAJA.
