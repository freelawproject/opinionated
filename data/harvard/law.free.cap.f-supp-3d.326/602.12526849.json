Durkin, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Alarm Detections Systems, Inc. is a company that provides fire alarm services to commercial and multi-unit residential buildings. It alleges that the Orland Fire Protection District (\"Orland FPD\") and Tyco Integrated Security, LLC have conspired to restrain or monopolize trade in the market for fire alarm system monitoring in violation of the Sherman and Clayton Acts and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendments. The case proceeded to a bench trial on May 22, 2017, and the Court received evidence through May 26, 2017. Initial post-trial briefing was completed on June 26, 2017, and the Court heard closing arguments on August 10, 2017. The parties submitted supplemental post-trial briefs on June 7, 2018, at the Court's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This opinion sets forth the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a). These findings are based on the documentary evidence and trial testimony. They are also based on the Court's credibility determinations after observing the witnesses testify. This opinion also addresses Alarm Detection's motion to reconsider the Court's earlier dismissal of part of the Fourteenth Amendment claims. R. 488. For the following reasons, the Court finds in favor of Orland FPD and Tyco on the merits and will enter judgment against Alarm Detection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Companies like Alarm Detection and Tyco install fire alarms (meaning the fire sensors and the transmitters that send alarm signals) in commercial and multi-unit residential buildings, and then monitor the transmitted signals for indications of fire or a need for maintenance of the alarms. Various technological systems can be used to monitor fire alarm signals. The systems relevant to this case are (1) central station and (2) direct connect. In a central station system, an alarm company establishes one facility to receive alarm signals indicating the presence of fire from multiple governmental jurisdictions and then relays those signals to the relevant jurisdiction's fire department 911 dispatch center. In a direct connect system, fire alarm transmitters send alarm signals directly to the relevant 911 dispatch center, without passing through a central station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Some jurisdictions accommodate both direct connect and central station fire alarm\n   monitoring. At issue in this case, however, are jurisdictions that have enacted ordinances requiring buildings to send fire alarm signals directly to the jurisdiction's 911 dispatch center. The Illinois appellate court has held that Illinois municipalities have statutory authority to mandate a direct connect fire alarm monitoring system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alarm Detection Sys., Inc. v.

Similarly, the Seventh Circuit has held that Illinois fire protection districts have statutory authority to mandate direct connect systems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ADT Sec.

A fire protection district is administered by an elected board of trustees. \"The Board of Trustees of any fire protection district ... may contract with any corporation organized to furnish fire protection service.\" 70 ILCS 705/11a. The jurisdictional entities relevant to this case are Defendant Orland FPD and non-parties the Village of Orland Hills and the Village of Orland Park. The Villages of Orland Park and Orland Hills together constitute more than 98% of the geographic territory comprised by Orland FPD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 501 at 1 n.1 (citing R. 472 at 278 (635:18-25) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A governmental entity desiring to implement a \"direct connect\" system for receipt of fire alarm signals at its 911 dispatch center generally hires an alarm company to provide reception equipment, and sometimes staff, at the 911 dispatch center. Fire alarm companies must obtain a license from the FCC to use a certain signal frequency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 472 at 345 (702:7-13). An alarm company's transmission and reception equipment will be calibrated to the frequency the alarm company has licensed. Thus, when a governmental entity hires an alarm company to establish a 911 dispatch center for a direct connect system, the alarm company must also provide the fire alarm transmitters to the commercial buildings, or sub-license other alarm companies to transmit on that frequency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fire alarm transmitters and receivers are generally built to transmit or receive only one signal frequency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 475 at 147 (1363:12-21).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in a direct connect system, the governmental entity requires that the signal transmit directly from the fire alarm to 911 dispatch. Thus, even if the other alarm companies not hired to provide the equipment for the 911 dispatch center are interested in reaching an agreement to use the transmission frequency of the company maintaining the 911 dispatch\n   center, those companies do not have access to, and cannot monitor, the signals sent by the alarm transmitters, whether indicating the presence of fire in the building or that the alarm transmitters and sensors require maintenance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 471 at 93 (93:2-8); R. 475 at 146-47 (1362:22-1363:4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2006, Orland FPD adopted an ordinance requiring direct connection to its 911 dispatch center.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. D-140. Orland FPD witnesses testified that they believe that direct connect is safer and more efficient. R. 472 at 218-19 (575:15-576:19); 230 (587:3-24); 253-54 (610:4-611:15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As far back as 1991, Orland FPD hired Tyco's corporate predecessors to provide alarm monitoring services and equipment for Orland FPD's 911 dispatch center and commercial buildings in Orland FPD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 472 at 250-52 (607:17-609:2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2012 and 2013, the Seventh Circuit issued decisions questioning the authority of fire protection districts to engage in the business of fire alarm monitoring and transmission in a case against the Lisle-Woodridge Fire Protection District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lisle-Woodridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3737480\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/672/492/#p501\">\n    672 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   492 ;\n   <em>\n    ADT Sec.

Lisle-Woodridge Fire Protection Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067336\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/854/\">\n    724 F.3d 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2013). Unlike the defendant Lisle-Woodridge FPD, however, Orland FPD never directly sold or leased alarm transmitters to customers. Nevertheless, apparently in light of the\n   <em>\n    Lisle-Woodridge\n   </em>\n   decisions, and at the suggestion of Tyco, Orland FPD rescinded the direct connect requirement provision of its ordinance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. D-115. But because Orland FPD officials continued to prefer direct connect fire alarm monitoring to central station monitoring, they lobbied the Villages to enact ordinances mandating a direct connect system for fire alarms in the Villages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 427 at 215-16 (572:14-573:5). Those new ordinances required that Orland FPD's 911 dispatch center be the direct connection reception facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. D-143; P-053. Orland FPD also renewed its exclusive agreement with Tyco in 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. J-006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Alarm Detection alleges that this arrangement between Orland FPD and Tyco illegally precludes Alarm Detection from competing in the fire alarm monitoring business in Orland FPD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lisle-Woodridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067336\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/854/\">\n    724 F.3d at 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (expressing in dicta \"serious concerns about the anti-competitive effects\" of a direct connect system).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, Tyco provides the transmitters for, and monitors the fire alarm signals from, nearly 100 percent of the customers in Orland FPD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 475 at 23 (1239:10-13). Although this arrangement does not directly preclude Alarm Detection from installing and maintaining alarm transmitters, Alarm Detection must purchase the alarms it installs in Orland FPD from Tyco for $1580,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 472 at 342-43 (699:20-700:3), or the transceiver component of the transmitter for $200,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 472 at 346-47 (703:15-704:3); R. 473 at 23 (729:3-7), and then contract with Tyco to send signals directly to the Orland FPD 911 dispatch center. As discussed, this means that even if Alarm Detection buys transmitters from\n   Tyco and contracts with Tyco for monitoring at the Orland FPD 911 dispatch (as is required by ordinance), Alarm Detection cannot receive maintenance signals directly from the alarms, but is reliant on Tyco or Orland FPD to forward those signals to Alarm Detection. Alarm Detection argues that the cost of buying alarm transmitters from Tyco, and its inability to directly monitor alarm signals, means that its services cannot be competitive in Orland FPD, and that it and other alarm companies are effectively precluded from competing for the business of monitoring fire alarms in individual commercial buildings within the Orland FPD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Alarm Detection also alleges that Tyco's effective monopoly over fire alarm monitoring in Orland FPD causes customers there to pay more for fire alarm monitoring services. Tyco charges $89 to customers in Orland FPD,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 472 at 102 (459:10-14), with $23.50 of that fee being remitted to Orland FPD for the right to be the exclusive fire alarm service provider in Orland FPD,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 473 at 63 (769:4-10). This means that Tyco receives $65.50 from each Orland FPD customer. Tyco charges an average of $68.98 for direct connection services in other jurisdictions in the northern Illinois region.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 474 at 304 (1158:13-23). The record does not reflect whether Tyco remits a fee to the relevant municipal entity in those jurisdictions. By contrast, Alarm Detection charges $55 or less for central station monitoring service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 471 at 160 (160:6-13). It is undisputed that direct connect is typically more expensive because it requires creation of an alarm monitoring \"board\" for every 911 dispatch jurisdiction, whereas a central station's single board can monitor alarms from multiple jurisdictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 472 at 163-64 (163:22-164:8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Alarm Detection argues that the exclusionary effects of the Orland FPD arrangement could be remedied by implementing certain technological or systematic adjustments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 481 at 6; R. 502 at 10-11. Tyco and Orland FPD argue that none of these options complies with the Villages' ordinances mandating a direct connect system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Alarm Detection claims that its exclusion from the Orland FPD market violates the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Fourteenth Amendment, and unjustly enriches Defendants in violation of Illinois law. Alarm Detection also brings these claims against Defendants with respect to the services they provide in the Lemont Fire Protection District (\"Lemont FPD,\" a former defendant in this case that settled the claims against it at the pleading stage,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 211). The Court addresses each claim to the extent necessary to render a verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Lemont FPD and the Clayton Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before turning to the Orland FPD arrangement that is the primary focus of Alarm Detection's claims, the Court addresses several claims Alarm Detection has made regarding Defendants' conduct in the Lemont FPD. In addition to providing direct connect fire alarm monitoring and 911 dispatch services in Orland FPD, Tyco and Orland FPD provide these services to residents of the Lemont FPD, respectively. Alarm Detection claims that this arrangement with Lemont FPD also precludes Alarm Detection from providing fire alarm services there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Very little evidence regarding the arrangement in Lemont FPD was presented at trial. But the evidence presented undermines Alarm Detection's claims. Alarm Detection's executive vice president testified that Lemont FPD does not have a direct connect mandate, customers in Lemont FPD may use central station fire\n   alarm monitoring, Alarm Detection has 44 accounts in Lemont FPD, and Alarm Detection uses its own transmitters and does not have to buy or lease them from Tyco. R. 472 at 82-83 (439:5-440:6). Based on this evidence, the Court finds that Alarm Detection is not in fact precluded from competing in Lemont FPD. Therefore, the Court finds for Defendants on Alarm Detection's claims about Lemont FPD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition to its claims about exclusion from Lemont FPD, Alarm Detection continues to claim injury based on Lemont FPD's allegedly illegal assignment of customer contracts to Tyco. R. 481 at 14 n.7;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. This is apparently Alarm Detection's only remaining basis for a Clayton Act claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. n.7. But the Court rejected this claim earlier in the case and sees no basis to reconsider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 237 at 19-24 (\n   <em>\n    Alarm Detection Sys., Inc. v. Orland Fire Protection Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4121472\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/129/614/#p626\">\n    129 F.Supp.3d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 626-28 (N.D. Ill. 2015) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Alarm Detection also claims a Fourteenth Amendment violation because Orland FPD is monitoring alarms in Lemont FPD, which is allegedly outside its jurisdiction, and beyond its statutory authority. R. 481 at 18. But the agreement between Orland FPD and Lemont FPD (an exhibit admitted at trial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J-011) shows that Orland FPD provides 911 dispatch service to Lemont FPD customers, and Tyco uses the Orland FPD dispatch center to provide direct connect alarm services for customers in Lemont FPD who want that service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 473 at 68-71 (774:4-777:11). Moreover, to the extent Orland FPD can be said to be monitoring fire alarms in Lemont FPD in violation of the District Act, this cannot form the basis of a Fourteenth Amendment claim because Alarm Detection has failed to show an injury-i.e., it has failed to show that it is excluded from the Lemont FPD market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Turning to Alarm Detection's Sherman Act claims, Defendants argue that they are untimely, because Tyco has had an exclusive contract to service the Orland FPD district since at least 2003,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 478 at 6, and Alarm Detection did not file this case until 2014. Under the federal antitrust laws, a plaintiff must bring a lawsuit \"within four years after the cause of action accrued.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15b.

However, state and local government may not delegate that power to private parties. In other words, governments must not enable anticompetitive conduct. The government entity's decision to alter the market must be complete upon enactment of the government's decision, and require no further anticompetitive conduct to create the market conditions envisioned by government authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, Alarm Detection has not sued the Villages and does not ask the Court to find that the Villages' ordinances are preempted. But the evidence shows that the Villages' direct connect ordinances require alarm signals to be sent directly from fire alarms to Orland FPD's 911 dispatch center. The parties have also implicitly conceded (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   footnote 1 above) that dual monitoring technology, i.e., a fire alarm that can send a signal to both Orland FPD's 911 dispatch and a central station, is not available or economically feasible. This combination of municipal regulation and technological/economic limitation eliminates alarm monitoring by any private alarm company other than the company hired to maintain Orland FPD's 911 dispatch center. Granting an exclusive contract for maintenance of the dispatch center is a proper exercise of the Orland FPD's power to contract under the District Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Active Disposal, Inc. v. City of Darien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031218\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/883/#p889\">\n    635 F.3d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 889 (7th Cir. 2011) (exclusive contracts \"are a foreseeable result of [the] authorization for municipalities to make contracts\"). Thus, there is a direct causal connection between the Villages' requirement for direct connect alarm monitoring and the allegedly anticompetitive effect in this case-i.e., the need for an exclusive provider of fire alarm monitoring in Orland FPD. Although there are several steps in this causal chain, the Court finds that the causal connections are sufficiently direct that the effect of an exclusive fire alarm monitoring provider in Orland FPD is the \"logical and intended result\" of the Villages' ordinances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court further finds that this restraint is \"complete upon enactment.\" Orland FPD and Tyco of course have certain discretion to implement the ordinances, which is embodied in their contract. But the anticompetitive effect at issue-i.e., the existence of an exclusive contract (whether with Tyco or another alarm company)- is\n   not within the discretion or control of Orland FPD or Tyco. The Villages require a direct connection to the Orland FPD 911 dispatch center, and an exclusive contract with a fire alarm provider is the only way to accomplish that goal. The Villages' ordinances, therefore, together constitute a \"unilateral restraint\" that involves no concerted action and therefore cannot be a violation of the Sherman Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alarm Det. Sys., Inc. v. Village of Schaumberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203780279\">\n    2017 WL 3780279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 31, 2017) (denying a preliminary injunction motion because \"[o]nly after the Village passed [a direct connect] [o]rdinance ... did Tyco allegedly become the exclusive provider of fire alarm monitoring equipment in the Village\" through an agreement with the municipal entity responsible for 911 dispatch).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Alarm Detection misses the mark with its argument that \"the Supreme Court has classified arrangements that authorize private actors, like Tyco here, to set prices or participate in setting prices, as hybrid restraints.\" R. 502 at 4. The Sherman Act forbids price fixing\n   <em>\n    agreements\n   </em>\n   , not a single company's right to set the prices at which it will do business. In\n   <em>\n    Schwegmann\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Midcal\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court found the statutes at issue preempted because they involved government consent for agreements among multiple private actors to set the price they would charge customers. That is not the situation in the fire alarm protection market in Orland FPD. Rather, as discussed, the Villages require direct connect to Orland FPD's dispatch, and Orland FPD has hired Tyco to maintain the dispatch center. Due to current technological and/or economic limitations that prevent the use of dual-frequency transmitters, these governmental decisions have the direct effect of making Tyco the exclusive provider of fire alarm services in Orland FPD. And like the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Yakima\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Englert\n   </em>\n   , Tyco has a role in setting the prices it will charge for its services, which it exercises through negotiation with Orland FPD, a governmental entity. This is not the kind of price-fixing agreement among multiple private entities the Supreme Court struck down in\n   <em>\n    Schwegmann\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Midcal.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Alarm Detection attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Englert\n   </em>\n   by noting that the ordinance in\n   <em>\n    Englert\n   </em>\n   expressly made the defendant company the exclusive electrical inspector, whereas the Villages ordinances do not make Tyco or any other alarm company the exclusive alarm company for Orland FPD. But as discussed, the evidence shows that the only way to comply with a direct connect requirement to a specific dispatch center-an option a village or fire protection district can indisputably mandate-is to enter into an exclusive contract with a single fire alarm company. The lack of an express choice by the Villages does not change the fact that some company must be given an exclusive contract under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Alarm Detection also argues that the exclusive nature of a direct connect mandate could be remedied by use of different technology. But Alarm Detection concedes that the purpose the Villages' ordinances is \"to eliminate any intervening call from a central station operator.\" R. 502 at 9. The two alternatives Alarm Detection describes in its supplemental brief would not satisfy this goal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alarm Detection first asserts that it \"and other alarm companies could use the same radio frequency as Tyco to send [s]ignals from their own transmitters to Orland Central Dispatch.\" R. 502 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   True, but neither Defendants nor the Villages prohibit this. The problem with this \"solution,\" as Alarm Detection has pointed out,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 471 at 29-30 (29:17-30:7), is that even if it transmitted signals on Tyco's frequency, Alarm Detection would be subject to the costs of replacing or recalibrating its transmitters with Tyco's frequency. Further, if Alarm Detection sends signals directly to Orland FPD 911 dispatch, Alarm Detection cannot monitor those signals (since transmitters with dual transmission ability are apparently not available) and the exclusive monitoring aspect remains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Alarm Detection's additional suggestion is that it could \"automatically retransmit the [s]ignals to eliminate the need to have a central station operator process the [s]ignals before they were sent to Orland Central Dispatch.\" R. 502 at 10. But this is obviously not a direct connection to Orland FPD's 911 dispatch. Alarm Detection never explains why a midpoint \"retransmission\" of the signals would comply with ordinances that require \"direct connection.\" Alarm Detection insists that the retransmission would be \"instantaneous.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203780279\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the evidence presented at trial on this issue was at best inconclusive. Further, time is not necessarily the only concern. With an additional retransmission point there is additional potential for a breakdown in the system. Clearly, the Villages intended that one alarm company be responsible for the reception of alarm signals in Orland FPD-a decision squarely within the Villages authority. Adding a retransmission point undermines that goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that Alarm Detection has not met its burden to prove concerted action that implicates Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Therefore, the Court finds for Defendants on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Section 2: Monopoly\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Only Section 1 of the Sherman Act includes an explicit \"concerted action\" element. However, unilateral state action also undermines a claim for violation of Sherman Act Section 2, because that provision requires \"the willful acquisition or maintenance of [monopoly] power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.\"\n   <em>\n    Endsley v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1094308\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/230/276/#p282\">\n    230 F.3d 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 282 (7th Cir. 2000). As discussed, Orland FPD's and Tyco's agreement on an exclusive fire alarm monitoring contract was a necessary result of the Villages' requiring direct connect fire alarm monitoring in the context of the current technological environment as it pertains to alarm transmitters. In these circumstances, Tyco cannot be said to have \"willfully\" acquired a monopoly. It is unnecessary for the Court to decide whether Tyco's business in Orland FPD constitutes a monopoly for purpose of the Sherman Act. But to the extent that it is properly characterized as such, Tyco simply accepted a monopoly that was made available to it by governmental entities. Other courts have found similar conduct insufficient to satisfy the \"willful acquisition\" element of Section 2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Name.Space, Inc. v.

Addressing the Villages first, it is likely that they would be immune from any antitrust liability that might arise from their ordinances. Municipalities in Illinois regulate fire alarm protection pursuant to Article 11 of the municipal code, and the Illinois legislature has stated its \"intention ... that the 'State action exemption' to the\n   application of federal antitrust statutes be fully available to all municipalities, and that agents, officers and employees of each to the extent that are exercising authority ... [pursuant to] all of Divisions of Articles 10 and 11 of the Illinois Municipal Code.\" 65 ILCS 5/1-1-10(b). Direct connect fire alarm monitoring has been mandated by some Illinois municipalities at least since 1999 when the ordinance at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hinsdale\n   </em>\n   was adopted.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=260%20Ill.%20Dec.%20599\">\n    260 Ill.Dec. 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=761%20N.E.2d%20782\">\n    761 N.E.2d at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although there is no express statutory permission for municipalities to take anticompetitive action in the realm of fire alarm monitoring, the fact that municipalities have been adopting direct connect ordinances for many years has made their effect apparent, not merely foreseeable. This apparent tolerance of such actions by the Illinois legislature, combined with its express intent to permit anticompetitive actions by municipalities generally, is sufficient to show that Illinois has \"articulated a clear policy to allow the anticompetitive conduct\" at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Village of Schaumberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203780279\">\n    2017 WL 3780279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (denying preliminary injunction of defendant village's fire alarm ordinance because it was likely that the village was immune (citing\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1736364\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/823/1182/#p1184\">\n    823 F.2d at 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he Illinois General Assembly's passage of [ 65 ILCS 5/1-1-10 ] supports the proposition that the state legislature intended reasonably foreseeable anticompetitive acts from its grant of power to municipalities.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The fact that the Villages are immune begs the question of whether the Villages' immunity suffices to immunize their sibling governmental entity, Orland FPD.

By contrast, fire protection districts are governed by elected officials. That fire protection district officials are responsible to voters removes the basis for the Supreme Court's imposition of the \"active supervision\" requirement. For these reasons, the Court does not believe that requirement is relevant to whether Orland FPD is immune from antitrust liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   However, even if that requirement is relevant, it is satisfied here.

Rather, the effect of the Villages' ordinances is to define the market for fire alarm monitoring in Orland FPD in the first place.

The evidence supporting this contention is inconclusive at best. But to the extent Tyco's tactics could be described as \"improper,\" they still do not constitute a basis to deny immunity to Tyco, because there is no evidence that Tyco did not genuinely desire to achieve an exclusive contract for fire alarm monitoring in Orland FPD. And there is no evidence that Tyco sought to abuse the governmental process in order to impede Alarm Detection's business in particular, as opposed to seeking to gain a greater share of the market, no matter the competitor. Absent such evidence, the sham exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For these reasons, even if Tyco could be found to have engaged in concerted action\n   in violation of Section 1, or willful acquisition of monopoly power in violation of Section 2, Tyco is immune from any such liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In its previous decision, the Court held that Alarm Detection's pleadings demonstrated that it had been excluded from the Orland FPD market at least since 2003 when Orland FPD signed an exclusive agreement with Tyco. Despite the age of this exclusion, Alarm Detection argued then, and argues again, that the 2014 contract constitutes a new and discrete act that is within the statute of limitations. R. 125 at 14. The Court held that \"[e]ven if such acts constituted fresh injuries to Alarm Detection's constitutional rights ... they are insufficient to trigger the application of the continuing violation doctrine, because the doctrine is reserved for only those cases where a plaintiff could not reasonably be expected to have perceived or known about the alleged violation.\" R. 237 at 50 (\n   <em>\n    Alarm Detection\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4121472\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/129/614/#p626\">\n    129 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   641 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Court's holding would have been correct with respect to an attempt to make old injuries actionable. But the Court was incorrect that the notice provided by earlier conduct made actions for relief based on more recent injuries untimely. As the Court held with respect to the timeliness of Alarm Detection's antitrust claims, the 2014 ordinances and contract renewal are sufficiently overt actions to start a new statute of limitations. Since Alarm Detection brought this action in 2014, the Court reconsiders it earlier decision and finds that Alarm Detection's Fourteenth Amendment claims are timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Alarm Detection argues that Orland FPD does not have the authority under the District Act to make its agreement with Tyco. And since Orland FPD does not have the authority to make that agreement, Alarm Detection argues it is arbitrary conduct that cannot satisfy the rational basis test of the Equal Protection Clause. Specifically, Alarm Detection argues that \"Orland FPD is not authorized by the District Act to [1] exclusively engage in fire alarm monitoring; [2] control the decision over transmission equipment; or [3] collect fees from its residents.\" R. 481 at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As to the first two contentions, both the Villages and Orland FPD have statutory authority to require a direct connect fire alarm monitoring. Further, Orland FPD's power to contract under the District Act necessarily implies the authority to enter into exclusive contracts. Moreover, although a governmental entity's decision to enter into an exclusive contract \"inherently involves a kind of discrimination,\" it does not violate the Equal Protection Clause when government actors merely exercise their discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corey Airport Servs., Inc. v.

Thus, the mere fact that Orland FPD entered into an agreement with one fire alarm services\n   company rather than another does not demonstrate a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Additionally, to the extent the District Act prohibits Orland FPD itself from engaging in transmission of fire alarm signals and collecting fees from residents, Alarm Detection has not proven that Orland FPD engages in such activities. Rather, the evidence shows that Orland FPD contracts with Tyco to provide fire alarms transmission services to its residents. Alarm Detection also concedes that the $23.50 Tyco remits to Orland FPD for each commercial account is \"consideration\" for the right to the exclusive contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 481 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Alarm Detection also claims that Orland FPD \"violated [its] due process rights because: (1) [Alarm Detection] is licensed under the Alarm Act and has a protected property interest in engaging in the Business; and (2) [Alarm Detection] was deprived of its property interest due to Defendants' arbitrary conduct.\" R. 481 at 17. This claim fails. First, Alarm Detection does not claim that it has lost its license under the Alarm Act. Second, Alarm Detection has cited no authority over the course of four years of litigating this case to demonstrate that it has a protected property right in the business of alarm monitoring in Orland FPD. Absent, such a property right, there can be no due process violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Therefore, the Court finds for Defendants on Alarm Detection's Fourteenth Amendment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court noted earlier in the case that Alarm Detection's claim for unjust enrichment would rise or fall with its other claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 316 at 36 (\n   <em>\n    Alarm Detection Sys., Inc. v.

When the Court specifically posed this question to Alarm Detection's counsel during his opening statement, the answer was long but non-responsive.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 471 at 30-32 (30:8- 32:24). During trial there was testimony that some big-box stores utilize dual-frequency transmitters,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    R. 474 at 134 (988:11-21), but the issue was not addressed in post-trial briefing. The Court's order requesting supplemental briefing highlighted this testimony and explained how the Court believed the apparent unavailability of dual-frequency transmitters affected the Court's understanding of the factual circumstances of the case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 499 at 2. Only Orland FPD's supplemental brief noted its agreement that such technology is not available or economically feasible.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 501 at 6. Alarm Detection and Tyco did not address the issue.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 500; R. 502. The Court concludes from this agreement/silence that dual-frequency transmitters are generally unavailable due to some combination of technological and economic circumstances.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    This testimony from Orland witnesses is sufficient to prove their motivations. There was insufficient evidence presented at trial for the Court to determine the relative merits of the two systems, but such a finding is unnecessary for the Court to render a verdict in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Lisle-Woodridge\n    </em>\n    case was remanded for various reasons, including potential consideration of any antitrust violations, but the case settled after court decisions based on Illinois law. Although Alarm Detection has consistently argued that the\n    <em>\n     Lisle-Woodridge\n    </em>\n    decisions require a finding in its favor, the Seventh Circuit did not engage in an analysis of anticompetitive effect or address any of the legal doctrines on which this Court's verdict is based.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The Court ordered supplemental briefing to address the\n    <em>\n     Fisher\n    </em>\n    line of cases as the parties had not addressed it in their trial briefs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    It has taken too long to reach a final judgment in this case. The case would have benefited from clearer thinking earlier in the proceedings about what facts, case law, and legal doctrine would ultimately prove to be dispositive-most notably the\n    <em>\n     Fisher\n    </em>\n    line of cases which the parties never addressed until ordered to do so in supplemental post-trial briefing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
