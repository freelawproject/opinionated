Cir. 2002) ). The phrase \"[c]onductors\n   <strong>\n    16\n   </strong>\n   comprise meandering tracks\" uses both the plural \"conductors\" and the plural \"meandering tracks.\" Therefore, on its face, this statement is inconclusive as to whether a single conductor is the same as a single meandering track.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Notably, although the '771 and '020 Patent specifications alternate in the use of the phrases \"conductors\n   <strong>\n    16\n   </strong>\n   ,\" \"conductor tracks\n   <strong>\n    16\n   </strong>\n   ,\" and \"track\n   <strong>\n    16\n   </strong>\n   \" to describe label 16, they also generally refer to \"conductor\n   <em>\n    s\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) and \"track.\" This distinction between singular and plural words is significant. Although there are some exceptions as to this distinction, this general usage suggests that a track\n   <strong>\n    16\n   </strong>\n   is comprised of multiple conductors\n   <strong>\n    16\n   </strong>\n   . The statement in the specification that \"conductors\n   <strong>\n    16\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    16\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   together constitute a meandering track\" also supports this interpretation. Indeed, this sentence, which appears immediately after \"conductors\n   <strong>\n    16\n   </strong>\n   comprise meandering tracks,\" would not make sense if Defendant's interpretations of \"conductor\" and \"track\" were adopted. Specifically, this portion of the specification would indicate that conductor\n   <strong>\n    16\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   and conductor\n   <strong>\n    16\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   together form a meandering track.

Defendant characterized conductor\n   <strong>\n    20\n   </strong>\n   as an escalator moving up at a particular angle between two stacked semiconductor layers. Thus, Defendant argues that conductor\n   <strong>\n    20\n   </strong>\n   changes direction in the vertical plane. However, there is no disclosure in the specification that conductor\n   <strong>\n    20\n   </strong>\n   is not a straight line, albeit one that is presented at an angle. Defendant's argument also fails because it would require an unreasonably broad understanding of the phrase \"change direction.\" Thus, the phrase would have to include any situation where a conductor is not perfectly situated on the same plane as the semiconductor layers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   When viewed together with this other disclosure in the specification and claims, the statement \"conductors\n   <strong>\n    16\n   </strong>\n   comprise meandering tracks\" alone is insufficient to represent a lexicographic definition of the term \"conductor\" that equates \"conductor\" and \"track.\" On the current record, a person of skill in the art would not have sufficient notice that the patent applicant intended to limit the term \"conductor\" in this way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The parties do not dispute that the term \"conductor\" relates to a conductive material.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 72 at 4-5. Defendant's argument that \"track\" and \"conductor\" are synonymous is rejected.

However, as Plaintiff observes, the phrase \"i.e., a track that changes its direction\" describes a \"meandering track,\" not simply a \"track.\" Dkt. 99 at 2. Stated differently, the specification would reflect that a \"meandering track\" is a type of track, but not that all disclosed tracks must meander. Defendant's proposal would narrow the meaning of the claim term \"track.\" Defendant, however, has failed to prove that the patentee acted as its own lexicographer, or that in doing so it provided a definition that gave express notice that all disclosed tracks must meander or change direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Further, in referring to Figure 2, the '020 Patent specification states, \"[c]onductor tracks\n   <strong>\n    19\n   </strong>\n   have node points\n   <strong>\n    22\n   </strong>\n   that join a plurality of tracks together.\" '020 Patent at 6:35-36.

Claims 32 and 38 of the '771 Patent and Claims 1, 9, and 16 of the '020 Patent specify that the semiconductor structure comprises one or more layers. For example, Claim 1 of the '020 Patent recites,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"[a]n LED lamp comprising: a semiconductor structure comprising a lower semiconductor layer having a lower face, an active region, an upper semiconductor layer having an upper face, a left edge, and a right edge ...\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   With respect to the phrase \"a high-power single-chip LED lamp without clustering,\" Plaintiff argues that there is nothing in the intrinsic record that supports a finding that this claim phrase should be restricted to a \"single chip, lack[ing] clustering, or high power.\" Dkt. 72 at 8-9.

Defendant responds that both the specification and prosecution history of the patents disparage small, clustered LED lamps. For this reason, it argues that this claim term should be limited to exclude clustered LEDs. Dkt. 71 at 7; Dkt. 97 at 1-2. The claims do not include language that supports Defendant's narrower proposed construction for \"semiconductor structure.\" Ultimately, the language of the claims is inconclusive as to the scope of the term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As to the specification, the '020 Patent and '771 Patent each states, \"[a]n object of the present invention is to provide a single-chip LED lamp that avoids or reduces the need for clustering.\" '020 Patent 2:30-31; '771 Patent 1:58-60. Defendant highlights similar language in the '771 Patent, which describes \"an object of the present invention\" as providing a \"single-chip LED lamp.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '771 Patent at 1:5-6 (\"The present invention is related to single-chip\n   LED lamps\");\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   , '771 Patent at 1:58-2:44. However, this language relates to LED lamps, not semiconductor structures. The parties have not requested construction of the term LED lamp, and it would be inappropriate to import Defendant's proposed limitations into the \"semiconductor structure\" term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   At the hearing, Defendant argued that the term \"semiconductor structure\" is properly construed to include these limitations because they relate to the properties of that structure. Plaintiff responded that the claim language itself sets forth the structural properties of the semiconductor structure, including the claim language to the effect that a semiconductor structure is comprised of a lower semiconductor layer, upper semiconductor layer and active region. Plaintiff's position is more persuasive because each of Defendant's proposed limitations relates to the properties of LED lamps overall, not to the semiconductor structure within those LED lamps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Because the parties have not presented specific arguments with respect to the claim term \"LED lamp,\" it is inappropriate to construe that term. However, based on evidence that has been submitted by the parties, it is apparent that the '771 and '020 Patents would not be limited solely to LED lamps \"without clustering,\" as Defendant proposes. Instead, both patent specifications refer to LED lamps that \"avoid or\n   <em>\n    reduce\n   </em>\n   the need for clustering.\" '020 Patent 2:30-31 (emphasis added); '771 Patent 1:58-60 (emphasis added).

In addition, the patent specification refers to concepts of \"parallelly\" and \"serially\" connected LED arrays. If the applicant intended to limit the scope of \"electrically connected\" as it appears in the claims to a particular type of electrical connection between adjacent light emitting stack layers, it would have been appropriate for the patent applicant to have stated this in the claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '738 Patent, Claim 13. Instead, the patent applicant relied on the general phrase \"electrically connected\" in Claim 1. Based on an assessment of these elements as well as the claim language and specification, there is not a sufficient basis to find that the applicant intended to depart from the plain and ordinary meaning of this phrase. Consistent with this conclusion is the statements that Plaintiff's counsel made at the hearing\n   <em>\n    , i.e.,\n   </em>\n   \"the plain and ordinary of electrically connected is fine,\" but what is electrically connected are two or more epitaxial light emitting stack layers, as stated in the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Defendant's argument that the phrase should be construed as \"wherein each structure is capable of being connected to an electrical current to emit light,\" is unpersuasive.

Defendant's related argument is persuasive,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   that a product should be understood to infringe (or invalidate) whether or not the device is actually being used. Indeed, Plaintiff does not argue that electricity must always be actively flowing through the connection between the two layers in order to support a claim of infringement.

Plaintiff further argues that LEDs have a \"natural top down orientation\" which is \"consistently disclosed by the specification.\" Dkt. 99 at 6. Plaintiff adds that construing the term as the layer \"opposite the substrate\" would add ambiguity because both surfaces of the \"adhesive layer\" could be considered \"opposite the substrate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Plaintiff's argument that LEDs have a \"natural top down orientation\" is unpersuasive. Although the figure in the '738 Patent shows the substrate at the bottom of the LED, it is simple to turn the LED upside down.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '738 Patent, Fig. 1.

For example, \"opposite the substrate\" could generally mean the surface on the other side of the substrate. In Figure 1 of the '738 Patent, this could be the surface Plaintiffs are referring to (the surface between layers\n   <strong>\n    12\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    13\n   </strong>\n   ), but it could also be the other surface of the layer (the surface between layers\n   <strong>\n    12\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    10\n   </strong>\n   ).
