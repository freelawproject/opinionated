Docket No. 23. Defendant Sylvia Mathews Burwell (now Alex Azar) filed a Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and a Response to Cypress's Motion for Summary Judgment. Docket No. 26. Cypress filed a Response to Defendant's Cross-Motion. Docket No. 29. Defendant filed a Reply to Cypress's Response. Docket No. 33. Cypress filed a Sur-Reply. Docket No. 35. The Court held a hearing on the motions. Docket No. 43. After the hearing, the Court issued an Order for Supplemental Briefing. Docket No. 49. Cypress filed a Supplemental Brief (Docket No. 53), and Defendant filed a Response (Docket No. 54). Cypress filed a Reply. Docket No. 55. Based on the briefing and argument and for the reasons below, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 23) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED-IN-PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED-IN-PART\n   </strong>\n   and Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 26) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED-IN-PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED-IN-PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Cypress filed a complaint for judicial review, asking the Court to overturn the final agency decision of the Medicare Appeals Council (\"Council\"). Docket No. 1 at 1. Cypress is a Medicare-certified home health agency with its principal place of business located in Mount Pleasant, Texas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Cypress provides home health services to residents of Texas, many of whom are Medicare beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Medicare is a Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled that was established in 1965. The Medicare statute is codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The Medicare program is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which, in turn, contracts with private entities to perform certain functions on its behalf. These functions include claims processing and audits of claims for reimbursement submitted by Medicare providers to ensure that those claims meet the requirements set forth in the Medicare statute and the implementing regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Medicare claims are processed by contractors known as Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs). Audits are undertaken by several different CMS contractors, including Zone Program Integrity Contractors (ZPICs). ZPICs may, among other functions, audit claims on a post-payment basis to ensure that the claims complied with Medicare coverage and documentation requirements at the time they were submitted for reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Due to the extraordinarily high volume of claims processed by CMS and its contractors every year, CMS issued an administrative ruling in 1986 that empowered it and its contractors to use statistical sampling in the context of post-payment claim audits for the purposes of overpayment estimation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CMS Rul. 86-1,\n   <em>\n    Use of Statistical Sampling to Project Overpayments to Medicare Providers and Suppliers\n   </em>\n   (Feb. 20, 1986). CMS then promulgated sub-regulatory guidelines in the form of manual instructions that contain requirements for sampling and overpayment estimation. Medicare Program Integrity Manual\n   (MPIM) Ch. 8 \u00a7 8.4.1.3 (Pub. No. 100-08, Rev. 377) (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the event that a Medicare contractor denies a claim (or claims) submitted by a provider, that provider may avail itself of an administrative appeals process to contest the claim denials and, in cases involving statistical sampling, challenge the validity of the sampling methodology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CMS Rul. 86-1. The Medicare appeals process consists of five stages: redetermination, reconsideration, a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), a request for review by the Council, and judicial review in federal district court. Requests for redetermination are processed by Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.940\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A.R. 001293-001296. In December 2011, Health Integrity sent a letter to Cypress summarizing the results of the post-payment audit. A.R. 001297-001301. Health Integrity stated that it believed that 95 percent of the claims under review had been paid incorrectly and also alleged that the claims it reviewed constituted a statistically valid random sample of Cypress's Medicare claims. A.R. 001297-001301; 001811. Based upon the results of the review, the ZPIC extrapolated an alleged Medicare overpayment to Cypress in the amount of $11,531,832.00. A.R. 001297.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In a letter dated December 28, 2011, Palmetto GBA, the MAC for home health and hospice providers in Texas, formally notified Cypress of the alleged overpayment. A.R. 001302-001306;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   42 C.F.R. 405.921(b). Cypress filed a request for redetermination and, subsequently, a request for reconsideration with the responsible CMS contractors. Both decisions were partially favorable in that they resulted in reversals of some, but not all, of the claim denials. A.R. 001307-001513; 001553-001594.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Cypress filed a request for a hearing before an ALJ on March 21, 2013. A.R. 001241-001289. The ALJ conducted an evidentiary hearing on April 1, 2015. Health Integrity elected to participate in the hearing consistent with the procedure set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1010\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A.R. 001853. In a decision dated November 30, 2015, the ALJ reversed one claim denial, affirmed the remaining claim denials, and invalidated the sampling methodology; the ALJ accordingly directed the Medicare contractor to recalculate the alleged overpayment without extrapolation. A.R. 000475-000554.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In a memorandum dated January 29, 2016, CMS, acting through its contractor, referred the portion of the ALJ's decision invalidating the extrapolation to the Council for review on the Council's own motion.

First, it argues that the Council's decision affirming the statistical validity of the ZPIC's sampling methodology did not correctly apply the relevant legal standards and is supported by nothing more than the speculative assertion of one expert (Dr. John Adams). Docket No. 23 at 18. Second, Cypress argues that the Council incorrectly applied the relevant coverage guidelines for home health services and erroneously determined that the claims at issue did not qualify for payment under the home health benefit. Docket No. 23 at 28. Specifically, Cypress contends that the Council applied the wrong version of the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual (MBPM) to this case, citing to the 2013 version in its decision, rather than the 2008 version, which Cypress argues was in effect when the beneficiaries were actually treated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-34. Third, Cypress argues that it is entitled to payment for any denied services under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395pp because it did not know, nor could it have reasonably been expected to know, that the Council would apply the incorrect legal standards when assessing its claims for Medicare coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In its Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendant responds to Cypress's three main points. Docket No. 26. First, Defendant argues that the Council applied the proper legal standards when determining that Health Integrity selected a valid probability sample.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Defendant further contends that the Council's determination is supported by substantial evidence, including the expert report of Dr. Adams.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Second, Defendant argues that the Council's individual coverage denials are supported by substantial evidence and the proper legal standard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Defendant further contends that Cypress waived any objection to the application of the statutory provisions regarding \"homebound\" coverage guidelines by failing to present the issue to the Council.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. Third, Defendant argues that the Council's denial of waiver of liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395pp is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court must review 23 individual coverage decisions:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-28\"><strong>Beneficiary</strong> <strong>Dates of Service</strong> <strong>Administrative Record Page Ranges</strong> M.C. 10/11/09 - 12/09/09 004516 - 004772 E.C. 06/17/08 - 08/15/08 004780 - 005025 D.C. 08/19/09 - 10/17/09 005029 - 005536 V.D. 06/29/09 - 09/26/09 005544 - 005800 S.D. 01/07/09 - 03/07/09 005807 - 006002 M.T.G. 12/24/09 - 02/21/10 006430 - 007010 E.G. 11/06/09 - 01/04/10 007015 - 007262 O.H. 07/26/09 - 09/23/09 007270 - 007528 R.J. 12/28/08 - 02/25/09 007830 - 008030 C.J. 11/17/08 - 01/15/09 008036 - 008169 C.J. 03/17/09 - 05/15/09 008174 - 008550 C.Y.J. 01/31/09 - 03/31/09 008555 - 008679 W.K. 09/05/09 - 11/03/09 008687 - 008942 J.M. 11/02/08 - 12/31/08 009281 - 009581 A.M. 08/07/08 - 10/05/08 009591 - 009856 M.M. 10/11/08 - 12/09/08 009861 - 010026 M.N. 04/11/09 - 06/09/09 010031 - 010245 V.P. 09/10/08 - 11/08/08 011107 - 011249 P.S. 07/06/08 - 09/03/08 011905 - 012289 Me.W. 09/23/08 - 11/21/08 012293 - 012509 Ma.W. 07/12/09 - 09/09/09 012513 - 012877 F.W. 10/21/08 - 12/19/08 013119 - 013470</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   P.

The relevant statutory language that explains when a patient is \"homebound\" provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [A]n individual\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     shall\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   be considered to be \"confined to his home\" if the individual has a condition, due to an illness or injury, that restricts the ability of the individual to leave his or her home except with the assistance of another individual or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker), or if the individual has a condition such that leaving his or her\n   home is medically contraindicated. While an individual does not have to be bedridden to be considered \"confined to his home\", the condition of the individual\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     should\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   be such that there exists a normal inability to leave home and that leaving home requires a considerable and taxing effort by the individual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395f(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In addition, CMS promulgated regulations.

In short, the 2008 version encompasses a wider universe of people who might qualify as \"homebound.\" Under the 2008 version, a patient would be considered homebound if she could not leave home \"except with the aid of\" a supporting device. MBPM Ch. 7 \u00a7 30.1.1 (Pub. 100-02, Rev. 1) (2003). Yet under the 2013 version, simply requiring the use of a supportive device is not enough, as the patient must also satisfy the two additional requirements under criteria two: \"[t]here must exist a normal inability to leave home\" and \"[l]eaving home must require a considerable and taxing effort.\" Docket No. 23-1 at 10. Thus, the key difference is \"rather than asking whether a patient could leave home\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   a supportive device, the regulations back then [in 2008] seemed to ask whether a patient could leave home\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   one.\"\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/\">\n    824 F.3d at 971-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   , the health care provider argued that it had relied on this wider universe found in the 2008 version of the MBPM for guidance as to who would be considered \"homebound.\"\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/\">\n    824 F.3d at 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Meanwhile, the second sentence says that certain additional clues 'should be' present, suggesting that the second sentence provides useful but not necessarily dispositive tests for homebound status.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/\">\n    824 F.3d at 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   further explained that other textual clues supported the health care provider's interpretation as well:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Next consider the fact that the first sentence suggests individuals shall be homebound either because they need to use supportive devices to leave or because leaving is medically contraindicated (because of, say, the risk of infection).

Assuming (as we usually do) that Congress means the same thing when using the same word in adjoining sentences, the second sentence's use of the term \"condition\" may be best read as meaning that the patient's condition normally renders him unable to leave home without considerable and taxing effort but for his supportive device.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/\">\n    824 F.3d at 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted).

On numerous occasions, the Council applied the 2013 requirements to the beneficiaries in this case, all of whom received treatment in the 2008-2010 time period. For example, for beneficiary V.D., the Council determined she was not homebound, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Overall, despite the appellant's responsibility for creating a contemporaneous record of the beneficiary's home health care, the appellant has not shown that the beneficiary was normally unable to leave home, or that she could leave home only with a considerable and taxing effort. Although the beneficiary used a walker for ambulating, she required only minimal assistance for most [activities of daily living] and her arthritis pain was largely controlled by medication. Therefore, the Council determines that the record in this case does not establish that the beneficiary was homebound, as required to qualify for Medicare coverage of home health services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A.R. 00053. As\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   shows, this analysis is flawed. Cypress should not have been required to show that V.D. could leave home only with \"a considerable and taxing effort.\" That requirement falls squarely within the domain of the 2013 regulation and was not required at the time V.D. received treatment. And while the statute\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   in effect at this time, as\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   explained, this \"considerable and taxing effort\" language was found only in the second sentence of the statute, where \"should\" was the controlling verb (and not \"shall\"). Thus, it was incorrect for the Council to require Cypress to meet this burden in order to show that V.D. was homebound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The administrative record is rife with this error.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R. 90 (\"The documentation in the medical record establishes that beneficiary J.M. required assistance to leave home. However, the documentation does not establish that he was normally unable to leave home, and could not leave home without a considerable and taxing effort. Therefore, the Council determines that he was not homebound.\"). Defendant defends some of these decisions by repeating the same argument\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   deemed incorrect.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 54 at 14 (\"Although the beneficiary was reported to have required some assistance for ambulating, the Council determined that the plaintiff has not shown that the beneficiary was normally unable to leave home, and could not leave home without a considerable and taxing effort.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   at pp. 15 &amp; 16 (explaining that for W.K. and P.S., \"leaving home did not require a considerable and taxing effort\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In total, out of 14 \"homebound\" denials, 11 clearly exhibited this same error, i.e., requiring Cypress to show that the patient was \"normally unable to leave home\" and/or \"could not leave home without a\n   considerable and taxing effort.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those 11 denials cannot stand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/\">\n    824 F.3d at 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]n agency decision that loses track of its own controlling regulations and applies the wrong rules in order to penalize private citizens can never stand.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Thus, the Court must find an appropriate remedy.

In addition, neither party has cited Fifth Circuit precedent that is on point.

Two of the denials relate to the same patient-C.J., Jr. A.R. 00113. In the Council's decision on C.J., Jr., the Council did not explicitly recite the incorrect law, as it did with the denials above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 0071. Instead, the Council makes a new error-when reviewing the forms submitted on behalf of C.J., Jr., the Council complained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   In this case it is not possible to determine whether Beneficiary C.J., Jr. was homebound during the first home health episode at issue, because the nurse who filled out the OASIS form at the start of home health care on November 17, 2008 marked two different answers, rather than one answer, for each question about the beneficiary's ability to perform his ADLs...As a result, it is impossible to determine from a review of the November 17, 2008 OASIS survey whether the beneficiary was so impaired as to be homebound at the start of care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   A.R. 0071.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Yet the Council did not consider the proper time period. The Outcome Assessment and Information Set (OASIS) has been revised multiple times.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P. App. 102 (Docket No. 23-1 at 105). During the time period in question, health care providers were specifically asked to make two marks: one for \"current\" status and one for \"prior\" status, i.e., 14 days prior. P. App. 204 (Docket No. 23-1 at 207). Here, Cypress followed those rules and made two markings but was reprimanded by the Council. In the briefing, Defendant conceded a mistake was made and asked the Court to \"modify the findings,\" or in the alternative, to remand to the Council to fix. Docket No. 33 at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In addition, the Court also notes that the Council stated that C.J., Jr. could \"ambulate with an assistive device.\" A.R. 00071.

On remand, the Council should: 1) interpret the OASIS forms in light of the instructions at the time; and 2) re-examine its homebound denial in light of the law at the time as explained in\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   , specifically considering the fact that C.J., Jr. may have required an assistive device to ambulate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The last homebound denial concerns A.M.

The Court now turns to these three beneficiaries: D.C., V.P., and Ma.Wa.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9821\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/138/#p143\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   At the outset, similar to the homebound denials, the relevant regulation has changed since the services were first rendered. The regulation in effect in 2009 when services were rendered provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (c) Physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, and occupational therapy. To be covered, physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, and occupational therapy must satisfy the criteria in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. Occupational therapy services initially qualify for home health coverage only if they are part of a plan of care that also includes intermittent skilled nursing care, physical therapy, or speech-language pathology services as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (1) Speech-language pathology services and physical or occupational therapy services must relate directly and specifically to a treatment regimen (established by the physician, after any needed consultation with the qualified therapist) that is designed to treat the beneficiary's illness or injury. Services related to activities for the general physical welfare of beneficiaries (for example, exercises to promote overall fitness) do not constitute physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech-language pathology services for Medicare purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (2) Physical and occupational therapy and speech-language pathology services must be reasonable and necessary. To be considered reasonable and necessary, the following conditions must be met:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (i) The services must be considered under accepted standards of medical practice to be a specific, safe, and effective treatment for the beneficiary's condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (ii) The services must be of such a level of complexity and sophistication or the condition of the beneficiary must be such that the services required can safely and effectively be performed only by a qualified physical therapist or by a qualified physical therapy assistant under the supervision of a qualified physical therapist, by a qualified speech-language pathologist, or by a qualified occupational therapist or a qualified occupational therapy assistant under the supervision of a qualified occupational therapist (as defined in \u00a7 484.4 of this chapter). Services that do not require the performance or supervision of a physical therapist or an occupational therapist are not considered reasonable or necessary physical therapy or occupational therapy services, even if they are performed by or supervised by a physical therapist or occupational therapist. Services that do not require the skills of a speech-language pathologist are not considered to be reasonable and necessary speech-language pathology services even if they are performed by or supervised by a speech-language pathologist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (iii) There must be an expectation that the beneficiary's condition will improve materially in a reasonable (and generally predictable) period of time based on the physician's assessment of the beneficiary's restoration potential and unique medical condition, or the services must be necessary to establish a safe and effective maintenance program required in connection with a specific disease, or the skills of a therapist must be necessary to perform a safe and effective maintenance program. If the services are for the establishment of a maintenance program, they may include the design of the program, the instruction of the beneficiary, family, or home health aides, and the necessary infrequent reevaluations of the beneficiary and the program to the degree that the specialized knowledge and judgment of a physical therapist, speech-language pathologist, or occupational therapist is required.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (iv) The amount, frequency, and duration of the services must be reasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20409.44\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 409.44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). In contrast, the regulation in place when the Council filed its decision in 2016 was greatly expanded, including a number of new requirements under CFR \u00a7 409.44 (c)(2)(i).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20409.44\">\n    42 CFR \u00a7 409.44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   This Court must analyze two key issues: \"(1) whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standards; and (2) whether the Commissioner's decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Morris v.

Instead, back then \u00a7 409.44(c)(2)(i) consisted of just one paragraph that spoke not at all of documentation and said only this: \"services must be considered under the accepted standards of medical practice to be a specific, safe, and effective treatment for the beneficiary's condition.\" Rather than requiring extensive paperwork, then, the regulation focused on whether the provider's physical therapy services were consistent with accepted contemporary standards of medical practice. And that's a condition no one disputes Caring Hearts can satisfy: nowhere does CMS's opinion suggest the doctors who prescribed the care in this case defied accepted medical standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/\">\n    824 F.3d at 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Here, V.P. provides a good example. The Council states that V.P.'s physical therapy evaluation \"does not provide specificity in defining the beneficiary's level of function, prior level of function, and decline.\" A.R. 0092. Again, as shown in\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   , the requirement of extensive paperwork was not set forth in the regulation until after V.P. was treated. Instead, the regulation \"focused on whether the provider's physical therapy services were consistent with accepted contemporary standards of medical practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/\">\n    824 F.3d at 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similar to\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   , no one disputes that V.P.'s treatment was consistent with accepted contemporary standards of medical practice. Thus, since the wrong law was applied, the denial as to V.P. cannot stand. Cypress could not have known, nor reasonably have been expected to know, that its coverage for V.P. would be denied. Therefore, the coverage decision as to V.P. is\n   <strong>\n    WAIVED\n   </strong>\n   under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395pp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As to beneficiary D.C., the Council goes further with its improper analysis: the Council cites provisions that did not exist during the time of treatment in the coverage decision itself. This was part of the Council's conclusion as to D.C.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   The Medicare regulations require that the patient's function be initially assessed and periodically reassessed by a qualified therapist, of the corresponding discipline for the type of therapy being provided, using a method that includes objective measurement as described in the regulations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20409.44\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 409.44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(i)(A). The regulations require that the method used to assess a patient's function include objective measurements of function in accordance with accepted professional standards of clinical practice enabling comparison of successive measurements to determine the effectiveness of therapy goals.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20409.44\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 409.44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(iv). Skilled nurses do not carry out physical therapy assessments, in accordance with accepted professional physical therapy standards....

Again, just as in\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   , the Council cited (and applied) provisions from a later version of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20409.44\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 409.44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   On the other hand, the Council's statement that \"[s]killed nurses do not carry out physical therapy assessments, in accordance with accepted professional physical therapy standards\" actually applied the proper law. Thus, the Court is left to guess whether the improperly cited provisions affected the Council's analysis in any meaningful way or if the Council would have reached the same result even without applying the incorrect provisions. \"[W]e may not, of course, affirm an agency by guess.\"\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/\">\n    824 F.3d at 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the proper remedy as to D.C. is to\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   to the Council. On remand, the Council should focus on the version of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20409.44\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 409.44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   that was in effect when D.C. received treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Lastly, as to Ma.Wa., the Council's analysis lacks any discussion as to \"whether the provider's physical therapy services were consistent with accepted contemporary standards of medical practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/\">\n    824 F.3d at 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the record, Ma.Wa.'s physician ordered physical therapy twice per week for three weeks. A.R. 12637. In the Council's analysis of Ma.Wa., as with V.P., it again focuses on the sufficiency of the documentation generally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 102 (\"The physical therapy plan itself (dated May 28, 2009) is cursory and unclear.\"). Thus, the Council should at least include some analysis as to \"whether the provider's physical therapy services were consistent with accepted contemporary standards of medical practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/\">\n    824 F.3d at 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since this analysis is missing, the proper remedy as to Ma.Wa. is to\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   to the Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In conclusion, as to the three physical therapy denials: D.C. and Ma.Wa. are\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   to the Council and any overpayment resulting from the denial as to V.P. is\n   <strong>\n    WAIVED\n   </strong>\n   under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395pp. We now move to the skilled nursing denials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Skilled Nursing Denials\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   While some beneficiaries received a favorable coverage decision as to the \"homebound\" statute, six received unfavorable decisions as to skilled nursing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   beneficiaries E.C., E.G., O.H., M.M., M.N., and F.W at A.R. 000112-000114. Medicare covers home health services when they are, among other things, medically reasonable and necessary for the treatment of a beneficiary's illness or injury. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(a)(1)(A). The MBPM elaborates that home health skilled nursing care \"must be reasonable and necessary to the diagnosis and treatment of the patient's illness or injury within the context of the patient's unique condition. To be considered reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient's illness or injury, the services must be consistent with the nature and severity of the illness or injury, the patient's particular medical needs, and accepted standards of medical and nursing practice.\" MBPM Ch. 7 \u00a7 40.1.1 (Pub. 100-02, Rev. 1) (2003);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20409.44\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 409.44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ;\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/\">\n    824 F.3d at 975-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Court must analyze two key issues: \"(1) whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standards; and (2) whether the Commissioner's decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Morris v.

There is ample evidence in the administrative record related to these beneficiaries on which CMS was able to base its decisions.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R. 4838 -\n   4872 for E.C.; A.R. 7083-7127 for E.G. In addition, the proper legal standards were applied. Unlike with the \"homebound\" denials, Cypress does not argue that CMS applied the wrong law from an improper time period. While Cypress makes other technical coverage arguments pertaining to each beneficiary, under\n   <em>\n    Shalala\n   </em>\n   , this Court only reviews for substantial evidence and whether the law was followed. Thus, since CMS applied the proper legal standards and each decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record, the Court\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMS\n   </strong>\n   the coverage denials as to skilled nursing for the following beneficiaries: E.C., E.G., O.H., M.M., M.N., and F.W.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 112-114.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Even though the coverage decisions are affirmed, Cypress argues these denials should be waived under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395pp. Docket No. 23 at 36. As described above, the waiver provision relates to whether Cypress knew or could have reasonably been expected to know that its skilled nursing services would not have been covered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   , similar to the homebound and physical therapy denials, the court found the skilled nursing denials were waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/\">\n    824 F.3d at 975-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   found that the skilled nursing denials were waived because the denials were based on \"want of sufficient documentation,\" and the skilled nursing provision in effect at the time did not demand \"extensive documentation for every skilled nursing visit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323453\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/968/\">\n    at 976-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, in the present case, the skilled nursing denials are of a different nature, as none of the six decisions seems to turn on sufficiency of documentation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the denials were based on what services were covered under the skilled nursing provisions. Thus, since the rationale underlying the waiver of skilled nursing denials in\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   is not present in this case, waiver as to the skilled nursing denials in this case is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Defendant's Responsive Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Defendant makes two general \"waiver\" arguments that apply to many of the beneficiaries. First, Defendant argues in its Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment that since Cypress specifically argues against only four individual coverage decisions in its Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 23), Cypress waived any other individual coverage challenges not mentioned in Cypress's Motion. Docket No. 26 at 21. Second, Defendant argues that Cypress waived any objection to the application of the statutory provisions regarding \"homebound\" coverage guidelines by failing to present the issue to the Council.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   As to Defendant's first argument that any denials not briefed in Cypress's Summary Judgment motion should be affirmed, the Court ordered supplemental briefing for the issues related to all beneficiaries to be briefed. Docket No. 49. Thus, Defendant's argument is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   As to Defendant's second argument, the legal argument under\n   <em>\n    Caring Hearts\n   </em>\n   is not waived merely because it was not presented to the Council. Sometimes known as issue exhaustion, this argument was discussed extensively in\n   <em>\n    Sims v. Apfel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/\">\n    530 U.S. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (U.S. 2000). In\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   , the court held that, as to Social Security disability proceedings, \"a judicially created issue-exhaustion requirement is inappropriate. Claimants who exhaust administrative remedies need not also exhaust issues in a request for review by the Appeals Council in order to\n   preserve judicial review of those issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/\">\n    530 U.S. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 112,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court's rationale was essentially that the Social Security disability proceedings were not sufficiently adversarial to trigger strict issue exhaustion.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (The \"analogy to judicial proceedings is at its weakest in [the area of Social Security disability proceedings]. The adversarial development of issues by the parties-the 'coming to issue'-on which that analogy depends simply does not exist....

The Council based its conclusion substantially on the report of the ALJ's independent expert, Dr. Adams.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   000035-000038. Yet Dr. Adams's report does not constitute substantial evidence for the Council's decision; in fact, after reviewing the same evidence as the Council did, the ALJ threw out the extrapolation because he found it invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 000547 (\"After careful review of the expert reports and hearing testimony, the ALJ finds that the statistical sampling methodology was invalid.... Specifically, the ALJ finds that the sample was not a probability sample because the claim selection in each step was not conducted independently, but rather the same seed was used.\"). In particular, there are two main points of concern: 1) Dr. Adams's comments (and the Council's admission) that the sample was not a simple random sample; and 2) Dr. Adams's comments that since it was not a simple random sample, the sample would need a different extrapolation technique.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   First, Dr. Adams concluded that this sample was not a simple random sample, even though it was Health Integrity's intention to create one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 00118 (\"My conclusion is that this is not a simple random sample.\") The use of the same seed number created a sample which mathematically was not a simple random sample, which the Council itself does not dispute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 00034 (\"The appellant has proven mathematically that it is not a [simple] random sample, and the Council does not dispute that.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   While this alone would not invalidate the sample under the MPIM, Dr. Adams acknowledged there were still potential consequences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 000119 (\"It is important to underscore that it is not essential that the sample be a simple random sample. This does have consequences for how the extrapolation should be performed.\"). Rather, the key issue, as Dr. Adams explained, is \"whether the sample is a probability sample. If it is not a probability sample it is not valid under the guidance of the [MPIM] regardless of how benign an error this may be.\" A.R. 000119. Thus, to fix the problem posed by the fact that the sample is not a simple random sample, he proposed ways to \"salvage the extrapolation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 000122. Specifically, he believed that the extrapolation might need to be more in-depth: \"If we can conclude that the sample is a probability sample then it may be possible to calculate a defensible\n   extrapolation. However, the extrapolation would likely require the use of somewhat more elaborate statistical techniques than those used for a simple random sample.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 000119-000120.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Yet Defendant does not argue that any of these potential remedies suggested by Dr. Adams were, in fact, used to save the extrapolation. Instead, after the ALJ dismissed the extrapolation, the Council reversed the ALJ, deciding to uphold the extrapolation based in part on a conclusory statement from Dr. Adams: \"Although no one would advocate the sampling process used by [Health Integrity], I believe I can make the argument that it produces a probability sample. Whether the hearing process allows us to go back at this point and redo the extrapolation with a new characterization of the sample is a matter for the OMHA process to address.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 000123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   This statement is not substantial evidence, as this type of speculative, conclusory statement does not constitute substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grogan v.

Here, the statements by Dr. Adams described above suggest that the extrapolation method used was not appropriate because it was not a simple random sample; indeed, he wondered whether it was possible to go back and \"redo the extrapolation.\" Thus, it was not appropriate for the Council to reinstate the extrapolation based on this conclusory statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The reason Dr. Adams made this statement relates to what he believed was the key sticking point-the meaning of the word \"known\" in MPIM Ch. 8 \u00a7 8.4.2:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   It comes down to the meaning of 'known' in the second PIM requirement above. A mathematical purist may read 'known' as calculable in a manner similar to the \"counting\" arguments in Dr. Cox's initial appendix. A more pragmatic modern interpretation would be that a properly designed simulation calculation could produce sampling probabilities that are known for all practical purposes. The PIM can be a problematic document for statistical experts. It contains some apparently quite formal statistical language while at the same time being occasionally vague. It certainly is not as prescriptive as many would like. It relies on references ... that were last revised in the 70s. These references did not anticipate the power of modern computers. My reading of the intent of the PIM is that this simulation could be an acceptable approach to calculating the sampling probabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   A.R. 000121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   However, as Dr. Adams himself acknowledged, each sampling unit did not have a \"known\" probability of selection as would be contemplated by what Dr. Adams called a \"mathematical purist.\" A.R. 000121. Rather, Dr. Adams stated that, in theory, a computer simulation\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   figure out these probabilities. This is what leads him to the conclusion that he \"believe[s] [he] can make the argument that it produces a probability sample.\" But, as explained below, the Court is not required to defer to the Council's interpretation of the meaning of the word \"known.\" The Court's aim is to evaluate, under\n   <em>\n    Shalala\n   </em>\n   , whether substantial evidence exists in the record to support the Council's finding. And based on the comments from Dr. Adams in the\n   record, such as a section labeled \"Other ways to 'salvage' the extrapolation,\" another section labeled \"If we accept that the sample is a probability sample how should the extrapolation be performed?\" and general comments wondering whether the Council can go back and \"redo the extrapolation,\" it seems clear that Dr. Adams had legitimate concerns about whether the MPIM was followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In sum, the core question is whether substantial evidence exists to support the Council's finding that the statistical sampling methodology was valid. Here, because the same seed number was used, each sample did not have a \"known\" probability of selection, which violates MPIM Ch. 8 \u00a7 8.4.2. Dr. Adams made multiple comments that suggested he was worried about this issue.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R. 000122 (\"I would be remiss if I did not mention some other logical possibilities for an extrapolation that works around the problem of the random number seeds.\"). Defendant does not argue that any of these remedies were actually used. Thus, the Court finds that there is a lack of substantial evidence in the record to support the Council's finding. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    REVERSES\n   </strong>\n   the Council's decision as to the extrapolation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Lastly, a word about deference: the Defendant argues that the Council's interpretation of the MPIM (for example, the meaning of the word \"known\") deserves deference under\n   <em>\n    Skidmore v.

Under\n   <em>\n    Skidmore\n   </em>\n   , deference is extended on a sliding scale according to a multitude of factors, such as the thoroughness evident in the agency's consideration, the validity of the agency's reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which lend the administrative decision the power to persuade.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As to the thoroughness evident in the agency's consideration, as described above, this process was non-adversarial in nature. Council decisions do not carry precedential value, and they are not binding on other adjudicators within the Medicare claim appeal system.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2065%2C327\">\n    74 Fed.

As to the validity of the Council's reasoning, its interpretation of the MPIM would essentially divest the first prong of MPIM Ch. 8 \u00a7 8.4.2 of any teeth whatsoever.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lastly, as to consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, neither party cites any other Council decision that interprets \u00a7 8.4.2 in the same way the Council did here. \"There is caselaw suggesting no deference is owed to an agency's interpretation where, like here, the interpretation appears for the first time in the agency's adjudication under consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    Employer Sols.Staffing Grp.
