MICHELSON, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After the United States Environmental Protection Agency designated southeast Michigan as not in attainment of national air-quality standards, Michigan came up with a plan to improve air quality in the region. This included enacting Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 290.650d. That statutory provision requires dispensing facilities in southeast Michigan to sell gasoline with a Reid Vapor Pressure of no more than 7.0 pounds per square inch during the summer. As Ammex, Inc.'s gas station is located in southeast Michigan, the Michigan Department of Agriculture &amp; Rural Development intends to enforce \u00a7 290.650d against Ammex this summer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   While Ammex's gas station is located in southeast Michigan, the station is more precisely located right before the Ambassador Bridge connecting the United States and Canada. In fact, the station is located beyond what United States Customs and Border Protection considers the \"exit point\" from the United States. Moreover, the station is part of a duty-free store and for a duty-free store to sell gasoline tax free, the gasoline must come from a foreign country (or foreign trade zone), stay beyond the exit point, and be sold to people leaving the United States. Indeed, the physical design of Ammex's gas station ensures that those who refuel there must immediately head into Canada. For these and related reasons, Ammex believes that MDARD would violate the Federal Constitution if it enforced Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 290.650d against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties' disagreement, coupled with Ammex's present inability to find a foreign source of 7.0 RVP gasoline, led to this lawsuit. Ammex asks this Court to enjoin MDARD from enforcing \u00a7 290.650d (and associated laws) against it and to declare that \u00a7 290.650d cannot be lawfully applied to it. Moreover, with summer imminent, Ammex has sought a preliminary injunction. (R. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As will be explained in detail below, the Court finds that Ammex is not likely to show that either the Supremacy Clause or the Foreign Commerce Clause bars MDARD from enforcing a 7.0 RVP standard against Ammex. As such, the Court will deny Ammex's motion for preliminary relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Customs bonded warehouses have existed in America for over 170 years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Xerox Corp. v.

For one, Congress set a national Reid Vapor Pressure standard for gasoline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207545\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h). In particular, Congress ordered the EPA to promulgate regulations prohibiting anyone (in the \"48 contiguous States\") from selling-or even \"dispens[ing]\" or \"supply[ing]\"-gasoline with an RVP higher than 9.0 pounds per square inch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207545\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1), (6). Moreover, it appears that Congress prohibited states from holding gasoline to a different RVP standard,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7545(c)(4)(A)(ii), unless the EPA both found the state's RVP standard was \"necessary\" to achieve a NAAQS and approved it as part of the state's implementation plan,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207545\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4)(C)(i) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046879\">\n    71 Fed.

(R. 18, PID 562.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This forced Michigan to come up with a strategy to bring southeast Michigan into attainment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 18, PID 562.) Part of the strategy was to require gas stations to use lower RVP gasoline in the summer months. (R. 18, PID 562;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 18, PID 537, 542). In particular, Michigan enacted House Bill 5508, which says in part, \"Beginning June 1 through September 15 of 2007 and for that period of time each subsequent year, the vapor pressure standard shall be 7.0 psi for dispensing facilities in Wayne\" and seven other counties in southeast Michigan. (R. 18, PID 542.) And the Bill defined \"dispensing facilities\" as \"a site used for gasoline refueling.\" (R. 18, PID 537.) Those two provisions of House Bill 5508 are now found in Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 290.650d and \u00a7 290.642, respectively. The Court will refer to \u00a7 290.650d, \u00a7 290.642, and associated state laws and regulations (e.g., Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 290.645(10) and Michigan Administrative Code Rules 285.561.1 - 3 ) as the \"Summer-Fuel Laws.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2006, Michigan asked the EPA to approve most of House Bill 5508, including the 7.0 RVP standard and the associated enforcement provisions, as a revision to its state implementation plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (R. 18, PID 529);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046879\">\n    71 Fed.

Under a settlement, Ammex agreed to sell gas that complied with the 7.0 RVP standard \"[b]etween June 1 and September 15 of each year.\" (R. 13, PID 226.) The settlement contained a \"retention of jurisdiction\" provision giving MDARD three years to return to the state court where it filed suit to enforce the settlement agreement.

In particular, Ammex's foreign (or, more precisely, foreign trade zone) supplier has an issue with one of its tanks. And while there are other foreign sources where Ammex could obtain gasoline, Ammex claims that none of those sell 7.0 RVP gasoline. And while there are domestic sources that sell 7.0 RVP gasoline, buying from those would preclude Ammex from selling gasoline tax-free. In any event, says Ammex, domestic gasoline would have to be stored in different tanks which would be cost prohibitive.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2019.36\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2). This rock and a hard place, coupled with MDARD's indication that it will require Ammex to comply with the 7.0 RVP standard this summer (R. 1, PID 4-5), prompted Ammex to file this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ammex's complaint consists of two counts. In Count I, Ammex says that the dormant side of the Foreign Commerce Clause prevents Wenk from enforcing the Summer-Fuel Laws against it. (R. 1, PID 12-14.) From Ammex's perspective, if Wenk enforced those laws, Michigan would be unconstitutionally discriminating against foreign commerce, regulating commerce beyond its borders, and infringing on Congress' right to be the \"one voice\" for the Nation on foreign commerce. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 8, PID 82-86.) In Count II, Ammex asserts that the Supremacy Clause prevents Wenk from enforcing the Summer-Fuel Laws against it. (R. 1, PID 14-15.) From Ammex's perspective, Congress and U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulate the entire field of products sold at duty-free shops so Michigan laws that affect what can be sold are preempted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 8, PID 81-82.) Ammex also claims the Summer-Fuel Laws are preempted because they conflict with Congress' goals for duty-free shops.

Ammex stresses that June 1, 2018 (the date when the Summer-Fuel Laws come into effect) is looming and that without an injunction in place it will either have to sell gas in violation of the 7.0 standard or simply not sell gas at all.

Wenk believes that Ammex challenges the EPA's approval of Michigan's revision to its SIP in 1997. ( R. 7, PID 52.)

In 1997, the EPA merely approved a \"summertime gasoline RVP limit of\n   <em>\n    7.8\n   </em>\n   psi for gasoline sold in Wayne\" and other counties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20Fed.%20Reg.%2024341\">\n    62 Fed. Reg. 24341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24342 (May 5, 1997) (emphasis added). It was not until 2007 that EPA approved RVP of 7.0: \"What action is EPA taking today? EPA is approving a SIP revision ... establishing a 7.0 psi RVP fuel requirement for gasoline distributed in Southeast Michigan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Fed.%20Reg.%204432\">\n    72 Fed.

But one does. The first clause of the judicial review says, \"[a] petition for review of the Administrator's\n   <em>\n    action in approving\n   </em>\n   or promulgating\n   <em>\n    any implementation plan under section 7410\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (emphasis added).

Finally, the Ninth Circuit found that the policy underlying the Clean Air Act's judicial-review provision, \"speedy review of EPA rules and final actions in a single court,\" would be undermined if the association's suit proceeded in district court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180441\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/500/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180441\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/500/\">\n    at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So, the Ninth Circuit concluded, the association should have petitioned it, not the district court, for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Despite obvious similarities with this case, there is at least one critical difference between the association's claims in\n   <em>\n    Dump Truck Owners\n   </em>\n   and Ammex's claims. There, the association argued that because its members would have to increase their prices and change their routes to comply with the state law, the state law was preempted by federal laws governing motor-carrier\n   pricing and routes.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180441\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/500/\">\n    784 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   503 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    California Dump Truck Owners Ass'n v.

In other words, if the association were correct about preemption, CARB would not have been able to enforce the state law against\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   heavy-duty truck operator. And so there was reason to think that the association's suit, \"if successful, would effectively eviscerate the SIP by precluding its enforcement by CARB.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180441\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/500/\">\n    784 F.3d at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Not so here. Ammex's success would only inure to the benefit of Ammex. There is no other gas station in southeast Michigan that could echo Ammex's arguments, for they are all grounded in its unique status as a customs bonded warehouse that sells gasoline that must enter Canada. So Ammex's success would not \"nullify\" or \"effectively eviscerate\" any provision of Michigan's SIP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   That leaves the Fourth and Eighth Circuit decisions Wenk relies on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Virginia v.

In other words, if successful, Virginia and Missouri would have rendered the EPA's actions either unlawful or without effect. That is not what Ammex is attempting to do.

Wenk appears to be correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   One way a state law made part of a state implementation plan looks like a federal law is that it makes a limited appearance in the Code of Federal Regulations. When the EPA approves a revision to a state implementation plan, the corresponding state rule is \"[i]ncorporat[ed] by reference\" into the CFR. For example, the CFR says, \"(a)\n   <em>\n    Purpose and scope.\n   </em>\n   This section sets forth the applicable State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Michigan ....

After all, state implementation plans are made up of a plethora of state rules. Without collecting them in one place, it might be difficult to know what laws comprise a SIP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207410\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) (requiring the EPA to \"assemble and publish a comprehensive document for each State setting forth all requirements of the applicable implementation plan for such State\" and to \"publish notice in the Federal Register of the availability of such documents\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2071508\">\n    78 Fed.

So House Bill 5508's \"incorporation by reference\" into the Code of Federal Regulations does not, by itself, show that it is federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   But House Bill 5508 looks like federal laws in another way: a federal agency can and, in some cases, must enforce its provisions. In particular, if the EPA found that a gasoline station in southeast Michigan was selling gas in the summer with a RVP higher than 7.0 psi, the EPA could \"issue an order requiring [the gas station owner] to comply,\" \"issue an administrative penalty order\" against the station owner, or even sue him in court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207413\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 14, PID 247; R. 33, PID 883.) There are several reasons for choosing this analytical path.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   First, the EPA has not been clear about whether it believes that by approving a state law as part of a SIP, it is promulgating a federal regulation. In approving the 7.0 RVP standard for southeast Michigan, the EPA at one point indicated that the standard was a federal regulation: \"The Congressional Review Act ... generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to each House of the Congress .... EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4435. But at other points, the EPA suggested that the 7.0 RVP standard was merely a state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Fed.%20Reg.%204432\">\n    72 Fed.

Apparently then, a finding that \u00a7 290.650d is a federal law would not resolve Ammex's preliminary-injunction motion. Instead, the new battleground would be the scope of \u00a7 290.650d and whether it applies to Ammex. Not only is that terrain relatively uncharted by the parties, it might be necessary to draw a third entity-the EPA-into that fray.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, answering the state-or-federal-law question is not absolutely necessary to resolve Ammex's motion for preliminary relief. Ammex has taken the position that it is challenging state law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 14, PID 247; R. 33, PID 883.) So the Court may assume that Ammex is correct on this point if Ammex's Foreign Commerce Clause and Supremacy Clause claims nonetheless fail. And that is the case, as will be explained next.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Constitution grants Congress the power \"[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. And if Congress has the power to regulate foreign commerce, then, by implication, the states do not. In other words, the Foreign Commerce Clause has a \"dormant\" side. Ammex says that Michigan's Summer-Fuel Laws violate the dormant Foreign Commerce Clause in three different ways. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 8, PID 82-86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Although relegating the argument to a conclusory footnote in its motion (R. 8, PID 82 n.4), Ammex spent much of oral argument asserting that Michigan's Summer-Fuel Laws fail the two-step test set out in\n   <em>\n    Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12427\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/573/#p578\">\n    476 U.S. 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 578,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12427\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/573/#p578\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12427\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/573/#p578\">\n    90 L.Ed.2d 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). Ammex believes that the Summer-Fuel Laws directly regulate or discriminate against foreign commerce and thus are subject to, but cannot withstand, heightened scrutiny. And Ammex claims, even if the Summer-Fuel Laws are not subject to heightened scrutiny, they are still unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Before delving into the particulars of Ammex's argument, it helps to get a better understanding of the\n   <em>\n    Brown-Forman\n   </em>\n   framework. When a state law is alleged to be a violation of the Interstate Commerce Clause (more on \"Interstate\" below), courts perform a two-step analysis. In the Sixth Circuit, the first step focuses on whether the state law is protectionist: does it favor in-state economic interests over out-of-state ones?\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Dairy Foods Ass'n v. Boggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786664\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/628/#p644\">\n    622 F.3d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 644-45 (6th Cir. 2010) (noting that the \" 'direct/incidental' distinction ha[d] fallen out of use in dormant commerce clause analysis\"). If yes, then the state law is \"virtually\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   invalid,\" surviving only if it is necessary\n   and there are no less discriminatory alternatives.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786664\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/628/#p644\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786664\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/628/#p644\">\n    at 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But if the state law is not protectionist, then it need only survive less-demanding \"\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   balancing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786664\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/628/#p644\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court flagged the fact that the\n   <em>\n    Brown-Forman\n   </em>\n   framework has been applied in the context of the Interstate Commerce Clause. Although Ammex asserts the Foreign Commerce Clause, it says that the\n   <em>\n    Brown-Forman\n   </em>\n   framework still applies. Whether that is accurate or not is also a question that the Court need not answer. As the Court finds that the Summer-Fuel Laws are not protectionist and that they pass the\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   balancing test, the Court can assume Ammex is correct that\n   <em>\n    Brown-Forman\n   </em>\n   applies to claims under the Foreign Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   With the framework in place, the Court turns to the specifics of Ammex's argument. Ammex points out that the summer-fuel regulations require dispensing facilities to sell gasoline with a RVP of 7.0 psi but permit a vehicle manufacturer to use higher RVP gas at its \"proving grounds,\" \"testing facilities,\" and \"assembly facility.\" Mich. Admin. Code R. 285.561.7. As Michigan is the home of the \"Big Three,\" i.e., America's three largest vehicle manufacturers, Ammex infers that Michigan's summer-fuel regulations favor in-state economic interests. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 14, PID 252.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Ammex has not shown that the Foreign Commerce Clause concerns itself with this variety of protectionism. While the summer-fuel regulations favor vehicle-manufacturing facilities over gas stations, it does not matter whether the facilities and stations are owned or operated by in- or out-of-state companies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Dairy Foods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786664\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/628/#p644\">\n    622 F.3d at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If Ammex operated a vehicle-testing facility instead of a gas station it would, like every other such operator, be able to use gas with a RVP above 7.0 psi this summer. The difference in treatment turns on the type of business, not whether the business is a Michigan or non-Michigan company. As such, the discrimination Ammex has identified is not the concern of the Foreign Commerce Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LensCrafters, Inc. v. Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9018278\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/798/#p804\">\n    403 F.3d 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 804 (6th Cir. 2005) (finding Tennessee law prohibiting retail eyewear companies from leasing space to optometrists but permitting optometrists to sell eyewear was not discriminatory for dormant Commerce Clause purposes);\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor Co. v.

Instead, they need only pass\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   's deferential test: the laws violate the dormant Commerce Clause only if their burden on foreign commerce is \"clearly excessive\" in relation to the benefits to Michigan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Dairy Foods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786664\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/628/#p644\">\n    622 F.3d at 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   On this point, Ammex says that it currently has no supply of 7.0 RVP gasoline and so if Wenk enforces the summer-fuel against it this summer, it cannot sell gas. And if that happens, Ammex avers that it will \"lose substantial profits\" not only from lost gasoline sales, but also from \"lost sales of other products that would have been purchased by the lost gasoline customers.\" (R. 29, PID 51-52.) And Ammex suggests that its contribution to Michigan's ozone is minimal given that cars burn the fuel they buy from Ammex in Canada and advances in vapor-capture technology. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 14, PID 244-45.) In other words, Ammex thinks that the burden that the Summer-Fuel Laws place on foreign commerce is in clear excess of the benefits to Michigan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Court disagrees. Over the past five years, Michigan's 7.0 RVP standard imposed little burden on the foreign commerce at issue: Ammex was able to buy significant quantities of gas from a foreign supplier and sell significant quantities of gas to those leaving this country. True, it is likely that there will be a greater burden on that commerce this summer. But that is only because Ammex's foreign supplier of 7.0 RVP gasoline has a\n   <em>\n    temporary\n   </em>\n   problem with one its tanks. Save for the next three months then, Michigan's Summer-Fuel Laws have not significantly burdened foreign commerce and are not anticipated to in the future. And enforcing the Summer-Fuel Laws against Ammex benefits Michigan. An analyst with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality avers that gas stations contribute to ground-level ozone formation when fuel is placed in the station's storage tanks and when people refuel their vehicles. (R. 13, PID 208.) A meteorologist with MDEQ avers that \"[e]missions associated with fueling at Ammex's gas station will add additional ozone precursor to an area that already has ozone exceeding the\" NAAQS for 8-hour ozone. (R. 13, PID 214.) On balance, the Court finds that the generally-minimal burden on foreign commerce imposed by the Summer-Fuel Laws does not \"clearly\" outweigh Michigan's interest in clean air.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   So, properly raised or not, the Court finds that Ammex is not likely to show that the Summer-Fuel Laws fail\n   <em>\n    Brown-Forman\n   </em>\n   's two-part test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Next, Ammex says that Michigan's Summer-Fuel Laws violate the Foreign Commerce Clause because the laws infringe on Congress' right to speak for the nation on matters of foreign commerce. (R. 8, PID 85-86.) To better understand this argument, it is helpful to review Ammex's sole authority on the issue:\n   <em>\n    Japan Line, Ltd. v.

In Ammex's view, the multiple-taxation test should be \"reformulated\" to a multiple-regulation test for purposes of this case.

The container companies were \"in fact\" subject to taxes by both Japan and California and satisfying one demand did not (and could not) satisfy the other. Here, if Ammex sells gas that complies with Michigan's summertime RVP standard, it also satisfies Canada's summertime RVP standards.

In amending \u00a7 1555 to more formally and more specifically regulate duty-free stores, Congress found that duty-free stores \"play a significant role in attracting international passengers to the United States.\" Pub.

And Michigan's Summer-Fuel Laws purportedly interfere with this declaration because they force Ammex to buy 7.0 RVP gasoline at higher costs than Canadian-compliant fuel, which, in turn, means that Ammex must sell gasoline at prices unattractive to international travelers. Or worse, in circumstances like the present, the Summer-Fuel Laws prevent Ammex from selling tax-free gasoline entirely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court does not understand \u00a7 1557(a)(1) to regulate at the level of granularity that Ammex thinks it does. Ammex reads \u00a7 1557(a)(1) as not only permitting it to sell every good (other\n   than perishables and explosives) but every variety of every good. It is not enough that \u00a7 1557(a)(1) permits Ammex to sell gasoline, in Ammex's view the statute permits it to sell Canadian-compliant gasoline. But the statute speaks of classes of goods (perishables) not specific goods (strawberries) let alone a specific variety of a specific good (California strawberries). The Court acknowledges that the Court of International Trade has stated, \"the plain language of \u00a7 1557(a)(1) shows Congress' intent that there be only two restrictions on the\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of dutiable merchandise that may be stored or withdrawn from a bonded warehouse: (1) perishable articles and (2) explosive substances other than firecrackers.\"\n   <em>\n    Ammex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.I.T.%20851\">\n    24 C.I.T. at 854-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11190904,6110460\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/116/1269/\">\n    116 F.Supp.2d 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). But read in context, the word \"type\" refers to a class of goods (\"perishable articles\" and \"explosive substances\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   A hypothetical leads to a similar reading of \u00a7 1557(a)(1). If a statute said, \"any vehicles, with the exception of military vehicles, may be sold at a car dealership,\" no one would think that the statute authorizes car dealers to sell vehicles without legally-required safety features (e.g., airbags).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20571.208\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20571.101\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 571.101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   That is, if a car dealer sold cars without airbags, it would be no defense for the dealership to say, \"but the law says that 'any vehicles, with the exception of military vehicles, may be sold at a car dealership' and cars without airbags are a type of vehicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Here, the Summer-Fuel Laws do not preclude Ammex from selling a good. It may sell gasoline. The Summer-Fuel Laws at most preclude Ammex from selling a variety of gasoline, namely gasoline with a RVP above 7.0 psi. Or, viewed slightly differently, the Summer-Fuel Laws are like the airbags in the hypothetical, they ensure that a good meets a certain quality or safety standard. Either way, the Summer-Fuel Laws are not contrary to what Congress has said in \u00a7 1557(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   But Ammex stresses that in this case, regulating a good is the same as prohibiting its sale. More specifically, because Ammex presently has no foreign source of 7.0 RVP gasoline, an effect of the Summer-Fuel Laws is to prohibit Ammex from selling gasoline this summer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by Ammex's regulation-is-prohibition argument. As explained, whether Michigan's Summer-Fuel Laws can be constitutionally applied to Ammex should not turn on whether Ammex has a temporary supply problem. It would be more than odd to say that Wenk does not violate the Commerce Clause by enforcing the Summer-Fuel Laws when Ammex can readily obtain 7.0 RVP gasoline from a foreign source (say, last summer), but he does when Ammex cannot (this summer). Stated differently, the Summer-Fuel Laws are in no way directly contrary to Congress' foreign-trade policy; they only indirectly affect that policy in uncommon circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Japan Line\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/\">\n    441 U.S. at 452-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding state tax unconstitutional where state tax on containers temporarily in the United States was directly contrary to foreign-trade policy of not taxing containers temporarily in the United States). As such, the Court does not find that the Summer-Fuel Laws unlawfully interfere with what Congress has said in \u00a7 1557(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Similar reasoning applies to Congress' goal of attracting international travelers to the United States, Pub. Law 100-418 (1988), and inducing those travelers to spend more money in this country, S. Rep. 100-71 (1987). For the past five years, Ammex has been able to sell gasoline. And Ammex has sold gasoline at prices attractive to travelers from Canada despite complying with the Summer-Fuel Laws. This\n   is evidenced by the fact that Canadian travelers have the option of stopping at a Canadian gas station just across the Ambassador Bridge but frequently stop at Ammex instead. Indeed, while not all its sales are to Canadians, Ammex sells 400,000 gallons of fuel a month. That the Summer-Fuel Laws may, in combination with other factors, result in Ammex not selling duty-free gasoline for one summer, does not show that the laws \"substantial[ly],\"\n   <em>\n    Japan Line\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/\">\n    441 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   456 n.20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , interfere with Congress' aims of increasing visits from and spending by foreign travelers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As for concession fees, Ammex has not shown that the amount it pays to Michigan in concession fees is tied to the amount of gasoline it sells. Ammex has argued that if it is forced to sell gasoline at unattractive prices or not at all, it will pay less in single-business tax to Michigan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ammex, Inc. v. Dep't of Treasury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5717157\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/273/623/\">\n    273 Mich.App. 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=732%20N.W.2d%20116\">\n    732 N.W.2d 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 124-25 (2007) (providing that Michigan's single-business tax is based in part on sales). But, as discussed, Ammex has been able to sell 400,000 gallons of gasoline in a month despite complying with the Summer-Fuel Laws. And Ammex's short-term inability to sell gasoline does not convince the Court that the Summer-Fuel Laws are contrary to duty-free stores' role in generating revenue for the state. Moreover, the Court is not convinced that Ammex would be unable to sell gasoline this summer if Wenk enforced the 7.0 RVP standard against it. Rather it appears that if Ammex obtained 7.0 RVP gasoline from a domestic source, it could still sell gasoline this summer, albeit not tax free.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201555\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2019.36\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   That leaves uniformity. Ammex claims that by amending \u00a7 1555(b) to \"encourage uniformity and consistency of regulation of duty-free sales enterprises,\" Pub. Law 100-418 (1988), Congress indicated that all duty-free stores should be able to sell the same goods. Ammex says that if states were able to regulate goods, duty-free stores would be subject to a \"patchwork\" of state regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Ammex's argument adds words to Congress' finding. In amending \u00a7 1555, Congress found that there was \"a need to encourage uniformity and consistency of regulation of duty-free sales enterprises.\" Congress did not find that there was \"a need to encourage uniformity and consistency of regulation\n   <em>\n    of goods that can be sold\n   </em>\n   at duty-free sales enterprises.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   And the history of duty-free stores further suggests that Congress was referring to uniformity in the operations of duty-free stores rather than the goods they are able to sell. In 1983, U.S. Customs explained that it had been regulating duty-free stores \"as part of its overall bonded warehouse program\" but \"the special nature of the stores and their procedures ha[d] become increasingly difficult to 'contain' within the other categories of bonded warehouses.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033318\">\n    48 Fed. Reg. 33318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (July 21, 1983). One possible solution was to \"provide for a comprehensive incorporation of duty-free store operating procedures into the Customs Regulations, beginning with Customs formal recognition, and specific designation of the duty-free store as a new class of Customs bonded warehouse.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033318\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Seven years later, Customs explained that it still had been regulating duty-free stores through \"administrative directives, rather than through any specific law or regulation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022833\">\n    56 Fed. Reg. 22833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (May 17, 1991). And while Customs had (as it contemplated in 1983) drafted regulations specific to duty-free stores, those \"regulations were never published\" because Congress had \"prohibit[ed] the use of Customs funds ... to propose or\n   promulgate any rules or regulations relating to duty-free stores until Congress legislated in the matter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022833\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That did not happen until 1988, when Congress amended \u00a7 1555 and found that \"there is inadequate statutory and regulatory recognition of, and guidelines for the operation of duty-free sales enterprises\" and \"there is a need to encourage uniformity and consistency of regulation of duty-free sales enterprises.\" Pub. Law 100-418 (1988). Thus, the history of regulation of duty-free stores suggests that Congress was not referring to uniformity in the goods that duty-free stores were able to sell, but uniformity in the operations of duty-free stores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In short, Ammex has not shown that Michigan's Summer-Fuel Laws violate the Foreign Commerce Clause because they subject Ammex to multiple regulation or because they infringe on Congress' right to speak for the nation on matters of foreign commerce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Japan Line\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/\">\n    441 U.S. at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Finally, Ammex says that the Summer-Fuel Laws violate the extraterritoriality branch of the dormant Foreign Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Healy v.

Ammex points out it buys gasoline from a foreign supplier or one located in a foreign trade zone. (R. 29, PID 848-49.) And Ammex points out that under the regulations governing duty-free shops, the merchandise it sells is for use outside the United States. (R. 8, PID 84.) In fact, Ammex says, \"[t]he geography of the Ammex Facility offers no direct physical route for products stored or sold at the store to enter the United States. Thus, cars entering the gas station must proceed into Canada upon exit.\" (R. 8, PID 84.) Therefore, in Ammex's view, its gasoline sales \"occur[ ] entirely outside\" of Michigan. (R. 8, PID 85.) And because Michigan's Summer-Fuel Laws regulate the gasoline it sells, the Summer-Fuel Laws impermissibly regulate commerce outside of Michigan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Although Ammex presents a compelling argument, the Court is not persuaded that the extraterritoriality doctrine applies to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As an initial matter, the doctrine should not be readily applied. In the Supreme Court, the extraterritoriality doctrine has only been used to strike down state laws on three occasions.\n   <em>\n    Energy &amp; Env't Legal Inst. v.

And each time, the law was a price-affirmation statute (e.g., a state law requiring a wholesaler to affirm he was not giving retailers in neighboring states a better deal).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

Indeed, writing for the Tenth Circuit, Judge-now-Justice Gorsuch called extraterritoriality \"the most dormant doctrine in dormant commerce clause jurisprudence,\" classified\n   <em>\n    Healy\n   </em>\n   's three \"propositions\" as \"dicta,\" and effectively limited the extraterritoriality doctrine to cases involving \"a price control or price affirmation regulation\" that linked \"in-state prices to those charged elsewhere\" with \"the effect of raising costs for out-of-state consumers or rival businesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Epel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278405\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/1169/#p1172\">\n    793 F.3d at 1170, 1173, 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And Judge Sutton of our appellate court has persuasively argued why the doctrine is a \"relic of the old world with no useful role to play in the new.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

None of this is to say that the extraterritoriality doctrine no longer exists-but it is to say that this Court should be circumspect in applying it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Second, Wenk would not contravene the concepts animating the extraterritoriality doctrine if he were to enforce the Summer-Fuel Laws against Ammex. The doctrine stems from three Founding Era concepts: (1) a state's regulatory power ends at its borders; (2) respect for other states' sovereignty; (3) respect for the federal government's sovereignty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

True, the gasoline Ammex purchases comes from a foreign country or foreign trade zone, is stored beyond CBP's \"exit point\" from the United States, and is taken to Canada immediately after purchase.

The Court declines the invitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   That decision is not inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    American Beverage\n   </em>\n   , the only case in which the Sixth Circuit has applied the extraterritoriality doctrine to strike down a state law. In that case, the Michigan law at issue essentially went a step further than the Ohio law at issue in\n   <em>\n    Int'l Dairy Foods\n   </em>\n   : Michigan not only required beverage manufactures to place their drinks in bottles with a unique Michigan mark (like the Ohio law), it prohibited those bottles from being sold in any other state that did not have a similar marking law (unlike the Ohio law).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 367, 374-75.

The Summer-Fuel Laws will not adversely \"interact with the legitimate regulatory regimes of other [sovereigns].\" As explained, there is no conflict between Canada's existing RVP standards and Michigan's existing RVP standards. And the Summer-Fuel Laws do not conflict with any RVP standard set by the federal government. Nor would \"havoc\" or a perverse effect arise if other sovereigns implemented RVP standards similar to the one set in the Summer-Fuel Laws. If Canada were to set a maximum RVP standard, Ammex could comply with the lower of Michigan's and Canada's standards. And the same is true if the EPA were to set a maximum RVP standard different than Michigan's. Accordingly, the Court finds that\n   <em>\n    American Beverage\n   </em>\n   does not require this Court to find Michigan's Summer-Fuel Laws unconstitutional under the extraterritoriality doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In sum, Ammex has not shown that the Summer-Fuel Laws fail\n   <em>\n    Brown-Forman\n   </em>\n   's discrimination test,\n   <em>\n    JapanLine\n   </em>\n   's multiple-taxation and \"one voice\" tests, or\n   <em>\n    Healy\n   </em>\n   's extraterritoriality test.

Because federal law is \"the supreme Law of the Land,\" U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, state laws can be trumped by federal ones. Congress' intent to preempt state law can be manifested in several ways.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Automobile Workers, Local 3047 v.

In Ammex's view, the Summer-Fuel Laws are even \"more invasive\" than state taxation, and so if Congress has regulated customs bonded warehouses to the point where\n   state taxes cannot intrude, it must be that there is no room for Michigan to impose a 7.0 RVP requirement on gasoline stored at a customs bonded warehouse.

That is, even if Congress has left no room for states to impose taxes on goods stored in customs bonded warehouses and destined for export, it does not follow that there is no room for states to regulate those goods. Ammex believes that the Summer-Fuel Laws are even more invasive than a state tax, but a state tax goes to the very core of Congress' regulation of bonded warehouses. Congress has specifically legislated that a merchant may store goods at customs bonded warehouses and defer import duties until the goods are placed into the stream of U.S. commerce or not pay them at all if exported to foreign country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201557\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Xerox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193046\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/145/\">\n    459 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   150-51 &amp; n.7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193046\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/145/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Congress has clearly occupied the field of import duties on goods entered into bonded warehouses, it arguably follows that it has occupied the field of taxes on goods stored in bonded warehouses\n   and destined for export. Taxes and duties are cousins. But regulations on the quality or safety of good, or a prohibition on one variety of good, are more afield. So simply because there is no room for state taxes on goods stored in customs bonded warehouses and destined for export, does not mean that there is no room for Michigan's Summer-Fuel Laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   At oral argument, Ammex did not focus on this\n   <em>\n    a fortiori\n   </em>\n   argument (i.e., state taxes are field preempted and so more intrusive regulations are field preempted).

Recall, in that case, the Court of International Trade stated that \"the plain language of \u00a7 1557(a)(1) shows Congress' intent that there be only two restrictions on the type of dutiable merchandise that may be stored or withdrawn from a bonded warehouse: (1) perishable articles and (2) explosive substances other than firecrackers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 854-55,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11190904,6110460\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/116/1269/\">\n    116 F.Supp.2d 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he plain language of \u00a7 1557(a)(1) makes [diesel fuel and gasoline] eligible for sale from duty-free stores.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The Court has effectively addressed Ammex's preemption argument based on\n   <em>\n    Ammex v. United States.\n   </em>\n   In finding that the Summer-Fuel Laws do not infringe on Congress' voice, this Court found that because the Summer-Fuel Laws merely regulated gasoline or dictated that Ammex sell a variety of gasoline, they were not inconsistent with \u00a7 1557(a)(1). And, in responding to Ammex's assertion that the Summer-Fuel Laws go further, i.e., that they prohibit the sale of gasoline, the Court found that the constitutionality of the Summer-Fuel Laws should not turn on Ammex's short-term supply problem. Accordingly, even if Congress dictated which goods may be sold at a duty-free store when it enacted \u00a7 1557(a)(1), the Court finds that Congress left room for Michigan to impose a volatility standard on gasoline sold at a duty-free store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   That leaves Ammex's claim that if the Summer-Fuel Laws were enforced against Ammex, it would frustrate Congress' goals for duty-free stores. Ammex argues that if Wenk were permitted to enforce the Summer-Fuel Laws against it, the \"direct effect\" would be \"precluding Ammex from selling Canadian-compliant gasoline-which is the product naturally desired by customers proceeding to Canada-during the summer months.\" (R. 8, PID 81;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 14, PID 258.) \"Therefore,\" says Ammex, \"the Summer Fuel Requirements plainly stand as an obstacle to the purposes of the federal customs law.\" (R. 14, PID 258;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 8, PID 81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The Court disagrees. As discussed, in providing more formal and more comprehensive regulation of duty-free stores, Congress found that duty-free stores attracted international travelers to the United States and found that duty-free stores provided revenue (in the form of concession fees) to the states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. Law 100-418 (1988). And Congress sought to \"encourage uniformity and consistency of regulation of duty-free sales enterprises.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11190904,6110460\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/116/1269/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, via \u00a7 1557(a)(1), Congress provided that duty-free stores may sell any goods save for perishables and most explosives. For essentially the same reasons that the Summer-Fuel Laws do not infringe on what Congress has said on behalf of the Nation on a matter of foreign commerce, the Summer-Fuel Laws do not\n   frustrate Congress' findings relating to and objectives for duty-free stores. For each of the past five years, Ammex has been able to purchase large quantities of gasoline from a foreign supplier and sell large quantities of gasoline to Canadian travelers despite complying with the Summer-Fuel Laws. And, as explained, the Summer-Fuel Laws do not prohibit Ammex from selling any good. And, consistent with the purpose of customs bonded warehouses generally (as opposed to duty-free stores specifically), they certainly do not prohibit Ammex from selling any good duty free and tax free. It is only in the temporary and uncommon circumstance where Ammex does not have a foreign supply of 7.0 RVP gasoline, that the Summer-Fuel Laws have the indirect effect of prohibiting the sale of tax-free gasoline at duty-free store. (Again, the Summer-Fuel Laws apparently do not preclude Ammex from selling taxed gasoline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2019.36\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2).) As such, the Court finds that the Summer-Fuel Laws do not frustrate Congress' findings set out in Public Law 100-418 or its objective in enacting \u00a7 1557(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In sum, Ammex is not likely to show that federal laws governing customs bonded warehouses are so pervasive that they left no room for an application of Michigan's Summer-Fuel Laws or that the Summer-Fuel Laws are an \"obstacle\" to Congress' goals for duty-free stores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Because Ammex is not likely to succeed on the merits, the Court does not address the other preliminary injunction factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper v.

But that hypothetical conflict is highly unlikely to arise. It has been 12 years since Michigan modified its RVP requirements. And the whole point of the summer-fuel laws is that ozone formation is most likely on hot, sunny days (R. 13, PID 208)-days which are more than rare during a Michigan winter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
