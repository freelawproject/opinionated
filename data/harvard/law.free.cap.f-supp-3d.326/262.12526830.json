Plaintiff testified that \"there was always grease present\" on these decks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to plaintiff, cables hanging over these decks were \"greased regularly, and grease would slough off of these cables.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also testified that \"it doesn't take a lot of grease to precipitate a slip.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   He referred to one earlier incident involving grease, when he \"came very close to being jettisoned down [a] ladder\" after grabbing a \"blob of grease that had [fallen] off the cables.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   After this incident, plaintiff purportedly raised concerns about the grease at a safety meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two other witnesses, marine surveyor John Pope and Christopher Keefe, an engineer aboard the M/V CAPE KNOX, confirmed that grease falls off the cables, although they stated the grease is rubbery, not slick.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Pope stated that while the deck area near the emergency diesel generator room was free of grease and oil, he noted \"some stains ... on the deck.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although there is evidence of the presence of grease on the decks, there is no evidence that the grease created an unsafe condition in the area where plaintiff slipped, or actually caused him to slip. The area immediately outside the emergency diesel generator room has a nonskid surface. It is also covered by an overhang, meaning that grease could not have fallen directly from the winch cables onto the floor outside the room.

He could have examined the deck, and he could have looked at his shoes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It was only some time after the accident that plaintiff realized, \"in retrospect,\" that he slipped on grease, and that he must have stepped in grease somewhere on the deck.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this is pure speculation on plaintiff's part.
