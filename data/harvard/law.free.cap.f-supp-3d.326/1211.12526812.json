Ackerman\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 90] in which he asks the Court to suppress all evidence obtained either directly or indirectly as a result of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (\"NCMEC\") opening his emails and the attachments thereto. Defendant argues that under\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ackerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055956\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1292/\">\n    831 F.3d 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2016), NCMEC is a government entity or agency, and therefore its warrantless searches of his emails violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment, and all evidence obtained thereafter is \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\" The Government filed a response [Doc. 93] and Defendant filed a reply [Doc. 114]. On April 24-25, 2018 and June 12, 2018, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress, at which Defendant was present and the Government presented evidence in the form of witness testimony and exhibits. On July 3, 2018, both parties filed written closing arguments. Docs. 123 and 124. After considering the evidence, the briefs, and the arguments of counsel, the Court concludes that the motion to suppress should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Donald Alvin Tolbert (hereafter, \"Tolbert\") has a 2006 state court conviction on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a child under age thirteen, among other charges. Tolbert served a term of years in prison until November of 2009, at which point he began serving concurrent terms of probation and parole. In 2010, the state arrested Tolbert for violating the terms of his probation and parole and reincarcerated him for 330 days. Then, the state released Tolbert a second time, subject to conditions of probation. As part of his release, Tolbert agreed to various standard conditions of probation, including allowing any probation or parole officer to visit him at his home or place of employment at any time, and permitting a warrantless search by the officer if he or she had reasonable cause to believe the search would produce evidence of a parole violation. Ex. A at 6-7. As a convicted sex offender, Tolbert also promised to provide all of his email addresses, usernames, and passwords to his probation officer. Ex. A at 3. Further, he agreed that any computer or electronic device to which Tolbert had access could \"be examined for inappropriate content [which expressly included child pornography] at any time.\" Ex. A at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 1, 2012, five emails with a total of fifteen attachments were sent through American Online (\"AOL\") by a user with the email address ddt123abc@aol.com -an email address allegedly belonging to Tolbert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. D1-D5 (NCMEC Cyber Tipline Report IDs 1576684, 1576685, 1576686, 1576688, and 1576689). Three of these emails were sent to a user with the email address\n   <em>\n    donnieisagod@aol.com\n   </em>\n   -also allegedly belonging to Tolbert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. D1, D2, and D3. The other two emails were sent to a third party email address,\n   <em>\n    widd2703@web.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    de.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Exs. D4 and D5. In accordance with its practice in 2012, AOL did not\n   <em>\n    initially\n   </em>\n   open or view the files attached to the emails.

As it is required to do by law, AOL electronically submitted the five emails and corresponding CyberTip reports concerning suspected child pornography to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (\"NCMEC\"). Exs. D1-D5; Trans. 4/24/18 at 18-20, 24; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258A. These CyberTips provided by AOL to NCMEC included (1) the email addresses of both the senders and the recipients of the emails, (2) the subjects of the emails, along with all of their attachments; (3) identification of the specific attachments which had been hash value matched as child pornography; and (4) the IP address\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   corresponding to the email sender for all five emails. Exs. D1-D5.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. D1 at 191.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   AOL's software also automatically prevented the five emails and their attachments from reaching their intended recipients, then terminated and saved a snapshot of the user's account. Trans. 4/25/18 at 8, 15. The entire process was fully automated, meaning no AOL employee opened or read the emails or attachments\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   AOL sent the CyberTip to NCMEC. Trans. 4/25/18 at 14, 18, 64; Trans. 6/12/18 at 128-30. However, in 2012 an AOL employee did open and view the email and attachments the next business day after the CyberTip was sent to NCMEC in order to confirm that the hashed image did in fact belong in AOL's database of images of child pornography. Trans 4/25/18 at 14. 35, 64; Trans. 6/12/18 at 130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 5, 2012, NCMEC\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   opened and then viewed the five emails and their attachments forwarded by AOL along with the CyberTips and determined that the attachments appeared to contain child pornography. Ex. D1 at 195. It did so without seeking or obtaining a search warrant. It then conducted various searches on various publicly available databases for the IP address associated with the five emails, for the two email addresses listed\n   above, as well as for the names \"Donnie T\" and \"Don Tolbert.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. D1 at 195-217. The open source searches on the IP address were conducted in order to locate the sender in a particular geographic area-in this case, Albuquerque, New Mexico. Trans. 4/24/18 at 38-41 and 72-76; Ex. D1 at 197-203. NCMEC then performed public, online searches on some of the information sent by AOL in the CyberTip, including the two email addresses noted above that were associated with the five emails and other unique identifiers, such as \"YUNGMUFFMAN\" and then eventually to someone named \"Donnie,\" then \"Don Tolbert,\" then Margaret Tolbert and her Albuquerque address, and then eventually to a Donald Alvin Tolbert in Albuquerque, New Mexico with a specific address and date of birth. Trans. 4/24/18 at 77-87; Ex. D1 at 203-217.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   NCMEC then forwarded the CyberTip reports containing those emails and attachments, as well as the results of its public record searches, to the New Mexico Attorney General's Office, Internet Crimes Against Children (\"ICAC\") division.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. D1 at 216. The ICAC is the clearinghouse for CyberTips with a connection to New Mexico. Trans. 4/24/18 at 164. An analyst with the Attorney General's Office reviewed the CyberTips, including the hash-matched images, and ran open source searches regarding the associated IP address to determine that the source of the emails is in New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 168-170.

By using open source searches on the IP address associated with the email addresses donnieisagod@aol.com and ddt123abc@aol.com listed in the CyberTip reports, Pena verified the geographical connection between the IP address and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182-83. Using that information, Pena obtained grand jury subpoenas duces tecum for information associated with the IP address from ISP CenturyLink as well as information from AOL regarding the two email addresses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 183; Ex. J. AOL's response to the subpoena resulted in information linking\n   <em>\n    donnieisagod@aol.com\n   </em>\n   with \"Donald Tolbert\" at an address in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87105.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 184-85.

Pena further found that the IP address associated with the above was also associated with an account on a Russian file uploading website, IMGSRC, under the name YUNGMUFFMAN.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 187. That public account contained pictures of young girls, some of them naked.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 187-88; Ex. L.

Under \"user info,\" it states: \"I love girls between 8-15. Someone told on me got my other 2 email accounts cancelled. AOL has something that reads your emails.\" Ex. L. After determining that the emails in the CyberTips were associated with Donald Tolbert, Pena called Tolbert's probation officer and confirmed that he was a registered sex offender on probation in New Mexico. Trans. 4/24/18 at 189-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pena contacted Christina Altamirano, an agent with Homeland Security Investigations specializing in internet crimes against children and sexual exploitation crimes. Trans. 5/25/18 at 67-69; Trans. 4/24/18 at\n   190. Altamirano met with Pena and reviewed the evidence that he had obtained regarding Tolbert. Trans. 5/25/18 at 69-70. This included subscriber information from AOL and Century Link, as well as five NCMEC reports and associated videos. Using that evidence, Altamirano prepared and obtained search warrants for AOL regarding the two email addresses mentioned in the CyberTip reports,\n   <em>\n    ddt123abc@aol.com\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    donnieisagod@aol.com\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71. These warrants revealed subscriber information for the two email addresses, along with IP addresses, times, and dates the accounts were used.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71-72; Exs. M and N. Similarly, Pena obtained search warrants for Tolbert's residence, as well as that of Tolbert's mother.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74; Trans. 4/24/18 at 190-91; Exs. K1 and K2. At Tolbert's residence, officials seized cell phones, a notebook, photographs, books and videos. Trans. 5/25/18 at 74. At his mother's home, they found two computers, a digital camera, and a cell phone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75. Police found photos and videos depicting child pornography on the two computers seized at Tolbert's mother's home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75-76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the Tenth Circuit released the\n   <em>\n    Ackerman\n   </em>\n   decision, the Rio Rancho police department obtained a new search warrant for the two computers without the benefit of the contents of the emails and the attached videos and images. Trans. 5/25/18 at 105. The computers were reexamined, and child pornography images and videos were again found on those machines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76-77. In an interview, Margaret Tolbert told police that she and Defendant were the only ones with access to those computers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Altamirano testified in some detail, and with credibility, about the steps that she would have taken and the investigation she would have conducted if the CyberTips in this case had come to her without the opened emails and attachments (photos and videos) for her to examine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trans. 4/25/18 at 80-97. Altamirano explained that even without the emails and attachments, she still would have conducted an investigation that would have ended in obtaining the emails and attachments, as well as connecting them to Tolbert.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For example, Altamirano could have used the fact that AOL obtained a hash value match to obtain a search warrant for the emails and their attachments, as well as to obtained the name and address of the user associated with that account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81-83. She also explained that once she had a name and address of the AOL account user, she could use law enforcement and open source databases to find out more information about that person. In this case, that information would have led Altamirano to Tolbert, and information about his prior criminal case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83-86. Altamirano also admitted that she had never actually done this, as all of the NCMEC CyberTips she had worked with in the past contained opened emails and/or attachments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99-100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Tolbert moves to suppress \"all evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of NCMEC's warrantless search.\" Doc. 90 at 9. He reasons that under the Tenth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ackerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055956\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1292/\">\n    831 F.3d 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2016), NCMEC is a government entity or agent and therefore was required to obtain a warrant prior to performing searches by opening his emails and their attachments. He contends that all evidence obtained as a result of the warrantless searches is \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" and must be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In its opposition to the motion to suppress, the Government relies on numerous arguments in support of the conclusion that the exclusionary rule does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, the government contends that Tolbert had no legitimate expectation of privacy in his emails because of both the terms of his probation and the terms of the AOL user agreement. Second, it contends that despite the Tenth Circuit's ruling to the contrary in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ackerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055956\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1292/\">\n    831 F.3d 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2016), NCMEC is not a governmental entity or agent and therefore cannot have violated Tolbert's Fourth Amendment rights. Third, it argues that the \"special needs\" exception to the warrant requirement applies here. Fourth, the government argues that under the \"totality of the circumstances\" exception to the warrant requirement, there was no constitutional violation. Fifth, the government contends that the \"good faith\" exception to the warrant requirement justified the search of Tolbert's emails. Sixth, the government argues that the email evidence should be not suppressed because it would have been inevitably discovered. Seventh, it contends that the evidence should not be suppressed due to the attenuation of the taint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court concludes that despite the fact that NCMEC opened the emails and attachments without a warrant, the evidence should not be suppressed because both the good faith and the inevitable discovery exceptions to the warrant requirement apply here. Having reached that conclusion, the Court will not reach the other arguments raised by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Fourth Amendment to our Constitution protects persons against unreasonable searches and seizures in their \"persons, houses, papers, and effects.\" U.S. Const. amend.

Ackerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055956\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1292/\">\n    831 F.3d 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2016). Like the Defendant in this case, defendant Ackerman used AOL as an internet service provider (ISP) to send and receive email. By comparing the hash values generated from the images in Ackerman's email to AOL's library of known hash values for child pornography, the company's automated filter identified one of the images attached to Ackerman's email as child porn. AOL instantly stopped delivery of the message and closed Ackerman's account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Once AOL identified a hash value match in Ackerman's email, the company forwarded a report to NCMEC's online CyberTipline. AOL's report included Ackerman's email along with all four attached images. A NCMEC analyst opened the email, viewed each of the attached images, and confirmed that all four (not just the one AOL's automated filter identified) appeared to be child pornography. After the analyst determined that Ackerman was the likely owner of the account, NCMEC alerted law enforcement agents in the area where he lived. A federal grand jury indicted Ackerman on charges of possession and distribution of child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   There were two issues raised in the\n   <em>\n    Ackerman\n   </em>\n   case. First, Ackerman alleged that NCMEC's actions amounted to an unreasonable search of his email and its attachments because no one sought a warrant and no one invoked any recognized lawful basis for failing to seek one. Because the Fourth Amendment only protects\n   against unreasonable searches undertaken by the government or its agents, Ackerman's motion to suppress raised the question of whether NCMEC qualifies as a governmental entity or agent. The second issue was whether NCMEC merely repeated or actually exceeded the scope of AOL's investigation. This question arose because the Supreme Court's \"private search\" doctrine suggests the government does not conduct a Fourth Amendment \"search\" when it merely repeats an investigation already conducted by a private party like AOL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As to the first issue, the Tenth Circuit held that the NCMEC is a governmental entity. The Court based this conclusion on five considerations. First, the court noted that NCMEC has law enforcement powers, and those powers extend well beyond those enjoyed by private citizens. NCMEC's two primary authorizing statutes- 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258A and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205773\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) -mandate its collaboration with federal (as well as state and local) law enforcement in over a dozen different ways, many of which involve duties and powers conferred on and enjoyed by NCMEC but no other private person. For example, NCMEC is statutorily obliged to maintain an electronic tip line for ISPs to use to report possible Internet child sexual exploitation violations to the government. Under the statutory scheme, NCMEC must forward every single report it receives to federal law enforcement agencies and it may make its reports available to state and local law enforcement as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205773\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2258A(c). Second, ISPs are required to report any known child pornography violations to NCMEC-not to any other governmental agency, but rather to NCMEC alone. ISPs who fail to comply with this obligation face substantial (and apparently criminal) penalties payable to the federal government.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205773\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2258A(a)(1), (e). Third, when NCMEC confirms it has received a report, the ISP must treat that confirmation as a request to preserve evidence issued by the government itself. Failure to comply again opens an ISP to potential civil or criminal sanctions. Fourth, in aid of NCMEC's tip line functions, Congress has statutorily authorized it to receive contraband (child pornography) knowingly and to review its contents intentionally.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205773\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2258A(a), (b)(4). The court observed that these are actions that would normally subject private persons to criminal prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2) (knowing receipt or distribution);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205773\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) (knowing possession or access with intent to view). Fifth, the Tenth Circuit compared NCMEC to Amtrak, and analogized cases wherein the Supreme Court held that Amtrak-a publicly owned corporation-is a governmental entity. Of primary consideration here were the level of governmental control over both NCMEC and Amtrak, the broad statutory mandates to which both entities are subject, their dependence on federal funding, the purpose behind each entity's creation, and the benefits they each conferred on the government. Based on all the foregoing factors, the Tenth Circuit concluded that NCMEC is a governmental entity. Alternatively, the Court found that NCMEC acted as an agent of the government, and was therefore subject to the Fourth Amendment under the\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Under\n   <em>\n    Souza\n   </em>\n   , to determine whether an entity is acting as a government agent, one must ask 1) whether the government knew of and acquiesced in the intrusive conduct, and 2) whether the party performing the search intended to assist law enforcement efforts or to further his own ends. The Tenth Circuit concluded that NCMEC satisfies both criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Ackerman\n   </em>\n   court then turned to the second issue, which was whether the\n   \"private search doctrine\" made the search permissible.

Neither is there any doubt NCMEC's search of the email itself quite easily \"could [have] disclose[d]\" information previously unknown to the government besides whether the one attachment contained contraband. Indeed, when NCMEC opened Mr. Ackerman's email it could have learned any number of private and protected facts, for (again) no one before us disputes that an email is a virtual container, capable of storing all sorts of private and personal details, from correspondence to other private (and perfectly legal) images, video or audio files, and beyond. And we know, too, that this particular container did contain three additional attachments, the content of which AOL and NCMEC knew nothing about before NCMEC opened them too.

Because NCMEC opened Ackerman's email first and did so in order to view not just the attachment that was the target of AOL's private search but three others as well, each of these steps-opening the email and viewing the three other attachments-was enough to risk exposing private, noncontraband information that AOL had not previously examined. Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Ackerman\n   </em>\n   court concluded that the search violated the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   However, the Tenth Circuit explicitly left open the questions of whether the third-party doctrine could preclude motions to suppress like Ackerman's, or that changes in how reports are submitted or reviewed might allow NCMEC to access attachments with matching hash values directly, without reviewing email correspondence or other attachments with possibly\n   private, noncontraband content-and in this way perhaps bring the government closer to a successful invocation of the private search doctrine. The court also left open the possibility that the government could cite exigent circumstances, the attenuation doctrine, the special needs doctrine, or the good faith exception to excuse warrantless searches or avoid suppression in at least some cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     The Good Faith Exception\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The government argues even if NCMEC's search of Tolbert's emails violated the Fourth Amendment, suppression is unwarranted because NCMEC and law enforcement officers acted in good faith.

As the Tenth Court set forth in great detail in\n   <em>\n    Ackerman\n   </em>\n   , Congress created a detailed statutory scheme endowing NCMEC, an incorporated entity,\n   <em>\n    Ackerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055956\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1292/\">\n    831 F.3d at 1295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , with the right to take the actions it did in this case: \"Congress's statutes don't require NCMEC to open and view email and attachments like Mr. Ackerman's. But everyone accepts that Congress has authorized and funded NCMEC to do just that. And everyone accepts that Congress enabled NCMEC to review Mr. Ackerman's email by excepting [NCMEC] from the myriad laws banning the knowing receipt, possession, and viewing of child pornography.

To the Court's knowledge, the First Circuit was the first federal court to suggest that NCMEC was a government agent; that ruling, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cameron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3632914\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/621/#p645\">\n    699 F.3d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 645 (1st Cir. 2012), was issued on November of 2012, a couple of months after the events in this case.\n   <em>\n    Cameron\n   </em>\n   was later followed by the Tenth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Ackerman\n   </em>\n   opinion in 2016, approximately four years after NCMEC reviewed Tolbert's emails in 2012. In September of 2012, when NCMEC opened Tolbert's emails, no court had held that NCMEC was a government entity and therefore was required to obtain a warrant prior to doing what it was statutorily authorized to do: opening emails and attachments that had been forwarded to it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Nor can this Court assert that NCMEC and law enforcement could not have reasonably relied either on the statutory scheme authorizing NCMEC to view the attachments to Tolbert's emails without a warrant, or on their apparent belief that NCMEC was a private entity. Although Tolbert argues that it should have been immediately obvious to the employees of NCMEC and to law enforcement agencies that NCMEC is a government agent, that argument is undermined by the fact that even the district court in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ackerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202968164\">\n    2014 WL 2968164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , No. 13-10176-01-EFM, at *7-8 (D. Kan. July 1, 2014) (unpublished), concluded that NCMEC was not a state actor. Of course, the Tenth Circuit ultimately reached the opposite conclusion and reversed the district court on this issue. However, the question is not whether law enforcement reached the wrong conclusion, but rather whether their belief in the legality of their actions was objectively reasonable at the time. This court concludes that it was. Law enforcement in this case naturally assumed that the statutory authority granted to NCMEC was enough to justify opening the emails. Thus, a reasonable law enforcement officer could conclude that by opening an email or attachment that NCMEC had already opened, he was merely repeating a search previously performed by a private party as permitted by the private search doctrine. The Court finds no evidence of deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent conduct by either NCMEC or the police who reasonably assumed that these were the statutorily authorized actions of a private party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   When Altamirano and Pena acquired the search warrants for AOL's records, Tolbert's home, and Margaret Tolbert's home, they had no reason to believe that AOL had provided NCMEC with information procured in violation of Tolbert's Fourth Amendment rights. There was no evidence NCMEC had exceeded the scope of its authority when it relied on the information AOL provided and opened the hash matched images. And, when the officers executed the search warrant on Tolbert's and his mother's respective homes, they had no reason to believe the warrants were obtained in violation of Tolbert's Fourth Amendment rights.

Specifically, Tolbert contends that it was improper for law enforcement to use grand jury subpoenas directed toward AOL and CenturyLink in order to find out identifying information relating to his IP address and his email accounts. According to Tolbert, under\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   this action constituted a \"search\" that required a warrant, not a mere subpoena. However, Tolbert attempts to stretch\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   too far.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , after the FBI identified the cell phone numbers of several robbery suspects, prosecutors were granted court orders to obtain the suspects' cell phone records under the Stored Communications Act. Among this information was cell-site location information (CSLI). Each time a phone connects to a radio antenna or \"cell site,\" it generates a time-stamped record, or CSLI, which wireless carriers collect and store for their own business purposes. In\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , wireless carriers produced CSLI for the defendant's phone, and the Government was able to obtain 12,898 location points cataloging Carpenter's movements over 127 days-an average of 101 data points per day. Carpenter moved to suppress the data, arguing that the Government's seizure of the records without obtaining a warrant supported by probable cause violated the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court agreed. It noted that individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the whole of their physical movements, and that allowing government access to these types of comprehensive cell-site records without a warrant contravenes that expectation. The Court then noted that in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Supreme Court contrasted this high expectation of privacy in the exhaustive and revealing chronicle of CSLI location information with the much lower expectation of privacy in some types of information voluntarily turned over to third parties, such as bank records and run-of-the-mill phone records.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446025,12186415\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 2216 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, evidence should not be excluded when the investigation would inevitably have discovered the contested evidence by lawful means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In this case, the Government has met its burden to show that the evidence provided to NCMEC in the various CyberTips would have inevitably led law enforcement to obtaining a warrant and searching Tolbert's home even if NCMEC, Pena, and Altamirano had not opened the attachment\n   to Tolbert's email before doing so. In its various CyberTips to NCMEC, which contained only information collected by a private entity, AOL transmitted a significant amount of information regarding the email accounts of the senders, including the originating email addresses, the email addresses of the intended recipient(s), the names of the files that were hash-matched using AOL's IDFP, the hash values for those files, the IP addresses from which the emails originated, and the subjects of the emails. In this case, that included the email addresses\n   <em>\n    ddt123abc@aol.com\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    donnieisagod@aol.com\n   </em>\n   , as well as the IP address 67.0.46.137. Then, a NCMEC analyst ran \"open source\" queries-that is, he or she used information available to members of the public online-with regard to the information described above. The open source query of the IP address showed that the sender's location was in Albuquerque, New Mexico and the internet service provider was Century Link. Searching the email address\n   <em>\n    ddt123abc@aol.com\n   </em>\n   showed a profile on IMGSRC for a user calling himself \"YUNGMUFFMAN,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   whose profile said that his real name was \"Donnie\" and that his email address was\n   <em>\n    ddt666abc@gmail.com\n   </em>\n   . That profile also gave a date of birth and the following statement under \"User info\": \"I love girls between 8-15. someone [sic] told on me got my other 2 email accounts cancelled. AOL has something that reads your emails.\" Then, the NCMEC performed a search on open sources for the email address\n   <em>\n    donnieisagod@aol.com\n   </em>\n   and found a blank profile for \"Don Tolbert.\" At this point, the email and IP addresses found in the header information sent by AOL to NCMEC pointed to a Don or Donnie Tolbert in Albuquerque, New Mexico with a stated sexual interest in young girls who had sent an email with an attachment with the same hash value as a known file containing child pornography. From there, the NCMEC analyst searched the National Sex Offender Public Website for the name \"Don Tolbert.\" That search, in turn, led to a hit on \"Donald Alvin Tolbert,\" a sex offender in Albuquerque who not only was convicted of criminal sexual contact of a minor under age thirteen, but who also had the same date of birth as \"YUNGMUFFMAN,\" the person with the IMGSRC profile with a professed sexual interest in young girls. The NCMEC then transmitted this information-all of which either had been obtained from a private party or generated from publicly available sources-to the New Mexico Attorney General's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At this point, without looking at the attachment in question or opening the emails themselves, the NMAGO would have had ample evidence to support probable cause for a search warrant to open the emails and their attachments, and for NMAGO to continue its own investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trans. 4/24/2018 at 202-204. In fact, this is what Pena did by conducting his own open source investigation (which also led him to Donald Tolbert, registered sex offender) and by securing grand jury subpoenas for the email addresses identified by AOL in the CyberTips. At that point, the evidence that AOL provided in response to the subpoena would have led law enforcement to Tolbert's residence, as well as to his mother's home-all without opening the emails or their attachments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   There are two additional sources of information that would have led to inevitable discovery of the evidence without opening the five emails or their attachments. They are the two additional CyberTips from AOL to NCMEC that are not the subject\n   of the motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. B (CyberTip # 1522765) and C (CybertTip # 1544073). Those two CyberTips-dated July 18, 2012 and August 8, 2012, respectively-also both referred to emails containing images that AOL hash-matched with known child pornography.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243505\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/1197/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The first report concerns an email sent from username \"Donnie T\" at\n   <em>\n    dat666@aol.com\n   </em>\n   . Ex. B. Using open source searches, the NCMEC analyst was able not only to trace the sender's IP address to Albuquerque, New Mexico, but also to link that email address to someone using the name \"Donnie Tolbert.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243505\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/1197/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The NCMEC analyst then forwarded this information to the New Mexico Attorney General's Office, ICAC Task Force.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243505\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/1197/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trans. 4/24/2018 at 96-97. With regard to the second CyberTip dated August 8, 2012,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. C, it referred to an email sent from\n   <em>\n    abc123ddt@aol.com\n   </em>\n   and which contained the same file attachment referred to in Government's Exhibit B.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. B and C; Trans. 4/24/2018 at 99-100. Again, the IP address led the analyst to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Based on this information, the NCMEC analyst also forwarded this report to the New Mexico Attorney General's Office. Both Pena and Altamirano testified credibly that in the absence of the other five CyberTips, and in the absence of anyone from law enforcement actually viewing the images contained in the attachments, they would have continued to investigate these two additional reports. Trans. 4/25/2018 at 87-97, 202-06. The information available from public sources-just like it did with the five other CyberTips previously discussed-would inevitably have led to the same open source searches that revealed the identity of Donald Albert Tolbert as the alleged sender of the emails, and then eventually to the search warrants for his and his mother's homes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Thus, the same evidence that Tolbert seeks to suppress would have been inevitably discovered through independent means.
