Payne, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendant Dish Network, L.L.C.'s MOTION TO DISMISS (ECF No. 20). For the following reasons, the motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural Context\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this action under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"), Plaintiff Ross A. Miller, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , sues Defendant Dish Network, L.L.C., on grounds related to Dish Network's allegedly improper acquisition of Miller's credit report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Miller initially brought this suit in the General District Court of Richmond, Virginia on March 13, 2017. On June 9, 2017, Dish Network removed the case to this Court. After removal, Dish Network moved to dismiss Miller's Bill of Particulars pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 (b)(6). By MEMORANDUM ORDER (ECF No. 17) dated March 29, 2018, the Court required Plaintiff to replead his claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Miller repleaded his claims on April 23, 2018. Dish Network has now moved to dismiss Miller's First Amended Complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Relevant Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 4, 2015, Miller obtained his Equifax credit report. First Am. Compl. *3. He noticed a credit inquiry from Dish Network. First Am. Compl. *3. He asked that Dish Network remove the inquiry. First Am. Compl. *3. Dish Network requested\n   detailed information, which Miller provided. First Am. Compl. *3. On July 7, 2015, Dish Network informed Miller by letter that its investigation was completed and that it had forwarded the removal request to Equifax for removal of the inquiry within 45 days. First Am. Compl. *3. On January 10, 2017, Miller again obtained his Equifax credit report, and the Dish Network inquiry was still present. First Am. Compl. *3. Miller then requested that Equifax remove the inquiry and sought to trigger a reinvestigation by Dish Network and Equifax. First Am. Compl. *3. Equifax provided a generic response, did not remove the inquiry, and there was no meaningful reinvestigation. First Am. Compl. *3. Accordingly, on January 31, 2017, Miller asked that Dish Network remove the inquiry and pay for FCRA violations. First Am. Compl. *3. Dish Network provided \"a letter with the same empty verbiage as their previous letter of July 7, 2015.\" First Am. Compl. *3. Miller followed up with a letter demanding payment for FCRA violations. First Am. Compl. *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Miller claims that Dish Network had no permissible purpose for obtaining his credit report. First Am. Compl. *4. He explains that he \"was simply shopping and comparing rates and plans\"; \"merely requested information of Defendant\"; and \"only inquired about prices, various plans and availability of service.\" First Am. Compl. *5. Miller \"specifically demanded that Defendant NOT pull his credit reports\" and did not provide written instructions to run his credit report. First. Am. Compl. *4-5. And, he did not apply for or seek credit, employment, insurance, government licenses or benefits, or any services from Dish Network. First Am. Compl. *5, 7. Furthermore, no government agencies were involved in the pull of the credit report, and Miller was not under a court order to have his credit report shared with Dish Network. First Am. Compl. *5. Moreover, Miller never initiated a business transaction with Dish Network and there has never been an account between Miller and Dish Network. First Am. Compl. *4. Miller contends that Dish Network \"had absolutely no reason even to believe it could obtain Plaintiff's credit report\" and \"had a specific reason NOT to believe it could or to [sic] obtain Plaintiff's credit report, because Plaintiff clearly and unequivocally denied Defendant any permission to obtain his credit report.\" First Am. Compl. *4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Miller states that Dish Network has a \"usual practice of obtaining credit reports of people who inquire about prices and products.\" First Am. Compl. *6. He notes that Dish Network \"customarily certifies to the credit reporting agency that it is requesting a credit report for the purpose of a business transaction, when in fact Plaintiff did not request DISH services nor initiate any business transaction from Defendant at all.\" First Am. Compl. *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Miller alleges that Dish Network's credit inquiry \"lowered his credit score, incorrectly signals to other creditors that Plaintiff is seeking credit ... and misrepresents Plaintiff's true credit history.\" First Am. Compl. *7. He asserts that the inquiry was on Miller's \"credit report for nearly a year,\" and each month served as \"a separate harm to his credit scores and credit history.\" First Am. Compl. *8. Miller also maintains that he has expended time and money writing to credit reporting agencies and to Dish Network; \"spent money on paper, envelopes, ink and postage\"; \"paid court filing fees\"; and \"spent money on parking and gas driving to court.\" First Am. Compl. *8-9. Additionally, Miller has suffered increased blood pressure \"over the months this has been going on and other pre-existing medical conditions have been aggravated, because\n   of the considerable length of time this matter has spanned.\" First Am. Compl. *9. And, he has had a \"diabetic flare-up\" and needed to take additional blood pressure medication. First Am. Compl. *9. Furthermore, Miller has \"suffered numerous negative emotions\" due to Dish Network's \"in-actions, misrepresentations, and deception,\" including \"aggravation, irritation, loss of happiness and loss of enjoyment of old age, fear, worry, anger, tumult, frustration, vexation and emotional distress.\" First Am. Compl. *9. Finally, Miller contends that his privacy has been invaded by Dish Network. First Am.

Article III Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Fourth Circuit has explained the basic standards governing the doctrine of standing as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Article III of the U.S. Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" \"One element of the case-or-controversy requirement is that plaintiffs must establish that they have standing to sue.\" To invoke federal jurisdiction, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing the three \"irreducible minimum requirements\" of Article III standing:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (1) an injury-in-fact (i.e., a concrete and particularized invasion of a legally protected interest); (2) causation (i.e., a fairly traceable connection between the alleged injury in fact and the alleged conduct of the defendant); and (3) redressability (i.e., it is likely and not merely speculative that the plaintiff's injury will be remedied by the relief plaintiff seeks in bringing suit).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Beck v. McDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277363\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/262/#p269\">\n    848 F.3d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269 (4th Cir. 2017) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Supreme Court has defined the \"injury-in-fact\" element as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered \"an invasion of a legally protected interest\" that is \"concrete and particularized\" and \"actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\" ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   For an injury to be \"particularized,\" it \"must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Particularization is necessary to establish injury in fact, but it is not sufficient. An injury in fact must also be \"concrete.\" ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A \"concrete\" injury must be \"\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   \"; that is, it must actually exist. When we have used the adjective \"concrete,\" we have meant to convey the usual meaning of the term-\"real,\" and not \"abstract.\" Concreteness, therefore, is quite different from particularization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"Concrete\" is not, however, necessarily synonymous with \"tangible.\" Although tangible injuries are perhaps easier to recognize, we have confirmed in many of our previous cases that intangible injuries can nevertheless be concrete.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   In determining whether an intangible harm constitutes injury in fact, both history and the judgment of Congress play important roles. Because the doctrine of standing derives from the case-or-controversy requirement, and because that requirement in turn is grounded in historical practice, it is instructive to consider whether an alleged intangible harm has a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts. In addition, because Congress is well positioned to identify intangible harms that meet minimum Article III requirements, its judgment is also instructive and important. Thus, we said in\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   that Congress may \"elevat[e] to the status of legally cognizable injuries concrete,\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   injuries that were previously inadequate in law.\" Similarly, Justice Kennedy's concurrence in that case explained that \"Congress has the power to define injuries and articulate chains of causation that will give rise to a case or controversy where none existed before.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Congress' role in identifying and elevating intangible harms does not mean that a plaintiff automatically satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right. Article III standing requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation. For that reason, Robins could not, for example, allege a bare procedural violation, divorced from any concrete harm, and satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

Specifically, Dish Network maintains that Miller \"affirmatively states that he contacted Defendant and inquired about prices, features, and product availability\" and that Miller claimed that Dish Network \"certified to Equifax that it had a permissible purpose to access Plaintiff's credit report.\" Def.'s Br. 10. These allegations, Dish Network argues, show that that it \"had reason to believe that the information obtained would be used 'in connection with a credit transaction' with and 'the extension of credit to' [Miller].\" Def.'s Br. 10-11 (citations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those contentions are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Relevant Permissible Purposes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As an initial matter, Miller's allegations, taken as true and construed liberally, show that Dish Network cannot rely on several \"permissible purposes\" enumerated by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a). Miller avers that: (1) he was not under a court order to have his credit report pulled; (2) he did not furnish written instructions to obtain his credit report (and, in fact, denied consent to Dish Network obtaining his report); (3) he did not seek employment\n   with Dish Network; (4) he did not apply for credit from Dish Network; (5) he did not apply for insurance from Dish Network; (6) he did not apply for any government licenses or benefits from Dish Network and government agencies were not involved; (7) there has never been an account between the parties; (8) Miller did not apply for services from Dish Network; and (9) Miller \"merely requested information of Defendant,\" \"only inquired about prices, various plans and availability of service,\" and \"was simply shopping and comparing rates and plans.\" First Am. Compl. *4-5, 7. Those allegations eliminate all of the \"permissible purposes\" except for those under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A) (credit transactions) and 1681b (a) (3) (F) (i) (business transactions initiated by the consumer). That is true even for those other permissible purposes that permit a \"reason to believe\" exception (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will focus on whether Miller has alleged the lack of a permissible purpose under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A) and 1681b(a)(3)(F)(i). To those purposes we now turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    b. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As set out above, Miller claims that there has never been any account between him and Dish Network; that he never applied for credit or services; and that he simply requested information about products and plans. First Am. Compl. *4-5. And, Miller alleges that Dish Network has a \"usual practice of obtaining credit reports of people who inquire about prices and products.\" First Am. Compl. *6. In essence, Miller contends that his only interaction with Dish Network was to engage in \"comparison shopping\" behavior, such as asking basic service-related questions, and that Dish Network pulled his credit report (in line with its standard practice) anyway. The question, then, is whether Miller's interactions with Dish Network (as he alleged them) fall within 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   That section establishes a permissible purpose where a user \"has reason to believe\" that it \"intends to use the information in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumer on whom the information is to be furnished and involving the extension of credit to, or review or collection of an account of, the consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A). As a threshold matter, it is clear that Dish Network could not have had a reasonable belief that it intended to use the credit report for \"review or collection of an account of\" Miller because Miller has alleged that there was never an account between the parties. Hence, all that remains is the issue of whether Dish Network had a reason to believe that it intended \"to use the information in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumer ... and involving the extension of credit to ... the consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20753322\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Decisions that have addressed the issue teach that a permissible purpose under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a) (3) (A) cannot, as a matter of law, be established where the defendant obtained a credit report in response to mere comparison shopping behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20588927\">\n    2018 WL 588927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15-16 ;\n   <em>\n    Qureshi v.

Similarly, the Ninth Circuit has viewed multiple sections of the FCRA together to understand what is required under a particular section, in accordance with general canons of statutory interpretation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    Heaton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206744525\">\n    2015 WL 6744525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   This Court has previously held that FTC Staff Opinion Letters, such as that cited by\n   <em>\n    Heaton\n   </em>\n   , are \"informative\" as to the interpretation of the FCRA (albeit not \"entitled to the deference that is owed to a formal Commission Opinion\").\n   <em>\n    Milbourne v.

And, the\n   <em>\n    Heaton\n   </em>\n   court's view finds support in the general principles set out in\n   <em>\n    Stergiopoulos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241141\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/1043/#p1047\">\n    427 F.3d at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, both\n   <em>\n    Qureshi\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Traveler\n   </em>\n   implicitly relied upon the 1998 FTC Letter in evaluating whether a permissible purpose had been established as a matter of law under\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Qureshi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205372184\">\n    2016 WL 5372184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ;\n   <em>\n    Traveler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20173687\">\n    2006 WL 173687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-5. Moreover, the FTC (like\n   <em>\n    Heaton\n   </em>\n   ) has expressly applied the principles set forth in the 1998 FTC Letter to the \"credit transaction\" context. In a 2011 summary of its interpretations of the FCRA, the FTC explained in\n   <em>\n    its commentary to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A)\n   </em>\n   that\n   <em>\n    no credit transaction\n   </em>\n   has occurred where a consumer \"simply asks for information about [products] and prices.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FTC,\n   <em>\n    40 Years of Experience with the Fair Credit Reporting Act: An FTC Staff Report with Summary of Interpretations\n   </em>\n   45 (2011) [hereinafter FTC,\n   <em>\n    40 Years of Experience\n   </em>\n   ]. Accordingly, the Court adopts the reasoning of the\n   <em>\n    Heaton\n   </em>\n   court and concludes that comparison shopping behavior will not support a permissible purpose under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Second, in\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   , the court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Section 1681b(a)(3)(A)\"requires that the entity must be engaged in a credit transaction in which the consumer is participating.\" \"An entity may rely on [ section 1681b(a)(3)(A) ] only if the consumer initiates the transaction. A third party cannot troll for reports, nor can it request a report on a whim. Rather, there must be a direct link between a consumer's search for credit and the bank's credit report request.\" T-Mobile did not have a credit account with Boone and was not close to extending credit to Boone. According to the complaint, Boone was essentially window shopping.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   Furthermore, Boone's contact with T-Mobile did not involve the extension of credit under the FCRA. The term \"credit\" is defined in the FCRA as it is defined in the Equal Credit Opportunity Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201691\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"ECOA\"). Thus, \"credit\" means \"the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer payment of debt or to incur debts and defer its payment or to purchase property or services and defer payment therefor.\" T-Mobile was not extending Boone the right to defer payment on a transaction or debt. Boone had not initiated a transaction or sought to create a debt; he merely asked for price quotes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   The Third Circuit has found a \"permissible purpose\" under section 1681b(a)(3)(A) where a consumer owes a debt or applies for credit. In\n   <em>\n    Huertas v. Citigroup, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2010748338\">\n    2014 WL 10748338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. Aug. 21, 2014) ] the Court held that \"[ section] 1681b(a)(3)(A) authorizes access to a consumer's credit report 'when the consumer applies for credit[.]' \" In\n   <em>\n    Huertas v. Galaxy Asset Management\n   </em>\n   , the Court [sic] that a creditor had a permissible purpose under section 1681b(a)(3)(A) when a consumer sought credit, received credit, and accumulated debt. The complaint alleges that matters had not gone nearly that far. Boone did not apply for credit and did not accumulate debt with T-Mobile.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20588927\">\n    2018 WL 588927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 (citations omitted). The Court finds this analysis compelling, and it therefore adopts\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    's\n   </em>\n   reasoning in addition to (and in support of) that of\n   <em>\n    Heaton\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Additionally, the 1998 FTC Letter itself provides guidance that\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   relates\n   to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A). Importantly, the Letter states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   For example, a [car] dealer may obtain a report [under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A) ], if one is necessary, in order to arrange financing requested by the consumer. The dealer may also obtain a report to check a consumer's creditworthiness when the consumer presents a personal check to pay for the vehicle. By contrast, a permissible purpose would not arise if a consumer intends to pay by cash.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Letter from Medine to Coffey,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%2034323748\">\n    1998 WL 34323748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. As explained above, the Court finds FTC Staff Letters to be informative, and courts have looked to this Letter for guidance in interpreting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A). The FTC recently reaffirmed the specific conclusions cited above in its staff interpretation summary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FTC,\n   <em>\n    40 Years of Experience\n   </em>\n   45, 48. Those conclusions also comport with the principles set forth herein. Hence, the Court relies on them in evaluating Dish Network's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Given the foregoing discussion and analysis, this is an easy case. Miller was, just like the named plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   , \"essentially window shopping,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , comparison shopping.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20588927\">\n    2018 WL 588927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15. Dish Network \"did not have a credit account with [Miller] and was not close to extending credit to [Miller].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20588927\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And, Miller \"had not initiated a transaction or sought to create a debt\" and \"did not apply for credit and did not accumulate debt.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20588927\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Miller's interactions with Dish Network were clearly insufficient to support a permissible purpose under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20588927\">\n    2018 WL 588927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15-16 ;\n   <em>\n    Heaton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206744525\">\n    2015 WL 6744525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ; FTC,\n   <em>\n    40 Years of Experience\n   </em>\n   45. Additionally, nothing in the First Amended Complaint suggests that Miller proposed to pay for Dish Network services on credit or with a check. Indeed, Miller did not apply for or request services at all. In short, the First Amended Complaint pleads that Dish Network had no permissible purpose under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A) to access Miller's credit report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Furthermore, taking Miller's allegations as true, Dish Network could not have had a\n   <em>\n    reason to believe\n   </em>\n   that it intended to use Miller's credit report in connection with a credit transaction involving Miller and the extension of credit to him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A). As set out above, the \"reason to believe\" exception refers to factual, not legal, ambiguity. Nothing in the First Amended Complaint implies any factual ambiguity as to Miller's interactions with Dish Network. And, Miller alleges that Dish Network has a common practice of obtaining credit reports of consumers (such as Miller) who merely ask about prices and products, thereby further demonstrating that Dish Network did not obtain Miller's credit report with the reasonable belief that it intended to use the report for a credit transaction purpose. First Am. Compl. *6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In sum, Miller has sufficiently alleged that Dish Network may not rely on 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A) to defeat his claim at the motion to dismiss stage. Indeed, if Miller's allegations are not rebutted, they are sufficient to support a finding that, as a matter of law, Dish Network had no permissible purpose for accessing his credit report under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    c. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(F)(i)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The analysis of the permissible purpose under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(F)(i) is similar to that of the \"credit transaction\" permissible purpose. As explained, Miller alleges that his interactions with Dish Network simply involved comparison shopping behavior and that Dish Network ran his credit report (in accordance with its normal practice). The question is whether this comes within the ambit of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(F)(i), which creates a permissible purpose where a user has reason to believe that it \"otherwise has a legitimate business need for the [credit report] information ... in connection with a business transaction that is initiated by the consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(F)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The same decisions that show that mere comparison shopping behavior cannot establish a permissible purpose under the \"credit transaction\" provision likewise demonstrate that such conduct cannot prove a permissible purpose under the \"business transaction\" provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20588927\">\n    2018 WL 588927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14-15 ;\n   <em>\n    Qureshi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205372184\">\n    2016 WL 5372184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-3 ;\n   <em>\n    Traveler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20173687\">\n    2006 WL 173687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, *3-5 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heaton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206744525\">\n    2015 WL 6744525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (relying on the 1998 FTC Letter, which mainly established principles applicable to the \"business transaction\" permissible purpose, to interpret the \"credit transaction\" provision).

All that the Fourth Circuit has had to say on the subject is that \"[t]he terms 'legitimate business need' and 'in\n   connection with' refer to the needs and objections of the individual to whom the report is furnished, not the needs of the person about whom the report is furnished.\"\n   <em>\n    Korotki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20753322\">\n    1997 WL 753322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. But, that does not affect the question of whether comparison shopping behavior is sufficient to establish a legitimate business need in connection with a transaction initiated by the consumer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Nevertheless, there is one non-judicial interpretation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(F)(i) more closely related to the context at issue here that is instructive and persuasive. In the 1998 FTC Letter referenced above, the FTC staff reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   [ 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(F)(i) ] permits CRAs to provide consumer reports to any party who has a 'legitimate business need for the information in connection with a business transaction that is initiated by the consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    You ask whether this provision allows a dealer to obtain a consumer report on a person who 'comes to an automobile dealership and requests information\" from a salesman about one or more automobiles. In our view it does not, because a request for general information about products and prices offered does not involve a business transaction initiated by the consumer.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   More generally, you ask \"when is the beginning of a business transaction\" initiated by the consumer? In responding to this question, it is important to note that [ 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(F)(i) ] limits this \"business need\" permissible purpose to transactions (i) that are \"initiated\" by the consumer and (ii) where the seller has a \"legitimate business need\" for the information. The staff's view is that an automobile dealer may obtain a report only in those circumstances in which the consumer clearly understands that he or she is initiating the purchase or lease of a vehicle\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the seller has a legitimate business need for the consumer report information in order to complete the transaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    For example, a consumer who asks a dealer questions about prices and financing is not necessarily indicating an intent to purchase or lease a vehicle from that particular dealer.

In this regard, we note that obtaining information for negotiation purposes does not constitute a \"legitimate\" business need. The dealer must have a specific need for the information directly related to the completion of the transaction. For example, a dealer may obtain a report, if one is necessary, in order to arrange financing requested by the consumer. The dealer may also obtain a report to check a consumer's creditworthiness when the consumer presents a personal check to pay for the vehicle. By contrast, a permissible purpose would not arise if a consumer intends to pay by cash.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Letter from Medine to Coffey,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%2034323748\">\n    1998 WL 34323748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (emphasis added).

Consequently, the Court finds the FTC's guidance to be persuasive and adopts it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   In applying those principles, the Court deems\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   to be precisely on point and instructive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   The first alleged permissible purpose is that T-Mobile obtained the report \"in connection with a business transaction that [was] initiated by the consumer\" and for a \"legitimate business need.\" The complaint does not establish, however, that Boone initiated a business transaction. Rather, Boone alleges that he made a \"general inquiry about the availability of cell phone plans and rates,\" made it clear that he did not want his consumer report to be accessed if a hard credit inquiry was required, \"did not initiate a transaction,\" and \"never signed any agreement and never agreed to any services from [T-Mobile].\" Those actions do not amount to a \"business transaction ... initiated by the consumer.\" The [FTC] agrees. \"[A] request for general information about products and prices offered does not involve a business transaction initiated by the consumer.\" For instance, a consumer who asks a car dealer to \"test drive\" a car, or asks questions about pricing and financing, \"is not necessarily indicating an intent to purchase or lease a vehicle from that particular dealer.\" Conducting a hard credit inquiry is therefore inappropriate at this stage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Moreover, T-Mobile did not have a \"legitimate business need\" to obtain Boone's credit report. He asked only about prices and financing. According to the FTC:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   Only in those circumstances where it is clear both to the consumer and to the dealer that the consumer is actually initiating the purchase or lease of a specific vehicle and, in addition, the dealer has a legitimate business need for consumer report information may the dealer obtain a report without written permission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Such circumstances were not present according to Boone's allegations....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20588927\">\n    2018 WL 588927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14-15 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   , the First Amended Complaint \"alleges that [Miller] made a 'general inquiry about the availability of [Dish Network] plans and rates,' made it clear that he did not want his consumer report to be accessed if a hard credit inquiry was required, 'did not initiate a transaction,' and 'never signed any agreement and never agreed to any services from [Dish Network].' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20588927\">\n    2018 WL 588927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (citations omitted).

That is because, as explained above, nothing in the First Amended Complaint implies any factual ambiguity as to the interactions between Dish Network and Miller. And, it was Dish Network's general practice to obtain credit reports of people in Miller's position (thereby further showing that it did not have a reasonable belief that the credit information would be used in connection with a business transaction initiated by Miller).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Am.

And, if Dish Network cannot counter Miller's allegations, they permit a finding that, as a matter of law, Dish Network had no permissible purpose under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(a)(3)(F)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. The Other Elements of the 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(f) Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Dish Network raises no argument that Miller has failed to satisfy the\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   elements of a claim under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(f).

The 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n(b) Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Dish Network also asserts that Miller failed to state a claim under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. 11. It is clear that 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n(b) only provides a cause of action to credit reporting agencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n(b). Miller concedes that he is not pursuing an individual claim under that provision. Pl.'s Opp'n *16. Thus, there is no need further to address that aspect of Dish Network's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion will be granted as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Concluding Comments &amp; Instructions to Miller\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   After reviewing Miller's papers in relation to Dish Network's motion, there are several matters that the Court deems it necessary to address, particularly given Miller's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   First, Miller's First Amended Complaint is difficult to interpret. Miller presents his claims using a \"kitchen sink\" approach that does not clearly delineate the theories of liability he is actually presenting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, and in the interests of clarity and judicial economy as this litigation proceeds, Miller is instructed to submit a Second Amended Complaint that clarifies the claims he is actually asserting and organizes those claims into specified \"Counts.\" He is further instructed to omit references to facts, statutes, or other materials that do not form the basis of his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Second, the Court observes that Miller has attempted to incorporate by reference his Bill of Particulars (ECF No. 1-3) into his First Amended Complaint. First Am.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Compl. *1. The Court by MEMORANDUM ORDER (ECF No. 17) required Miller to\n   <em>\n    replead\n   </em>\n   his claims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(c)(2). The Court considers it to be procedurally improper for an amended complaint to incorporate by reference a previous complaint that is no longer operative. And, in any case, such incorporation by reference can lead to substantial ambiguity as to what claims and allegations remain active. Therefore, Miller is instructed\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to incorporate by reference previous complaints (including the Bill of Particulars) into any future complaints filed in this action. Miller must directly insert into any new complaints all content from previous complaints that he would like the Court to review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Third, Miller attempted to incorporate by reference his Opposition to Dish Network's first motion to dismiss (which was denied as moot by MEMORANDUM ORDER (ECF No. 17) ) into his Opposition to the motion to dismiss at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n *4. That is procedurally improper, and Miller is instructed not to incorporate by reference previous papers into his briefs in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Dish Network's MOTION TO DISMISS (ECF No. 20) will be granted in part and denied in part. It will be granted with respect to any request for relief that the Court refer Dish Network to the appropriate authorities. It will also be granted as to any claim raised pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n(b). The motion will be otherwise denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   It is so ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    Miller also alleges that Dish Network illegally deducted money from his account and refused to refund it.

Allegations cannot be raised by way of a plaintiff's response to a motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Neal v. Patrick Henry Cmty.

First, as detailed above, the allegation that Miller \"contacted Defendant and inquired about prices, features, and product availability\" offers no support for Dish Network's position.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Br. 10. Second, Dish Network's certification \"to Equifax that it had a permissible purpose\" does not show that Dish Network reasonably believed that it had a permissible purpose.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Br. 10-11. In the vast majority of cases, the user of a credit report will have certified that it had a permissible purpose in accordance with 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(f)(2) ; the Court still must determine, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(f)(1), whether the user\n    <em>\n     in fact\n    </em>\n    had a permissible purpose.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(f). The Court declines to interpret the FCRA as assuming the infallibility of a user's certification because doing so would gut the FCRA and render meaningless the requirement under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(f)(1) that a credit report actually be \"obtained for a purpose for which the consumer report is authorized to be furnished under this section.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1681b(f)(1). And, in any case, Miller expressly alleges that Dish Network, in line with its general practice, certified that it had a permissible purpose when, in fact, it did not. First Am. Compl. *4, 6-7.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    Furthermore, it may well be true, as Dish Network contends, that users of credit reports do not need \"permission\" to obtain them, that it is insufficient for a plaintiff to allege that he never sought to acquire services from the defendant, and that a plaintiff does not need to have direct dealings with a defendant for it to obtain a credit report lawfully.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Br. 9-10. However,\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n    action must give rise to a permissible purpose, and here Miller alleges that his\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    connection with Dish Network was to engage in comparison shopping behavior.
