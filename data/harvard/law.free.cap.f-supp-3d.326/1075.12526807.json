Dallas High School, located in Dallas, Oregon, and under the control of Defendant Dallas School District No. 2 (\"District\"), adopted and implemented the Student Safety Plan (\"Plan\") together with underlying policies allowing transgender students to use restrooms, locker rooms, and showers that match their gender identity. Plaintiff Parents for Privacy is composed of current and former Dallas High School students (\"Student Plaintiffs\") and their parents (\"Parent Plaintiffs\"). Plaintiff Lindsay Golly formerly attended Dallas High School during the 2015-2016 school year while the Plan was in place. Compl. \u00b6 16, ECF 1. Plaintiffs Kris Golly and Jon Golly are her parents as well as the parents of their son A.G., an eighth-grade student who will soon attend Dallas High School. Compl. \u00b6 16. Plaintiff Melissa Gregory is a parent of T.F., a student at Dallas high school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs challenge the legality of the plan, seek to enjoin District from enforcing it, and request that the Court order District to require students to only use the restrooms, locker rooms, and showers that match their biological sex. Additionally, Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the U.S. Department of Education (\"USDOE\"), U.S. Department of Justice (\"USDOJ\"), and their respective secretaries (collectively \"Federal Defendants\") from taking any action based on USDOE's alleged rule redefining the word \"sex\" as used in Title IX to include gender identity. District and Federal Defendants have separately filed motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Moreover, Basic Rights Oregon (\"BRO\"), a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the rights of Oregon's LGBTQ community, filed a motion to intervene as a defendant in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Intervene, ECF. 24. The Court\n   granted BRO's motion to intervene and BRO filed its own motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BRO's Mot. to Dismiss, ECF 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lastly, the Oregon Department of Education (\"ORDOE\") and Governor Kate Brown (collectively \"State\") were originally named parties in this lawsuit. Upon the parties' stipulation, Plaintiffs' claims against those defendants were dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. Notice of Dismissal, ECF 11. State, however, moved to rejoin this litigation as amicus curiae.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Leave to Appear as Amicus Curiae, ECF 50. The Court granted that motion, and State filed its amicus brief in support of District's Motion to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amicus Br., ECF 50-1. In sum, there are three fully-briefed motions to dismiss before the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons discussed below, the motions are GRANTED and this case is DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs bring the following eight claims for relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     First Claim:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (against Federal Defendants) Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 136-185.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Second Claim:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (against District and Federal Defendants) Violation of the Fundamental Right to Privacy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 186-206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Third Claim:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (against District and Federal Defendants) Violation of the Parents' Fundamental Right to Direct the Education and Upbringing of Their Children.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 207-220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Fourth Claim:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (against District) Violation of Title IX,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 221-247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Fifth Claim:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (against Federal Defendants): Violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 248-255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sixth Claim:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (against District and Federal Defendants): Violation of the First Amendment's Guarantee of Free Exercise of Religion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 256-264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Seventh Claim:\n   </strong>\n   (against District) Public Accommodation Discrimination, Or.

Definitions\n   </strong>\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court finds it necessary to explain its use of several relevant terms. In a recent decision, the Third Circuit aptly summarized the same set of terms the Court uses throughout this Opinion &amp; Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517346\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/893/179/#p183\">\n    893 F.3d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 183-84 (3d Cir. 2018). The Court adopts the following definitions from the Third Circuit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Sex\" is defined as the \"anatomical and physiological processes that lead to or denote male or female.\" Typically, sex is determined at birth based on the appearance of external genitalia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Gender\" is a \"broader societal construct\" that encompasses how a \"society defines what male or female is within a certain cultural context.\" A person's gender identity is their subjective, deep-core sense of self as being a particular gender.... \"[C]isgender\" refers to a person who identifies with the sex that person was determined to have at birth. The term \"transgender\" refers to a person whose gender identity does not align with the sex that person was determined to have at birth. A transgender boy is therefore a person who has a lasting, persistent male gender identity, though that person's sex was determined to be female at birth. A transgender girl is a person who has a lasting, persistent female gender identity though that person's sex was determined to be male at birth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517346\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/893/179/#p183\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Student A was a twelfth grade student at Dallas High School.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76. Student A was born and remains biologically female.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77. Before September 2015, Student A used the girls' restrooms, locker rooms, and showers (collectively \"facilities\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77. In September 2015, Student A publicly identified as a boy and asked District to allow him\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to use the boys' facilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78-79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In November 2015, District responded to Student A's request by implementing the Student Safety Plan entitled \"Transgender Student Access to Locker Room.\" Compl. Ex. A, at 1. The Plan permits Student A to use Dallas High School's locker rooms, restrooms, and showers consistent with his gender identity. Compl. \u00b6 75, Ex. A, at 1. The preamble to the Plan states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   All students have rights for attendance at public schools, and we have to follow the laws which protect those students['] rights. This safety plan has been created to support a transgender male expressing the right to access the boy's locker room at Dallas High School. Following are targeted areas\n   of concern and the procedures or actions aimed to support all students in this transition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Compl. Ex. A, at 1. At that time, Student A had not expressed which bathroom he felt comfortable using.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79. Accordingly, the Plan states that Student A \"can use any of the bathrooms in the building to which he identifies sexually.\" Compl. Ex. A, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Furthermore, the Plan, as referred to by the parties, also encompasses several previously established District policies. Compl. Exs. B-G. District's nondiscrimination policy provides that District \"prohibits discrimination and harassment on any basis protected by law, including ... an individual[']s perceived or actual ... sex\" or \"sexual orientation.\" Compl. Ex. B, at 1. Sexual orientation under the policy \"means an individual's actual or perceived ... gender identity, regardless of whether the individual's gender identity, appearance, expression or behavior differs from that traditionally associated with the individual's sex at birth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Likewise, District has a policy entitled \"Equal Education Opportunity\" providing that \"[e]very student of the district will be given equal educational opportunities regardless of ... sex\" or \"sexual orientation.\" Compl. Ex. C. The policy explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Further, no student will be excluded from participating in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity conducted by the district.

Specifically, Student A has used the boys' locker room and showers and has changed clothes while male students were present.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82. Plaintiffs allege that male students at Dallas High school experience \"embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension, and stress produced by using the restroom with students of the opposite sex[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83. The alleged risks posed to those students persist despite the presence of privacy stalls in the bathrooms because \"there are large gaps above and below the stall doors, and gaps along the sides of the doors\" through which \"another student could see through even inadvertently.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Plaintiffs maintain that Student Plaintiffs \"must risk exposing themselves to the opposite sex every time they use the restroom.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83. Consequently, Student Plaintiffs and other students use the restroom as little as possible and \"risk tardiness by hurrying to distant facilities of the school, during short 5-minute passing periods, to try and find a restroom not likely to be used by a student of the opposite biological sex.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Student and Parent Plaintiffs expressed their concerns about the Plan to Dallas High School's principal who informed them that all facilities may be used by any student regardless of biological sex.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87. The principal also told Parent Plaintiffs that their students could use the unisex staff lounge which has no shower.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 91.

Two of the four guidance documents that comprise the challenged Rule were withdrawn before this lawsuit commenced. Federal Defendants claim that Plaintiffs cannot show that they suffered any injury as a result of the Rule or that Plaintiffs' alleged injuries would be redressed by the relief\n   that they seek from Federal Defendants. The May 2016 Dear Colleague Letter-the only guidance specifically addressing transgender students' use of school facilities-was expressly withdrawn by the February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter. Federal Defendants point to District's Plan as the sole source of Plaintiffs' alleged injuries. In other words, withdrawal of Federal Defendants' Rule would neither compel District to rescind its Plan nor require students at Dallas High School to use facilities matching their biological sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   To have Article III standing, a plaintiff must show that, (1) it suffered an \"injury in fact,\" (2) arising out of the defendant's conduct, and (3) \"it must be 'likely,' as opposed to 'speculative,' that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

Federal Defendants do not challenge the injury requirement for standing. Instead, they argue that the alleged injury is solely attributable to District's Plan and that Plaintiffs are unable to establish either causation or redressability. As discussed below, however, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged their remaining claims based on District's Plan. Accordingly, because those dismissed claims form the basis for Plaintiff's alleged injury, Plaintiffs' APA claim falls with them.

Federal Defendants point out that four of the five claims that Plaintiffs allege against them do not mention any federal action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss 8, ECF 49. Plaintiffs' second, third, fifth, and sixth claims for relief only allege actions taken by District.

Particularly, Plaintiffs allege that Federal Defendants' enforcement of Title IX against other school districts based on the Rule caused District to enact the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Causation requires showing that an injury is \"fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

District's Plan was enacted in November 2015, well before the May 2016 Dear Colleague letter was issued. Similarly, most of Federal Defendants' enforcement actions alleged in the complaint occurred after the Plan was enacted.

It would be purely speculative to conclude that Federal Defendants' enforcement actions-as opposed to Student A's request or the requirements of many other state and federal laws-substantially motivated District to enact its Plan. There are no allegations based on District's statements explaining why they enacted the Plan.

Defendants direct the Court to several cases similar to this one in which courts have rejected Plaintiffs' purported privacy interest in favor of transgender students' access to school facilities. The following decisions are not binding upon this Court; however, in the absence of binding authority from the Ninth Circuit, the Court relies on these opinions for their persuasiveness. Defendants primarily rely upon\n   <em>\n    Students &amp; Parents\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206629520\">\n    2017 WL 6629520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In reaching that conclusion, the court considered the practical implications of transgender students' access to facilities, our Nation's history of protecting and deferring to school administrators' discretion, and contemporary notions of liberty and justice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *24-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The court noted that no student was \"compelled\" by a state actor to use facilities with a transgender student. Rather, District 211's policy allowed transgender students to use facilities of their choice. The facilities included privacy stalls as well as other protections. Additionally, privacy alternatives such as separate, single-user facilities were available. Students could also request the use of an alternate changing area within the locker rooms. The court found these privacy protections significant and that they distinguished the case from those involving compulsion and involuntary invasions of privacy. The court opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Generally speaking, the penumbral rights of privacy the Supreme Court has recognized in other contexts protect certain aspects of a person's private space and decision-making from governmental intrusion. Even in the context of the right to privacy in one's own body, the cases deal with compelled intrusion into or with respect to a person's intimate space or exposed body. No case recognizes a right to privacy that insulates a person from coming into contact with someone who is different than they are, or who they fear will act in a way that causes them to be embarrassed or uncomfortable, when there are alternative means for both individuals to protect themselves from such contact, embarrassment, or discomfort.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *24. Regarding the Nation's history of deferring to schools, the court wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Therefore, our Nation's deeply rooted history and tradition of protecting school administrators' discretion require that this Court not unduly constrain schools from fulfilling their role as a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him or her for later professional training, and in helping him or her to adjust normally to his or her environment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted). The court also found that the plaintiffs' asserted privacy right was inconsistent with contemporary notions of liberty and justice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *25. It was persuaded that transgender people do not live their lives in conformance with their sex assigned at birth and the transgender students at issue in that case were treated by others in a manner that was consistent with their gender identities. Additionally, the court reflected on the fact that, at that time, the U.S. military and militaries of other nations allowed transgender personnel to serve fully and openly. Recognition and acceptance of transgender people in various areas of society contradicted plaintiffs' asserted right of high school students not to share facilities with transgender students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Similarly, the Seventh Circuit granted a transgender boy's request for a preliminary injunction enjoining a school district from preventing him from using facilities consistent with his gender identity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitaker v.

The court elaborated that the bathroom policy applied to all restrooms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   That means cisgender boys use the boys' restrooms with transgender boys just like cisgender girls use the girls' restrooms with transgender girls. District 211 also has made clear that it will allow transgender boys to use the boys' locker rooms and will provide the same privacy protections in the boys' locker rooms as exist in the girls' locker rooms, if requested. Therefore, the alleged discrimination and hostile environment that Girl Plaintiffs claim to experience is not on the basis of their sex, and any discomfort Girl Plaintiffs allege they feel is not the result of conduct that is directed\n   at them because they are female.

Indeed, in the February 2017 Dear Colleague Letter, Federal Defendants maintain that discrimination against transgender students is prohibited by Title IX, while at the same time they deferred to the discretion of school administrators on the issue of segregated facilities.

ORDOE promulgated guidance for school districts entitled: \"Creating a Safe and Supportive School Environment for Transgender Students.\" Compl. Ex. M-1, at 1. That guidance provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   It is recommended that school districts accept a student's assertion of his/her/their own gender identity. A\n   student who says she is a girl and wishes to be regarded that way throughout the school day should be respected and treated like any other girl. So too with a student who says he is a boy and wishes to be affirmed that way throughout the school day. Such a student should be respected and treated like any other boy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.

Oregon's statutory scheme, case law, and administrative guidance discussed above support State's position. Oregon law prohibits discrimination in public education based on an individual's gender identity. Plaintiffs seek a Court order directing District to treat transgender students differently based on their gender identity in violation of Oregon law. O.R.S. 659A.403(1) ; O.R.S. 174.100(7).
