The matter is fully briefed and the Court held a hearing on April 25, 2018. For the reasons that follow, the Court GRANTS ASC's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 26, 2014, Plaintiff injured his shoulder and thumb while working for ASC as a seaman aboard the M/V St. Clair. (ECF No. 9-2, Pl.'s Resp. Ex. A, March 24, 2016 Deposition of Ahmed Musleh taken in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   , at 12:22-23, 39:16:-40:3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff received medication and monthly injections in his shoulder for pain for some period of time along with physical therapy, and was declared fit for duty (\"FFD\") and able to return to work with no restrictions on June 16, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:22-14:1, 40:4-44:17.) It is not disputed that \"Plaintiff received [from ASC] maintenance and cure benefits throughout the six month period\" that he was recovering from his injury and not fit for duty.\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203966576\">\n    2017 WL 3966576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After being declared FFD, Plaintiff attempted to return to work for ASC, but was deemed not qualified to return to work on an ASC vessel because he failed to obtain a Vessel Personnel and Designated Security Duties (\"VPDSD\") certificate.\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203966576\">\n    2017 WL 3966576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. In the previous action between these parties, in addition to seeking benefits for maintenance and contractual support, Plaintiff sought unearned wages for the time period following ASC's refusal to rehire him based upon the lack of a VPDSD certificate. This Court determined that Plaintiff's entitlement to unearned wages ceased when Plaintiff's voyage aboard the M/V St. Clair ended on December 26, 2014, the date on which his voyage for ASC ended (also coincidentally the date on which Plaintiff suffered his injury.)\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203966576\">\n    2017 WL 3966576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (\"Although ASC continued to provide Plaintiff with maintenance and cure payments up until he was rendered FFD and ready to return to work, the law is clear that Plaintiff was no longer entitled to unearned wages once his last voyage for ASC,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the voyage on which he was injured, had ended.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   contained two counts-one for unearned wages and one for maintenance and \"contractual\n   support\" benefits. The complaint in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   did not contain a claim against ASC under the Jones Act for negligence or for unseaworthiness, claims that are set forth in Counts I and II of the Complaint in this action. In fact, at Plaintiff's deposition in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   , counsel for both parties discussed the fact that Plaintiff was not bringing a Jones Act claim for negligence in that action at that time:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Galea: I guess the first thing is, before we get started, so that we can try to narrow the focus of this deposition, it's my understanding that the lawsuit in this particular case, and the claim being made, is not so much to seek the damages arising as a result of the incident of December 26, 2014, but more what transpired as a result of the requirement, or whatever, for the vessel personnel designated securities duties endorsement, the VPDSD, and not to seek recovery for damages for the December 26, 2014, incident?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Fishback: Yes. On behalf of Mr. Musleh, that is correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   And we had a brief conversation this morning, and I thought just to add to the understanding, I think, obviously, the Complaint speaks for itself. There is no claim asserted for a Jones Act or seaworthiness at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   And certainly, if that were to become relevant at a later time, we'd agree to present Mr. Musleh, and you can question him, whatever.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Pl.'s Dep. 5:8-6:9.) Plaintiff never deemed any potential negligence or seaworthiness claims relevant as\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   moved forward and proceeded to closure on the unearned wages and maintenance claims. On September 8, 2017, the Court denied Plaintiff's claims for unearned wages and maintenance benefits,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203966576\">\n    2017 WL 3966576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10, and on December 21, 2017, Plaintiff filed this second lawsuit relating to the same December 26, 2014 incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant now moves to dismiss this action, arguing that Counts I and II, for negligence and seaworthiness respectively, arise out of the same December 26, 2014 injury that formed the basis for the claims in the prior case and therefore could and should have been brought in the prior litigation. Defendant also argues that the issues presented in Count III of the Complaint in this case, for maintenance and cure, were expressly decided in that prior proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff responds that\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   was an action filed for \"the limited purpose of litigating [Plaintiff's] claim for unearned wages\" and that ASC acknowledged this limited purpose and therefore is now estopped from asserting the defense of\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff also asserts that the claim for cure in this case is different from the claim asserted in the previous action because his condition resulting from the December 26, 2014 injury has worsened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The parties' summary judgment arguments focused on the count for unearned wages, which was a dispute regarding whether Plaintiff had the necessary certification to return to work after he was declared FFD following his injury. Plaintiff alleged that ASC wrongfully refused to allow Plaintiff return to work after he was declared FFD following his December 26, 2014 injury and therefore Plaintiff sought unearned wages from the date that Plaintiff was declared FFD (June 16, 2015) to the present. The Court disagreed and found that as a matter of law Plaintiff's entitlement to unearned wages ceased when he finished the voyage he was on for ASC at the time of the injury. Coincidentally, that voyage ended on December 26, 2014, the date that Plaintiff suffered the injury. The fact of Plaintiff's injury while in the service of the ship, a critical element of both of his claims in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   , was necessarily decided in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   and the parties did exchange discovery regarding the nature of Plaintiff's injury and his medical expenses up until the date on which he was declared FFD. Several pages of Plaintiff's deposition in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   were devoted to a discussion of the treatment, medication, and physical therapy that Plaintiff had received for the injury he suffered on December 26, 2014, and several medical professionals were listed by Plaintiff on his witness list in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Pl.'s Resp.

Res Judicata Bars Plaintiff's Claims in this Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   , this court decided that Plaintiff was not entitled to unearned wages as a result of his December 26, 2014 injury and decided that Plaintiff had received all of the maintenance and cure benefits to which he was entitled as a result of that injury. In resolving these claims, the Court necessarily found that Plaintiff was a seaman, and that he was injured in the course and scope of his employment for ASC on December 26, 2014. Plaintiff argues in opposition to Defendant's motion, and it is evident, that the essential elements of his Jones Act claim, notably whether ASC was negligent and whether this negligence was the proximate cause of Plaintiff's injury, as well as essential elements of his unseaworthiness claim, notably whether the M/V St. Clair was reasonably fit for its intended use and, if not, then whether such unseaworthiness was the substantial and direct or proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries, were not the subject of discovery or argument in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiff suggests that because this additional evidence will be essential here and was not essential to resolution of the claims presented in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   , res judicata does not bar this action. But the res judicata analysis is more exacting than this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As discussed above, the parties do not dispute the first and second elements\n   of the res judicata analysis-\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   resulted in a final judgment on the merits and the parties are identical. And Plaintiff puts up minimal resistance with regard to the third factor-Jones Act and unseaworthiness claims are frequently litigated together with claims for unearned wages and maintenance and cure. \"It has long been settled that a seaman is not required to elect between a claim for maintenance and cure and a claim for negligence under the Jones Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Bartholomew\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2019971\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/279/911/#p914\">\n    279 F.2d at 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, in this case, the Plaintiff clarified that he was not, at the time of Plaintiff's deposition in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   , asserting a Jones Act or unseaworthiness, suggesting that such a tack was noteworthy because such claims are typically asserted in the same action where they arise, as they do here, out of the same maritime accident and injury. In fact, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , in the course of Plaintiff's deposition in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's counsel expressly left the door open to asserting such a claim in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   \"if it became relevant,\" in which case, Plaintiff's counsel represented on the record, Mr. Musleh was prepared to sit for a second deposition in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   to address the issues relevant those then-unasserted claims. And at oral argument in this action, Plaintiff's counsel conceded that the claims asserted in this action absolutely could have been asserted in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   . Thus there is little argument that the claims asserted here could have been litigated in the prior action, and if Plaintiff had amended his complaint, Plaintiff would have continued his deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The real dispute here focuses on the fourth element-whether there is \"an identity of the causes of action\" in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   and here.

The transaction is the basis of the litigative unit or entity which may not be split.\" Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24 (cmt. a). Here, ASC argues, the \"transaction\" is the December 26, 2014 injury, and all claims and theories of recovery stem from that single event. In\n   <em>\n    Cemer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , for example, the Sixth Circuit held that a final judgment in plaintiff's age discrimination suit was res judicata to a subsequently-filed breach of contract suit based upon the same termination.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"853581\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/583/830/#p832\">\n    583 F.2d at 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court noted the applicability of the test under analysis here, i.e. that \"in order for the third and fourth elements [of res judicata] to be satisfied, 'there must be an identity of the causes of action that is, an identity of the facts creating the right of action and of the evidence necessary to sustain each action.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3814141\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/287/468/#p471\">\n    287 F.

The Sixth Circuit further noted that \"[w]here the two causes of action arise from the 'same transaction, or series of transactions,' the plaintiff should have litigated both causes in the first action and\n   may not litigate the second issue later.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1267780\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/656/1224/#p1227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Rawe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3463696\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/521/#p528\">\n    462 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   529 ). The Sixth Circuit held that \"disparity in pay\" was at the heart of both the Equal Pay Act claims and discrimination claims and that only plaintiff's legal theory changed between her first and second suits, a direct subversion of the principles of res judicata as established in\n   <em>\n    Cemer\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Holder first argues that her race and gender pay discrimination suits arise from different facts and therefore do not possess \"an identity of the causes of action\" required for res judicata to apply. However, both Holder I and II actually arise from the same facts (disparate pay); it is the legal theory of her claims that differ. The district court correctly noted that the \"only discernable difference between the facts of [both cases] is that in her [current] Complaint she specifically seeks to compare her pay to two particular white female employees and her claims are all race based. [Both cases] involve the same employment, same supervisor and the same circumstances.... Even though Holder was aware of a possible racial disparity when filing\n   <em>\n    Holder I\n   </em>\n   , she chose only to pursue her gender-based discrimination theories in her first suit. She cannot now subvert the principles of res judicata by filing yet another lawsuit on the same facts, basing that suit solely on claims of racial discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3814141\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/287/468/#p471\">\n    287 F.

Clearly additional evidence, beyond that which would have been essential to Holder's gender-based Equal Pay Act claim, would have been essential in the subsequent Title VII race discrimination action. But because both claims arose out of the same set of operative facts related to an alleged disparity in pay, involving \"the same employment, same supervisor and the same circumstances,\" there was sufficient identity of claims and her Title VII claims could and should have been brought in the first action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 471.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Venture Global Engineering, LLC v.

The mere fact that the parties asserted contract-based claims in the arbitration proceeding, however, does not necessarily establish that an \"identity of the causes of action\" does not exist. The Sixth Circuit has observed that \"[claim preclusion] extinguishes all claims arising out of the same transaction o[r] series of transactions.

Indeed, Plaintiff's counsel announced during Plaintiff's deposition in\n   <em>\n    Musleh I\n   </em>\n   that he reserved the right to assert the claims asserted here in that prior action, presumably by way of amendment to the pleadings, \"if they became relevant,\" which apparently they did not-until Plaintiff did not prevail on his \"novel\" unearned wages claim. But Plaintiff cannot split his claims in this fashion-he cannot control the scope of the res judicata bar by electing to limit his claims, and accordingly limit discovery and argument, to a discrete theory of recovery, then wait to see how that theory is received, and only after losing on that theory, file a second lawsuit arising out the very same accident and injury, alleging different theories of recovery that admittedly could have been asserted in the first proceeding. \"The Sixth Circuit has observed that \"[claim preclusion] extinguishes all claims arising out of the same transaction o[r] series of transactions.
