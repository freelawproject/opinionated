For the following reasons, the Government's objection was overruled and the Criminal History Category calculation of the PSR was adopted as written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this case, Defendant Devin D. Edmonds pleaded guilty to Count 1 of a Criminal Information charging Distribution of Cocaine Base, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C). Before sentencing, United States Probation Officer Diane C. Moczydlowski prepared a PSR that calculated Edmonds' Offense Level to be 12 and his Criminal History Category to be III (5 Criminal History Points). PSR 11, 16. There were initially no objections to that PSR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Several of the entries in the Criminal History section of the PSR were not counted towards Edmonds' Criminal History Category based on United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"USSG\" or \"Guidelines\") Section 4A1.2(c), which excludes from the Criminal History Category calculation enumerated misdemeanor or petty offenses (and those similar to them).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR 8-10; USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2016). Under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1), certain offenses are excluded so long as they did not result in,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"a term of imprisonment of at least thirty\n   days.\" USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Two of Edmonds' convictions that were excluded under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c) concerned the Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Driving on Suspended License (Richmond City General District Court, Conviction Date: 3/25/2009)\n   </em>\n   : 30 days' incarceration, with 20 days suspended for a period of 1 year, conditioned upon good behavior; a $200 fine; license suspended for 90 days; and court costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Driving Under Revocation or Suspension 4th Offense (Henrico County General District Court, Conviction Date: 6/23/2016)\n   </em>\n   : 90 days' incarceration, with 80 days suspended; license suspended for 90 days; and court costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   PSR 8, 10-11 (paragraphs 29 and 33). Those convictions gave the Court pause because they resulted in sentences of thirty days or more but were partially suspended, so that the \"active\" portions were shorter than thirty days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR 8, 10. A review of the relevant case law revealed several unpublished Fourth Circuit opinions holding that even\n   <em>\n    suspended\n   </em>\n   sentences are counted towards the \"thirty day threshold\" under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Consequently, under the reasoning of those opinions, the above convictions would result in the assessment of Criminal History Points and would affect Edmonds' Criminal History Category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In light of the Court's concerns, it ordered supplemental briefing on the issue of how properly to assess the above convictions and the correct Criminal History Category for Edmonds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORDER (ECF No. 41). At the sentencing hearing held on August 24, 2018, the Government raised an objection to the PSR in perspective of the Court's ORDER (ECF No. 41), and the parties further argued the matter. The Court overruled the Government's objection and concluded that the PSR's Criminal History Category calculation should be adopted as tendered. The Court thereafter issued an ORDER (ECF No. 45) to that effect. This Opinion sets out the Court's reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Government argues that suspended sentences should satisfy the thirty day threshold under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Br. 1-3 (ECF No. 42).

USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c). USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) describes several offenses that do not count for that calculation unless specific criteria are met.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%201255738\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). Importantly, an offense listed under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1)\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   receive Criminal History Points if the offense resulted in a sentence that was \"a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1) teaches that \"[t]he term 'prior sentence' means any sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   , for conduct not part of the instant offense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%201255738\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1). And, under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(3), \"[a] conviction for which the imposition or execution of sentence was totally suspended or stayed shall be counted as a prior sentence under \u00a7 4A1.1(c).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%201255738\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Sentence of imprisonment,\" as used in USSG \u00a7 4A1.1, is defined at USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1 cmt. ns. 1-2, 4A1.2(b).

The commentary to USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(b) offers further guidance. It instructs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   To qualify as a sentence of imprisonment, the defendant must have actually served a period of imprisonment on such sentence....\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(3) and (b)(2). For the purposes of applying \u00a7 4A1.1(a), (b), or (c), the length of a sentence of imprisonment is the stated maximum (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , in the case of a determinate sentence of five years, the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence of one to five years, the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a term not to exceed five years, the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a term not to exceed the defendant's twenty-first birthday, the stated maximum is the amount of time in pre-trial detention plus the amount of time between the date of sentence and the defendant's twenty-first birthday). That is, criminal history points are based on the sentence pronounced, not the length of time actually served.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4A1.2(b)(1) and (2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047548\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/940/#p942\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Contrasting Views Respecting Whether Suspended Sentences Satisfy the Thirty Day Threshold Under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As noted above, the Fourth Circuit has held, in unpublished decisions, that suspended sentences satisfy the thirty day threshold under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). That is also the view taken by the Fifth Circuit. The Government here agrees. Several Courts of Appeals, however, have concluded that suspended sentences do not count towards the thirty day threshold.

Although the Guidelines do not specifically address suspended sentences in the context of this case, Washington cites to no authority, nor do we find any, supporting his claim that suspended sentences should not be counted. To the contrary, when considering terms of imprisonment, the focus is on \"the sentence pronounced, not the length of time actually served.\" USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n. 2).

The Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Gonzales\n   </em>\n   , however, provided a more comprehensive analysis of the suspended sentence issue and the overarching structure of USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Gonzales argues that because his thirty-day sentence for driving with a suspended license was entirely suspended, it should have been excluded under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) (2003). We agree. Section 4A1.1 instructs that the following points be added to a defendant's criminal history score for prior criminal sentences: ....\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Application Notes to \u00a7 4A1.1(c) direct us to the definition of \"prior sentence\" in \u00a7 4A1.2(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Section 4A1.2(a)(1) defines \"prior sentence\" .... Section 4A1.2(a)(3) further provides that a totally suspended sentence \"shall be counted as a prior sentence under \u00a7 4A1.1(c).\" This is the provision\n   upon which the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   opinion rested. As the government notes, however, the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   analysis failed to account for \u00a7 4A1.2(b)-(c) and the related Commentary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Section 4A1.2(b)(1) states that \"[t]he term 'sentence of imprisonment' means a sentence of incarceration and refers to the maximum sentence imposed.\" The corresponding Application Notes state that \"[t]o qualify as a sentence of imprisonment, the defendant must have actually served a period of imprisonment on such sentence.\" In other words, a \"sentence of imprisonment\" requires a period of confinement. Section 4A1.2(b)(2) further provides that if a sentence is partially suspended, the \"sentence of imprisonment\" refers only to the non-suspended portion. Therefore, while a totally suspended sentence could never result in additional criminal history points under \u00a7 4A1.1(a) or (b), it could result in one additional point under \u00a7 4A1.1 (c), depending on the nature of the prior offense and whether or not the prior offense is deemed \"countable\" under that section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The Application Note for \u00a7 4A1.1(c) makes clear that \"[s]entences for certain specified non-felony offenses are counted only if they meet certain requirements\" as outlined by \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). In \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1), the Sentencing Commission has specified which sentences should or should not be counted....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   The issue before us is whether a totally suspended thirty-day sentence constitutes a \"term of imprisonment\" of at least thirty days. While \"term of imprisonment\" is not specifically defined, \"sentence of imprisonment\" is clearly defined by \u00a7 4A1.2(b)(1) and the corresponding Application Notes. A plain reading of \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) suggests that, in this context, the phrases are interchangeable....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   We agree with the government that at least as used in this provision in Chapter Four of the Guidelines Manual, there is no meaningful distinction discernable between the phrase \"the sentence was ... a term of imprisonment\" and the phrase \"sentence of imprisonment,\" which is fully defined in \u00a7 4A1.2(b), the preceding subsection. Because the only logical conclusion is that the requirement of actual incarceration also applies to \"term of imprisonment,\" a totally suspended sentence for a qualifying misdemeanor, regardless of its length, cannot be\n   <em>\n    counted\n   </em>\n   as a prior sentence. In other words, while a totally suspended sentence is a \"prior sentence\" under \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(3), it is not necessarily \"counted\" in the calculation of a defendant's criminal history score. Moreover, a partially suspended sentence for a misdemeanor listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) counts only if the non-suspended portion of the sentence is at least thirty days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047548\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/940/#p942\">\n    506 F.3d at 943-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

However, the court offered no basis for reaching this conclusion. In essence, it replaced one term for another without recognizing that the phrase \"prior sentence\" was explicitly meant to cover any other type of sentence that was not otherwise defined in the sentencing guidelines. And, similarly, the term \"sentence of imprisonment\" was explicitly meant to cover a particular type of sentence and was so defined in the sentencing guidelines. Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit's analysis served to limit the broader definition of \"prior sentence\" by removing from its ambit the phrase \"term of imprisonment,\" while simultaneously broadening the limited definition of \"sentence of imprisonment\" by adding to its definition the phrase \"term of imprisonment.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Gov't Br. 4 (citations omitted).

In short, some subset of sentences are \"prior sentences\" and therefore \"countable\" for purposes of the Criminal History Category calculation, and some subset of those \"prior sentences\" are rendered \"uncountable\" by USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   With that textual analysis in mind, it is rather clear that we cannot rely upon USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a) in interpreting the rules governing USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) because USSG \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.2(a) and 4A1.2(c) (1) pertain to entirely different steps in the USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 analysis. Indeed, by the time USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) comes into play, the sentence at issue must already have been found to be a \"prior sentence,\" and USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a) is no longer relevant. And, USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a) does not, by its terms, say anything about how to understand USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a). Thus, we must look to other provisions of the Guidelines in ascertaining the meaning of USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   A corollary to this conclusion is that USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(3), which provides that \"[a] conviction for which the imposition or execution of sentence was totally suspended or stayed shall be counted as a prior sentence under \u00a7 4A1.1(c),\" does not establish that suspended sentences can be used to satisfy the thirty day threshold under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c) (1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a) (3).

However, USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(b)\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   define the similar term \"sentence of imprisonment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047548\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/940/#p942\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4A1.2(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   It is clear from the language of USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 that \"term of imprisonment\" was intended to have the same meaning as \"sentence of imprisonment.\" By its terms, USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) refers to a \"sentence\" (of imprisonment): \"if (A) the\n   <em>\n    sentence\n   </em>\n   was ... a\n   <em>\n    term of imprisonment\n   </em>\n   of at least thirty days.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) (emphasis added). Indeed, it would make little sense grammatically to use \"sentence of imprisonment\" in USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). Doing so would require USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) to contain the repetitive language: \"if (A) the\n   <em>\n    sentence\n   </em>\n   was ... a\n   <em>\n    sentence\n   </em>\n   of imprisonment of at least thirty days.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Furthermore, USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 frequently uses \"term\" to mean the length of a \"sentence of imprisonment\" or otherwise treats \"term of imprisonment\" as interchangeable with \"sentence of imprisonment.\" For example, application note 2 to USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, the application note to USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(b), states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   For the purposes of applying \u00a7 4A1.1(a), (b), or (c), the\n   <em>\n    length of a sentence of imprisonment is the stated maximum\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ... in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a\n   <em>\n    term\n   </em>\n   not to exceed five years, the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a\n   <em>\n    term\n   </em>\n   not to exceed the defendant's twenty-first birthday, the stated maximum is the amount of time in pre-trial detention plus the amount of time between the date of sentence and the defendant's twenty-first birthday).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n.2 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Likewise, USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(k)(1) provides: \"[i]n the case of a prior revocation ...\n   <em>\n    add the original term of imprisonment to any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation\n   </em>\n   .

First, the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Gonzales\n   </em>\n   is helpful, even if it was incomplete. Second, the Ninth Circuit's analysis was, as explained herein, correct. Third, there is nothing \"unprincipled\" about the Ninth Circuit's interpretation, which comports with the Guidelines and the view of other Courts of Appeals.

Edmonds' Sentences\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Given the conclusion that suspended sentences do not count towards the thirty day threshold under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1), the analysis in this case becomes rather straightforward. Edmonds' first sentence (Driving on Suspended License) resulted, in relevant part, in a sentence of 30 days, 20 days suspended. PSR 8. Edmonds' second sentence (Driving under Revocation or Suspension 4th Offense) resulted, in relevant part, in a sentence of 90 days, 80 days suspended. PSR 10. The active portion of both sentences was only 10 days. Hence, these sentences do not constitute a \"term of imprisonment of at least thirty days\" and were properly excluded under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the Court overruled the Government's objection to the PSR (ECF No. 39) and adopted the Criminal History Category calculation of the PSR as written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   It is so ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    The Court refers to this aspect of USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) as the \"thirty day threshold.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    The other criteria are not at issue here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Although not binding, the Sentencing Commission staff and the Probation Office also have concluded that suspended sentences should not count towards the thirty day threshold.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    The Eleventh Circuit has issued conflicting decisions on this question.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    \"Driving without a license or with a revoked or suspended license\" is an offense listed under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1).

Def. Opp'n 5 n.3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    The Court recognizes that Edmonds' sentences were\n    <em>\n     partially\n    </em>\n    suspended. However, it is appropriate to consider the treatment of\n    <em>\n     totally\n    </em>\n    suspended sentences as well. First, that issue is inextricably linked to the overarching structure of USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, an understanding of which critical to a thorough and accurate interpretation of USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1), and the analyses applicable to totally and partially suspended sentences are connected in a variety of other ways as well. Second, if the Court were to limit its analysis to partially suspended sentences, it would leave that analysis open to the criticism that, in light of the Fourth Circuit's reasoning with respect to USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(3),\n    <em>\n     totally\n    </em>\n    suspended sentences\n    <em>\n     do\n    </em>\n    count towards the thirty day threshold, and the Guidelines could not have been designed to treat the various forms of suspended sentences differently.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gonzales\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047548\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/940/#p942\">\n     506 F.3d at 946\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that the court's previous distinction between partially and totally suspended sentences could create \"illogical and unjust results\" because \"a defendant ... who received a wholly suspended thirty-day sentence would receive one criminal history point\" but \"a defendant convicted of the same offense who received a thirty-day sentence with one day suspended-thus actually serving twenty-nine days in jail-would\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    receive a criminal history point\"). Third, and relatedly, it strengthens the Court's conclusion as to partially suspended sentences if the Guidelines do not permit\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    type of suspended sentence to satisfy the thirty day threshold. Finally, addressing the issue of totally suspended sentences allows the Court to assess the persuasiveness the Fourth Circuit's interpretation of USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 and suspended sentences generally (as well as the interpretations of other Courts of Appeals).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    There is one minor way in which USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a) influences USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n.2, the application note to USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(b), cites USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(3) once.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n.2. If (as the Court concludes) USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) is defined by USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(b), then USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a) has some bearing on the meaning of USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). But, the citation is for a limited purpose and, in any event, supports the view that suspended sentences\n    <em>\n     do not\n    </em>\n    satisfy the thirty day threshold.
