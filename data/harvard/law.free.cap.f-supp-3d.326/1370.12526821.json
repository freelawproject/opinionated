The parties have notified the Panel of six additional actions involving related issues. Common plaintiff Scott Johnson opposes centralization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On the basis of the papers filed and the hearing session held, we deny Starbucks' motion. These actions are only facially similar. In each action, plaintiff, who is quadriplegic, alleges that he visited a Starbucks in California, and encountered one or more illegal barriers to access that caused him difficulty and frustration, and that have deterred him from returning. Plaintiff asserts that these barriers violate the Americans with Disabilities Act and California's Unruh Civil Rights Act. But each action involves a different Starbucks (in one case, two Starbucks are involved), and the unique circumstances in existence at that Starbucks at the time of plaintiff's visits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even the alleged barriers are not the same from action to action. Although in all 21 actions, one specific alleged barrier concerns the absence of a lowered, 36-inch portion of the transaction counter available for use by wheelchair users, several of the actions involve additional alleged barriers, such as an inaccessible parking space or non-ADA compliant door hardware. Starbucks does not point to any common policies or procedures at issue, and it does not suggest that there will be any common witnesses other than plaintiff himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The significantly varying procedural posture of the cases also weighs against centralization. Although the most recent actions were filed in March of this year, seven of the 21 cases were commenced in 2016, and six in 2017. In at least three of the actions, the fact discovery cutoff already has passed. Finally, the limited number of involved counsel\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and districts suggests that cooperation and informal coordination by the involved courts and counsel should be effective in minimizing or eliminating duplicative pretrial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the motion for centralization of these actions is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    SCHEDULE A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   MDL No. 2849 -\n   <strong>\n    IN RE: STARBUCKS CORPORATION ACCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES LITIGATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Central District of California\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   JOHNSON v.
