Nos. 23, 24)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The issue before the Court is whether Plaintiff Arvaunti Victoria (\"Victoria\") has adequately alleged that his traffic stop conducted by San Diego Police Officers was unwarranted and unreasonable. Victoria claims that he was pulled over under the guise of \"loud pipes\" when in actuality he alleges that he was stopped under a formal policy of the San Diego Police Department (\"SDPD\") to harass and arrest anyone perceived to be a member of a motorcycle gang. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 17.) In response, the City of San Diego and Shelley Zimmerman (collectively referred to as \"City Defendants\") and Defendants David Dunhoff, Sergeant J. Johnson, Timothy Coyle, Justin Montoya, Adam George, and David Wolff (collectively referred to as \"Officer Defendants\") filed two separate motions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Doc. Nos. 23, 24.) Victoria opposes both of the motions. (Doc. Nos. 27, 28.) On May 18, 2018, the Court held oral argument on both motions and then took the matters under submission. (Doc. No. 43.) As will be explained in greater detail below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   City Defendants' motion to dismiss,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Officer Defendants' motion to dismiss, and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Victoria leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following allegations are taken from Victoria's second amended complaint (\"SAC\") and are construed as true for the limited purpose of resolving this motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Elec. Arts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067914\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/1235/#p1247\">\n    724 F.3d 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1247 (9th Cir. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Victoria claims that SDPD proceeds under a policy to pursue any kind of action, legal or illegal, to suppress motorcycle clubs in San Diego, assuming that all motorcycle clubs are criminal gangs. (Doc. No. 17 \u00b6 12.) During the time frame in which Victoria was purportedly illegally arrested, the SDPD was investigating the assault of a marine some distance from the Off Base Bar located at 9522 Miramar Road, San Diego. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) The police did not have a description of the suspects, but according to the police report, the marine had been told to leave the bar by unknown members of a motorcycle gang. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 9, 2016, Victoria arrived on a motorcycle to the Off Base Bar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) That particular night was \"motorcycle night\" where the bar encouraged motorcycle riders and motorcycle clubs to show up. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ) When Victoria parked, the officers observing the bar, saw him take a vest with the emblem of the motorcycle club named the \"Chosen Few\" out of his saddle bags, put it on, and then enter the bar. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ) Subsequently, Victoria left the bar, placed the vest back into his saddlebags, and drove away. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Victoria was then stopped in the vicinity of Miramar and Kearney Mesa Roads. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) The officers initially told Victoria that he was stopped for loud motorcycle pipes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) After he was stopped, the officers also stated that they had stopped him because his motorcycle did not have a license plate. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ) Victoria argues that both of these reasons were concocted as the officers did not have a decibel meter or any type of device to measure the sound of\n   his motorcycle exhaust pipes. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, Victoria presented to the officers the appropriate DMV paperwork indicating that the motorcycle had just recently been purchased and the license plates were arriving soon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During Victoria's stop, a total of five officers appeared. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) After one or more officers confirmed that Victoria had no citations, one of the officers informed Victoria that they needed to search his saddlebags. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ) Victoria objected to the search, but after \"stern\" comments from an officer stating that they could do this \"the easy way or the hard way,\" putting Victoria in fear of his life, Victoria raised his hands slowly and told the officers that the key to the saddlebags was in his pocket. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ) During the search of the saddlebags, Victoria's \"Chosen Few\" vest was found. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Subsequently, Victoria was arrested and charged with having illegal metal knuckles due to the rings he was wearing along with a gang enhancement. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ) Victoria's cell phone was then taken and officers demanded that Victoria provide a password for the phone or they would tow his motorcycle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Plaintiff provided the password for the phone, but the pattern did not work thus Plaintiff's motorcycle was towed. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ) After Victoria was arrested and booked, the officer who transported Victoria to jail let Victoria unlock the phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ) Victoria's phone was then seized. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thereafter, a search warrant for Victoria's cell phone was procured. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26.) Victoria asserts that this warrant is extremely broad. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) For instance, the warrant sought all financial information, all social media applications, identification and settings, data, address, book/contacts, social network posts/updates/tags, stored passwords, photographs, and Wi-Fi network tables. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) In sum, Victoria argues that the warrant is invalid as it did not contain a statement of probable cause and the affidavit would not have been able to establish probable cause as Victoria was stopped on a mechanical violation and had no criminal record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After Victoria's arrest, he was not charged, but he paid $8,000.00 for bail as a result of the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) Further, Victoria claims that due to the initial stop and the allegations surrounding his arrest, he has been suffering from mental and emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, Victoria alleges violations of (1) his Fourth Amendment rights against all individual Defendants-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) false arrest against all individual Defendants-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (3) illegal search against all individual Defendants-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (4) deliberate indifference against all Defendants-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (5) deliberate indifference in regards to the purported custom and policies of the SDPD-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (6) violation of the California Constitution Article I \u00a7 13 against Defendants Coyle, Dunhoff, Johnson, and George; (7) violation of California Civil Code \u00a7 52.1 against all Defendants; (8) injunctive relief pursuant to the Bane Act against all Defendants; and (9) intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\") against all individual police officer Defendants.

Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 201 states that a \"court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Fed.

Nos. 26, 32.) As the objections mimic each other, the Court will refer to ECF document number 26 for purposes of this Order. Victoria's objections to each exhibit are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1) Exhibit 1 - Victoria argues that the Chosen Few case cannot be incorporated by reference, is a nuisance complaint against people Victoria has not met, and the document is inadmissible hearsay. (Doc. No. 26 at 5.) Moreover, Victoria contends that the document is prejudicial and contains no probative value. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   2) Exhibit 2 - Victoria asserts that this default judgment concerns events completely unrelated to the allegations of this case and is not referenced in the SAC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6- 7.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   3) Exhibit 3 - Victoria argues that the declaration is not referenced in the SAC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Moreover, the declaration raises relevance, hearsay, prejudice, improper expert opinion, and improper character evidence objections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   4) Exhibit 4 - As to the warrant affidavit and search warrant for Victoria's phone, Victoria concedes that portions of these documents are incorporated by reference. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) However, Victoria objects to judicial notice of any fact related to said document beyond its existence, the filing date, and the date of the stop and arrest at issue etc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   5) Exhibit 5 - Similarly, as to the police report, Victoria states that portions of the document may be incorporated by reference. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) However, he asserts that any facts subject to dispute are not judicially noticeable facts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   6) Exhibit 6 - Victoria asserts that the NCIS bulletin is an opinion formed by some officers and therefore does not reflect an adjudicative fact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.) Moreover, the document is not referenced in the SAC.

Thus, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   only limited judicial notice of Exhibit 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, the Court finds judicial notice of Exhibit 6 unwarranted. Exhibit 6 is a Naval Criminal Investigative Service document issued on May 16, 2016. (Doc. No. 23-8.) The document illustrates that the NCIS Marine Corps West Field Office\n   identified the \"Chosen Few\" as a motorcycle club that is \"closely aligned with criminal organizations[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Despite Victoria referencing the Chosen Few in his complaint, the Court does not find this document relevant, capable of accurate determination, or not subject to reasonable dispute. This document is simply a report generated by unknown members of the Navy Corps based on unknown factors. Thus, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' request for judicial notice of Exhibit 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel. Modglin v.

(\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 24-1.) The Court notes however that as currently pled, the Court is being asked to decide qualified immunity aided only by a skeletal factual background provided by Victoria in his amended complaint. The Ninth Circuit has\n   found that this type of decision making is at times complex:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   The confluence of two well-intentioned doctrines, notice pleading and qualified immunity, give rise to this exercise in legal decisionmaking [sic] based on facts both hypothetical and vague. On one hand, the federal courts may not dismiss a complaint unless \"it is clear that no relief can be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations\" ... On the other hand, government officials are entitled to raise the qualified immunity defense immediately, on a motion to dismiss the complaint, to protect against the burdens of discovery and other pre-trial procedures ... The unintended consequence of this confluence of procedural doctrines is that the courts may be called upon to decide far-reaching constitutional questions on a nonexistent factual record ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    Kwai Fun Wong v.

Specifically, the Court highlights that the chronology of the events after Victoria was stopped are not clearly alleged. Accordingly, the Court is not in a position to be able to pick apart the pleadings with the particular degree of scrutiny needed under a qualified immunity analysis. Moreover, as Victoria is being granted leave to amend his claims, a qualified immunity analysis is premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Based upon this, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Officer Defendants' motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity\n   <strong>\n    WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v.

The Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Officer Defendants argue that the fourth and fifth causes of action fail as to the City and Zimmerman as they do not specify the conduct of each individual defendant. (Doc. No. 24-1 at 34.) As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 1013-17, the Court agrees. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   the fourth and fifth causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     iii. The Sixth Causes of Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Officer Defendants argue that Victoria cannot bring damages claims directly under the unreasonable search and seizure provisions of the California Constitution. (Doc. No. 24-1 at 35.) In opposition, Victoria argues that all sections of Article 1 are self-executing and allow for injunctive relief, which is the only relief he is requesting to stop further incidents of harassment. (Doc. No. 34 at 22-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Victoria's SAC asserts that the conduct of Officer Defendants damaged him both financially and emotionally. (Doc. No. 17 \u00b6 58.) Victoria then requests compensatory, general, punitive, and exemplary damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Section 13 of Article 1 of the California Constitution does not confer a private right of action for damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elliott v.

Cal. Oct. 24, 2017). As it is unclear what relief Victoria seeks under this cause of action and the SAC requests both injunctive relief and various damages, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Victoria's sixth cause of action pursuant to Rule 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     iv. The Seventh Cause of Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Officer Defendants also seek to dismiss Victoria's Bane Act claim for failure to allege any facts that would indicate threats, intimidation, and coercion independent from the intimidation and coercion inherent in a detention. (Doc. No. 24-1 at 36.) For the same reasons explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 1017-19, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Officer Defendants' motion to dismiss the seventh cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     iv. The Ninth Cause of Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Officer Defendants argue that Victoria has no viable claim IIED as the officers' actions were reasonable and justified. (Doc. No. 24-1 at 36.) Victoria retorts that the actions of the Officer Defendants was illegal and outrageous. (Doc. No. 34 at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Under California law, a prima facie case of IIED requires the following: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant; (2) with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress; (3) \"the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress\"; and (4) \"actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by defendant's outrageous conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sabow v.

Victoria pleads that Officer Defendants \"exhibited conduct that was outrageous,\" that they \"intended to cause [him] emotional distress,\" that \"they acted with reckless disregard of the probability that [he] would suffer emotional distress,\" and that as a result Victoria has suffered \"severe emotional distress[.]\" (Doc. No. 17 \u00b6 64.) \"Conclusory, 'threadbare' allegations that merely recite the elements of a cause of action will not defeat a motion to dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Cal. Jan. 26, 2012). Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Officer Defendants' motion to dismiss Victoria's IIED claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King v.

Officer Defendants' qualified immunity claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As explained in great detail above, City Defendants' motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Officer Defendants' motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .
