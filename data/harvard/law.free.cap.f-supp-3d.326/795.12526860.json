PERRY, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Sally Sanzone and Gene Grasle worked at different health care facilities operated by defendant Mercy Health. When they retired from Mercy in 2003 and 2013, respectively, they began receiving pension benefits from the Mercy Health MyRetirement Personal Pension Account Plan (the \"Plan\" or the \"Mercy Plan\"), and continue to do so. Plaintiffs bring this action against Mercy Health, the Mercy Health Benefits Committee, and the Mercy Health Stewardship Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that defendants have underfunded the Plan and have violated various provisions of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), including their duties under ERISA as fiduciaries or sponsors of the Plan. They contend that the Mercy Plan does not qualify for ERISA's \"church plan\" exemption because is it not maintained by an organization whose principal purpose is providing benefits for employees of a church. Plaintiffs also seek a declaration that ERISA's \"church plan\" exemption as applied to the Plan violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. In alternative claims, plaintiffs seek relief under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I agree with defendants that the Mercy Plan is an ERISA-exempt church plan and, further, that plaintiffs lack standing to bring their Establishment Clause claim. Therefore, I do not have subject-matter jurisdiction over any of plaintiffs' ERISA and constitutional claims. Without federal jurisdiction over those claims, I have no jurisdictional authority to consider plaintiffs' state law claims, so I will dismiss this case in its entirety without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mercy Health is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation operating one of the largest Catholic healthcare systems in the United States, with twenty-nine acute care hospitals, eleven specialty hospitals, and several hundred physician practices and outpatient facilities. Mercy Health offers a retirement plan for its employees, with more than 40,000 participants who are current or former employees of Mercy Health. The Mercy Health Benefits Committee is the Plan Administrator. The Mercy Health Stewardship Committee oversees and monitors the Plan's financial status. Mercy Health is the Plan's Sponsor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plan was originally established in 1960 as \"the Retirement Plan for Employees of the Religious Sisters of Mercy of the Union in the United States of America, Province of St. Louis.\" In 1991, it was renamed the Retirement Plan for Employees of the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas, St. Louis. Sponsorship of the Plan was transferred to the Sisters of Mercy Health System (now Mercy Health) in March 2007. In 2011, the name of the Plan was changed to its current name, the Mercy Health MyRetirement Personal Pension Account Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plan specifically states its intention to be maintained as a church plan, and the Internal Revenue Service\n   has recognized it as a church plan since April 1999.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Church plans are not considered to be ERISA plans and are exempt from compliance with ERISA's requirements.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201003\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs Sanzone and Grasle are former employees of Mercy Health. Sanzone retired from Mercy Health in 2003 and began receiving pension benefits under the Plan. Grasle retired in 2013 and likewise began receiving pension benefits under the Plan. Both continue to receive benefits, and neither claim that their benefits have been reduced. In this putative class action,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   plaintiffs claim that the Plan is not a church plan and is therefore governed by ERISA. They seek equitable relief and statutory penalties against Mercy Health, the Benefits Committee, and the Stewardship Committee, alleging that the Plan violates several provisions of ERISA and that defendants breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA. Plaintiffs also seek alternative relief under the Establishment Clause and under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    The Second Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs bring their complaint in thirteen counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In Counts 1 through 8, plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the Mercy Plan is not a church plan and, further, that it must comply with ERISA's requirements and take steps to be brought into compliance with ERISA. They also seek monetary penalties for the Plan Administrator's failure to meet certain statutory obligations under ERISA. They bring their ERISA claims as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Count 1 - for equitable relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), 1332(a)(3), and 1109(a) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Count 2 - for violating reporting and disclosure provisions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201022\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1023, 1024(b)(3), 1021(d)(1), 1021(f), and 1025(a)(1) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Count 3 - for failing to provide minimum funding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201082\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Count 4 - for failing to establish the Plan pursuant to a written instrument meeting ERISA requirements under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201102\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Count 5 - for failing to establish a trust that meets ERISA requirements under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Count 6 - to clarify participants' rights to future benefits under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Count 7 - for civil penalties under ERISA for violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201021\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1), 1021(f), and 1025(a)(1) ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Count 8 - for breach of fiduciary duties under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Count 9 of the complaint is a contingent claim, alleging that if the Plan is an ERISA-exempt church plan, then the exemption as applied to the Plan violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In Counts 10 through 13, plaintiffs seek alternative relief under state law for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants seek dismissal of all of plaintiffs' ERISA and Establishment Clause claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for this Court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims. Defendants also seek dismissal of five of plaintiffs' eight ERISA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   claims under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. In addition, defendants seek a general merits determination that the Plan qualifies as an ERISA-exempt church plan, thereby subjecting all of plaintiffs' ERISA claims to dismissal. Finally, defendants contend that with the dismissal of plaintiffs' federal claims, I should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs' state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the following reasons, I do not have subject-matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' ERISA and Establishment Clause claims and will grant defendants' motion to dismiss these claims. With no original jurisdiction over these claims, I have no authority to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs' remaining state law claims; and no independent jurisdictional basis exists for me to consider these claims. They will likewise be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants invoke both Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) to dismiss plaintiffs' federal claims. I consider the Rule 12(b)(1) challenge first because all other defenses are moot if I lack subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants base their jurisdictional argument on their claim that plaintiffs lack standing to raise any of their federal claims. I agree that plaintiffs lack standing to bring their Establishment Clause claim and arguably lack standing to bring some of their ERISA claims. However, in conducting a factual review of this Court's jurisdiction, I find that federal question jurisdiction does not exist over any of plaintiffs' ERISA claims because ERISA does not govern the Plan at issue. Although defendants do not raise lack-of-federal-question as a specific basis to dismiss these claims, I may consider jurisdictional issues not raised by the parties.\n   <em>\n    Mansfield, C. &amp; L.M.

Plaintiffs aver that to \"maintain\" a plan means to commit to and assume ultimate responsibility for providing benefits, and to continue the plan, which necessarily includes the authority to modify or terminate the plan.

Plaintiffs contend that because Mercy Health is the only entity with authority to terminate the Plan under the Plan's terms, then it necessarily is the organization that \"maintains\" the Plan under \u00a7 1002(33)(C)(i). Not surprisingly, defendants seize upon the alternative meaning of \"maintain\" and argue that because the Benefits Committee as Plan Administrator is charged under the Plan with the duties to care for the operational productivity of the Plan, preserve it from failure or decline, and continue the Plan at such a level to ensure its operation, the Benefits Committee is necessarily the entity that \"maintains\" the Plan under \u00a7 1002(33)(C)(i). To the extent these positions are based on dictionary definitions, both are plausible. However, when I consider the dictionary definitions in conjunction with other courts' treatment of the term \"maintain\" in the context of ERISA-exempted plans, I conclude that for purposes of \u00a7 1002(33)(C)(i), the Benefits Committee is the entity that maintains the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Medina v.

First, plaintiffs' complaint identifies the Benefits Committee as having the \"sole responsibility for administration of the Plan\" and \"all discretionary powers and authority necessary to carry out the provisions of the Plan.\" (Sec. Amd. Compl., ECF # 145 at paras. 118, 136.) The complaint further delineates some of the Committee's specific duties and responsibilities, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   plan administration; interpreting the Plan to determine all questions arising in the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan; adopting rules for the Plan; employing accountants, actuaries, counsel, specialists and other persons necessary to help carry out the Committee's duties and responsibilities under the Plan; issuing directions to the Trustee concerning all benefits which are to be paid from the Trust Fund pursuant to the provisions of the Plan; directing the Trustee's exercise of its power in the administration and investment of the Trust Fund; making all decisions and determinations concerning the right of any person to a benefit under the Plan; requiring each Participant Employer to keep such books, records, and other data as it deems necessary for the proper administration of the Plan; exercising discretion to determine that the Participating Employers pay or reimburse costs and expenses of the Plan; and monitoring other fiduciaries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at para. 137.) In addition to these duties identified by the plaintiffs, the Plan also directs the Benefits Committee to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , engage in claims administration and communicate with members about plan coverage; approve and/or provide claims forms and election forms for participants; comply with all reporting and disclosure requirements; provide consent regarding who shall become participating employers; determine the effective date of the Plan with respect to employees, the\n   classification of employees, and specify rules regarding years of service; and inspect and audit the Trustee's records. Notably, the Plan provides that the Benefits Committee's decisions are final, conclusive, and binding - including on the Plan Sponsor, that is, Mercy Health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   While plaintiffs are correct that Mercy Health is the sole entity that can modify or terminate the Plan, the totality of the circumstances shows that the Benefits Committee is the entity that actually \"maintains\" the Plan as that term is ordinarily used in the context most relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Is the Benefits Committee an Organization?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that if the Benefits Committee is considered to be the entity that maintains the Plan, it nevertheless cannot be considered an \"organization\" under \u00a7 1002(33)(C)(i) because it merely is an internal subset of Mercy Health and does not have a distinct, separate existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As with the term \"maintain,\" several provisions of ERISA include the term \"organization,\" but none define it specifically. Notably, however, while ERISA does not define \"organization\" as a stand-alone word, it does define \"employee organization\" to mean \"... any organization of any kind, or any agency or employee representation committee, association, group, or plan, in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning an employee benefit plan[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4). With this definition, it appears that ERISA contemplated an organization to include a committee existing for the purpose of dealing with an employee benefit plan. Such is the case with the Benefits Committee. An examination of dictionary definitions and other authority supports this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Webster's\n   </em>\n   defines \"organization\" as \"an administrative and functional structure.\"\n   <em>\n    Organization\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's II Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2002). In the\n   <em>\n    Cambridge Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , \"organization\" is defined as \"a group of people who work together in an organized way for a shared purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Cambridge Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/organization (last visited May 31, 2018). Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   defines \"organization\" as \"a body of persons (such as a union or corporation) formed for a common purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Organization\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). And the Tenth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   explicitly found that a subcommittee of a larger non-profit organization can itself be an \"organization\" under \u00a7 1002(33)(C)(i).\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267000\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/1213/\">\n    877 F.3d at 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I have found no definition, and plaintiffs point to none, that requires an \"organization\" to be a wholly independent and separate entity from a larger group of which it is a part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Benefits Committee is a body made up of five members, with one member designated as the chairperson of the committee.
