Gardemal III in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed October 30, 2017 (Doc. 73)(\"Motion to Strike\"); and (iii) the Plaintiff's Motion for Modification and/or Reconsideration, filed April 27, 2018 (Doc. 97)(\"Motion\"). The Court held a hearing on June 13, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether the City of Albuquerque's forfeiture attorneys and enforcement personnel have an unconstitutional institutional incentive to seize cars and prosecute forfeiture actions; (ii) whether the City of Albuquerque's forfeiture officials -- enforcement personnel, prosecutors, and administrative law judges -- have an unconstitutional personal incentive to seize cars, prosecute forfeiture actions, and conclude that vehicles are forfeiture eligible; (iii) whether the City of Albuquerque's forfeiture program\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America by placing the burden of proof on vehicle owners to prove that they have a right to keep their property; and (iv) whether the Court should strike the Declaration of Joseph T. Gardemal III (dated October 9, 2017), filed October 16, 2017 (Doc. 67-2)(\"Gardemal Decl.\"), as an improper expert opinion. The Court concludes that the City of Albuquerque has an unconstitutional institutional incentive to prosecute forfeiture cases, because, in practice, the forfeiture program sets its own budget and can spend, without meaningful oversight, all of the excess funds it raises from previous years. Thus, there is a \"realistic possibility\" that forfeiture officials' judgment \"will be distorted by the prospect of institutional gain\" -- the more revenues they raise, the more revenues they can spend.\n   <em>\n    Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181682\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/238/#p251\">\n    446 U.S. 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 251,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181682\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/238/#p251\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181682\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/238/#p251\">\n    64 L.Ed.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980) (\"\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Independent from the institutional incentive, the Court concludes that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the City of Albuquerque, forfeiture officials have no unconstitutional personal incentive, because their salary is not tied to forfeiture revenue. Therefore, the possibility that they would feel pressured to prosecute more cases or hold for the City of Albuquerque to maintain their income is too remote to implicate due process. The forfeiture program, however, violates procedural due process, because owners have to prove that their cars are not subject to civil forfeiture. Finally, the Court will not strike the Gardemal Decl. because the Gardemal Decl.'s relevant portions contain factual statements that arise from admissible evidence. Accordingly, the Court grants the MSJ in part and denies it in part, denies the Motion to Strike, and grants the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court draws the factual background from the parties' undisputed material facts\n   in their summary judgment motion papers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ \u00b6\u00b6 1-70, at 3-15; Defendant's Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 1-64, at 3-14, filed October 30, 2017 (Doc. 72)(\"MSJ Response\"); Reply in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 7-60, at 3-6, filed November 13, 2017 (Doc. 77)(\"MSJ Reply\").

Second, she argues that \"the City budgets for future forfeiture revenues and evaluates the program based on the amount of revenue that it generates.\" MSJ at 18. Third, she concludes that the prior two realities affect \"city officials who exercise discretion to return or forfeit property, including city attorneys who have their entire salaries paid by forfeiture revenues and a hearing officer whose docket is largely made up of forfeiture cases.\" MSJ at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Harjo argues that the undisputed facts support her contention that the forfeiture program depends on a high level of penalties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 19.

Next, Harjo contends that it is undisputed that, \"if forfeiture revenues were no longer able to cover those expenses, it would become necessary to find room elsewhere in the City's already thinly-stretched budget.\" MSJ at 20 (citing Thompson Depo. at 139:8-20;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 149:14-20). Third, she argues, that, according to the City of Albuquerque's Budget Analyst, a drop in forfeiture revenues would result in a drop in expenditures, including a possible \"cut [in] personnel from the program.\" MSJ at 20 (citing Cutler-Padilla Depo. at 14:12-19;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:5-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Harjo asserts that the undisputed facts also demonstrate that the revenues generated controls how much the City of Albuquerque allocates to the forfeiture program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 20-23. According to Harjo, the City Council, in practice, \"appropriates the program's budget based on projected forfeiture revenue.\" MSJ at 21 (citing Gardemal Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 58-61, at 8, 25-26; Thompson Depo. at 54:20-22;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 134:21-136:23; Cutler-Padilla Depo. at 17:12-18:8). She adds that \"[a]ctual spending then adjusts to reflect actual forfeiture revenue.\" MSJ at 21-22 (citing Thompson Depo. at 136:2-23)(\"If more revenue comes in, then yes, our expenditures can increase.... If less revenue comes in, then we don't -- we have less availability to expend funds.\"). According to Harjo, the increase in spending, which comes from an increase in revenue generation, funds more than just \"the program's necessary expenses,\" and is used \"to pay for bonus equipment and supplies -- purchases the City might not otherwise be able to afford.\" MSJ at 22 (citing Gardemal Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-56, at 21-24). She also argues that, under the Forfeiture Ordinance, the forfeiture program and its officials are assured that they will \"benefit from the revenue\" generated, because the Forfeiture Ordinance \"provides that revenue must be\n   used first to pay program expenses and then to fund related DWI enforcement efforts.\" MSJ at 21 (citing ROA \u00a7 7-6-5(E) ). Harjo contends that the City \"ramps up\" the incentives to raise more forfeiture funds in other ways as well: (i) \"[t]he City's annual budget includes 'performance measures' setting targets for the number of seizures, the number of vehicles returned, via settlement, and the amount of money raised at auction\"; (ii) \"[e]very annual budget ... includes the program's actual performance ... as well as that last year's goals\"; (iii) \"the program tracks ... monthly performance\"; (iv) \"[a]nnual performance evaluations for program personnel list 'increas[ing] the amount of revenue generated from Seized vehicles\"; and (v) \"the City's 2016 budget openly list[s] as an 'accomplishment[ ]' that the program 'generat[ed] $471,000 in proceeds.\" MSJ at 22-23 (citing 2013 Budget at 192; 2014 Budget at 185; 2015 Budget at 183; 2016 Budget at 181; DWI Seizure Unit Statistics; Rodgers Depo. at 69:12-18;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 70:3-73:11; D.

She argues that City of Albuquerque attorneys \"have latitude to set the financial consequences associated with vehicle seizures\" through setting settlement terms, so, according to Harjo, those attorneys must be free from any bias. MSJ at 24 (citing Rodgers Depo. at 19:20-21:25;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:5-25:25;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:3-21; D.

According to Harjo, however, those City of Albuquerque attorneys have a financial incentive to boost revenues, because those attorneys know that the forfeiture revenues pay their \"entire annual salaries ... plus benefits like health insurance.\" MSJ at 24-25 (citing Gardemal Decl. \u00b6 34, at 14-15; Cutler-Padilla Depo. at 26:8-20;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:16-22; Locher Email at 1; Thompson Email at 1). Harjo argues that the City of Albuquerque attorney who prosecuted her case also reaped the forfeiture program's revenues, as he earned $70,776 from the forfeiture program during the fiscal year in which he prosecuted Harjo's case and he earned a $9,500 raise that year \"to be paid for by forfeiture revenues.\" MSJ at 25 (citing Interrog. Response at 15; Hernandez Memo. at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   She contends that other forfeiture program enforcement personnel also have an unconstitutional personal incentive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 26. According to Harjo, enforcement personnel \"are responsible for conducting the only investigation following a seizure, including verifying ... [whether] the seizure falls within city limits.\" MSJ at 26 (citing D. Rivera Depo. at 45:16-46:1). Harjo argues that, because the forfeiture program revenue funds these officials' salaries, there is an unlawful incentive for those enforcement personnel to be less diligent with their investigations, as a poor investigation, especially about whether the car is seized within city limits, could result in \"the City making a profit -- even though [the car] was not subject to forfeiture.\" MSJ at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   She argues that hearing officers suffer from the same personal unconstitutional incentive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 27. According to Harjo, \"[t]he hearing officer\" who adjudicated her case \"is aware of the importance of forfeiture revenues to the forfeiture program,\" and, also according to Harjo, although that \"hearing officer is not formally part of the forfeiture program, his job is still inextricably bound up with the program.\" MSJ at 27 (citing Forfeiture Conf. at 1:20:30 (Harada); id. at 2:33:05 (Harada) ). Harjo argues that seventy-seven percent of the hearings that her hearing officer\n   holds are related to the Forfeiture Ordinance, and, according to Harjo, \"[if] the program were to go away -- for instance, because it was financially unsustainable -- the hearing officer's stream of cases would dry up as well,\" impacting the \"hearing officer personally.\" MSJ at 27-28 (\"When the City shut down its red light ticketing program in 2013, the City cut six positions from the administrative hearing office as a result.\")(citing Third Interrog. Response at 3; 2013 Budget at 137).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Harjo argues that the forfeiture program also violates procedural due process, because the \"City places the burden on property owners to prove their own innocence.\" MSJ at 28. She argues that\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

The City of Albuquerque contends that hearing officers are not paid with forfeiture revenues, do not have \"any responsibility for generating revenue,\" have no \"control over the City's budget,\" and do not \"have any decision-making authority as to how much money will be allocated for their salaries.\" MSJ Response at 17. The City of Albuquerque acknowledges that hearing officers may be aware of how important forfeiture revenues are, but it argues that such knowledge does not translate into an improper incentive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ Response at 17.

It contends that evidence of \"bonus equipment and supplies\" do not demonstrate an institutional bias, because such equipment and supplies do not personally benefit forfeiture program officials. MSJ Response at 21-22. According to the City of Albuquerque, evidence of \"annual budgeting targets\" does not demonstrate an institutional bias, because \"[e]stimating revenue, tracking\n   performance, and comparing actual performance among various fiscal years is part of any normal budgeting process.\" MSJ Response at 23 (\"The fact that employees report or review budgeting metrics routinely also is a necessary part of any budgeting process.\"). It contends similarly that, although employee evaluations have \"form language\" about seizure or revenue targets, \"there is no evidence that employees were either charged with generating revenue or evaluated on it.\" MSJ Response at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The City of Albuquerque argues that its attorneys' and other enforcement officials' discretion either to prosecute cases or conduct investigations do not demonstrate an unconstitutional bias.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ Response at 24.

Harjo argues that, contrary to the City of Albuquerque's position that jurors do not need an opinion to aid them in determining the ultimate issues, Gardemal conducted \"significant, detailed analysis\" of the City of Albuquerque's financial data, distilling complicated information, which would aid jurors in their ultimate determination.

The City of Albuquerque argues that Gardemal makes an \"unsupported leap in reasoning\" that, \"if there is a financial interest, there is also a financial incentive to maximize revenues.\" Motion to Strike Reply at 4. According to the City of Albuquerque, forfeiture program officials must have some power to impact revenue for there to exist a financial incentive to maximize revenues, but, also according to the City of Albuquerque, Gardemal did not inquire or address that issue when coming to his conclusions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Strike Reply at 4-6.

The City of Albuquerque argues that the Court should strike Gardemal's opinions, because he ignores significant contrary evidence and does not test his theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Strike at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The City of Albuquerque contends that Gardemal's testimony about the City of Albuquerque's financial interest in forfeiture revenue is improper rule 702 evidence, as it is an undisputed issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Strike at 10-11.

According to Harjo, the Court disregards the allegation that, \" '[b]ecause forfeiture revenues increase the amount of money available to spend, program personnel directly benefit from increased forfeiture revenues.' \" Motion at 4 (quoting Amended Complaint \u00b6 19, at 5). She concludes that, because the Court is required to accept all of the complaint's allegations as true on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Court erred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Harjo argues that the Court's interpretation and application of the Forfeiture Ordinance, which the Court uses to discount Harjo's factual allegation in the MOO, is an improper application of judicial notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 5. According to Harjo, the Court may judicially notice the Forfeiture Ordinance's text, but it may not properly \"interpret[ ] and appl[y]\" the Forfeiture Ordinance. Motion at 5. Harjo argues that the Court erred, because it interpreted and applied the Forfeiture Ordinance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 5 (\"The challenged portion of the Opinion goes beyond a recitation of the City's Ordinance.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Harjo also argues that the Court improperly interpreted the Forfeiture Ordinance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 3. According to Harjo, the Forfeiture Ordinance says that \" 'proceeds that exceed the costs of administering this article shall be used for DWI enforcement, prevention and education,' \" Motion at 6 (quoting ROA \u00a7 7-6-5(E) ), but, also according to Harjo, there are three reasons why that language does not mean that \"[e]xcess funds collected must be allocated to other programs,\" Motion at 6-7 (quoting MOO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201163\">\n    307 F.Supp.3d at 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   )(brackets in Motion)(emphasis from Motion omitted). First, she argues that \"the ordinance allows the forfeiture program to recover 'the costs of administering this article,' and nothing in the ordinance prevents the program from claiming a share of increased revenues by increasing\n   its 'costs.' \" Motion at 7 (quoting ROA \u00a7 7-6-5(E) ). Second, she argues that the forfeiture program qualifies as \"DWI enforcement,\" so, although excess funds must go to \"DWI enforcement, prevention and education\" the forfeiture program can reap those excess funds as a DWI enforcement program. Motion at 7 (citing Thompson Depo. at 37:8-17). Third, she argues that the forfeiture program also qualifies as \"DWI education,\" so, again, she argues that the forfeiture program can use those excess funds. Motion at 8 (citing D. Rivera Depo. at 17:6-10; Rodgers Depo. at 81:1-82:9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Harjo also asserts that the Court erred by concluding that the forfeiture program \"cannot benefit from increased revenues, because its spending is constrained by the budget.\" Motion at 9. She argues that the evidence demonstrates that the City of Albuquerque always appropriates money based on the forfeiture program's revenues, so, according to Harjo, the forfeiture program \"can increase its appropriations by generating an upward trend in revenue.\" Motion at 9-10. Harjo also asserts that the \"forfeiture program stands to benefit from increased revenues,\" because, as a practical matter, \"the program cannot spend money\" that the program does not raise. Motion at 10. Harjo also argues that the budget is not a constraint, because in fiscal years 2014-2016 the City Council appropriated far more than what was spent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 11-12. Harjo also argues that the budget does not constrain spending, because the forfeiture program can spend more than its appropriation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 12 (citing Cutler-Padilla Depo. at 17:23-18:5; Suppl. Interrog. Response at 3);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201163\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"This evidence establishes that the true constraint on the program's spending is its ability to generate revenue, not the budgeting process.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Harjo also argues that, even if the Mayor and City Council want to limit the forfeiture program's spending, it could not, because \"the program would be able to draw on unused appropriations from past fiscal years.\" Motion at 13 (citing Thompson Depo. at 125:20-126:3). Thus, according to Harjo, because the forfeiture program spent less than its appropriations in 2014-2016, the Mayor and City Council would not be able to meaningfully limit the forfeiture program, so long as the cost did not exceed total appropriations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Harjo argues that, contrary to the Court's conclusion that forfeiture program officials have \" 'little control over ... how [program] money is spent,' \" some forfeiture program officials have authority to \"approve expenditures,\" such as for supplies or other office needs. Motion at 14 (citing Thompson Depo. at 43:18-44:2). She argues that the only barrier for other expenditures is the Albuquerque Police Department Fiscal Manager, who reviews the proposed expenditure for legal compliance and to make sure \"that there [is] funding available to pay for it.\" Motion at 14 (citing Thompson Depo. at 45:12-15;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:6-13;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 108:18-24). Thus, according to Harjo, the evidence demonstrates that \"the head of the forfeiture program exercises significant authority to initiate expenditures of program funds.\" Motion at 14. Harjo contends that the APD Fiscal Manager is more likely to ratify expenses which the forfeiture program head proposes if the forfeiture program revenues increase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 14-15 (citing Thompson Depo. at 135:20-136:8). Harjo concludes, accordingly, that the Court should not have resolved these issues on the pleadings, and should grant their Motion, so that the Court can decide the issue on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    8.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The City of Albuquerque responds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Response in Opposition to\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Modification and/or Reconsideration at 1, filed May 11, 2018 (Doc. 98)(\"Response\"). The City of Albuquerque argues that Harjo's Motion does not meet the Court's reconsideration standards, because: (i) the parties already thoroughly addressed the arguments raised in the Motion; (ii) Harjo has not provided new controlling authority; (iii) the record evidence that Harjo raises is immaterial to the Court's MOO ; and (iv) there is no clear indication that the Court erred. First, the City of Albuquerque argues that the parties spent considerable time briefing the issues Harjo raises, and the Court spent \"an entire section\" of the MOO addressing it, demonstrating that reconsideration and alteration is not proper.

Second, the City of Albuquerque contends that Harjo presents no new controlling authority, but instead relies on the same cases that she presented earlier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4. Third, the City of Albuquerque contends that, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Court cannot consider factual evidence, and the majority of Harjo's Motion improperly asks the Court to consider record evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5-6. The City of Albuquerque adds that the Court's interpretation of the Forfeiture Ordinance is proper as a matter of legal interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5-7. Fourth, the City of Albuquerque argues that the Court did not clearly err, as there is no indication that forfeiture program officials have control over whether excessive funds are returned to the forfeiture program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 7. The City of Albuquerque also argues that, contrary to Harjo's assertion that the statute may be interpreted to mean that excess funds are kept within the forfeiture program, the Amended Complaint \"expressly asserts that excess revenue is distributed for purposes other than the forfeiture program.\" Response at 8 (citing Amended Complaint \u00b6 15, at 4).

Harjo contends that this record evidence shows that the MOO rests on \"a series of factual assumptions\" as opposed to legal interpretations. Reply at 3. She argues that the Court's factual assumptions are not properly judicially noticed, because, as the record evidence demonstrates, the Court's assumed facts \"are subject to reasonable dispute.\" Reply at 5-6.

Harjo notes, however, that, should the Court disagree, she \"stands ready to file a motion to amend.\" Reply at 6 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, Harjo contends that her arguments have not been subject to extensive briefing, because the City of Albuquerque argued previously only that \"the possibility\" of the forfeiture program \"benefitting from increased revenues ... is legally irrelevant.\" Reply at 7 (citing Motion for Judgment at 10). Harjo contends that the issue here is different: whether the forfeiture program can benefit from increased revenues and not whether such a benefit is legally relevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 7. She concludes that her Motion is a narrow request to modify only a page or two of the MOO, so that the Court can consider all of the relevant factual issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    10.\n    <em>\n     The Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Court held a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Draft Transcript of Motion Proceedings at 1:2 (taken June 13, 2018)(Court)(\"Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harjo opened by arguing that her procedural due process argument is \"a pure legal issue,\" of which the Court already disposed in the MOO, so she asked the Court to grant summary judgment on that issue \"for all the reasons that are stated in the Court's opinion.\" Tr. at 3:4-15 (Johnson). She contends that the profit incentive claim is still relevant, even if the Court grants summary judgment on the procedural due process claim, because the two claims deal with different damages; according to Harjo, the procedural due process claim covers only damages \"that arose after the hearing,\" but Harjo sustained a month's worth of damages between the date of seizure and the date of the hearing. Tr. at 3:16-24 (Johnson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   On the improper incentive theory, Harjo argues that the City of Albuquerque \"admits\" that the forfeiture program is \"dependen[t] ... on the revenue generated by the forfeiture program,\" and that, because the forfeiture program is dependent on that revenue, the program violates due process Tr. at 4:1-25 (Johnson). Harjo contends that, even without that concession, the testimony of the City of Albuquerque's executive analyst, the declining budget appropriations, and that forfeiture revenues pay the forfeiture program officials' salaries demonstrate that the forfeiture program is dependent on forfeiture revenues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5:1-19 (Johnson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Harjo contends that all three of the City of Albuquerque's responses to Harjo's arguments fail. First, she contends that it is not true, as the City of Albuquerque argues, that, \"if this [forfeiture program] is illegal, then any forfeiture program would be illegal.\" Tr. at 6:18-19 (Johnson). According to Harjo, a forfeiture program funded through the government's general fund would be constitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 8:2-6 (Johnson). She also notes that federal guidelines prohibit all of the City of Albuquerque's forfeiture processes, and yet the federal government's forfeiture program survives constitutional muster.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 6:16-25 (Johnson). She contends that the\n   constitutional issue with the City of Albuquerque's program is that \"there is a link between how much ... the program is able to generate and how much it's able to spend.\" Tr. at 8:7-11 (Johnson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Court inquired whether there would be a constitutional issue if a forfeiture program received its funding from the general fund, but the funds appropriated from the general fund were consistently equal to the amount the forfeiture program generated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 9:10-17 (Court). Harjo responded that such a pattern might \"raise difficult constitutional questions,\" and in that case, a plaintiff would have to \"show a practice\" that the general fund appropriation equaled revenue raised, which would place a \"higher evidentiary burden\" on the plaintiff. Tr. at 9:18-10:2 (Johnson). The Court expressed reservation about Harjo's conclusion, because, in the Court's opinion, it foreclosed any city from attempting to run a budget-neutral forfeiture program, and, ultimately, Harjo's argument did not present the City of Albuquerque a way to run a constitutional program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:8-20 (Court). Harjo responded that a city could cure any constitutional difficulties by \"budgeting based on cost, not based on respective revenue\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   There's no reason to think that if revenue goes up from 800,000 to 900,000 ... that the program's costs go from 800 to 900,000 as well. The cost of the program, say, are about 700,000, and the program should be budgeted at 700,000. And anything above that should simply go into the general fund. And, similarly, if there's a shortfall, the program shouldn't be in a situation where, you know, it has to worry that, because they've not generated the amount of revenue [needed to cover costs that they] aren't going to be able to pay for salaries and other fixed expense[s].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Tr. at 10:21-11:8 (Johnson). Harjo continued that all she wants is for the program \"to be funded like any law enforcement program.\" Tr. at 11:15-16 (Johnson). The Court responded that, unlike other law enforcement programs, \"it's a program that probably nobody has an incentive to run if it's going to be under water.\" Tr. at 11:21-25 (Court). Harjo countered that such an argument proved her point that, if the forfeiture program's only incentive is to pay for itself, or if the program's law enforcement goals are not worth it if the program does not fund itself, the program is unconstitutional. Tr. at 12:3-13:2 (Johnson). The Court observed that it could not see \"a limiting principle for your arguments.\" Tr. at 13:3-10 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The City of Albuquerque responded that there are factual issues that preclude summary judgment, including that police officers who seize vehicles are paid out of the general fund.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 19:17-19 (Walz). The City of Albuquerque also argued that the Court is correct that Harjo does not provide a limiting principle, but the Court responded that the City of Albuquerque could \"run a deficit program,\" if it concluded that asset forfeiture \"deters crime so much\" that it is worth running a program that needs constant funding from the general fund. Tr. at 20:22-21:2 (Court).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 20:2-11 (Walz). The City of Albuquerque conceded the Court's point, but argued that if a city strived for \"fiscally responsible policies and procedures\" such a concern would not raise constitutional concerns. Tr. at 21:3-16 (Walz).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The City of Albuquerque contended that there is no institutional bias, because the budget is designed to be \"revenue neutral,\" but that the City of Albuquerque could, at any time, decide to make the forfeiture program \"revenue negative.\" Tr. at 23:9-14 (Grubel). The City of Albuquerque also argued that forfeiture program funds used to pay for \"equipment, training\n   programs to the public, and that type of expenditure ... cannot, as a matter of law, show either an institutional financial incentive or [a] personal financial incentive.\" Tr. at 24:17-23 (Walz).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Responding to the Court, Harjo clarified that the forfeiture program account, from which all forfeiture program expenses are paid, is not a separate checking account, but it has a different accounting notation such that, if an item is budgeted to be paid out of the forfeiture fund, there must be money in that forfeiture fund to pay for it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 27:13-22 (Johnson). Harjo also noted that, in fiscal year 2019, the City has, for the first time, appropriated money from the general fund to cover the forfeiture program's costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 30:10-17 (Johnson);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:2-11 (Johnson). The Court observed that the 2019 budgeting transfer undermines Harjo's argument that the forfeiture program is dependent on its own funds, to which Harjo responded that such a reality does not undercut her theory, because the forfeiture program's budget \"has fallen far more than what the city has been able to make up with its supplementation.\" Tr. at 32:11-24 (Court, Johnson).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:13-15 (\"[T]he Supreme Court never suggested that it has to be 100 percent of the budget coming from forfeiture revenues for there to be a profits violation.\"). Harjo also argued that the budget data from before 2019 shows an institutional incentive to prosecute forfeitures, because, as revenues drop, appropriations drop as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 31:12-32:10 (Johnson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Harjo argued that the Court should grant summary judgment on her procedural due process claim under\n   <em>\n    Colorado v. Nelson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 36:15-37:4 (Johnson). The Court asked whether Harjo would concede that\n   <em>\n    Colorado v. Nelson\n   </em>\n   is in tension with previous Supreme Court cases about affirmative defenses shifting the burden of proof, to which Harjo argued that\n   <em>\n    Colorado v. Nelson\n   </em>\n   is not in tension with previous cases, because in previous cases, the government still held the burden to prove that the defendant did something wrong first before the burden shifts, whereas, here, the City of Albuquerque has no burden to prove that the owner did something wrong before the burden shifts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 37:5-25 (Court, Johnson);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:11-19 (citing\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

The City of Albuquerque argued that probable cause has been \"long recognized\" as a proper \"threshold\" procedure for a \"preliminary determination as to whether a criminal activity has occurred.\" Tr. at 41:14-19 (Walz). Accordingly, the City of Albuquerque asked the Court to reconsider its conclusion about this claim in the MOO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 41:1-5 (Walz). Harjo responded that probable cause cannot be enough, because facts showing probable cause center on only the person who is driving the car and not, at least in this case, the vehicle's owner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 43:13-44:4 (Johnson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   On the Motion to Strike, the Court signaled that it is inclined to consider many of Gardemal's more factual points, but that it will discount Gardemal's points that cross the line into legal opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 45:2-9 (Court). The City of Albuquerque responded that it finds the Court's solution acceptable: \"If it's the Court's inclination to deny the motion, but to take a close look and see what you may want to use out of the affidavit or reject, that is certainly the Court's province.\" Tr. at 47:10-13 (Walz). Harjo also agreed with the Court's plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 48:6-9 (Johnson)(\"[T]o the extent that the Court ... intend[s] to disregard\n   any statements that ... cross[ ] the line into a legal conclusion, ... that's fine.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   As to the Motion, Harjo reiterated her arguments from the briefing that it is a narrowly tailored motion that the Court erred in a conclusion that is \"directly contrary to the allegations\" in the Amended Complaint. Tr. at 54:7-20 (Johnson). The City of Albuquerque contended, for the first time, that the Motion was untimely filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 54:24-25 (Walz). The City of Albuquerque also contended that the Court cannot properly reconsider the Motion, because it thoroughly considered the point and concluded against Harjo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 56:6-21 (Walz). Harjo countered that the Motion is timely, as there is no timing requirement for a motion to reconsider an interlocutory order, and that, even if the Motion is untimely, the City of Albuquerque waived the argument by asserting it for the first time at the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 56:25-57:12 (Johnson). Harjo clarified that her Motion seeks to ensure that the Court was not \"hamstrung\" from considering all the relevant facts which the MSJ briefing raises, because of one conclusion in the MOO. Tr. at 58:4-12 (Johnson). The City of Albuquerque rejoined that it had made the timeliness argument in its briefing, because it argues that the Court should not reconsider an opinion if a motion to reconsider is based on evidence that was previously available to the movant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 58:23-59:3 (Walz).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LAW REGARDING MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states: \"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Should the forfeiture program spend more than appropriated, the City of Albuquerque will approve that spending after the fact, as long as previous revenues cover the costs. Accordingly, the forfeiture program has de facto power over its spending, and thus, the more revenue it raises, the more revenue it can spend. Forfeiture program officials, however, do not have an unconstitutional personal incentive to prosecute, because, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the City of Albuquerque, their continued employment or salary is not contingent on the forfeiture program revenues. The Forfeiture Ordinance independently violates due process by depriving car owners of their property unless they prove their innocence. Finally, the Court will not strike the Gardemal Decl., because the statements upon which the Court relies in the Gardemal Decl. are based on admissible evidence. Accordingly, the Court grants the MSJ in part and denies it in part, denies the Motion to Strike, and grants the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     THE CITY OF ALBUQUERQUE HAS AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTIONAL INCENTIVE TO PROSECUTE FORFEITURE ACTIONS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Harjo argues that enforcement officials have an unconstitutional institutional incentive to prosecute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 19-20.

Whereas, in\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   , the fees collected represented less than one percent of the program's budget, the forfeiture program revenues pay all of the program's major expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1157-58 (citing MSJ \u00b6\u00b6 29-31, at 8); Suppl.

In\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   , the amount of the program's budget returned to the Department of Treasury's general fund greatly outweighed the funds raised via prosecution, but here, no money is returned to the general fund.

Although the City Council -- a detached authority -- by law, has the authority to appropriate funds to the forfeiture program, the City Council sets its appropriation to estimated revenues, as opposed to estimated costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1158 (citing MSJ \u00b6 33, at 9). It is undisputed that \"[t]he City sets the amount of [the forfeiture program] appropriation by estimating program revenues for the coming fiscal year.\" MSJ \u00b6 33, at 9.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1158. Indeed, according to the City of Albuquerque's Executive Budget Analyst, if \"we think we're going to get a million dollars in revenue, we'll allow them to spend a million in expenditures.\" Cutler-Padilla Depo. at 17:20-22.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ \u00b6 33, at 9;\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1158. Moreover, it is undisputed that the forfeiture program can spend even more than appropriated, as long as the forfeiture program raises the revenues, and the City Council will retroactively authorize the spending.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1158 (citing MSJ \u00b6 34, at 9).\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The Court concludes, on these facts, that there is a due process violation. Most relevant to the Court's conclusion is the undisputed facts that the City Council retroactively approves spending over the appropriation amount, and that the forfeiture program can spend as much as it raises. On those facts, there is a realistic possibility that the forfeiture program prosecutors' judgment will be distorted, because in effect, the more revenues the prosecutor raises, the more money the forfeiture program can spend.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

As the Court noted in the MOO, by statute, a central authority -- the City Council and the Mayor -- exercised ultimate control over the forfeiture program's budget.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MOO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"350\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201163\">\n    307 F.Supp.3d at 1206-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After discovery, however, the undisputed facts demonstrate that the central authority has ceded its official statutory control such that the forfeiture program officials are in de facto control of how its revenue is spent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1158 (\" 'As a practical matter, the program's spending is limited by its revenue, not by the City Council.' \")(quoting MSJ \u00b6 34, at 9);\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1158 (\"If the forfeiture program has more funds 'available than [the] City Council has appropriated, it can spend even more and [the] City Council will pass a clean up bill retroactively authorizing the spending.' \")(quoting MSJ \u00b6 34, at 9). As the City of Albuquerque's Executive Budget Analyst testified, should the forfeiture program raise \"extra revenues\" one year, those funds are \"dropped\" into a \"fund balance\" such that, in subsequent years, if the appropriation is less than spending, the City of Albuquerque will use the excess balance accrued to cover that additional spending. Cutler-Padilla Depo. at 15:9-19 (\"[W]e call it a cleanup, where we've taken from fund balance and made it whole again.\"). Thus, although the appropriation is nominally the forfeiture program's legal-spending limit, in reality, it is not, because the City of Albuquerque approves extra-appropriation spending:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   [B]ecause we think we're going to get a million dollars in revenue, we'll allow the[ forfeiture program] to spend a million in expenditures. So ... we'll appropriate\n   the million dollars, but if in that year they actually spend a million one hundred, we have to then go back and appropriate another hundred.... And as long as they have the fund balance, you know, we can do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Cutler-Padilla Depo. at 17:17-18:5.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cutler Padilla Depo. at 19:15-16 (\"So if the appropriation is less than what they've spent, we have to clean it up.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:22-25. Thus, in practice, no central authority checks forfeiture program spending; the more excess revenues raised one year will be saved to cover additional spending in subsequent years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Thompson Depo. at 136:4-5 (\"If more revenue comes in, then yes, our expenditures can increase.\"). Thus, the forfeiture program described in the pleadings and on the Forfeiture Ordinance's face is constitutional, but the forfeiture program that this case's discovery reveals is not. The Court concludes, accordingly, that there is an unconstitutional institutional incentive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   In so ruling, the Court is mindful of analogous cases.

First, it argues that there is no constitutional violation when a program is merely \"self-funded\" or when \"the revenues generated offset program expenses.\" MSJ Response at 16.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. The Court agrees that there is not necessarily a constitutional violation if a program is self-funded, or, put another way, if a program is budget neutral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MOO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"359\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201163\">\n    307 F.Supp.3d at 1207-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Thus, that the program funds itself does not create an institutional incentive for prosecutors to prosecute more cases or for officers to seize more vehicles.\"). The forfeiture program here goes beyond mere self-funding, however, because the forfeiture program has the control to spend all it takes in, and it has done so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1157-58 (citing MSJ \u00b6\u00b6 31, 34, at 8-9); Thompson Depo. at 136:4-5 (\"If more revenue comes in, then yes, our expenditures can increase.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   The City of Albuquerque also contends that, if its forfeiture program is unconstitutional, every forfeiture program is unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ Response at 16. To the contrary, the City of Albuquerque could craft a constitutional forfeiture program by altering how it funds the program. For example, the City of Albuquerque could -- instead of placing forfeiture revenues in a special fund -- place forfeiture revenue directly into its general fund and then appropriate money from that fund to pay for the forfeiture program's expenses. Should the City of Albuquerque continue its practice of mechanically approving the forfeiture program's after-the-fact spending,\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   there might still be constitutional concerns, but with the revenues placed in the general fund, there is far less reason to think that the City of Albuquerque would be a rubber stamp, given its many financial obligations. Accordingly, the City of Albuquerque's forfeiture program could pass constitutional muster with some changes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FORFEITURE OFFICIALS DO NOT HAVE AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL PERSONAL INCENTIVE\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   The Court concludes that none of the forfeiture officials have an unconstitutional personal incentive to favor the City of Albuquerque over car owners.

There is no bonus should the hearing officer hold for the City of Albuquerque.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 27. The situation also diverges from Lavoie, in that the Alabama Justice in\n   <em>\n    Lavoie\n   </em>\n   was highly likely to receive the settlement, whereas it is not that likely that Harjo's hearing officer will lose his salary. First, hearing officer's salaries are not paid from revenues raised by the forfeiture program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 27. Thus, a drop in forfeiture cases does not overtly bear on salary. Second, on Harjo's facts, it is not apparent that any hearing officer's job is in jeopardy. To that point, Harjo argues that, because the City of Albuquerque previously eliminated positions when facing the abolition of a revenue-generating program, the City of Albuquerque will eliminate positions again.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ 27-28. It is unclear, however, whether the City of Albuquerque in fact fired any\n   <em>\n    hearing officers\n   </em>\n   in 2012, as the undisputed fact states that \"the City eliminated six\n   <em>\n    positions\n   </em>\n   from the\n   <em>\n    office of administrative hearings\n   </em>\n   .\" MSJ \u00b6 49, at 12 (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2013 Budget at 137. Those positions could be hearing officers, or they could be support staff, or they could be something else. Moreover, eliminating positions does not mean that those individuals were fired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cutler-Padilla Depo. at 78:2-6 (noting that the last time the City of Albuquerque laid off workers was \"back in 2001 or 2002\"). It is possible the City of Albuquerque transferred those employees elsewhere.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cutler-Padilla Depo. at 77:15-16 (\"[H]opefully there would be another job they could transfer into.\"). Consequently, that fact does not demonstrate that Harjo's hearing officer's job is at risk, even if the forfeiture program's numbers plummet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The other fact upon which Harjo relies to argue that the hearing officer's salary is at risk is that he had a high concentration of vehicle seizure hearings in 2015 and 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 27. That fact tells the Court little, however. Those high hearing numbers for those two years could be aberrations. Moreover, that he had a concentration of a case type does not necessarily make it likely that the City of Albuquerque would fire him should the forfeiture program end or shrink.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cutler-Padilla Depo. at 77:14-17 (\"[T]he city doesn't like to lay people off.\"). Many variables bear on a decision to fire an employee. For example, seniority might affect the City of Albuquerque's decisionmaking. Harjo's hearing officer is the chief hearing officer, which makes it less likely that the City of Albuquerque would fire him or that a reasonable hearing officer in his position would feel that his job or salary was in jeopardy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Interrog. Response at 3. Caseload projections might also dictate whether the City of Albuquerque would reduce the number of hearing officers. Thus, should the need for vehicle seizure hearings decrease, but the need for other hearings rise, the City of Albuquerque might not fire hearing officers. Another variable is how busy the hearing officers are. If they are overworked, a reduction in a case type would not necessarily lead to layoffs. The Court recognizes that its analysis draws upon inferences, but, on a motion for summary judgment, it must draw all reasonable\n   inferences in the nonmovant's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"420\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/\">\n    550 U.S. 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 378,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"421\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). Thus, a possible temptation to favor the City of Albuquerque to preserve his salary is fairly remote, as he would know that his salary or job would be at risk only if several other facts, not established here, indicated that the City of Albuquerque was prepared to make pay cuts or fire some of its employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   For similar reasons there is no institutional incentive for Harjo's hearing officer or any hearing officer to favor the City of Albuquerque.

Harjo argues that her hearing officer's awareness of the forfeiture revenue's importance coupled with his high concentration of forfeiture hearings and that the City of Albuquerque previously cut six positions in a different revenue-generating program shows that an unlawful institutional incentive exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 27-28 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

Harjo's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Ward v. Monroeville\n   </em>\n   is misplaced, because the Supreme Court concluded there that, in addition to the high percentage of revenues from the mayor's court used to fund the town, it was the mayor's dual responsibilities as both mayor and judge that led to an unlawful institutional incentive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171363\" index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/57/\">\n    409 U.S. at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171363\" index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/57/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   [T]he test is whether the mayor's situation is one which would offer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge.... Plainly that possible temptation may also exist when the mayor's executive responsibilities for village finances may make him partisan to maintain the high level of contribution from the mayor's court.

Hearing officers have no dual responsibility here. The record shows that they act only as judicial officials. Thus, the temptation that the mayor had in\n   <em>\n    Ward v. Monroeville\n   </em>\n   to boost revenues to satisfy his other responsibilities is missing with the hearing officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Harjo's other arguments do not demonstrate an institutional incentive. Awareness of the importance of a program's revenue does not, on its own, nullify the presumption of neutrality. Judicial officers are often aware of and tasked with deciding issues affecting important sources of governmental revenue, but the presumption of neutrality is not disturbed there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gurley v.

Awareness of a program's importance may tip the balance toward a due process violation if coupled with other salient facts, but the facts here do not point toward a constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   First, that the City of Albuquerque may have fired other hearing officers from an analogous program bears on a personal incentive which hearing officers might have --\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to not get fired -- and not on an institutional incentive. How or why other hearing officers' job security is relevant\n   under an institutional incentive analysis is not immediately apparent. There might be an argument that hearing officers, for institutional reasons, would want to preserve the number of hearing officers employed. That argument involves many inferences, however, that the Court cannot draw at this time. One inference is that the City of Albuquerque would fire hearing officers should forfeiture hearings plummet. As explained above, that inference is not entirely sound, because many variables bear on a decision to fire an employee, particularly in the public sector.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1202-03. That inference is even less sound here, because it is not clear that most hearing officers have a high concentration of forfeiture cases. It is undisputed that Harjo's hearing officer had a high concentration of forfeiture cases in 2015 and 2016, but there are no facts about the other hearing officers' caseload concentration. The available evidence supports an inference that those hearing officers do not have a high concentration of vehicle seizure cases. The 2016 Budget shows that the City of Albuquerque projected 1,200 vehicle seizure hearing in 2016 and estimated 1,013 vehicle seizure hearings in 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Budget at 181. Thus, Harjo's hearing officer's 1,288 vehicle seizure hearings from 2015 through 2016 amount to over half the total number of vehicle seizure hearings in that period, making it unlikely that the majority of other hearing officers' dockets would comprise vehicle seizure hearings. Furthermore, the Court notes that the actual vehicle seizure hearings in 2016 were about half of the estimated 1,200: 576.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Albuquerque Approved Budget Fiscal Year 2018\n   </em>\n   , at 178 (2018) available at\n   <em>\n    http://documents.cabq.gov/budget/fy-18-approved-budget.pdf\n   </em>\n   (\"2018 Budget\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   MOO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"441\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201163\">\n    307 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1208 n.12 (taking judicial notice of the 2018 Budget). It follows that Harjo's hearing officer held about eighty percent of the City of Albuquerque's vehicle forfeiture hearings over that period, making it even less likely that other hearing officers' dockets comprise a majority vehicle seizure cases. That evidence suggests that there is not a high possibility that hearing officers would be tempted to rule for the City of Albuquerque over vehicle owners for institutional reasons. Accordingly, the Court concludes that there is no unconstitutional institutional incentive for the hearing officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   <strong>\n    B. ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL DO NOT HAVE A PERSONAL INCENTIVE TO PROSECUTE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The enforcement personnel do not have a personal incentive to prosecute more cases, so there is no due process violation. The Court concludes that, although those officials are not city attorneys, enforcement personnel are prosecutorial in nature, because their main task is to investigate facts underlying forfeiture seizures and aid the city attorneys in prosecuting vehicle forfeitures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ \u00b6\u00b6 4-7, at 3-4, 26;\n   <em>\n    California Pacific Bank v.

Second, enforcement personnel have their salaries paid with forfeiture program revenues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, 68, at 7-8, 15, 26-27.

Thus, on the one hand, Harjo alleges that \"[m]oney collected through the forfeiture program is distributed to other purposes only if there is any surplus left over after paying the expenses of the forfeiture program,\" and, on the other hand, alleges, \"forfeiture revenues increase the amount of money available to spend.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 15, 19 at 4-5. There is some tension in those two allegations. The Amended Complaint acknowledges that \"surplus left over after paying the expenses of the forfeiture program\" must go to other programs, yet she contends that there is no such thing as a surplus that must go to other programs, because the more the forfeiture program raises, the more it can spend. Nevertheless, that reality does not mean that the Court can disregard Harjo's allegation that \"forfeiture revenues increase the amount of money available to spend,\" because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure let her plead -- even facts -- inconsistently.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.

The two allegations are compatible if one infers that forfeiture officials can increase forfeiture program costs such that there is never surplus revenue to be distributed to other programs.
