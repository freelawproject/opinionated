First, it defines \"tributaries\" of primary waters as per se waters of the United States, with tributary defined as \"a water that contributes flow, either directly or through another water,\" to a primary water and \"is characterized by the presence of the physical indicators of a bed and bank and an ordinary high water mark,\" declaring for the first time that \"remote sensing sources\" or \"mapping information\" would be used to detect these \"physical indicators.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20328.3\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 328.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) ; 80 Fed. Reg. at 37,076 -78. The WOTUS Rule also envisions the use of \"desktop tools\" for \"hydrologic estimation of a discharge sufficient to create an ordinary high water mark\" to identify the presence of a bed, bank, and OHWM, or even the historical presence of such where physical characteristics are \"absent in the field.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37,077.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Second, the WOTUS Rule declares that all \"adjacent\" waters are per se jurisdictional, defining \"adjacent waters\" as waters and wetlands \"bordering, contiguous or neighboring\" primary waters, even if they are separated from the primary water by man-made or natural barriers.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20328.3\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 328.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Third, the WOTUS Rule also grants authority to the Agencies over certain waters with a relationship to a primary water, to include: (1) all waters, any part of which are within the 100-year floodplain of a primary water; and (2) all waters, any part of which are within 4,000 feet of the high tide line or ordinary high water mark of a primary water, impoundment, or tributary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20328.3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 328.3(a)(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With the WOTUS Rule's new definition of \"waters of the United States,\" the Agencies estimated that determinations of federal jurisdiction would increase by 2.84% to 4.65% annually. 80 Fed.

Dkt. No. 32. This Court held a hearing on the Motion on August 12, 2015. Dkt. No. 70. On August 27, 2015, the Court issued an order denying the preliminary injunction for lack of jurisdiction, holding that original jurisdiction lay with the Courts of Appeals. Dkt.

The President of the United States issued an executive order in March 2017 for reconsideration of the WOTUS Rule. Exec. Order No. 13,778,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C497\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 12,497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mar. 3, 2017). In response, the Agencies proposed a rule on July 27, 2017, that, once implemented, would rescind the WOTUS Rule and recodify the pre-2015 regulatory definition of \"waters of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Definition of \"Waters of the United States\" - Recodification of Pre-Existing Rules,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034899\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 34899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 34901-34902. Then, in November 2017, following oral argument in\n   <em>\n    National Association of Manufacturers v. Department of Defense\n   </em>\n   , the Agencies proposed another new rule. That one became final on February 6, 2018 (\"Applicability Rule\"). The Applicability Rule is identical to the WOTUS Rule but provides an effective date of February 6, 2020. Until then, the Agencies assert that the WOTUS Rule \"is being actively reconsidered by the Agencies.\" Dkt. No. 154-1, p. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Applicability Rule, in turn, has now been challenged in several lawsuits. Two lawsuits are pending in the Southern District of New York-the first involves a coalition of eleven states led by New York against the Agencies. Dkt. No. 149, pp. 1-2. Those eleven states seek a declaration that the Applicability Rule is unlawful.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034899\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The second New York action involves two environmental groups against the Agencies, arguing that the Applicability Rule is unlawful and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Compl., N.Y. v.

Several other environmental groups sued the Agencies in the District of South Carolina, challenging the legality of the Applicability Rule and requesting declaratory and injunctive relief. Dkt.

The parties in this case also made reference during the preliminary injunction hearing to a case challenging the Applicability Rule in the Western District of Washington. Dkt. No. 167, pp. 7, 29. The parties also represented that the challengers of the Applicability Rule have so far moved for summary judgment in three of those lawsuits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   pp. 6-7. The Agencies will be responding to those motions for summary judgment from now until August (as those cases have similar but staggered deadlines).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 29. No parties in those cases have sought preliminary relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Southern District of New York denied motions to transfer both cases to the Southern District of Texas, and as far as this Court has been presently made aware, a motion to transfer the District of South Carolina case to the Southern District of\n   Texas is still pending.

The WOTUS Rule\n   allows the Agencies to regulate waters that do not bear any effect on the \"chemical, physical, and biological integrity\" of any navigable-in-fact water. The definition of \"tributary\" covers a trace amount of water so long as \"the physical indicators of a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark\" can be found by \"mapping information\" or \"remote sensing tools\" where actual physical indicators are \"absent in the field.\" This definition is similar to the one invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Rapanos\n   </em>\n   , and it carries with it the same concern that Justice Kennedy had there-it seems \"to leave wide room for regulation of drains, ditches, and streams remote from any navigable-in-fact water.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Army Corps had attempted to justify the rule at issue in\n   <em>\n    SWANCC\n   </em>\n   on the ground that 121 bird species had been observed at the site, including several known to depend on aquatic environments for a significant portion of their life. Similarly, the WOTUS Rule asserts that, standing alone, a significant \"biological effect\" - including an effect on \"life cycle dependent aquatic habitat[s]\" - would place a water within the CWA's jurisdiction.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20328.3\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 328.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(5).

Second, unlike the final rule, the proposed rule made no mention of exempting waters on farmland only from the \"adjacent waters\" category. The proposal gave no indication that it would treat farmland differently from any other land or that it would treat farmland differently as between the adjacency and the tributary categories. Third, the proposed rule did not include in the definition of tributaries waters and land that possess no observable (from the ground) bed, bank, or ordinary high water mark, but the final rule defines tributaries as possessing a bed, bank, or ordinary high water mark that can be detected by remote sensing imagery.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   79 Fed.

First, the WOTUS Rule requires States to expend resources updating the water quality goals under the CWA's Water Quality Standard program. The State of Kansas has produced evidence that this will require \"significantly greater resources\" than $300,000. Dkt. No. 32-3 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10. Second, the WOTUS Rule requires States to expend resources in issuing additional state certifications under the Section 404 program.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201344\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The EPA has estimated that the WOTUS Rule will impose additional obligations on the States of between $798,000 and $1.3 million per year under this program alone. EPA, Economic Analysis of the EPA-Army Clean Water Rule, at 19 (May 2015). Third, the WOTUS Rule requires the States to create, process, and issue additional National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits. Dkt. No. 32-3 \u00b6 13. The EPA has predicted that this will impose upon the States additional obligations of between $527,000 and $770,000 per year under this program alone. EPA, Economic Analysis of the EPA-Army Clean Water Rule, at 25-29 (May 2015). These losses are unrecoverable economic losses, in addition to the unrecoverable loss of state sovereignty, because there is neither an alternative source to replace the lost revenues nor a way to avoid the increased expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The States have easily shown that the harm they will suffer once the WOTUS Rule becomes effective has no adequate remedy at law. But the Agencies argue that these harms are not \"actual and imminent\" because the WOTUS Rule may never become effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Here, there are two ways that the WOTUS Rule could become effective, thereby\n   triggering immediate irreparable harm to the States. First, the WOTUS Rule will become effective once the Applicability date arrives (February 6, 2020). This trigger provides actual harm, and the Court will discuss whether it is imminent. Second, the WOTUS Rule will become effective if one of the several courts considering the issue invalidates the Applicability Rule. This trigger will occur, if at all, rather imminently. Together, these are two independent ways that the States can establish that irreparable harm is both actual and imminent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Regarding the first trigger for the WOTUS Rule's effectiveness, the effective date is certain to arrive-that is, the States will suffer \"actual\" harm on February 6, 2020. As the law presently stands, the WOTUS Rule\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   become effective on that date. The Applicability Rule providing that date is not provisional, conditional, or equivocal, but definite in its effectiveness on that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Agencies argue that there is not a substantial threat of irreparable harm before a decision on the merits can be reached, because the Agencies intend to issue a new and superseding rule before February 2020. The Intervenors\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   argue that the States' concerns are simply matters of regularity uncertainty, and that irreparable harm must be based on something more than regularity uncertainty (citing\n   <em>\n    New England Power Generators Ass'n, Inc. v. FERC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3536224,3661910,4170302\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/364/\">\n    707 F.3d 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369 (D.C. Cir. 2013) ).\n   <em>\n    New England\n   </em>\n   does hold that uncertainty about the possibility that an agency may reverse its position does not create irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3536224,3661910,4170302\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/364/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the present situation is, in an important way, just the opposite. The possibility that the agency may reverse its position cannot create harm, nor can the possibility that the agency will reverse its position alleviate the harm already set in motion. The States argue that actions must be based on an agency's present position, without speculating that they may change at some point in the future. The Court can and must analyze the situation based on the present state of the law. And the law presently states that the WOTUS Rule\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   actually become effective in February 2020.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The question then becomes whether February 6, 2020 - nineteen months from now - is imminent. The law does not provide a time-specific answer. At the outer limit, imminence is capped by the amount of time it takes to render a decision on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, 11A Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Civ. \u00a7 2948.1 (3d ed.) (requiring a demonstration that \"the applicant is likely to suffer irreparable harm\n   <em>\n    before a decision on the merits can be rendered\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    Lambert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1492173\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/695/536/#p539\">\n    695 F.2d at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he harm considered by the district court [in a preliminary injunction] is necessarily limited to that which might occur in the interval between ruling on the preliminary injunction and trial on the merits.\"). Given that the States filed this suit thirty-six months ago, and still no decision on the merits has been possible, it is quite possible that February 6, 2020 will occur before a decision on the merits can be rendered. No discovery has been permitted nor possible; dispositive motions have not been submitted, briefed, or even scheduled. Therefore, the Court finds that the occurrence of actual irreparable harm in nineteen\n   months is sufficiently imminent to weigh this factor in favor of the States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Moreover, there exists the possibility of an even earlier trigger of the WOTUS Rule - the WOTUS Rule could become effective, and the irreparable harm suffered by the States, even more imminently than February 6, 2020. This could occur if a court in one of the numerous other lawsuits pending in various states across the country finds that the Applicability Rule is invalid. Such decisions are ripe for decision beginning this very month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Agencies argue that the Court should not speculate regarding whether those courts will invalidate the Applicability Rule but should instead wait and see what their decisions turn out to be. Thus, the Agencies have asked the Court to hold the States' Motion in abeyance pending further developments in each of the Applicability Rule cases. The States respond that this would be too late, for once the Applicability Rule is invalidated, the WOTUS Rule is immediately effective, and the harm to the States is immediately suffered. Their larger concern is that by the time any Court invalidates the Applicability Rule, it might be too late for the States to seek preliminary injunctive relief because preliminary injunctive relief is not available to remedy harm that has already occurred.\n   <em>\n    Ala. v.

Balance of equities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The third preliminary injunction prerequisite requires the Court to compare the harm to the movant in the absence of the preliminary injunction with the harm to the nonmovant in granting the preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Here, this factor weighs heavily in favor of the States. The harm faced by the States has already been articulated: loss of sovereignty and unrecoverable monetary losses. On the other hand, the only harm that the Agencies have articulated is complying with the Court's order. As counsel stated at the hearing, \"the Agencies would have to monitor compliance with now two injunctions\" - two injunctions that do the same thing. Dkt. No. 167, p. 25. Counsel went on: the harm is \"hard to articulate, admittedly\" but is the institutional harm of having their rule enjoined by a court. That would always be the case. If the harm of complying with an injunction - of having one's activity enjoined - were enough to tip the balance against an injunction, every request for injunction would fail. In any event, the effect of an injunction would be the same as what the Agencies themselves are seeking: non-application of the WOTUS Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The harm to the Agencies of preserving the status quo as this case progresses pales in comparison to the harm that the States urge - loss of sovereignty and unrecoverable monetary losses - were the WOTUS Rule to become effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Public interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   An injunction of the WOTUS Rule favors the public interest. First, \"[t]he public has no interest in the enforcement of what is very likely\" an unenforceable rule.\n   <em>\n    Odebrecht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566580\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/1268/#p1289\">\n    715 F.3d at 1273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, if the WOTUS Rule becomes effective before a final decision on the merits is rendered, farmers, homeowners, and small businesses will need to devote time and expense to obtaining federal permits-all to comply with a rule that is likely to be invalidated. Lastly, enjoining the WOTUS Rule will put the eleven States in this case in the same position as the thirteen states granted preliminary injunctive relief by the District of North Dakota, thereby adding consistency of judicial determination as well as of the Rule's applicability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs have clearly met the burden of persuasion on each of the four factors entitling them to a preliminary injunction. Three of the four factors (substantial likelihood of success on the merits, balance of harms, and public interest) weigh overwhelmingly in Plaintiffs' favor.
