Defendants are the owners of the land on which the marijuana operation is claimed to be maintained and several alleged participants in that operation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to each defendant, Plaintiffs assert one state-law nuisance claim and two Racketeer Influenced\n   and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") claims. The case comes before the Court on Defendants' motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and, as to the alleged RICO violations, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Since each claim satisfies the minimum constitutional requirements for this Court to exercise jurisdiction, Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is DENIED. Nevertheless, because Plaintiffs fail to allege a compensable property injury under the civil RICO statute, Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is GRANTED. Plaintiffs' RICO claims are therefore DISMISSED without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Robert D. Ainsworth, Tami L. Ainsworth, Karl G. Frink, Lucinda A. Frink, Gordon D. Griswold, Elaine C. Griswold, John K. Lindsey, William E. Whitaker, and Suzanne R. Whitaker bring this civil RICO and state-law nuisance action against Mark A. Owenby, Michelle A. Page, Jenny R. Silveira, Howard D. Brown III, William W. Templeton, Jr., Elisha Templeton, and Bryan D. Philp. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-13. Their claims arise out of the presence and effects of an alleged marijuana production and processing operation (the \"Marijuana Operation\") on property owned by Owenby and Page in Lebanon, Oregon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. \u00b6 1. Plaintiffs are residential property owners with land neighboring the Owenby and Page property. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 30-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, in November 2016, Owenby and Page agreed with William Templeton and Elisha Templeton (collectively, the \"Templetons\") to seek and acquire property on which to \"produce and process\" marijuana. Compl. \u00b6 15. In December 2016, Owenby and Page purchased their Lebanon property and resolved with the Templetons, Silveira, and Brown to \"develop\" the property, \"erect structures,\" and \"purchase and install equipment, fixtures, and materials\" to produce and process marijuana. Compl. \u00b6 15. Owenby and Page further agreed with the Templetons, Silveria, and Brown that they would \"make a financial investment in the Marijuana Operation, and that in exchange,\" Owenby and Page \"would receive a portion of the [operation's] proceeds.\" Compl. \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the Templetons, Owenby, Page, Silveira, Brown, and Philp began using the property to \"produce[ ] marijuana and distribute[ ] it for sale.\" Compl. \u00b6 22. To that end, Silveria and Brown moved onto the Owneby and Page property in January 2017, \"setting up\" and \"managing\" the Marijuana Operation. Compl. \u00b6 17. Also in support of the Marijuana Operation, Owenby, Page, and the Templetons\n   purchased and transported to the property materials and equipment for producing and processing marijuana, often with the help of Silveria, Brown, and Philp. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18. The same defendants made improvements to the land and its structures in furtherance of the Marijuana Operation. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-20. In return, the Templetons, Owenby, Page, Silveria, Brown, and Philp have all \"received a portion of the proceeds of the Marijuana Operation.\" Compl. \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the Marijuana Operation continued to operate through at least December 1, 2017, the date on which they filed their Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. \u00b6 22. Since the operation's commencement, a greenhouse \"equipped with large, commercial exhaust fans\" has operated on the Owenby and Page property \"24 hours a day, seven days a week.\" Compl. \u00b6 24. In addition, Owenby, Page, Silveira, Brown, Philp, and Bill Templeton have \"regularly burn[ed] marijuana debris, trash[,] and discarded items from the [M]arijuana [O]peration, creating thick, noxious smoke.\" Compl. \u00b6 24. Traffic traveling to and from the Owenby and Page property, moreover, has transformed the two dead-end roads on which Plaintiffs live into \"busy, and at times unsafe, commercial roadways.\" Compl. \u00b6 26. Plaintiffs \"no longer feel safe in their homes and on their properties,\" citing the presence of \"pit bull guard dogs\" roaming loose in the neighborhood, \"unknown vehicles entering their properties at all hours of the day and night,\" and at least two reports of \"prowling and break-ins\" on nearby properties. Compl. \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, as a result of the \"persistent stench of marijuana,\" ever-present fan noise, and increased traffic, the Marijuana Operation has interfered with the \"use and enjoyment of their properties.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-32. They note, for example, that they are no longer able to open the windows in their homes, sit outside on their decks and patios, or recreate in their yards. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-32. Plaintiffs further allege that the odors, noise, and traffic created by the Marijuana Operation, along with the very fact of the operation's existence, make each of their properties \"worth materially less than they otherwise would be\" and \"harder to sell at any price.\" Compl. \u00b6 35. Finally, Plaintiffs allege that, fearing \"the presence of a drug trafficking operation in their neighborhood,\" they have \"formed a neighborhood watch group, ... purchased and installed cameras and security systems, purchased and installed fencing and gates, and purchased firearms.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30, 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(1)\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Fed.

They contend that Plaintiffs lack constitutional standing to seek relief in federal court and, even if they did not lack constitutional standing, that Plaintiffs have suffered no injuries of the type compensable under the civil RICO statute. Since this Court is without jurisdiction to entertain the merits of any of Plaintiffs' claims if they lack constitutional standing, it addresses that issue first. The Court finds that, although Plaintiffs have constitutional standing to bring their claims, Plaintiffs have not alleged any compensable injuries to property and therefore cannot to state a claim under any provision of the civil RICO statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Constitutional Standing\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants argue that this Court is without jurisdiction to decide the present suit because Plaintiffs lack standing.

To the extent Plaintiffs allege an interference with the use and enjoyment of their land, they allege a cognizable injury-in-fact. Although Defendants contend that any such injury is not \"concrete\" or \"actual\" because their racketeering activities have ceased, it is axiomatic that a plaintiff may recover damages for past harms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/#p105\">\n    461 U.S. at 105-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/#p105\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (distinguishing between claims seeking damages for past harms and prospective injunctive relief). Plaintiffs here seek damages not only to compensate for their present inability to enjoy the use of their properties, but also for past interferences with that same interest; in turn, even if Defendants' activities had ceased, Plaintiffs would have standing to seek damages, albeit potentially nominal, for the prior months of smoke, noise, and foul odors emanating from the Owenby and Page property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants' challenge to the jurisdictional facts underlying Plaintiffs' alleged property value injury is both irrelevant and premature.

Defendants do not argue that economic injuries are non-cognizable injuries or that, to the extent Plaintiffs have experienced a past or\n   present reduction in the value of their properties, they would lack standing to sue. Instead, Defendants suggest that Plaintiffs have not alleged a past economic injury and that there can be no present economic injury because their activities have ended. Although the Court agrees that the Complaint alleges only a present drop in property value, the issue is moot because, as noted above, Plaintiffs need only have standing as to each claim and type of relief sought. Defendants cite no case, and the Court can find none, holding that once a plaintiff demonstrates that she has standing to bring a claim for damages, she must also produce evidence of the injury underlying each\n   <em>\n    theory\n   </em>\n   of her damages. Plaintiffs here, based on their use and enjoyment injury, have standing to bring their claims and seek relief in the form of damages-Article III does not place further limitations on their ability to assert alternative theories of damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Moreover, even if Plaintiffs' property value injury were the only one alleged, it would be inappropriate for the Court to resolve the factual dispute at this juncture. Defendants correctly state the general rule that a court may resolve disputes of jurisdictional facts by consulting extra-pleadings evidence. That rule, however, does not govern when the jurisdictional facts are \"so intertwined\" with substantive aspects of a claim that resolution of the factual dispute would touch the \"merits of an action.\"\n   <em>\n    Sun Valley Gasoline, Inc. v.

Although actionable under Oregon nuisance law, such harms to human comfort are not compensable under RICO. The Ninth Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Oscar\n   </em>\n   confirms this conclusion and makes clear that, whereas harm to the physical condition or value of land is a \"tangible injury to property,\" the \"diminution of enjoyment\" experienced by Plaintiffs is a distinct \"personal injury in the form of emotional distress.\" Plaintiffs note that the Ninth Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Oscar\n   </em>\n   was based in part on California nuisance law, but they make no attempt to distinguish between California and Oregon law. As interpreted by the Ninth Circuit, California draws the same distinction between personal and proprietary nuisance injuries.

Defendants contend that because the\n   Complaint lacks specific allegations of attempts to rent, sell, or otherwise monetize their property interests, Plaintiffs fail to plead a \"concrete financial loss.\" Under this view, a plaintiff seemingly cannot state a civil RICO claim if the pecuniary loss on which she relies is in any way contingent upon the occurrence of future events.

Although the plaintiff was entitled to no wages from prospective employers and any financial loss was therefore as yet unrealized, his injury was tangible because not only did he possess a valuable property interest, but he had a present intent to monetize it.

To the contrary, as currently drafted, the Complaint suggests that the burdened lands house private residences which Plaintiffs have no desire or intent to rent or sell. Although it is certainly reasonable to infer that their fair market values have dropped, that is an abstract harm. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   , the Complaint lacks factual allegations from which to infer that Plaintiffs are actively seeking to monetize their interests. Indeed, even though the plaintiff's ability to monetize his interest in\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   was contingent upon future events, he at least alleged a present intent to seek out a future financial benefit. That is not the case here. Plaintiffs are not required to offer detailed statics, appraisals, or other information quantifying their losses at this stage in the litigation, but they must do more than allege that, in an abstract sense, their lands are worth less.

It is this aspect of Plaintiffs' RICO claims which Defendants challenge.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Defendants offered another theory at oral argument. They asserted that it would make little sense if a civil RICO claimant could get into federal court based on an injury-in-fact, such as lost use and enjoyment of land, which is not compensable under the civil RICO statute. Any such injury, they seemed to reason, would not be redressable since, as discussed in Part II.A,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , it could not form part of a viable RICO claim. That argument puts the cart before the horse. The standing doctrine requires only that an alleged injury-in-fact be redressable by a\n    <em>\n     favorable\n    </em>\n    decision of the court-it does not require that the plaintiff be guaranteed of a favorable decision. If a defendant could claim that a plaintiff lacked standing on redressability grounds simply because she is unable to state a claim, every motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) would be transformed into a decision on the merits. The standing requirement, as applied in the non-generalized grievance context, seeks to ensure actual adversity between parties. That purpose is served here. Standing is a constitutional minimum and does not replace the separate requirement that a complaint allege facts stating a plausible claim for relief.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v.
