Wier's Recommended Disposition (also known as a \"Report and Recommendation,\" or \"R &amp; R\") [R. 240] on the motion to vacate [R. 210] filed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   by Brian Hamilton, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The motion was fully briefed, and, on November 9, 2017, Judge Wier appointed CJA counsel to represent Hamilton on his motion. [R. 221] An evidentiary hearing was held on December\n   15, 2017. [R. 230.] Judge Wier issued his R &amp; R on January 22, 2018, recommending that the Court grant Hamilton \u00a7 2255 relief. [R. 240 at 1.] For the reasons stated below, the Defendant's Motion to Vacate [R. 210] will be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Brian Hamilton filed a motion to vacate pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   seeking habeas relief for certain alleged sentencing errors and ineffective assistance of counsel. [R. 240.] The Magistrate Judge conducted an evidentiary hearing on the issues raised in Hamilton's motion to vacate and, thereafter, issued a written R &amp; R wherein he recommends granting Hamilton habeas relief solely on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. [R. 230; R. 240.] In his recommendation, Magistrate Judge Wier thoroughly set out his proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. [R. 240.] Judge Wier's Recommended Disposition advised the parties that any objection to the R &amp; R must be filed within fourteen days. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.] The time to file objections has passed, and neither party has objected nor sought an extension of time to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   123 Generally, this Court must make a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   determination of those portions of the Recommended Disposition to which objections are made.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(c). When no objections are made, as in this case, this Court is not required to \"review ... a magistrate's factual or legal conclusions, under a de novo or any other standard.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

Parties who fail to object to a magistrate judge's report and recommendation are also barred from appealing a district court's order adopting that report and recommendation.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Walters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1357587\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/638/947/\">\n    638 F.2d 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 1981). Nevertheless, this Court has examined the record and agrees with Magistrate Judge Wier's Recommended Disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The sole issue on which Judge Wier recommends granting \u00a7 2255 habeas relief relates to Hamilton's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Hamilton asserts that he was not granted the discretionary one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3E1.1(b), due to the representations of his trial counsel. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.] The essence of Hamilton's claim is that his trial counsel did not effectively communicate to him that not accepting a plea offer, which contained the three-level reduction for acceptance, by the Government's deadline might result in the loss of the third level of acceptance. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.] In advising his client, Hamilton's trial counsel seemed to ignore the deadline presented by the Government and seemed to rely solely on the Court's scheduling order. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.] Because Hamilton was not properly advised on the deadline for accepting the Government's plea offer, when he ultimately pled guilty he did not receive the third level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.] Judge Wier determined that this level of representation fell below the \"prevailing professional norms\" established in\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   4 In calculating a criminal defendant's sentencing guidelines, the Court may only grant the third level reduction for acceptance of responsibility when presented with a motion from the Government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3E1.1(b) ( U.S. Sentencing Comm'n 2016). Although the Magistrate Judge recommends granting \u00a7 2255 habeas relief based on the ineffective assistance of Hamilton's trial counsel, the Court still has not been presented with a motion from\n   the Government to grant Hamilton the third level reduction for acceptance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Accordingly, and the Court being sufficiently advised, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1.

Wier, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Movant, Brian Hamilton, is a federal inmate. On August 9, 2017, Hamilton filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   DE 210 (Motion). The United States responded in opposition. DE 218 (Response). Hamilton replied. DE 219 (Reply).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Per normal practice, the District assigned the matter to the undersigned for a recommended disposition. The Court determined to conduct an evidentiary hearing and, accordingly, appointed counsel for Hamilton.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 221 (Order). The Court held the evidentiary hearing on December 15, 2017, DE 230 (Minute Entry Order), and has carefully evaluated the full record, all briefing, and the hearing evidence (including three witnesses and three exhibits). For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    RECOMMENDS\n   </strong>\n   that the District Judge\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   \u00a7 2255 relief (DE 210)-on the terms stated below-to the extent Hon. Andrew Stephens, Hamilton's trial-level counsel, ineffectively assisted Movant regarding his plea offer, otherwise\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   \u00a7 2255 relief (DE 210), and issue no Certificate of Appealability as to the rejected claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Counsel failed to effectively inform Hamilton of the terms and mechanics of a plea offer from the United States, particularly the import of the prosecutor's plea deadline. That failure caused Hamilton to forgo a plea deal that included a third-point reduction, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b), for timely acceptance of responsibility. The representation fell below\n   the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   performance standard and prejudiced Hamilton. As such, the Court should grant the motion, tailor appropriate relief, and give Hamilton the sentencing benefit of the plea deal that counsel's ineffective conduct caused to lapse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In October 2015, a grand jury indicted Hamilton on one count of conspiring to defraud the Government (Count 1), four count of wire fraud (Counts 29-32), and two counts of aggravated identity theft (Counts 41-42), in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20286\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1343, and 1028(a)(1). DE 1 (Indictment). On May 10, 2016, Hamilton pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and one count of both wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. DE 142 (Minute Entry - Rearraignment). Judge Thapar sentenced Hamilton to 82-months' imprisonment. DE 193 (Judgment). Hamilton appealed. DE 195 (Notice). Hamilton, to the court of appeals, argued \"the district court erred by not awarding him a minor-role reduction or an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.\" DE 207 (6th Cir. Order Dismissing). The Sixth Circuit dismissed the appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Hamilton consented to a magistrate judge conducting his rearraignment. The magistrate judge discussed Hamilton's appellate-waiver provision with him in depth, noting its breadth. Hamilton stated that he understood the provision, that he had read it carefully, and that he had reviewed it with his counsel. That his sentence had not yet been imposed and he could not know if an error might arise during sentencing does not render his plea involuntary or unknowing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Coker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048153\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/562/#p574\">\n    514 F.3d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574 (6th Cir. 2008). His plea agreement set out sentencing recommendations, which did not include a minor-role reduction or an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. If Hamilton wanted to appeal these issues, he should have preserved his right to appeal them.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048153\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/562/#p574\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On August 9, 2017, Hamilton timely submitted a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. DE 210. The motion renews both direct-appeal contentions and adds the claim that counsel's ineffective assistance during plea negotiations cost him an offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.

Accordingly, and as with the appellate waiver already enforced, he remains bound by it.

In essence, Stephens argued that Defendant was incarcerated for a year of the alleged eighteen-month conspiracy, that he rarely aided the conspiracy-only at the explicit behest of the major figures-and that he received but minimal monetary benefit.

Hamilton does not allege a constitutional infirmity (nor is there any record suggestion of one). Hamilton also fails to allege an arbitrary act.

Andrew M. Stephens) regarding a lapsed plea offer and the attendant loss of an offense level reduction for \u00a7 3E1.1(b) timely acceptance of responsibility. Per Hamilton, Stephens failed to explain the meaning and effect of the prosecutor's plea offer deadline. The plea lapsed, and Hamilton lost the \u00a7 3E1.1(b) point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that Stephens deficiently failed to convey the possibility of irrevocable third-point loss and ineffectively advised Hamilton that the prosecutorial deadline was not controlling. Further, Hamilton established a reasonable probability that, if accurately advised, he would have accepted the plea before it lapsed. Hamilton ultimately accepted-and was sentenced based on-an agreement that differed only by omitting the third point reduction, a point lost by misadvice. Nothing in the record suggests that, had Hamilton accepted the original deal, such a plea would have been withdrawn, gone unaccepted, or that the resulting sentence would not have been similarly situated within the lower guideline range.

Undisputed Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On November 24, 2015, the Government sent defense counsel a letter broaching the possibility of a plea agreement. DE 185, at 8-9. A month later, the prosecutor, Hon. Neeraj Gupta, contacted Stephens again, provided the broad contours of a possible plea agreement, and established a January 25, 2016, expiration for all existing offers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.

Stephens's first substantive response came over two months later-twelve days before offer expiration-and requested a plea status update.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Gupta's same-day response restated the terms offered in January and explicitly reiterated that: \"Brian Hamilton can get the\n   <strong>\n    third point\n   </strong>\n   for acceptance of responsibility\n   <strong>\n    if we can sign a plea agreement on or before April 11\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The next day, March 31, 2016, Stephens indicated that \"Brian [Hamilton] is most certainly not interested in a trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Stephens and Gupta scheduled a plea discussion for April 6, after which Gupta provided a draft plea agreement and restated that \"if the plea agreement isn't signed by April 11 then this particular deal will expire.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.

In relevant part, Stephens requested a new plea offer and noted that, \"extension of an offer may offend you [sic] self-imposed deadline, but does comply with subpart 1 of the Court' [sic] standing order concerning re-arraignment.\" DE 223-2, at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, Gupta offered a new plea \"removing the third level of acceptance for a timely plea\" and setting an April 28 deadline. DE 185, at 1. On May 2, 2016, Stephens relayed Hamilton's desire to plea and stated, \"when I spoke with him last, he asked me to 'do better', but if not to plead as offered. I would ask that you insert a provision that doesn't remove the third point, but holds the withdrawal of same to sentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Gupta noted that the most-recent plea expired\n   on April 28, advised that the third point would not be offered, but acknowledged the Government's willingness to nonetheless honor the April 26 offer, which omitted the third point.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On May 3, Stephens responded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   I will advise mr Hamilton of your position. However, It seems that this position opens me up for post-sentencing litigation because it would appear that denial of the third point is my responsibility. I share emails with the client when they are relevant to settlement negotiations. He will thus see your calendar of our contacts and could draw a conclusion that not complying with your scheduling deadlines is the sole cause of the loss of the 3rd point. As a practice matter, that is a very troubling issue with me. I regret sincerely the way in which this matter has developed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    I continue to believe that the court's scheduling order, which I have diligently compiled with, is the standard by which the requisites for the third point is to be judged upon.\n   </strong>\n   As this has, in fact been complied with, I believe that exclusion of the third point is contrary to the Court's stated procedures and thus, feel compelled pursuant to my ethical and professional obligations to my client, to argue for the third point during the plea, in my sentencing memorandum, and at the allocution during the sentencing hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   DE 234, at 1 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Hamilton subsequently executed a plea agreement expressly conceding that the Government would \"not move to decrease the offense level for timely notice of intent to plead guilty that avoided trial preparation and inefficient resource allocation.\" DE 188, at \u00b6 9(g). Nonetheless, and consistent with his stated intentions, Stephens argued for the third point at sentencing. DE 200, at 4-12. He repeated his oft-stated opinion that it was inappropriate \"that the United States would put me under an artificial deadline to enter the plea\" and that the Government setting a hard deadline was new practice in his experience.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 9-10. Stephens also reiterated his belief that Judge Thapar's standard scheduling order controlled his duties with regard to \u00a7 3E1.1(b) timeliness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Finally, after Judge Thapar advised him that the rules and guidelines give the Government discretion regarding such deadlines, Stephens acknowledged the possibility that he could have been at fault for Hamilton losing the third point by \"not ... spending earlier time with him[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Ultimately, Judge Thapar overruled Stephens's objection and, finding no allegation of arbitrariness or unconstitutional motive,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   declined to override the Government's third-point discretion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. The preceding facts are essentially undisputed. However, the stories diverge on the extent and content of pre-April 11 discussions between Hamilton and Stephens. The Court summarizes their respective versions, based on the December 15, 2017, evidentiary hearing (DE 230).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Hamilton's Version\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Per Hamilton, the first time Stephens showed him a plea agreement was at a meeting one day before the April 11th deadline. DE 237, at 29 (Evidentiary Hearing Transcript). At that April 11th meeting, Stephens reportedly told him there was a deadline, but told him \"he didn't agree with the deadline\" and that he would be back on Wednesday (April 13th) to get an answer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. Importantly, Hamilton claimed Stephens never discussed the\n   specific consequences of the deadline nor the potential loss of the third point.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Hamilton definitively stated that if he had known the deadline-expiration repercussions, he would have accepted the offer on April 10th, or called Stephens pre-expiration to accept.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32, 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On cross, Hamilton further explained that Stephens disagreed with Gupta's \"self-imposed deadline\" because the District Court said it wanted a plea fourteen days before trial, and that, as Hamilton understood it, the deadline was simply the date when Gupta wanted an answer for his convenience.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34, 40. He testified to being unaware that missing the April 11 deadline would lose the third point for timely acceptance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Stephens's Version\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Stephens's testimony, understandably, rested largely on his case file records. Mr. Stephens is a member of the District's CJA Panel and, as he testified at the hearing, has handled hundreds of federal cases. DE 237, at 7. The Court would not expect Stephens to recall practice details of a client meeting he had eighteen months prior. Per Stephens, file notes indicate he had meetings with Hamilton on April 6, 7, 10, 17, and 21, 2016. DE 237, at 9-10. Further, Stephens's notes signaled to him that he informed Hamilton about the April 11 deadline and told him that expiration would result in loss of the third point.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (\"My notes would indicate that I did.\"). Specifically, Stephens claimed his notes show that during an April 7, 2016, meeting with Hamilton: \"I talked to him in-depth ... about what Mr. Gupta was saying and what Mr. Gupta was not saying, and I see Mr. Gupta's note-or name actually written down.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. However, Stephens also explained \"that I told Mr. Hamilton that I thought that Mr. Gupta's deadline was artificial. That I actually talked about the trial order that gave us the right for Judge Thapar to file the motion for rearraignment within two weeks of the actual trial date.\n   <em>\n    I told him I thought that trumped Mr. Gupta's deadline\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12 (emphasis added). Stephens later reiterated \"what I believed and what I told my client was that I thought we could plead up to the 14 days before the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Stephens's testimony hinged on his notes, but he was unwavering in two respects: (a) that he told Hamilton about the lost point issue; and (b) that he called the deadline imposed by the prosecutor \"artificial\" and inconsistent with court order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    iv. Factual Resolution\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The players' stories conflict on several issues, but the Court finds it necessary to directly resolve only the divergence between the parties' disparate accounts as to deadline discussions. Other contradictions are largely irrelevant to the core claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Specific meeting dates is an example. The Court cites the visit dates identified in Stephens's September 8, 2016, CJA Voucher (Voucher).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stephens completed\n   the Voucher temporally closer to the events in question. The Voucher records three April 2016 jail visits that match all but two (April 7 &amp; 21) of the five April dates Stephens's notes reflected: April 6, 10, and 17. An April 6th visit also squares with the e-mail records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, the actual visit dates are only mildly probative of the central issues. Both Stephens and Hamilton agree there was at least one pre-deadline meeting and that Stephens conveyed the existence of the April 11th deadline to Hamilton before expiration. The actual date of any such meeting is of minimal importance save indirectly (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , on credibility) and the number of visits is only material to the extent additional pre-deadline meetings might have offered more opportunities to convey the relevant deadline repercussion. Thus, the Court finds that April 6th and 10th pre-deadline visits occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Turning to the more important question-pre-deadline discussion contents-the Court finds that Stephens did not effectively convey that expiration of the deadline would result in loss of the third point. The principal contrary evidence comes from Stephens's testimony. Several factors erode the force of that testimony. As noted above, Stephens primarily based his testimony not on recollection, but on his notes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 237, at 9 (\"My notes would indicate that I did.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (\"And the notes speak for themselves.\"). The only specific note-basis Stephens identified for the possible point loss discussion was AUSA Gupta's name in April 10th notes. DE 237, at 10-11. Further, although Stephens alleged the April 7th notes are also supportive, he failed to claim a specific note trigger-the Voucher also omits reference to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   April 7 meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court has thoroughly examined the notes and is unable to locate anything indicative of a looming lost point discussion. Stephens never convincingly explained how he could parse out the alleged meaning from notes 18+-months old. The word deadline (or any analog) does not appear in the notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Indeed, the Court has carefully scrutinized the notes. Nothing in the papers specifically mentions any deadline or \u00a7 3E1.1. Further-and the Court views this as critical-every guideline calculation reflected in the notes includes a 3-point reduction for \"A/R,\" which in context indicates acceptance of responsibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 1. Thus, notes from 4/6 and 4/10, both pre-deadline, reflect three points.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Then, in notes from 4/17, six days post-deadline, the notes state \"-3 A/R.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, in that entry, just a few lines after noting offer withdrawal, Stephens yet includes the full three points in the guideline calculation. This surely means that Stephens did not convey to Hamilton that the third point was, by that point, gone. Rather, Stephens continued to advise Hamilton that a plea would net him the third point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Ultimately, the Court finds determinative what Stephens repeatedly made clear throughout the proceedings: he believed the Gupta deadline was artificial and that Judge Thapar's scheduling order controlled.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DE 237, at 16 (\"Now, what I believed and what I told my client was that I thought we could plead up to the 14 days before the trial.\"). As the sentencing discussion above makes clear, Stephens was wrong-prosecutorial discretion concerning the third-point motion is near-absolute.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.C. Stephens thought the deadline \"artificial.\" He believed and told Hamilton that Judge Thapar's scheduling order \"trumped\" the prosecutor's deadline. DE 237, at 12. On May 3, he stated: \"I continue to believe that the court's scheduling order ... is the standard by which the requisites for the third point is to be judged[.]\" DE 234, at 1. Before the sentencing, Stephens argued that compliance with the court's deadline still would be \"\n   <em>\n    timely\n   </em>\n   \" acceptance. DE 182, at 4 (emphasis in original). The Court finds it implausible that Stephens carefully advised Hamilton that he was losing the third point as of 4/11 when Stephens himself flatly did not believe that to be true or accurate. The notes from 4/17 starkly show that Stephens continued to count on Hamilton receiving the additional level reduction, even after the offer lapse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court finds that Stephens did not convey to Hamilton that the 4/11 expiration would eliminate Hamilton's access to the \u00a7 3E1.1(b) third level. Either Stephens utterly failed to address the third point, or Stephens cited the deadline, but only in a way that emptied the discussion of any real force or vitality. If Hamilton's trained and expert counsel told him the deadline was \"self-imposed,\" \"artificial,\" and \"trumped\" by Judge Thapar's scheduling order-and that all did happen-he did not meaningfully convey the gravity of a decision to let the 4/11 date pass without plea acceptance. Hamilton behaved accordingly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 237, at 46 (\"[W]hen [Stephens] said self-imposed, I took it as Mr. Gupta wanted to know on Monday - I mean I thought ... two lawyers, they do this a lot ... I didn't think that it would be withdrawn.\"). Hamilton thought any deadline was non-binding, for Gupta's convenience, and without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In sum, the record preponderantly shows: that Stephens did not effectively explain to Hamilton that if he failed to accept the third-point inclusive offer before the April 11 deadline his sentencing prospects would be irreparably damaged; he, relatedly, affirmatively misadvised Hamilton by telling him the plea deadline was artificial and trumped by Judge Thapar's scheduling order deadline. Having so found, the Court examines Stephens's performance against\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   dictates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   Strickland\n   <em>\n    Compliance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Bearing in mind the deference due to counsel, the Court nonetheless finds that Stephens's advice fell below \"prevailing professional norms\" under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. at 2064-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Government, notably, does not argue otherwise. DE 218, at 2-4. \"Though the standard for counsel's performance is not determined solely by reference to codified standards of professional practice, these standards can be important guides.\"\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   , 132 S.Ct. at 1408. In the context of plea discussions, the ABA standards provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (b) Once discussions with the prosecutor begin, defense counsel should keep the accused advised of relevant developments.

The record shows that Stephens failed to inform Hamilton of this looming consequence. This lapse falls outside the objective bounds of reasonable professional practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Padilla v. Kentucky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1482,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (\"The first prong-constitutional deficiency-is necessarily linked to the practice and expectations of the legal community: 'The proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2065 ). Stephens all but acknowledged as much during Hamilton's sentencing and via e-mail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 200, at 11 (\"[T]hat's my trouble about this, because if that's my fault in not, you know, spending earlier time with him, his not getting the point is probably on me and -- and that troubles me, quite honestly.\"); DE 234 (\"It seems that this position opens me up for post-sentencing litigation because\n   <em>\n    it would appear that denial of the third point is my responsibility\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added). Gupta conveyed the deadline to Stephens as early as January 28, 2016, DE 185, at 4-7. Stephens was cavalier toward the plea schedule, deeming Gupta's approach a self-imposed outlier, subordinate to Judge Thapar's standard order and practice. Counsel did not reasonably appreciate the plain risk in this view, and he did not adequately warn Hamilton of the need for a timely response. This was not effective assistance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Hamilton depended on Stephens, as his lawyer, to accurately convey all relevant repercussions related to a possible plea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ABA Criminal Justice Standards for the Defense Function, Standard 4-6.3 (\"Defense counsel should investigate and be knowledgeable about sentencing procedures, law, and alternatives, collateral consequences and likely outcomes[.]\"). Stephens's analysis and the advice he gave Hamilton conflicted directly with the guidelines and clearly established Sixth Circuit precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 200, at 12;\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lapsins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665421\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/570/758/#p769\">\n    570 F.3d at 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he decision\n   whether to file a motion for an additional one-point reduction [is committed] to the Government's discretion.\"). The chronology here may reflect novel prosecutor practice, but Stephens should have known and communicated that a prosecutor's deadline could and would control the prosecutor's own decision of whether to file the requisite third level motion under \u00a7 3E1.1(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that Stephens ineffectively assisted Hamilton during plea negotiations. His deadline management, by omission and commission, was \"fundamentally at odds with the critical obligation of counsel to advise the client of the advantages and disadvantages of a plea agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. at 1484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted). As to the third point loss and the plea deadline lapse, Stephens, to the prosecutor, \"apologize[d] for [his] tardiness\" (DE 223-2, at 2) and later starkly conceded, \"denial of the third point is my responsibility.\" DE 234, at 1. The Court's placement of fault simply reflects the full record and aligns with the contemporaneous view of defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Prejudice\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Hamilton also established a reasonable probability that his ultimate sentence would have been more favorable if he were assisted effectively. The Government's principal contention is that Defendant would not have accepted the offer even if Stephens told him deadline expiration would cost him the third point. DE 218, at 3-4. The record contains ample contradictory evidence. Hamilton unequivocally testifed that he would have accepted the plea before April 11 if aware of the looming third-point loss. DE 237, at 31-32. The subsequent plea on less-favorable terms corroborates Hamilton's claim. Stephens's e-mail and evidentiary hearing statements confirm that Hamilton never considered a trial and likewise augment the prejudice proof. DE 237, at 17 (\"I don't think there was ever any time that we seriously considered a trial.\"); DE 185, at 5 (March 31 e-mail to Gupta explaining Hamilton \"is most certainly not interested in a trial\"). Hamilton's sworn position is that he would have accepted the plea by April 11-he even said he would have called Stephens on the final day to tell him the decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 237, at 34. At the very next meeting (likely the 17th, but no later than the 21st, based on the chronology and records), Hamilton told him to get the prior deal if he could do no better. Def.'s Ex. 1 (Stevens notes purportedly from 4/21: \"If [possible] better deal. If no get the other one back.\"). Although Stephens did not reach out to Gupta for another several days (not until the 4/26 letter), the Court easily finds a reasonable probability that Hamilton would have accepted the 4/11 deal if well-advised. Remember, by early May, Hamilton took the identical deal, less the fateful third level point. On this record, the Court agrees that Hamilton, properly advised, would have struck the deal including the third level by 4/11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Nonetheless, the Government contends Hamilton asked Stephens to \"do better,\" and thus rejected the plea offer before expiration. The Court disagrees. First, there is no record support for Hamilton telling Stephens to simply \"do better.\" Rather, Hamilton asked Stephens to \"do better\" or, \"\n   <strong>\n    if not\n   </strong>\n   [,]\n   <strong>\n    to plead as offered\n   </strong>\n   .\" DE 185, at 1 (emphasis added). The proof also suggests the statement the Government relies on came\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   deadline expiration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[W]hen I spoke with [Hamilton] last, he asked me to 'do better', but if not to plead as offered.\"). Stephens's\n   <em>\n    May 2\n   </em>\n   , 2016, e-mail depicted Hamilton's desire for a better plea as arising from their\n   <em>\n    last\n   </em>\n   conversation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stephens testified that notes from their\n   <em>\n    last meeting\n   </em>\n   indicated Hamilton mentioned a better deal, and indeed the April 21, 2016, notes are supportive. DE 237, at 15 (\"In the last meeting, very clearly my notes reflect, and I remember it clear as day, if I can get a better deal, get a better deal.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Government appears to make two other arguments. First, and related to the offer-rejection claim, the Response suggests that Hamilton's failure to accept after being shown the plea agreement forecloses any prejudice argument. DE 218, at 2. Proverbially, the Government takes issue with the cart, but ignores the horse's deficiencies. That is, by ignoring the first\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prong, the United States fails to account for misadvice impact. The crux of Hamilton's claim is that he did not accept precisely because Stephens was ineffective. Hamilton's failure to abide by a deadline that he was unaware of or affirmatively misadvised about says little about how he would have acted with accurate lawyering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The United States also attempts to connect the knowing and voluntary status of the subsequent plea with prejudice rebuttal. True enough, Hamilton signed a plea deal that acknowledged the Government would not move for a third point. DE 140, at \u00b6 9(g). Hamilton also confirmed, at rearraignment, that he had as much time as he needed to discuss plea proposals with his counsel, and that no one promised him anything additional to get him to sign. DE 206, at 32-34. However, Hamilton also clarified that he had encountered two pleas, \"but one was pulled before I could deny it or accept it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. That Hamilton ultimately accepted a lesser plea deal is hardly evidence that he would not have accepted a more favorable deal weeks earlier, if he had known the full story. To the contrary, taking a less favorable deal, in the same time frame, tends to suggest a likelihood of taking the better deal mere days prior.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Randall v.

Thus, the record supports a reasonable probability that, but for Stephens's ineffectiveness, Hamilton would have received a lesser sentence.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glover v.

As the\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   Court said, \"for the offer was a formal one with a fixed expiration date.

This is typically the case when the charges that would have been admitted as part of the plea bargain are the same as the charges the defendant was convicted of after trial.
