The Plaintiff, Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (\"PCMA\") filed its motion for summary judgment on January 19, 2018.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Docket No. 33. The Defendants, Mylynn Tufte, Mark Hardy, Fran Gronberg, and Wayne Stenehjem, in their official capacities (collectively \"North Dakota\"), filed a response in opposition and a cross-motion for summary judgment on March 9, 2018.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Docket Nos. 38 and 39. PCMA filed a response on April 9, 2018.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Docket No. 40. North Dakota filed a reply on April 23, 2018.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Docket No. 42. With the Court's permission, PCMA filed supplemental authority on July 9, 2018.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Docket No. 44. North Dakota filed a response to PCMA's supplemental authority on July 20, 2018.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Docket No. 50. In light of recent case law, both parties also filed supplemental briefing on July 20, 2018.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Docket Nos. 48 and 49. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants, in part, each motion for summary judgment and denies, in part, each motion for summary judgment.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  <strong>\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  PCMA is a national trade association representing pharmacy benefit managers (\"PBMs\"), with its principal place of business in Washington, D.C.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Docket No. 1. PBMs are third-party health plan administrators that manage and administer prescription drug benefits on behalf of health insurance plans.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Docket No. 10-3, p. 3. PBMs negotiate prescription drug prices with drug manufacturers and pharmacies, create networks of pharmacies to fill prescriptions, and process and pay insurance claims.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Docket No. 1, p. 4. When an insured patient fills a prescription, the pharmacy generally contacts a PBM to obtain insurance coverage and copayment information.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Docket No. 39-2, p. 6. After the pharmacy fills the prescription, the PBM reimburses the pharmacy based on a rate set out in a contract between the PBM and the pharmacy.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Docket No. 1, p. 6. The PBM then bills the health insurance plan at a rate negotiated between the PBM and the health insurance plan.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Docket No. 39-2, p. 6. In sum, PBMs are intermediaries between patients' and health insurance plans' demand for prescription drugs and manufacturers' and pharmacies' supply of prescription drugs.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April 2017, North Dakota's governor, Doug Burgum, signed Senate Bills 2258 and 2301 into law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.B. 2258, 2017 Leg., 65th Sess. (ND 2017); S.B. 2301, 2017 Leg., 65th Sess. (ND 2017). The laws regulate PBMs and pharmacies. According to North Dakota, the legislation \"sought to define the rights of pharmacist in relation to [PBMs], and to regulate certain practices by PBMs.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 39-1, p. 2.

PCMA then filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on July 20, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 10. The Court held a hearing regarding PCMA's motion for preliminary injunction on August 22, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 24. On November 7, 2017, the Court denied PCMA's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 27.

PCMA specifically cites the definition's inclusion of the term \"employee benefit plan,\" which includes ERISA plans within its scope.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33-1, p. 18. The legislation provides that \"plan sponsor,\" as that term is used within each bill, has the same definition as in N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.6-01.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.B. 2258 \u00a7 1(1)(b) and S.B. 2301 \u00a7 1(1)(b);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-02.1-16.1(1)(b). That provision defines \"plan sponsor\" as \"the employer in the case of an\n   <em>\n    employee benefit plan\n   </em>\n   established or maintained by a single employer, or the employee organization in the case of a plan established or maintained by an employee organization ... or other similar group that establishes or maintains the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 19-03.6-01(5) (emphasis added). PCMA contends that because the reference to \"employee benefit plan\" encompasses ERISA covered plans, it constitutes an impermissible implicit reference to an ERISA plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33-1, p. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   PCMA's argument is without merit. The legislation uses the term \"plan sponsor\" to either allow pharmacies, or require PBMs, to disclose certain information to, among others, the sponsors of plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.B. 2258 \u00a7 1(5) (allowing pharmacies to disclose information to plan sponsors and patients regarding drug reimbursement amounts); S.B. 2301 \u00a7 1(2) (requiring PBMs to disclose the difference between amounts paid to pharmacies and amounts charged to plan sponsors for prescription drugs). However, the plans referenced in the definition of \"plan sponsors\" may or may not be subject to ERISA, and thus the law still has purpose absent ERISA applicability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201003\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 1144(a) (exempting government-sponsored plans, church-sponsored plans, workmen's compensation plans, and other types of plans from ERISA regulation and preemption). In other words, the legislation makes no distinction between ERISA and non-ERISA plans, and it applies equally to both. Thus, it does not constitute an impermissible reference to ERISA or ERISA plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In sum, PCMA's arguments regarding the scope of certain terms and definitions oversimplifies the issue. The \"reference to\" inquiry concerns the law's implications on ERISA plans-i.e., whether the law \"acts immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans ... or where the existence of ERISA plans is essential to the law's operation[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Gobeille\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602419\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/936/#p943\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation and quotation omitted). North Dakota's law does neither, and thus the Court\n   finds no impermissible reference to ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     WHETHER THE LEGISLATION HAS AN IMPERMISSIBLE CONNECTION WITH ERISA PLANS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Because the Court finds that neither bill includes a \"reference to\" ERISA, the Court continues its preemption analysis under the \"connection with\" prong. A state law has an impermissible \"connection with\" ERISA plans when it \"governs ... a central matter of plan administration\" or \"interferes with nationally uniform plan administration.\"\n   <em>\n    Gobeille\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602419\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/936/#p943\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . PCMA's arguments largely focus on PBMs' relationships with ERISA plans. PCMA asserts the legislation's imposition of requirements on PBMs necessarily affects PBMs' ability to provide services to ERISA plans. Thus, PCMA's logic continues, the legislation's limitations on PBMs have impermissible downstream effects on ERISA plans and plan administration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33-1, pp. 20-21.

PCMA argues the legislation will impose a variety of burdens and expenses upon PBMs, the imposition of which will have a downstream effect on ERISA plans. The legislation's incidental effect on plans, PCMA asserts, will result in interference with nationally uniform plan administration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33-1, pp. 20-21. The Court does not doubt that, like other state healthcare regulation, the legislation will have some effect on healthcare plans. For example, the legislation places various requirements on PBMs that may result in PBMs losing certain revenues or incurring expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , S.B. 2258 \u00a7\u00a7 1(2) and (9) (prohibiting PBMs from levying post point-of-sale fees on pharmacies and requiring disclosure of pharmacy network information to enable pharmacies to make informed contracting decisions). PBMs may attempt to recoup these lost revenues and expenses by passing costs on to plans. These increased costs could potentially affect plans' decision-making. But this effect is too tenuous to constitute interference with nationally uniform plan administration. \"[I]f ERISA were concerned with any state action-such as medical-care quality standards or hospital workplace regulations-that increased costs of providing certain benefits, and thereby potentially affected the choices made by ERISA plans, [the Court] could scarcely see the end of ERISA's pre-emptive reach, and the words 'relate to' would limit nothing.\"\n   <em>\n    Dillingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595471\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/316/#p324\">\n    519 U.S. at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595471\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/316/#p324\">\n    117 S.Ct. 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   PCMA's arguments fail to bridge the gap between the legislation and interference with plan administration-let alone nationally uniform plan administration.

But it has not articulated a change in custom or practice that the legislation requires ERISA plans to make.

North Dakota asserts none are preempted. The Court will address each contested provision in the following order: (1) provisions concerning the practice of pharmacy; (2) provisions regarding accreditation and credentialing requirements; and (3) provisions directed at perceived abusive practices and PBM self-dealing. But first the Court turns to PCMA's preliminary argument that three specific Medicare provisions generally preempt any state regulation of contracts between PBMs and pharmacies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     PCMA'S GENERAL PREEMPTION ARGUMENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   PCMA first argues 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-104, which provides beneficiary protections for prescription drug coverage, preempts any state regulation of contracts between pharmacies and Part D plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 33-1, p. 36 and 40, p. 46. PCMA specifically points to Section 1395w-104(b)(1)(A), requiring Part D plans\n   to \"permit the participation of any pharmacy that meets the terms and conditions under the plan.\" PCMA argues that because of this standard \"a Part D Sponsor need not contract with a pharmacy that does not meet those terms and conditions; if a pharmacy wishes to participate in a plan sponsor's network, it has no choice but to accept the plan's 'terms and conditions.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33-1, p. 36. Thus, PCMA contends the legislation \"interfere[s] with that standard by preventing North Dakota's pharmacies from accepting the plan's 'terms and conditions.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33-1, p. 36. First, the Court disagrees with PCMA's characterization of this standard, i.e. that it was meant to give pharmacies \"no choice but to accept the plan's 'terms and conditions.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33-1, p. 36. The standard ensures patients have ready access to pharmaceutical services-hence its title: \"Access to covered part D drugs-assuring pharmacy access-Participation of any willing pharmacy.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-104(b)(1)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517029\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/1109/\">\n    891 F.3d at 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (characterizing the standard as setting \"forth requirements with regard to Medicare recipients' access to pharmacies\"). Moreover, this standard has no bearing on the negotiation and contracting process between pharmacies and PBMs. The Court finds Section 1395w-104(b)(1)(A) does not overlap with North Dakota's regulation of contracts between pharmacies and PBMs, and thus it does not preempt the legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   PCMA similarly argues\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20423.505\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 423.505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides certain requirements for contracts between CMS and Part D plan sponsors, preempts any state regulation of contracts between pharmacies and PBMs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 33-1, p. 37 and 40, p. 46. PCMA specifically cites Section 423.505(b)(18) requiring Part D plans to agree \"to have a standard contract with reasonable and relevant terms and conditions of participation whereby any willing pharmacy may access the standard contract and participate as a network pharmacy ....\" This standard parallels 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-104, discussed directly above, to ensure Part D beneficiaries have access to pharmaceutical services. Moreover, it only applies to contracts \"between the Part D plan sponsor and CMS.\" Section 423.505(a). The Court concludes this provision does not preempt the legislation's regulation of contracts between PBMs and pharmacies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Last, PCMA argues the Medicare Part D \"non-interference clause\" preempts all state regulation of contracts between PBMs and pharmacies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 33-1, p. 38; 40, pp. 26-27; and 48, p. 11. The clause provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   In order to promote competition under this part and in carrying out this part, the Secretary -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (1) may not interfere with negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and PDP sponsors; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (2) may not require a particular formulary or institute a price structure for the reimbursement of covered part D drugs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-111(i). By its plain terms, the clause prohibits the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services from interfering in certain areas. However, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has interpreted the clause to prohibit \"both federal\n   <em>\n    and state\n   </em>\n   interference in negotiations between Part D sponsors and pharmacies ....\"\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517029\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/1109/\">\n    891 F.3d at 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). PCMA argues \"every challenged provision of [the legislation] interferes in contract negotiations between plan sponsors/PBMs and pharmacies by mandating or proscribing outcomes on issues that would otherwise be bargained for.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33-1, p. 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   PCMA's argument-that the non-interference clause creates a type of general field preemption of state regulation on PBM contracts-is unpersuasive. First,\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   did not decide the preliminary issue of whether the non-interference clause even applies to PBM-related regulation. By its plain terms, the clause prohibits interference between \"drug manufactures and pharmacies and PDP sponsors.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w111(i)(1). And thus\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   did not hold, as PCMA suggests, that any and all state regulation of contract negotiations between pharmacies and PBMs is preempted by Medicare Part D. Rather than finding the non-interference clause creates a type of field preemption,\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   explained: \"The federal scheme preempts a state law when (1) Congress or [CMS] has established 'standards' in the area regulated by the state law; and (2) the state law acts 'with respect to' those standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   , at 1113.\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   then went on to examine specific Medicare Part D standards and concluded the state laws at issue were preempted because they acted \"with respect to\" the Part D Standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   , at 1113-1114 (finding Arkansas laws regulating the price of retail drugs and allowing pharmacies to decline to dispense drugs were preempted by the Medicare Negotiated Price Standard and the Medicare Pharmacy Access Standard). Given the Eighth Circuit's recent analysis in\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   , the Court concludes Section 1395w111(i) does not bar states from all regulation of PBM contracts. Accordingly, as instructed by\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   , the Court will examine each provision of the legislation to determine (1) if Congress or CMS has established a standard in the area regulated; and (2) whether the state regulation acts with respect to those standards.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517029\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/1109/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517029\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/1109/\">\n    at 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court concludes all but one provision survive Medicare Part D analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE PRACTICE OF PHARMACY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The legislation contains various provisions regulating the practice of pharmacy. It contains provisions: (1) allowing pharmacies to dispense any drug they are licensed to dispense; (2) allowing pharmacies to disclose pricing information to patients; and (3) allowing pharmacies to mail or deliver drugs to patients. As detailed below, the Court finds these provisions, which regulate the practice of pharmacy in North Dakota, are not preempted by Medicare Part D. They do not act with respect to a Medicare standard, and even if they did, they regulate the practice of medicine and thus fall within the scope of the Medicare savings clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to authorize any Federal officer or employee to exercise any supervision or control over the practice of medicine or the manner in which medical services are provided\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    i.\n    <em>\n     PHARMACIES MAY DISPENSE ANY DRUG ALLOWED BY THEIR LICENSE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The legislation provides: \"A licensed pharmacy or pharmacist may dispense any and all drugs allowed under that license.\" S.B. 2301 \u00a7 1(5). PCMA suggests this provision acts with respect to CMS's standards concerning formularies. PCMA argues: \"[T]his provision would bar the use of formularies. A formulary is a list of drugs that a Part D plan covers. CMS extensively regulates the development and use of formularies.... Allowing North Dakota to ban formularies deliberately undermines CMS's contemplation, regulation, and approval of them.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33-1, p. 47. The Court disagrees. This provision allows pharmacies to dispense drugs in a manner consistent with their licenses. It has no bearing on whether a drug may\n   be listed on a formulary, and it contains no language banning formularies or compelling Part D plans to cover any drugs. The Court finds PCMA's arguments unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     PHARMACY DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The legislation contains two provisions regarding pharmacy disclosure obligations. It first contains a provision concerning the disclosure of information regarding drug efficiency and cost:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   A pharmacy or pharmacist may provide relevant information to a patient if the patient is acquiring prescription drugs. This information may include the cost and clinical efficacy of a more affordable alternative drug if one is available. Gag orders of such a nature placed on a pharmacy or pharmacist are prohibited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   S.B. 2258 \u00a7 1(7). The legislation also contains a provision allowing pharmacies to disclose reimbursement amounts they receive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   A pharmacy or pharmacist may disclose to the plan sponsor or to the patient information regarding the adjudicated reimbursement paid to the pharmacy which is compliant under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   S.B. 2258 \u00a7 1(5). In support of preemption, PCMA asserts CMS has developed standards concerning what information must be disclosed to plan beneficiaries. PCMA cites to various provisions identifying plan sponsors' disclosure obligations to beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 40, p. 53;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-104(a)(1) and (a)(2) (setting forth annual disclosure obligations plan sponsors must provide to plan enrollees); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-104(k) (plan sponsors must ensure pharmacies inform plan enrollees of \"any differential between the price of the drug to the enrollee and the price of the lowest priced generic covered part D drug under the plan\"). However, North Dakota's law does not speak to\n   <em>\n    plan sponsor\n   </em>\n   disclosure obligations. Rather, it sets forth disclosure obligations for\n   <em>\n    pharmacies.\n   </em>\n   Thus, it does not overlap with the standards PCMA cites. Moreover, it falls squarely within the savings clause for regulations concerning the manner in which medical services are provided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.\n    <em>\n     DRUG DELIVERY SERVICES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The legislation also authorizes pharmacies to mail or deliver drugs to patients: \"A pharmacy or pharmacist may mail or deliver drugs to a patient as an ancillary service of a pharmacy.\" S.B. 2258 \u00a7 1(8). A related provision allows pharmacies to charge shipping and handling fees: \"A pharmacy benefits manager or third-party payer may not prohibit a pharmacist or pharmacy from charging a shipping and handling fee to a patient requesting a prescription be mailed or delivered.\" S.B. 2258 \u00a7 1(9). In support of preemption, PCMA cites standards that \"contemplate the existence of mail-order pharmacies that are distinct from retail pharmacies.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33-1, p. 44;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20423.120\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 423.120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (authorizing Part D sponsors to charge beneficiaries higher cost-sharing amounts for using retail pharmacies instead of mail-order pharmacies). PCMA also cites the definition of \"dispensing fees,\" which includes \"pharmacy costs associated with ensuring that possession of the appropriate covered Part D drug is transferred to a Part D enrollee.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20423.100\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 423.100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the standards PCMA relies on might \"contemplate the existence\" of mail order pharmacies, they do not regulate mail order pharmacy services like North Dakota's law. Thus, there is no overlap between the legislation and the federal standards. And even if there was, the Court finds the legislation's provisions regarding drug delivery services constitutes a regulation concerning the manner\n   in which medical services are provided under the Medicare savings clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     PROVISIONS REGARDING PHARMACY ACCREDITATION AND CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The legislation contains provisions concerning two areas of pharmacy accreditation and credentialing. First, it contains provisions prohibiting PBMs from imposing accreditation requirements that are stricter than state and federal law. Second, the legislation requires PBMs to utilize benchmarks set by an unbiased, nationally-recognized entity when evaluating pharmacy performance, and it regulates the fees PBMs may levy on pharmacies due to deficient performance. As detailed below, the Court finds none of these provisions overlap with a CMS standard. Further, to the extent any did, they would fall under the Medicare preemption provision's exception for state laws concerning licensing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-26(b)(3) (Medicare standards supersede any state law or regulation \"other than State licensing laws\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-112(g) (applying Part C's preemption provision to Part D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    i.\n    <em>\n     IMPOSITION OF ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   With respect to PBMs' imposition of accreditation requirements on pharmacies, the legislation provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   A pharmacy benefits manager or third-party payer may not require pharmacy accreditation standards or recertification requirements inconsistent with, more stringent than, or in addition to federal and state requirements for licensure as a pharmacy in this state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   S.B. 2258 \u00a7 1(11).

Section 1(3) of S.B. 2258 provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   3.

North Dakota's legislation sets a standard for pharmacy performance by articulating the benchmarks that may be used to measure pharmacy performance-i.e., the \"electronic quality improvement platform for plans and pharmacies\" or \"other unbiased nationally recognized entity aiding in improving pharmacy performance measures.\" S.B. 2258 \u00a7 1(3).

As articulated below, the Court finds the bulk of the law not preempted, save one provision requiring PBMs to disclose certain information to plans, which the Court finds preempted by an overlapping Medicare Part D standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    i.\n    <em>\n     REGULATION OF FEES AND CHARGES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The legislation provides the following prohibitions on post point-of-sale fees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   2.

PCMA argues CMS has enacted \"intricate standards\" concerning post point-of-sale fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 40, p. 56. PCMA points to standards that contemplate post point-of-sale fees in reconciliation calculations used to determine the amounts Part D sponsors \"actually pay\" for prescription drugs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 40, pp. 56-57;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20423.308\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 423.308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining \"direct and indirect remuneration\" to include retroactive fees). PCMA suggests North Dakota's law alters the Part D reconciliation scheme by \"banning retroactive fees.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 40, p. 57. PCMA argues the legislation \"would nullify part of the standard concerning what makes up a negotiated price and would change the calculation of payments made by CMS to plans during the reconciliation process by removing retroactive fees from the equation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 40, p. 57. The Court finds PCMA's argument unpersuasive. The legislation regulates the imposition of fees levied on pharmacies that are related to claims for prescription drugs. It does not overlap with, nor does it alter, the calculations used in the reconciliation process. PCMA has not pointed to any federal standard concerning PBMs' imposition of fees on pharmacies. The Court finds S.B. 2258's provision regulating post point-of-sale fees is not preempted by Medicare Part D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   PCMA also argues the legislation's regulation of copayments is preempted. The legislation provides the following concerning copayments:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   A pharmacy benefits manager or third-party payer may not charge a patient a copayment that exceeds the cost of the medication. If a patient pays a copayment, the dispensing provider or pharmacy shall retain the adjudicated cost and the pharmacy benefits manager or third-party payer may not redact the adjudicated cost.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   S.B. 2258 \u00a7 1(4). PCMA argues this provision overlaps with federal standards that set copayment amounts for certain drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33-1, pp. 41-42;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20423.104\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 423.104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5)(i). PCMA suggests that retainment of copayments is \"an entitlement that CMS has granted to plans.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33-1, p. 42. The Court disagrees. The standards PCMA cites may set copayment amounts, but they do not specify which entity is entitled to retain copayments as does North Dakota's law. PCMA also argues there are federal standards accounting for \"direct and indirect remuneration\" to plans after a prescription drug has been sold, which may include copayment amounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33-1, p. 42;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20423.308\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 423.308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, these standards, which account for various fees and payments, also do not mandate the allocation of certain payments to certain parties. The Court finds North Dakota's regulation of copayments is not preempted by Medicare Part D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The legislation contains two provisions concerning PBM disclosure obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The first provision requires PBMs to disclose information about PBM pharmacy networks to pharmacies. According to North Dakota, this provision was intended to help pharmacies evaluate the profitability of PBM contracts by providing pharmacies with information detailing the number of patients that would be subject to a PBM contract's reimbursement policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 39-1, p. 10. The provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Upon request, a pharmacy benefits manager or third-party payer shall provide a pharmacy or pharmacist with the processor control number, bank identification number, and group number for each pharmacy network established or administered by a pharmacy benefits manager to enable the pharmacy to make an informed contracting decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   S.B. 2258 \u00a7 1(10). The second disclosure provision obligates PBMs with an ownership interest in a pharmacy to disclose, to plan sponsors, the difference between the amount paid to a pharmacy and the amount charged to the plan sponsor. It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   If requested by a plan sponsor contracted payer, a pharmacy benefits manager or third-party payer that has an ownership interest, either directly or through an affiliate or subsidiary, in a pharmacy shall disclose to the plan sponsor contracted payer any difference between the amount paid to a pharmacy and the amount charged to the plan sponsor contracted payer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   S.B. 2301 \u00a7 1(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In support of preemption, PCMA cites various federal standards discussing PBMs' disclosure obligations to beneficiaries, CMS, and plan sponsors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 33-1, pp. 42-43;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395w-104(a)(1)-(2) (setting forth annual disclosure obligations plan sponsors must provide to plan enrollees); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395w-104(k) (plan sponsors must ensure pharmacies inform plan enrollees of \"any differential between the price of the drug to the enrollee and the price of the lowest priced generic covered part D drug under the plan\"); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320b-23 (requiring PBMs to disclose information regarding drug sales and pricing to CMS);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20423.514\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 423.514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (detailing reporting requirements for pharmacy benefits manager data to plan sponsors and CMS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   PCMA does not cite any federal standard, and the Court is not aware of any, that concerns the disclosure of information by PBMs to pharmacies. Because CMS has not promulgated standards in this area, the Court finds S.B. 2258 \u00a7 1(10), which requires the disclosure of PBM pharmacy network information to pharmacies, is not preempted by Medicare Part D. However, the Court agrees with PCMA regarding S.B. 2301's PBM disclosure obligations to plan sponsors. Federal standards specifically require PBMs to provide information to plan sponsors, including the number of prescriptions dispensed, the amount of rebates, discounts, or price concessions the PBM negotiates and passes through to the plan sponsor, and the difference between the amount the PBM pays the pharmacy and the plan sponsor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20423.514\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 423.514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320b-23. Senate Bill 2301 \u00a7 1(2), which requires certain PBMs to report to plan sponsors \"any difference between the amount paid to a pharmacy and the amount charged to the plan sponsor\" overlaps with this standard, and thus the Court finds it is preempted as applied to Medicare Part D plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.\n    <em>\n     PBM SELF DEALING\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The legislation also contains a provision aimed at potential self-dealing on the part of PBMs that own pharmacies. It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   A pharmacy benefits manager or a pharmacy benefits manager's affiliates or subsidiaries may not own or have an ownership interest in a patient assistance program and a mail order specialty pharmacy, unless the pharmacy benefit manager, affiliate, or subsidiary agrees to not participate in a transaction that benefits the pharmacy benefits manager, affiliate, or subsidiary instead of another person owed a fiduciary duty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   S.B. 2301 \u00a7 1(3).
