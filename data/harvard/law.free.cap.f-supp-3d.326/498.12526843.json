MICHELSON, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   ABG Prime Group sells beauty products on Amazon. This includes LOMA hair-care essentials. But ABG is not an authorized retailer of LOMA products. So once LOMA discovered its products on ABG's Amazon.com store, LOMA filed a series of complaints with Amazon. Twice the complaints led Amazon to partially or totally suspend ABG's selling privileges. In turn, ABG sued LOMA, seeking a declaratory judgment that it did not infringe LOMA's trademark rights. Soon after, LOMA counter-sued, alleging trademark infringement and false designation of origin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Initially, this case was entirely focused on LOMA's and ABG's trademark dispute. But after LOMA counter-sued, ABG amended its complaint to add new claims and new parties. The new parties, Demosthenes Prodromitis, All Alliance, and Total Image International, all reside in Florida (Florida Defendants). ABG says the Florida Defendants and LOMA are enmeshed in a vast, antitrust conspiracy designed to kick ABG off Amazon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In response, the Florida Defendants move to dismiss the amended complaint for-among other things-a lack of personal jurisdiction. As will be explained, the Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Gary and Adam Greenberg along with Bryan Acrich incorporated ABG Prime, a Michigan LLC, to sell products on Amazon. (PageID.148.) Amazon's platform permits third-parties-like ABG Prime-to\n   open the digital equivalent of a brick-and-mortar shop. (PageID.149.) ABG's third-party store at Amazon.com relies on Amazon's market share and fulfilment capabilities to generate an average of $10,000 in daily revenue. (PageID.149-150.) Among the products on its virtual shelves, ABG stocks LOMA hair-care essentials. (PageID.153.) ABG lawfully purchases LOMA shampoos, conditioners, and other hair-care products from a distributor only to turn around and resell the identical, unopened, and authentic product through its Amazon store. (Page.ID.153.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2017, LOMA complained to Amazon about ABG's store. According to LOMA's complaint, ABG's sale of LOMA products infringed on LOMA's trademark rights. (PageID.153.) Upon receiving the complaint, Amazon temporarily shuttered ABG's store, just as LOMA intended. (PageID.153, 156.) But Amazon policy requires a complainant complete a \"test buy\"- a controlled purchase of the allegedly infringing product to determine its authenticity-prior to claiming trademark infringement. (PageID.154.) LOMA had not completed a test buy prior to filing its complaint, so LOMA withdrew the complaint and Amazon permitted ABG to reopen. (PageID.154.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Once reopened, ABG continued to sell LOMA products. And in the months after LOMA withdrew its first complaint, LOMA completed one test buy and then another. (PageID.154-155.) And after both test buys, LOMA confirmed the products' authenticity to ABG's lawyer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   LOMA again complained to Amazon, but this time making a more general claim that ABG was stealing LOMA's intellectual property. (PageID.155.) Again Amazon closed ABG's store, but also permanently barred ABG from selling LOMA products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sometime after its second suspension, ABG came to learn that All Alliance Products was the only other third-party storefront selling authentic LOMA goods on Amazon. (PageID.151.) ABG came to suspect that this competitor conspired with LOMA to stop it from selling LOMA goods. (Page.ID.151.) All Alliance is owned by a Florida LLC registered to a Florida citizen named Theo Prodromitis, the associate of yet a third Floridian, Demosthenes Prodromitis. (PageID.151-152.) ABG found out about the Floridians after Amazon forwarded LOMA's first complaint to ABG. The complaint appeared to be written by Cimos Angelis, LOMA's lawyer. (PageID.153.) But somehow ABG discovered that Demosthenes Prodromitis actually wrote it. (PageID.153.) ABG also learned that Angelis and Prodromitis have a friendship stretching back to high school. (PageID.152.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on all of the above, ABG thinks LOMA and Demosthenes Prodromitis have conspired to expel ABG from Amazon. (PageID.152, 165.) According to ABG, LOMA gives All Alliance the exclusive right to sell LOMA products on Amazon. (PageID.152, 164.) In return, All Alliance polices the digital marketplace for unauthorized third-party retailers like ABG. (PageID.164.) All Alliance reports offenders to Angelis, and either Angelis or Prodromitis-as-Angelis complain to Amazon. (PageID.165.) Complaining to Amazon results in the third-party store temporarily losing its selling privileges. (PageID.166.) And the suspension of selling privileges eliminates competitors, specifically ABG. (PageID.165.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Additionally, ABG alleges LOMA's complaints were fraudulent. ABG points to the early 2017 complaint Prodromitis-as-Angelis sent to Amazon. (PageID.165.) That first complaint said ABG's sales infringed on LOMA's trademark rights. (PageID.166.) But LOMA's test buys confirmed ABG sold authentic LOMA products. (PageID.156.) So in ABG's view\n   LOMA had no factual basis to accuse it of infringing, knew that the accusation would or could result in ABG's suspension, and yet made the accusation anyway. (PageID.156-57, 165.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Accordingly, ABG's amended complaint added as defendants Demosthenes Prodromitis, All Alliance, and Total Image International LLC, all Florida residents. And the complaint alleges the Florida Defendants participated in a fraud and a conspiracy to violate antitrust laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response, the Florida defendants move to dismiss the amended complaint for-among other things-want of personal jurisdiction in Michigan. (R. 34, 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"In deciding a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, the district court may rely upon the affidavits alone; it may permit discovery in aid of deciding the motion; or it may conduct an evidentiary hearing to resolve any apparent factual questions.\"\n   <em>\n    MAG IAS Holdings, Inc. v.

Here, the parties have submitted affidavits and have not asked for discovery or an evidentiary hearing.

And at this stage, as ABG does not assert general jurisdiction, ABG need only make a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that this Court may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over each claim in this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MAG IAS Holdings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277152\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/894/#p899\">\n    854 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   899 ;\n   <em>\n    Schneider v.

Instead, the Florida Defendants argue only that requiring them to defend this suit in Michigan runs afoul of due process. (PageID.371,409-410.)

First, the Florida Defendants waived any personal jurisdiction defense when their local counsel filed a general appearance prior to contesting personal jurisdiction. Failing that, ABG says the Florida Defendants' participated in a conspiracy, punctuated with fraudulent conduct, aimed at shutting an online store run by a Michigan company. ABG says knocking the Michigan store out of the market damaged competition in the online marketplace so much so that Michigan bore the brunt of the conspiracy's effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court takes these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ABG insists that when the Florida Defendants' local counsel filed his one-sentence appearance, he explicitly waived any personal-jurisdiction defense. And this appearance led ABG to form a reasonable expectation that the Florida Defendants intended to defend the suit on its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Back in the day, a defendant's \"general appearance\" waived a personal-jurisdiction defense.\n   <em>\n    Dahlgren v.

As waiver was-and still is-an intentional relinquishment of a known right, whether a defendant made a general appearance was a case-specific question of a defendant's intent, gleaned by way of a defendant's conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3943536\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/263/841/#p846\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The question of general appearance is one of intent, actual or implied, and where the whole purpose of defendant's application to the court is to set aside an order because it has been made without personal jurisdiction over him, the conduct which will make the motion unavailing and destory [sic] its basis must be clear and unequivocal.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grable v.

If a defendant wished to challenge personal jurisdiction, they still had to appear, but they also had to make clear that their \"appearance\" was purely a legal apparition, solely to challenge the court's personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5706201\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/282/185/#p196\">\n    282 F. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   196 ;\n   <em>\n    Dahlgren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3943536\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/263/841/#p846\">\n    263 F. at 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure changed all that. Most importantly, conduct giving rise to a general appearance no longer waived a personal-jurisdiction defense.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Orange TheatreCorp.\n   </em>\n   , 139 F.2d at 874 (\"Rule 12 permits a defendant to raise a jurisdictional defense even though his voluntary appearance has already called into existence the potential power of the court to adjudicate the merits of his controversy.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Republic International Corp. v.

So\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   places\n   <em>\n    Gerber\n   </em>\n   squarely on its foundation: a case-specific analysis of a defendant's conduct.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5714675\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/514/#p520\">\n    649 F.3d at 520-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Moore, J., concurring) (\"[\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    n light of the facts of this case,\n   </em>\n   a formalistic one sentence notice of appearance as counsel simply cannot amount to a waiver of the right\" to challenge personal jurisdiction (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   So the Court turns to assessing \"all the relevant circumstances\" in this case. On November 13, 2017, Jordan Bolton, the Florida Defendants' local counsel, filed a one-sentence, general appearance. (R. 26.) Less than a month later, and following unsuccessful settlement discussions between counsel, the Florida Defendants moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.

So the Court did nothing at all with respect to the Florida Defendants' pending their first responsive pleading or motion. Plus, filing an appearance allowed Bolton to receive notification of docket entries by email, offering the most efficient way to stay current on the case. And as ABG's counsel conceded at oral argument, Bolton's appearance did not give rise to a reasonable expectation that the Florida Defendants' intended to defend on the merits. To the contrary, in an affidavit and at oral argument, Bolton attests that in the month between appearance and motions, he told ABG's counsel that the Florida Defendants intended to raise a personal-jurisdiction defense. (PageID.587.) At oral argument, ABG's counsel confirmed Bolton's account. In sum, as the appearance neither put the court to work nor gave ABG the impression that the Florida Defendants intended to litigate the merits, the Florida Defendants may challenge personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ABG Prime Group, Inc. v.

And the conspiracy involves acts of fraud perpetrated by a Floridian operating a Florida LLC selling products to Michiganders. Added together, the Florida Defendants' contacts with the forum are an injury to a Michigan company, an Amazon storefront selling products in Michigan, and the ripple effects of reduced competition on Amazon. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Calder v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/\">\n    465 U.S. 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/\">\n    79 L.Ed.2d 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), ABG says the Florida Defendants purposefully availed themselves of Michigan and the contacts relate to the suit, so exercising personal jurisdiction is reasonable and constitutional. (PageID.497.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court disagrees-ABG cannot satisfy the Sixth Circuit's personal-jurisdiction test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Southern Machine Co. v.

ABG alleges a fraud and conspiracy that took place entirely in Florida and Washington. Prodromitis allegedly drafted fraudulent IP complaints using an Amazon platform and LOMA submitted them to Amazon. Prodromitis was in Florida, LOMA was in Washington, and Amazon received the complaints in Washington. So the \"course and conduct\" of the fraud and conspiracy had nothing to do with Michigan.\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578282,12701990\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1115/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Michigan is only relevant to the fraud and conspiracy in so far as it injured ABG and ABG happens to be incorporated here.

(\"[O]ur minimum contacts analysis looks to the defendant's contacts with the forum State itself, not the defendant's contacts with persons who reside there.\") (internal quotations omitted). Outside of ABG's injury, the Florida defendants have\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   contact with Michigan. Only All Alliance sells any product here, something less than 2% of sales, and only by operation of an Amazon store open for business across the web. (PageID.368.) As those sales have nothing to do with ABG's claims, any purposeful availment is ultimately unrelated to the suit and so not a basis for personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Southern Machine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2135115\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/401/374/#p381\">\n    401 F.2d at 381-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, neither Total Image nor Prodromitis have sold anything in Michigan since 2015. They do not have employees or distributors in Michigan, do not have bank accounts here, have never traveled here, and do not own any Michigan real estate. (PageID.405-406.) Ultimately, the Florida defendants' only connection to Michigan is their relationship to ABG as a competitor, and that is not enough to exercise jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walden,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578282,12701990\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1115/\">\n     134 S.Ct.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578282,12701990\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1115/\">\n    at 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] defendant's relationship with a plaintiff or third party, standing alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Resisting this conclusion, ABG argues that the Florida Defendants had Michigan as its intended target all along.

Nor do the effects of ABG's injury ripple across the Great Lake State. The intended target of the fraud and conspiracy was Amazon's digital marketplace, not Michigan. So the Florida Defendants do not have sufficient contacts with Michigan to justify haling them into court here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS the Florida Defendants' motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The Florida Defendants cite Sixth Circuit case law holding that Michigan's long-arm statute extends only as far as the due process clause's reach. (PageID.371, 409.) But the Michigan Supreme Court holds that the long-arm statute for individuals requires a two-part analysis, and the due process clause only factors into the second.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Green v.
