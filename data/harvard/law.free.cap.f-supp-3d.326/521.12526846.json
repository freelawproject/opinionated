(\"BesTop\") infringes Webasto's\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%209%2C346%2C342\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 9,346,342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '342 Patent\"), entitled \"Vehicle Roof and Roof Opening Mechanism.\" BesTop asserts that the claims of the '342 Patent were disclosed in prior art and are therefore unpatentable. BesTop has filed its First Amended Counterclaim, adding a claim of inequitable conduct and an affirmative defense of unclean hands based on that same alleged inequitable conduct. Webasto now moves to dismiss the inequitable conduct claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), and to strike the unclean hands affirmative defense pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). The Court concludes that a hearing is not necessary to resolve the issues raised in Webasto's motion and will determine the matter on the parties' written submissions. E.D. Mich.

(Compl. \u00b6 10-11.) Webasto alleges that the Webasto roof opening mechanism provides an innovative and effective way to cover and selectively uncover a roof opening. (Compl. \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Webasto alleges that BesTop manufactures a roof opening mechanism under the name \"Sunrider For Hardtop\" (\"Sunrider\") that incorporates Webasto's patented roof opening mechanism and infringes one or more claims of the '342 Patent, either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents. Webasto alleges that representatives of BesTop were present at the 2015 Moab, Utah Jeep event and that, at that time, BesTop did not offer a roof opening mechanism similar to or in-line with its current Sunrider. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Webasto alleges that BesTop's Sunrider infringes at least claims 1 and 6 of the '342 Patent. (Compl. \u00b6 25.)

A, United States Patent No. 9,346,342, claim 6, PgID 38.) Webasto alleges that BesTop's Sunrider mechanism satisfies all of the limitations of claim 6 of the '342 Patent.

Webasto alleges that BesTop's infringement has caused and continues to cause damage to Webasto and\n   that Webasto is entitled to recover damages at trial, including treble damages, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20284\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and attorneys' fees pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20285\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Webasto now moves for partial dismissal of BesTop's First Amended Counterclaim, specifically for dismissal of BesTop's Inequitable Conduct Counterclaim (Count III), and moves to strike BesTop's Seventh Affirmative Defense. For the reasons that follow the Court GRANTS the motion, DISMISSES Count III of BesTop's First Amended Counterclaim, and STRIKES BesTop's Seventh Affirmative Defense (Unclean Hands), which expressly incorporates Count III of its Counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The question presented in Webasto's motion is whether BesTop has pleaded inequitable conduct with the specificity required by Rule 9(b) and whether the allegations of Count III state a plausible claim of inequitable conduct under Rule 12(b)(6). The Federal Circuit has taken aim at what it has labeled a gross misuse and overuse of the inequitable conduct claim in patent actions, stemming in large part from the Federal Circuit's own relaxation of the standards for a showing of the intent and materiality elements of the claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   This court embraced [ ] reduced standards for intent and materiality to foster full disclosure to the PTO. This new focus on encouraging disclosure has had numerous unforeseen and unintended consequences. Most prominently, inequitable conduct has become a significant litigation strategy. A charge of inequitable conduct conveniently expands discovery into corporate practices before patent filing and disqualifies the prosecuting attorney from the patentee's litigation team. Moreover, inequitable conduct charges cast a dark cloud over the patent's validity and paint the patentee as a bad actor. Because the doctrine focuses on the moral turpitude of the patentee with ruinous consequences for the reputation of his patent attorney, it discourages settlement and deflects attention from the merits of validity and infringement issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   With these far-reaching consequences, it is no wonder that charging inequitable conduct has become a common litigation tactic. One study estimated that eighty percent of patent infringement cases included allegations of inequitable conduct. Inequitable conduct has been overplayed, is appearing in nearly every patent suit, and is cluttering up the patent\n   system. [T]he habit of charging inequitable conduct in almost every major patent case has become an absolute plague. Reputable lawyers seem to feel compelled to make the charge against other reputable lawyers on the slenderest grounds, to represent their client's interests adequately, perhaps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Therasense, Inc. v.

The Federal Circuit has enunciated the following new standard:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   To prevail on a claim of inequitable conduct, the accused infringer must prove that the patentee acted with the specific intent to deceive the PTO. A finding that the misrepresentation or omission amounts to gross negligence or negligence under a \"should have known\" standard does not satisfy this intent requirement. In a case involving nondisclosure of information, clear and convincing evidence must show that the applicant made a deliberate decision to withhold a known material reference. In other words, the accused infringer must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant knew of the reference, knew that it was material, and made a deliberate decision to withhold it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715257\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/1276/#p1288\">\n    649 F.3d at 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Webasto argues that BesTop has failed to allege a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of inequitable conduct and seeks dismissal of Count III of BesTop's First Amended Counterclaim alleging Unenforceability of the '342 Patent.

BesTop identifies the prior art as Webasto's\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C042%2C858%20B2\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,042,858 B2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Webasto's '858 Patent\").

The following factual scenarios could all fit within the allegations: [the inventor] committed the act, but [his law firm] and [the prosecution attorney] did not; [the inventor's law firm] committed the act, but [the inventor] and [the prosecution attorney] did not; neither [the inventor] nor [his law firm] committed the act, but [the prosecution attorney] did; [the inventor] and [the prosecution attorney] committed the act, but [the inventor's law firm] did not; [the inventor's law firm] and [the prosecution attorney] committed the act, but [the inventor] did not; and [the inventor] and [his law firm] committed the act, but [the prosecution attorney] did not.
