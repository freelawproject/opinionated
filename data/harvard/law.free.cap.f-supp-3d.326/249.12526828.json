Both motions are opposed (Docs. 16, 17.) Oral argument is not necessary. The Court has carefully considered the law, facts in the record, and arguments and submissions of the parties and is prepared to rule. For the following reasons, the Defendant's motion is denied and the Plaintiff's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Factual Background\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Car Accident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The motor vehicle accident made the subject of this proceeding (\"subject accident\") occurred in the early morning hours of April 23, 2016 on Interstate 10 eastbound near the Atchafalaya Basin Spillway in Iberville Parish, Louisiana. On the evening of April 22, 2016, Hunter James Clark (\"Clark\") and Donovan Hinkle (\"Hinkle\") decided to take a trip to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The two (2) individuals left Fort Polk, Louisiana, driving in a 1998 Honda Accord owned by Clark. Clark was the driver of the 1998 Honda Accord and Hinkle sat as the front-seated passenger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The subject accident involved a 2007 Chevrolet Silverado, operated by James Owen Merritt (\"Merritt\"), colliding with the stopped 1998 Honda Accord, and a stopped 1997 Acura RL, owned by Frank Cornelius Stewart (\"Stewart\"). The 1998 Honda Accord was insured by defendant, USAA General Indemnity Company (\"USAA\"), pursuant to USAA policy number 03899 82 74G 7101 5 (\"the policy\"), providing for automobile liability coverage and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage with limits of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident, and personal injury protection coverage with a limit of $5,000 per person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sometime before the subject accident, Clark, as driver, and Donovan Hinkle (\"Hinkle\"), as front-seated passenger, noticed a disabled Acura on the shoulder of Interstate 10 eastbound. Clark pulled his Accord to the side of the road to lend assistance to Stewart, who advised of his need for gasoline and a battery \"jumpstart.\" Clark, Hinkle, and Stewart then travelled together to the Tiger Truck Stop. Stewart purchased a gas container and gasoline. Clark, Hinkle, and Stewart proceeded back to the location of Stewart's disabled Acura.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Upon returning to the disabled Acura, Clark maneuvered his Accord onto the shoulder with the front of his vehicle facing westbound and pointed toward front of Stewart's Acura, such that the disabled Acura could be jumpstarted. Clark placed\n   the Accord in park and all three persons (Clark, Hinkle, and Stewart) exited the vehicle. All three persons proceeded with the process of filling the disabled Acura with gasoline and affixing jumper cables to the batteries of both the disabled Acura and the Accord. Because the Acura did not have a device to hold its hood upright, Stewart held the hood up while the jumper cables were attached by Clark and Hinkle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After affixing the jumper cables, Hinkle entered and sat in the front driver's seat of the disabled Acura, turning the vehicle keys in the ignition to attempt to start the Acura. As Hinkle was seated inside the disabled Acura, Clark was seated in the front driver's seat of his Accord, revving the engine to assist in charging the disabled Acura's battery. The three persons (Clark, Hinkle, and Stewart) repeated their respective tasks for some time, unsuccessfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   If the attempt to jumpstart the Acura had been successful, Hinkle and Clark intended to proceed on their drive to Baton Rouge in Clark's vehicle, with Hinkle as the front seated passenger and Clark as the driver. While Clark was seated in the driver's seat of his Accord, and while Stewart was holding upright the hood of the Acura, and while Hinkle was seated in the driver's seat of the disabled Acura, a Chevrolet Silverado operated by Merritt on Interstate 10 eastbound collided with the disabled Acura and the Accord.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the time of the collision, Hinkle was not in physical contact with the Accord. At the time of the collision, Hinkle was seated in the driver's seat of the disabled Acura. After the collision, Hinkle remained inside the disabled Acura until such time as Clark was able to extract Hinkle from the vehicle. Clark and Hinkle are not related by blood, marriage, or adoption. Hinkle is not the named insured or an operator listed under the USAA policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 12)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Defendant's Original Brief (Doc. 12-2)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant argues that from the plain language of the policy, the plaintiff cannot be found to have \"occupied\" the insured Accord. According to Defendant, Plaintiff was not \"in, on, getting into or out of\" the Accord (a) because he was physically \"in\" or inside another vehicle; (b) because Plaintiff would have had to get out of the other car in order to \"get into\" the insured vehicle; and (c) because Plaintiff would have to get out of the car he was in, then into the insured Accord, then out of it to be \"getting out of\" the Accord. Defendant cites to\n   <em>\n    Landry v. Allstate Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-220,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203528572\">\n    2010 WL 3528572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (La. App. 1 Cir. 2010), which explained that the \"general, ordinary, plain and popular meaning\" of the policy controlled. Thus, Defendant argues that Hinkle's actions in conjunction with the plain language of the policy show that Hinkle was not \"in, on, getting into, or out of\" the insured Accord. Defendant acknowledges that other courts give the phrases \"alighting from\" or \"upon\" a broad interpretation, but Defendant says that these phrases are not present in the USAA policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Plaintiff's Opposition (Doc. 16)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff argues Hinkle did not need to be in physical contact with the insured vehicle at the time of the accident because he had a \"relationship\" to it such that he was \"in, on, getting into or out of\" it within the meaning of Louisiana jurisprudence and law. (Doc. 16 at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Girley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9808897,3265276\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/la/260/223/\">\n    260 La. 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9808897,3265276\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/la/260/223/\">\n    255 So.2d 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 751 (1971).) Plaintiff cites to\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   because both in that case and the present case, the plaintiffs' use of the insured car to jumpstart the disabled car created a relationship between them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff also cites to other cases to support his position. Plaintiff points to\n   <em>\n    Westerfield v. LaFleur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7586898\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/493/600/#p601\">\n    493 So.2d 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 601 (La. 1986), arguing that, in that case, the court considered whether or not the person was engaged in activities related to the use of the insured vehicle and decided the plaintiff covered despite the fact that he was not touching the bus in question. Furthermore, plaintiff draws attention to\n   <em>\n    White v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7538810\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/563/1316/#p1317\">\n    563 So.2d 1316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1317 (La. App. 3 Cir. 1990), contending that, in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , the court held the plaintiff was covered since his physical departure from the insured car was solely for purposes of performing an act directly related to the car, and the plaintiff never abandoned his relationship with the insured car. Although Plaintiff was on his way back to the car, the\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   court did not impose a requirement the plaintiff must be moving toward the car.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7538810\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/563/1316/#p1317\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7538810\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/563/1316/#p1317\">\n    at 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, here, Hinkle maintains that he was involved in acts directly related to the insured car since he was using its energy for a jumpstart. Plaintiff also states that he had a relationship to the car since he was a passenger before the accident and intended to continue as a passenger after they successfully jumped the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff challenges Defendant's citation to\n   <em>\n    Landry\n   </em>\n   , arguing that the\n   <em>\n    Landry\n   </em>\n   court determined plaintiff was not \"occupying\" because his physical and intentional relationship was attenuated as a result of being at least 300 feet away.\n   <em>\n    Landry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203528572\">\n    2010 WL 3528572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Hinkle, however, was only a few feet away, and plaintiff argues that USAA failed to show Hinkle did not have a clear relationship to the insured Accord or that he was required to be in physical contact with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 14)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Plaintiff's Original Brief (Doc. 14-2)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff moves for partial summary judgment on the issue of insurance coverage. Plaintiff contends that the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   case alone should be dispositive since that plaintiff was also using battery power to jumpstart another car.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9808897,3265276\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/la/260/223/\">\n    255 So.2d at 750-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff contends that the Louisiana Supreme Court found the plaintiff was \"upon\" the car despite not touching the insured car at the time of the accident and that he never abandoned his status of occupant of the insured vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 751. According to Hinkle, since he was also jumpstarting a vehicle, he should be covered under USAA's UM policy. Plaintiff also argues that he never abandoned his status of occupant since he intended to continue as a passenger to Baton Rouge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Furthermore, Plaintiff notes that\n   <em>\n    Westerfield's\n   </em>\n   relationship test was applied to\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   where the court found that no physical contact is necessary and that the plaintiff's physical departure was solely to perform an act directly related to the car.\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7538810\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/563/1316/#p1317\">\n    563 So.2d at 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff also argues that he similarly only departed the insured Accord to jump the disabled car, both of which cars were physically linked through the jumper cables. Additionally, Plaintiff maintains that he was only temporarily in the disabled vehicle and never intended to occupy it as he intended to continue to Baton Rouge in the insured vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Defendant's Opposition (Doc. 17)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant responds that not all \"occupying\" clauses are identical, and no broad test can apply to all insurance contracts for UM coverage. However, Defendant notes that Louisiana law has held that \"in, on, getting into or out of\" is clear and unambiguous language that should not be expanded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valentine v.

Insurance policies are contracts in which ordinary contract principles of the Louisiana Civil Code apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11920961,11920913\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/691/665/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11920961,11920913\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/691/665/\">\n    at 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, when the words of an insurance contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences, courts must enforce the contract as written.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11920961,11920913\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/691/665/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Moreover, the Defendant cites to\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , maintaining that both cases determined that the \"occupying\" clause that stated \"in, upon, getting in, on, out or off\" was not susceptible to more than one meaning and was clear and unambiguous.\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11920961,11920913\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/691/665/\">\n    691 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   671 ;\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.

App. 4 Cir. 1993). Defendant further argues that\n   <em>\n    Westerfield's\n   </em>\n   language was more expansive and different, and other courts have followed\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   to abandon\n   <em>\n    Westerfield\n   </em>\n   's relationship test when the language of the \"occupying\" clause was clear and unambiguous.

Additionally, Defendant also notes that\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   are more recent cases that focus on the general and common meaning of the language of the policy when it is clear and unambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, Defendant contends that, since insurance policies are not to be interpreted in an unreasonable or strained manner that would enlarge or restrict what is reasonably contemplated by the terms of the policy or so as to achieve an absurd conclusion, the plain language of USAA's policy should apply. (Doc. 17 at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Magnon v.

Furthermore, to rebut Plaintiff's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the Defendant argues that in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the term \"upon\" was the only language to have been deemed ambiguous and required liberal interpretation, but the term \"upon\" does not appear in the present USAA policy. Defendant avers that\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   cannot solely be dispositive, as Plaintiff argues, because\n   <em>\n    Smith's\n   </em>\n   plaintiff was moving toward the vehicle, so the only factual similarity between that case and the present one is that the plaintiffs were both trying to jumpstart a vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Summary of Ruling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The crux of this decision lies in the definition, interpretation, and application of the term \"occupying\" a vehicle under USAA's UM policy. Again, this policy covers anyone \"occupying\" the vehicle, which the policy defines as \"in, on, getting into or out of\" the vehicle. (Doc. 12-5 at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In short, Plaintiff has the better position. While there is no definitive Louisiana Supreme Court case on point interpreting a policy with the precise language at issue, the Court's\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   guess, based on the jurisprudence discussed below, is that the phrase \"getting into or out of\" is ambiguous and that the\n   <em>\n    Westerfield\n   </em>\n   relationship test applies. Applying that test to the undisputed facts, and construing the ambiguous policy against the insurer (as the Court must do), the Court finds that the USAA policy provides coverage to Plaintiff. Consequently, Defendant's motion for summary judgment should be denied, and Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Interpretation of \"Occupying\" in UM Policies Under Louisiana Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Louisiana jurisprudence concerning the interpretation of \"occupying\" in insurance policies involves interpreting the contract language on a case-by-case basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11920961,11920913\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/691/665/\">\n    691 So.2d at 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Each determination is highly fact and contract specific; thus, in some cases, depending on the policy language, the plaintiff may not even need to touch the insured vehicle in order to be covered, while in other cases, the court may determine that the plaintiff was too far in time and physical proximity to the vehicle to be covered under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff, a sheriff, pulled over his patrol car to jumpstart a stalled vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9808897,3265276\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/la/260/223/\">\n    255 So.2d at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After he attached the jumper cables to the disabled car and was on the way back to attach the cables to his vehicle, another car hit the stalled car and pinned the plaintiff between the stalled car and his patrol car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 750. The plaintiff's leg was also touching the insured car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 752. The insurance policy covered persons who sustained bodily injury while \"in or upon, or while entering into or alighting from\" a covered vehicle and applied to \"any other person while occupying an insured automobile.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 749.

Because the employee had previously settled for less than his employer's policy limits, the plaintiff could not seek additional recovery under his own insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11619543\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/731/457/#p458\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11619543\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/731/457/#p458\">\n    at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Hinkle \"Occupied\" the Insured Vehicle under USAA's UM Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   While it appears that a consensus as to the definition of \"occupying\" has not been reached with regard to the phrase \"getting into or out of,\" in short, the Court's\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   guess, based on the above cases, is that USAA policy provides coverage for Hinkle's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   First, contrary to Defendant's arguments, it is not clear based on the jurisprudence that\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   and its progeny should decisively determine the outcome of this case. USAA's UM policy defines \"occupying,\" as \"in, on, getting into or out of,\" a definition which is slightly different from those of the preceding cases, with the notable exception of the\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   case, wherein that court determined verbatim language was ambiguous and found coverage. Moreover, there is not a significant difference between the \"getting into or out of\" language in the USAA policy at issue and the\n   \"entering into\" language in the\n   <em>\n    Westerfield\n   </em>\n   cases where the courts found coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Second, Defendant is incorrect that defining \"occupying\" as \"in, on, getting into or out of\" is \"clear and unambiguous.\" The court in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   clearly believed that the exact same language was ambiguous. Moreover, again, the language in\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Landry\n   </em>\n   was not identical to the policy language at issue in this case. In this highly fact-specific and contract-specific area of law, these three decisions are distinguishable from the present case. Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , which are factually analogous to one another and not to this case, the plaintiffs were directing traffic with no intention to return to their vehicle at the moment the accidents occurred. Meanwhile,\n   <em>\n    Landry\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable (1) because it relied on\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   due to the fact that both cases contemplated identical UM policy language, and (2) because the court's reasoning indicated that, had it determined the contract language was ambiguous and applied the relationship test, the outcome would have been the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Third, the relevant jurisprudence indicates that the relationship test is appropriate under the facts of this case. Even in the cases Defendant cites,\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Landry\n   </em>\n   , Louisiana courts have been reluctant to abandon the\n   <em>\n    Westerfield\n   </em>\n   relationship test. In both of those cases, despite the courts' findings that the UM policy language was \"clear and unambiguous,\" they still used the relationship test factors to indicate that the ultimate result would be the same. Thus, the relationship test is appropriate in the case at bar, for this reason and because this Court has already determined that the UM policy language in this case is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Fourth, the relationship test factors indicate that Hinkle was \"occupying\" the insured vehicle at the time of his accident. To summarize, the relationship test articulated in\n   <em>\n    Westerfield\n   </em>\n   and its progeny contemplates the plaintiff's physical and intentional relationship to his vehicle, including the time, distance, and the risk in relation to the coverage.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Westerfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7586898\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/493/600/#p601\">\n    493 So.2d at 602-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Here, Hinkle was in close physical proximity to the covered vehicle, much like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Martinez.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the jumper cables physically connected the two vehicles, which is analogous to the chains connecting the two vehicles in\n   <em>\n    Martinez.\n   </em>\n   The physical distance between Hinkle and the covered vehicle could not have been as far as in some of the previously discussed cases (e.g., the distance between the officer and his vehicle in\n   <em>\n    Ashy\n   </em>\n   ), because the cars must have been in close proximity to one another to be connected via jumper cables.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Hinkle's temporal relationship with the vehicle was also not too attenuated, since he only left the insured vehicle to help Stewart jumpstart his car, while Stewart held open the hood of his own vehicle. Hinkle's intention with regard to his relationship to the covered vehicle was to return to and enter the vehicle before resuming his trip to Baton Rouge with Clark. Also, similar to the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , Hinkle was involved in acts directly related to the insured car since he was using its energy for a jumpstart. He also had a relationship to the car since he was a passenger before the accident and intended to continue as a passenger after they successfully jumpstarted the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, the risk of having one's car on the side of an interstate to assist another vehicle is one that is reasonably contemplated by the parties at the time of the insurance contract's formation. While the exact facts of this cases were potentially not those contemplated by the insurance company and the insured, it is likely that\n   the parties reasonably contemplated such situations where the car might be at risk on the shoulder of an interstate. Such circumstances could certainly include a situation where the driver and passenger of the covered vehicle were lending assistance to another driver and might not physically be inside of their car at the time of those interactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Thus, application of the\n   <em>\n    Westerfield\n   </em>\n   relationship test is dispositive in favor of Hinkle. The Court's\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   guess is that the USAA UM policy is not \"clear and unambiguous\" in light of the relevant case law. Instead, the contractual language \"getting into or out of\" is ambiguous, and the Court should apply the\n   <em>\n    Westerfield\n   </em>\n   relationship test to resolve the issue of whether Hinkle \"occupied\" the vehicle at the time of his accident. Finding that Hinkle's relationship with the covered vehicle was sufficiently close in time and space, and that the circumstances in which he was injured were those reasonably contemplated as included in the insurance policy at the time the contract formed, the Court determines that Hinkle was \"occupying\" the insured vehicle at the time of his injury. Therefore, he is covered under USAA's policy. Plaintiff is thus entitled to partial summary judgment, and Defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
