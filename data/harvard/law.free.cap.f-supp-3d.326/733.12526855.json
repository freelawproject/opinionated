Collins filed this\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   excessive force action, alleging that the attack was an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Because there remains no genuine dispute of material fact that Collins was seized or that the seizure was unreasonable, and because the law was clearly established at the time of the attack, the Court will deny Schmidt's motion and grant Collins' motion. As a result, this case shall proceed to trial on damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of this case are largely undisputed. At dawn - about 6:25 a.m. - on Saturday, September 23, 2017, Schmidt and his K-9 partner Gabe responded to a burglary in progress in a residential neighborhood of St. Paul. (JA at 10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On arrival,\n   Schmidt met with Officers Joel Bierwerth and Brent Campbell, who had given chase to one of two suspects but had lost track of him about one block east of the house where the burglary was reported. (JA at 10-11, 19, 30.) Schmidt took Gabe out of his vehicle, put the dog on a 20-foot leash, twice gave a K-9 warning (\"St. Paul Police K-9, announce yourself right now or you will get bit; Police K-9, announce yourself, come out now or you will get bit\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and commanded the dog to track. (JA at 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   JA at 214 (\"Bierwerth Video\"), JA at 215 (\"Campbell Video\") (collectively, \"Videos\") at 38:13-38:26.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Gabe quickly took the officers a half block south and a half block east before turning into a yard. (JA at 11.) Gabe and the officers spent roughly five minutes thoroughly investigating the backyards of two residences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Videos at 38:40-43:45.) During that time, the officers learned that a suspect had been apprehended; Campbell told the other officers that he believed that the suspect was likely the one they were looking for.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Schmidt responded, \"I want to find out where he went, though. I want to find that sweatshirt.\" (Videos at 41:47-42:00.) Bierwerth agreed, and - as he had done before - told Schmidt that he was the boss. Schmidt responded, \"You don't have to keep telling me that. I know that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The officers did not discuss the other suspect, and nothing in the record indicates that they continued the search to find him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Eventually, Gabe led the officers back north, into an alleyway. (JA at 11.) Notably, Schmidt did not give K-9 warnings when the dog entered the backyard of either residence or when it went into the alley. (Videos at 38:45-38:55, 40:30-41:00, 43:35-44:00.) As the officers moved further east, \"Gabe was showing some indications that he was searching/locating human odor.\" (JA at 11.) At one point, Gabe rounded the corner of a garage, disappearing out of the officers' sight to focus his attention on what officers - guns drawn - came to realize was simply a cat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Videos at 44:15-44:30.) The officers proceeded down the alley, discussing the likely path of the suspect's flight. (Bierwerth Video at 45:00-45:12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As the officers neared a dumpster at the end of the alley, a noise is audible on their body camera recordings; Gabe's ears perked up, his head lifted, and his pace toward the dumpster visibly hastened. (Videos at 45:22-45:30.) Perked ears and head movement can be an alert that the dog has found the source of the odor. (JA at 78-97 (\"Schmidt Dep.\") at 43:6-15.) Schmidt acknowledges that Gabe's ears perked, but believes that he was alerting to the sound rather than to odor; Schmidt denies hearing the sound. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43:24-44:7.) Schmidt's then-supervisor, Sergeant John Linssen, agrees that Gabe was likely not alerting to human odor. (JA at 130-144 (\"Linssen Dep.\") at 43:10-45:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In any event, Gabe quickly proceeded down the alley and circled out of sight between a car and the far end of the dumpster. A person began to scream. (Videos at 45:30-45:35.) Although Schmidt \"could not see the person,\" he \"knew Gabe had apprehended someone.\" (JA at 11.) Campbell observed, \"Oh, there's a lady,\" and approached her, grabbing her arm and hanging on as Gabe pulled at her other arm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Videos at 45:35-45:40.) Either Bierwerth or Campbell attempted to command the dog to \"out,\" or release, which may have further aggravated the dog; Schmidt told them to \"stop yelling.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Schmidt Dep. at 35:10-36:15, 51:5-17.) Schmidt can be observed, still behind the dumpster, pulling in Gabe's leash foot-by-foot while ordering him to \"out.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Videos at 45:38-45:42; Schmidt Dep. at 48:19-49:21.) Schmidt wrote in his report that, as he rounded the corner of the dumpster, he saw that Gabe had \"apprehended\" a woman and \"knew this was not our suspect.\" (JA at 11.) Gabe continued to bite even as Schmidt continued to pull in his leash and command him to \"out.\" (Videos at 45:42-45:48.) Schmidt attempted to use Gabe's electric collar, or \"e-collar,\" to persuade him to obey, but the attempt was unsuccessful. (Schmidt Dep. at 46:2-47:10.) Schmidt eventually grabbed Gabe with both arms and pulled him off. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45:45-46:05.) In total, the dog was clamped onto the woman's left arm for roughly 30 seconds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The woman was Plaintiff Desiree Collins, who was taking out the trash. (JA at 17.) Collins, who lost her right hand in a fire years ago, was 52 at the time of the attack. (JA at 76.) After the officers stood her up, she immediately asked, \"What did I do to him?\" Bierwerth responded, \"Nothing. You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, ma'am.\" (Videos at 46:08-46:13.) As Collins waited for medical help to arrive, she asked the officers if they were looking for somebody in the neighborhood, and officers confirmed that they were. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48:30-48:38.) Collins was taken to Regions Hospital for treatment of centimeter-deep lacerations to her arm and leg. (JA at 69-72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sergeant Linssen investigated the incident. Linssen found that Schmidt's handling of Gabe and Collins after the bite was reasonable but faulted Schmidt's actions leading up to the bite, including his failure to give additional warnings, the\n   long 20-foot lead, and improperly setting the dog's e-collar to a constant setting instead of a setting that would ramp up over time. (JA at 39-40;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Linssen Dep. at 37:17-46:13.) Linssen's supervisor, Senior Commander Karsten Winger, reviewed Linssen's report and submitted the matter to Internal Affairs, recommending discipline. (JA at 37-38.) Internal Affairs and the Chief of Police agreed, and Schmidt was suspended without pay for one working day for his failure to follow department policy and training standards. (JA at 36, 43-44.) Schmidt did not appeal his discipline and stated in his deposition that he accepted it as \"essentially accurate and fair.\" (Schmidt Dep. at 20:18-22.) Schmidt specifically admits that he should have set the e-collar at a higher setting, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:2-20), and that other warnings would have been prudent, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 66:15-23). Schmidt and Gabe left the K-9 unit; Schmidt transferred to a patrol district and Gabe retired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 6:11-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

But Schmidt admits that he gave Gabe a command to track knowing that he would bite whoever he encountered, common knowledge that Schmidt's initial warnings (\"you will get bit\") make clear. As such, this matter is not genuinely in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Regarding the second inquiry, Schmidt contends that the bite was not intentionally applied to Collins because Collins was not the suspect and he did not know she was there; as such, Schmidt says, her injury is comparable to that of an innocent bystander struck by an errant bullet. Schmidt points to\n   <em>\n    Hansen v. City of St. Paul\n   </em>\n   : \"The dispositive inquiry is not whether [Officer] Pavlak intended to release [K-9] Buster, the means of seizure, but whether he intended to seize [innocent bystander] Hansen, the eventual object of the seizure.\" No. 06-1286,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204224052\">\n    2007 WL 4224052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D. Minn. Nov. 27, 2007). In\n   <em>\n    Hansen\n   </em>\n   , a police dog was chasing a suspect who ran onto a bystander's porch, and the dog mistakenly bit the bystander when she grabbed the suspect to stop him from running into her home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. As such,\n   <em>\n    Hansen\n   </em>\n   is analogous to those cases in which bystanders are struck by an errant bullet in a shootout - the suspect and the injured party were next to one another and the force aimed at the former missed and was thereby mistakenly applied to the latter. But that is not the case here: Collins was bit by mistake, but not because Gabe missed. As such,\n   <em>\n    Hansen\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable, if not inapposite.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This case is better understood as one of mistaken identity. Because the nature of a police dog is to bite the first person it encounters, the dog effectively perceives the first person it encounters to be the suspect. Schmidt knew that Gabe was likely to bite the first person he encountered during the search for the suspects, (Schmidt Dep. at 61:25-62:3); as such, Schmidt intended for Gabe to seize the first person he encountered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover,\n   the fact that Schmidt put Gabe on a 20-foot lead ensured that he could do so with ease. Other district courts confronting similar facts have reached the same conclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This conclusion is reinforced by the Eighth Circuit's implicit holding in\n   <em>\n    Szabla v. City of Brooklyn Park\n   </em>\n   that a seizure occurs when a police dog seizes an individual that police did not know to be present, at least when police initially believe that the individual is the suspect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1554019\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/429/1168/#p1172\">\n    429 F.3d 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1172-73 (8th Cir. 2005),\n   <em>\n    reh'g en banc on other grounds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3117360\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/385/\">\n    486 F.3d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, when construing the facts in the light most favorable to Collins, the early morning hour and relative quietness of the neighborhood allow the inference that Schmidt believed that only the suspects\n   were out.

As such, it makes no difference whether Schmidt thought Collins was the suspect or whether he knew she was present.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Schmidt further contends that he complied with\n   <em>\n    Kuha\n   </em>\n   because he gave two warnings when he started the search. Shouting a warning into the void is insufficient. Presumably, that is why St. Paul policy mandates repeated warnings in large or multileveled buildings, (JA at 64), and why Schmidt's failure to give additional warnings played a role in the decision to discipline him, (JA at 39-40). Schmidt acknowledges that Collins did not hear his warnings, (Schmidt Dep. at 55:2-4), and that most handlers would have given additional warnings and that doing so would have been prudent, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 66:15-23). Schmidt's supervisor acknowledged that Schmidt's warnings would not have been effective to Collins and that effective warnings are required. (Linssen Dep. at 33:7-20, 37:17-38:12.) Taken together, this evidence shows that Schmidt's failure to give effective warnings during the seven-minute search was unreasonable as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, it was unreasonable for Schmidt to give the dog 20 feet of leash. A 20-foot lead might be reasonable in an open field, but not in a crowded urban area. This long lead allowed Gabe to advance out of sight behind the dumpster.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKay\n   </em>\n   , 949 F.Supp.2d at 981 (30-foot lead). Schmidt's sergeant testified that a 4- to 6-foot lead would have been appropriate - and that he would not have approached the dumpster from a blind angle at all. (Linssen Dep. at 45:3-46:5.) This conclusion does not require the benefit of hindsight: the fact that Gabe\n   had already disappeared out of sight once to bark at a cat put Schmidt on notice that the 20-foot lead was too long. Taken together, this evidence shows that Schmidt's lack of control over Gabe during the seven-minute search, and particularly as the officers approached the readily-apparent blind spots near the end of the alley, was unreasonable as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Third, the bite was prolonged because Gabe did not respond to Schmidt's \"out\" command, (Schmidt Dep. at 25:25-26:8), and his e-collar was on a training setting instead of the field setting, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:2-20). Linssen attributes these issues to training failures. (JA at 40.) As such, taking the facts in the light most favorable to Schmidt, he acted reasonably after the bite took place - though a reasonable jury could disagree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, because there is a serious question as to whether there was any governmental interest justifying the search after the suspect was apprehended and because Schmidt's failure to give effective warnings and maintain control of his K-9 partner were unreasonable as a matter of law, the seizure of Collins was unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

And, as above, it is confirmed by the decision of every district court case cited by the parties: when a handler deploys a dog trained to bite and hold, the dog's bite of an unknown third party is a seizure. This robust consensus of on-point persuasive authority combined with the Eighth Circuit's implicit holding in\n   <em>\n    Szabla\n   </em>\n   is more than sufficient to conclude that the matter was clearly established at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Regarding Schmidt's failure to warn, even though\n   <em>\n    Kuha\n   </em>\n   does not explicitly spell out the obvious point that the required warning must be audible, it does establish that the warning must be \"loud.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9254335\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/590/#p599\">\n    365 F.3d at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Linssen Dep. at 43:1-24.)

Not so. The St. Paul policy requiring repeated warnings in large or multilevel buildings codifies the common-sense point that a warning must be audible to be effective and implicitly requires repeated warnings in other similar circumstances. If Schmidt had given additional warnings before entering either of the two backyards he searched at length, or moving into the alley, or proceeding a half block down the alley, his position might be defensible. But he didn't. Thus, even taking the facts in the light most favorable to Schmidt, his best contention is that it cannot be right that he \"was in a constant state of violating constitutional rights as he walked down the alley and Gabe searched for human odor - he just did not know whose rights, if anyone's, were being violated.\" (Def.'s Resp. at 8-9, June 21, 2018, Docket No. 23.)

Schmidt says that that he is critical of those actions, and that he told the other officers to \"stop yelling.\" As such, taking the facts in the light most favorable to Schmidt, these actions cannot be fairly attributed to him. However, taking the facts in the light most favorable to Collins, it is notable that Schmidt did not instruct Campbell not to talk to Gabe when the dog was ignoring Schmidt's \"down\" commands or instruct the officers to avoid pulling Collins.
