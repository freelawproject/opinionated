Edinger responded to the grievance by explaining that Casey Bradley, the Stutsman County Auditor,\n   had mentioned this to him and that no formal request for the resignation had been made. Edinger Aff., Ex. 4, ECF No. 37-4. On November 5, 2015, Sheriff Kaiser told Edinger that he wanted Nagel to stay out of the Sheriff's Office.
