PAUL CITY ATTORNEY, 15 West Kellogg Boulevard, Suite 750, St. Paul, MN 55102, for defendant.\n </attorneys>\n <p id=\"p-7\">\n  <strong>\n   MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   JOHN R. TUNHEIM, Chief Judge United States District Court\n   First Lutheran Church brings this action against the City of St. Paul, Minnesota, alleging violations of its rights under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIPA\"), as well as its rights under the constitutions of Minnesota and the United States, including the First Amendment. First Lutheran claims that the City violated its rights when the City imposed fourteen conditions as part of a Determination of Similar Use regarding First Lutheran's partnership with a nonprofit dayshelter that operates out of First Lutheran's basement. One of those conditions requires that a sign be posted restricting after-hours use of First Lutheran's property so that the City can enforce trespassing laws, even though First Lutheran wants to permit such after-hours use of its property. Another condition limits the number of guests to twenty per day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   First Lutheran moves for a preliminary injunction on its RLUIPA and First Amendment claims, and it asks the Court to enjoin enforcement of all the imposed conditions. Because First Lutheran has shown that it is entitled to a preliminary injunction with respect to the sign-posting requirement and the twenty-person limit, the Court will grant First Lutheran's motion in part and enjoin the City from enforcing those two conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First Lutheran Church is located in a residential area of St. Paul, Minnesota. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-9, Apr. 6, 2018, Docket No. 1.) Supporting poor and homeless individuals has always been an important part of First Lutheran's religious identity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) Over the last decade, First Lutheran has undertaken numerous steps in furtherance of its religious mission to assist the poor and homeless. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) For example, First Lutheran served breakfast to over 300 people each Sunday over a three-year span. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Chris O. Bingea (\"C. Bingea Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, May 21, 2018, Docket No. 25.) First Lutheran also established a \"Wellness Center\" on its property where its volunteers and partners provide services to approximately 80-150 people one evening per week, including: free blood pressure checks and health assessments; free mental health counseling; free clothing, blankets, and housewares; free holistic therapy; and a hot meal. (Compl. \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Margaret D.A. Peterson (\"M. Peterson Decl.\") \u00b6 4, May 21, 2018, Docket No. 26.) First Lutheran also has a \"Ministering Angels\" program that operates on First Lutheran's property and provides gently used clothing and household items to the needy. (Decl. of Darlissa A. McDonald (\"McDonald Decl.\") \u00b6 3, May 21, 2018, Docket No. 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Listening House of St. Paul is a nonprofit dayshelter and community center that focuses on providing hospitality and practical assistance to the disadvantaged, homeless, or lonely. (Compl. \u00b6 16.) For over 33 years, Listening House operated in downtown St. Paul, approximately half a mile from City Hall. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) In 2016, First Lutheran learned that Listening House needed a new location, and in early 2017, First Lutheran agreed to allow Listening\n   House to operate out of First Lutheran's basement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both saw the partnership as a natural match. First Lutheran's Council President is a clinical social worker with a 30-year history with Listening House. (Decl. of Bret Byfield (\"Byfield Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6, May 21, 2018, Docket No. 30.) Listening House's Executive Director attends First Lutheran. (Decl. of Cheryl Peterson (\"C. Peterson Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5, May 21, 2018, Docket No. 28.) First Lutheran saw Listening House's \"commitment to helping those in need with practical and holistic assistance\" as \"precisely what First Lutheran had been attempting to provide its community for decades.\" (Compl. \u00b6 19.) Their partnership would enable First Lutheran to expand its ministries and services beyond the neighborhood and into more of St. Paul. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) For example, Listening House's established reputation as a welcoming dayshelter for the homeless reduced the need for First Lutheran to separately provide similar services to the neighborhood and broader community. (Byfield Decl. \u00b6 6.) Additionally, Listening House could provide First Lutheran with access to previously unavailable resources, such as full-time social workers. (Compl. \u00b6 70(c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before Listening House opened its doors at its new location, it sought guidance from the City. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Listening House was told that First Lutheran needed to apply for a Determination of Similar Use. (Decl. of Brenda O. Bingea (\"B. Bingea Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, May 21, 2018, Docket No. 29.) First Lutheran claims that it never had needed to apply for such a Determination before, even though \"First Lutheran houses and rents its space many non-profit tenants, some of which provide similar services to Listening House and serve more guests than Listening House.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In February 2017, First Lutheran applied for a Determination of Similar Use. (Compl. \u00b6 25, Ex. A.) The following month, a City inspector approved First Lutheran's application. (FL00205.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Determination stated that Listening House's use of First Lutheran's basement would be \"similar in character\" to \"the uses provided by First Lutheran,\" such as its Wellness Center and Ministering Angels, and that Listening House's use would be \"similar to other accessory church-related programs.\" (FL00204.) The Determination relied, in part, on an analogous 2004 application by St. Mary's church to hold a yoga class on its church property. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) The only three conditions the City imposed were: (1) that Listening House be \"limited to uses that are low profile, generate limited traffic, are compatible with the church's presence in the community, and have the potential to complement the activities of the church,\" (2) that Listening House \"meet the standards and conditions for 'home occupation' as listed in\" the City's Zoning Code, and (3) that First Lutheran work with Listening House to prevent traffic and congestion on neighborhood streets. (FL00205.) Listening House then moved into First Lutheran's basement and opened its doors on June 5, 2017. (Compl. \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The partnership appears to have proven to be the natural match that both had hoped for. Listening House serves approximately 50-60 guests per day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   St. Paul City Council Hr'g at 1:16:57-1:17:30 (Dec. 6, 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Many regular guests at Listening\n   House became First Lutheran members, and members of First Lutheran's staff and volunteers became Listening House volunteers. (C. Bingea Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.) On the weeknight that First Lutheran hosts its Wellness Center, one-third to one-half of the Wellness Center guests are also Listening House guests. (M. Peterson Decl. \u00b6 4.) Listening House guests also help First Lutheran volunteers set up for the evening's Wellness Center. (McDonald Decl. \u00b6 7.) Listening House also allowed First Lutheran to provide previously unavailable resources, including employment help, computer services, and housing assistance. (Decl. of George L. Gevan (\"Gevan Decl.\") \u00b6 18, May 21, 2018, Docket No. 32.) For Listening House, the new location proved to be a more controlled environment with better security and more volunteers, and guests were more respectful of the physical space. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    References to documents with the bates numbers FL__ are to the administrative record concerning Resolution 18-145.

According to First Lutheran, \"a subset of several neighbors made it clear that they were opposed to Listening House and its visitors' presence\" in the neighborhood. (Compl. \u00b6 31.) Neighbors complained to the City of increased foot traffic and people sleeping outside, and of an increase in petty offenses such as littering and public intoxication and urination. Neighbors documented their complaints by, in part, taking photographs of people (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , FL00110-142, 231-270), despite being told by police not to (FL00122). Although the neighbors complained to the City and the police about unlawful behavior such as littering, trespassing, public urination, and vandalism (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , FL00140, 141, 268), they also expressed frustration that police could not change lawful behavior that the neighbors disliked. For example, a neighbor stated that a person was \"sleeping under a blanket on a bench outside of Listening House\" between 7:00am and 11:30am. (FL00097.) The neighbor \"called the police and an officer responded, but because the church is private property and L[istening] H[ouse] staff are fine with people living outside their doors, the officer told us that there is nothing he can do.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    FL00122.) On another occasion, a neighbor admitted to police that he took a picture of a man sitting on Listening House's steps \"because the 'listening is closed,' \" even though the man was not being disorderly or causing a public nuisance. (FL00064.) The neighbor told police \"I will do everything I can to shut that place down.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) And on another occasion, a neighbor called the police because a man was resting on a bench on First Lutheran's property with First Lutheran's permission. (FL00057.) The neighbor \"was unhappy with the legal authority of the police in this situation when [police] explained to him.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Even if police were not called, neighbors took pictures of people engaged in lawful behavior, such as church volunteers eating lunch \"picnic-style\" on the church lawn. (Gevan Decl. \u00b6 21.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    <strong>\n     II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The St. Paul Zoning Code requires that any appeal of \"a decision of the planning or zoning administrator\" be filed within ten days of that decision. St. Paul Zoning Code \u00a7 61.701(c). On July 3, 2017 - less than a month after Listening House opened and more than three months after the City's decision - the City informed First Lutheran that it was inviting appeals of its Determination of Similar Use. (FL00208.) First Lutheran alleges that \"[p]roviding notice of a right to appeal a determination of similar use is not required under statutes, nor does the Zoning Administrator have a written policy to do so.\" (Compl. \u00b6 37.) Several of First Lutheran's neighbors appealed the inspector's determination of similar use to the Zoning Committee. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 38-44.) After a public hearing - and after the neighbors, the\n    City, First Lutheran, and Listening House tried to settle their disagreements - the Zoning Committee recommended granting the neighbors' appeal, which would have shut down Listening House. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 43-49.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Listening House objected to the Committee's recommendation to the Planning Commission. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 50.) The Commission adopted a middle-of-the-road approach. It voted to deny the neighbors' appeal in part and modify the Determination of Similar Use, adding eleven conditions. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 52.) The fourteen total conditions imposed are:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    1. The nonprofit tenant is limited to uses that are low profile, generate limited traffic, are compatible with the church's presence in the community, and have the potential to complement the activities of the church.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n    2. Tenants shall meet the standards and conditions for \"home occupation\" as listed in Section 65.141 b, c, g and h of the Zoning Code, ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n    (b) A home occupation shall not involve the conduct of a general retail or wholesale business, a manufacturing business, a commercial food service requiring a license, a limousine business or auto service or repair.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    (c) A home occupation shall be carried on whole[ly] within the main building. No occupation shall be allowed in detached accessory structures or garages.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    (g) There shall be no exterior storage of equipment, supplies, or overweight commercial vehicles, nor parking of more than one (1) business car, pickup truck or small van, nor any additional vehicles except one business car, pickup truck or small van, nor any additional vehicles except those for permitted employees associated with the home business.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    (h) There shall be no detriments to the residential character of the neighborhood due to noise, odor, smoke dust, gas, heat, glare, vibration, electrical interference, traffic congestion, number of deliveries, hours of operation, or any other annoyance resulting from the home occupation.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    3. The church shall work with Listening House to prevent scheduling of multiple events that, taken together, would generate considerable traffic and congest neighborhood streets.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    4. Hours of operation shall be limited to 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    5. Listening House will ensure that guests have left the area after Listening House has closed and will provide bus fares to its guests. Listening House staff must be on-site for two hours before and two hours after the times guests are served at the facility.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    6. Listening House will not allow the consumption of alcohol or controlled substances anywhere on the First Lutheran Church properties.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    7. Listening House will call emergency services when a guest is engaged in behavior that is harmful to self or others.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    8. Listening House will give notice on a shared Google site of serious incidents observed that involve their guests.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    9. No outdoor patio may exist anywhere on church grounds during Listening House's tenancy.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    10. A sign must be posted in a plainly visible location to restrict after-hours use of the church grounds so as to aid in the enforcement of trespassing violations by Listening House guests or other persons when Listening House is closed.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    11. Listening House will attend community policing meetings as invited by the Saint Paul Police Department.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    12. Listening House will review on a daily basis their own camera footage and\n    an online log maintained by neighbors in order to identify issues of concern and potential intervention.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    13. Listening House will post guest policies regarding \"good neighbor\" expectations and consequences, including suspension or barring from Listening House and the church properties. Such policies must be readily visible to guests. Also, the policies must be provided to neighbors and the Zoning Administrator upon request.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    14. The number of guests will generally be limited to 20 per day....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    (FL00143-146.) In support of the additional conditions imposed, the Commission made two findings. First, that Listening House \"has not operated like a home occupation because of its detrimental effect on the neighborhood, with an increase in issues such as littering, public urination, and sleeping in outdoor public and private spaces causing such detriment, including during hours when the facility is closed.\" (FL00144.) Second, the City found that Listening House \"has not been compatible with the church's presence in the community.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Both Listening House and the neighbors appealed the Planning Commission's decision to the City Council. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54, 56.) During the City Council's public hearing in December 2017, City Planner Bill Dermody was asked about the Planning Commission's basis for imposing the twenty-person limit. St. Paul City Council Hr'g at 1:10:20. He stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    We do have some guidance from the previous approval of another church with the yoga use where that use was limited to ten persons per day to make it act like an accessory use and be clearly incidental. On that site, ten per day has worked. We haven't had issues or complaints at that site. And so, if ten worked on that site, hopefully twenty would work on this, on this site.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1:10:30-1:10:55. The City Council denied both appeals and passed Resolution 18-145, which adopted the Planning Commission's recommendation. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.) Resolution 18-145 is the City's final decision on the matter. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 62.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    First Lutheran then brought this action in federal court. First Lutheran alleges violations of RLUIPA in two ways: (1) Resolution 18-145 substantially burdens First Lutheran's religious exercise, does not further a compelling government interest, and is not the least restrictive means of furthering the City's interest(s); and (2) Resolution 18-145 subjects First Lutheran to restrictions and conditions not imposed on nonreligious assemblies in the same zoning district. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 71-92.) First Lutheran also alleges that Resolution 18-145 violates First Lutheran's First Amendment rights to free exercise of religion, free speech, and free assembly. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 109-141.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    On May 11, 2018, a City inspector came to Listening House for an inspection. (M. Peterson Decl. \u00b6 14.) The inspector said that she or other inspectors would be continuing to ensure \"compliance with the zoning conditions.\" (C. Peterson Decl. \u00b6 16.) The inspector also told Listening House's Executive Director that Listening House violated the twenty-person limit every day that the inspector was there. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    First Lutheran moves for a preliminary injunction, asking the Court to enjoin enforcement of Resolution 18-145 against First Lutheran.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    <strong>\n     I.

First Lutheran's mission and values are to be \"welcoming all individuals where they are regardless of their current economic, physical, mental and social state,\" and part of First Lutheran's practice is \"to welcome, serve and live among ... those in need.\" (C. Bingea Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 15.) According to First Lutheran's pastor:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n    Unless a visitor was at risk of harming themselves or others, we would not ask them to leave the property. They are welcome to rest and enjoy our property regardless of the time of day. Requiring our church to put up a No Trespassing sign is contrary to the mission and teaching of our Church ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 16.) First Lutheran's purpose in allowing visitors to enjoy its property is to be welcoming and inviting to the homeless, lonely, and needy. By limiting the use of First Lutheran's property after hours, the City is preventing First Lutheran from being welcoming for two-thirds of the day. And by requiring that a sign be posted effectively saying, \"You are welcome here only during business hours,\" further undermines First Lutheran's mission to be welcoming. These effects are not mere inconveniences, but rather put substantial pressure on First Lutheran to change both its use of its property and the message it sends to the community in ways that are antithetical to First Lutheran's purpose, mission, and practice. The sign-posting requirement\n    imposes a substantial burden on First Lutheran's religious exercise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    <strong>\n     (ii) Twenty-Person Limit\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Resolution 18-145 generally limits the number of guests to twenty per day. Listening House serves approximately 50-60 guests per day, and the fire-code capacity for the church basement is 122. (C. Bingea Decl. \u00b6 17.) In the past, First Lutheran has served breakfast to over 300 people each Sunday, and it currently serves approximately 80-150 people one evening a week at its Wellness Center. The twenty-person limit severely undermines First Lutheran's mission, preferred practices, and message. First, it reduces the actual number of guests served. There is obviously demand for the services that First Lutheran and Listening House provide, and that demand vastly exceeds the limit the City imposed, and the per-day nature of the limit means that First Lutheran will be restricted to providing services to 20 people per day and will have to turn people away. Because First Lutheran and Listening House want to serve - and can serve - well more than 20 people per day, the limit undermines their mission to provide services to any many people as they can. Second, the twenty-person limit reduces the ability to effectively recruit volunteers, especially professional volunteers such as licensed social workers, because volunteers may feel that their time could be better used at facilities that serve more people. This restriction is likely to reduce both the number and types of services that First Lutheran and Listening House can provide. And third, the twenty-person limit will result in an unwelcoming message being sent. The limit will require that guests be turned away, even if the first 20 guests that cycled through Listening House that day are no longer on the premises. Turning guests away - especially when there is the space for them - would undermine First Lutheran's message to be welcoming to the homeless, the lonely, and the needy. These effects are not mere inconveniences, but rather put substantial pressure on First Lutheran to change its partnership with Listening House. The twenty-person limit imposes a substantial burden on First Lutheran's religious exercise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    <strong>\n     (iii) Resolution 18-145's Other Requirements\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Although First Lutheran has shown that the sign-posting requirement and the twenty-person limit each impose a substantial burden on its religious exercise, First Lutheran has not shown - at this early stage and on this limited record - that the other twelve conditions in Resolution 18-145 impose a substantial burden on its religious exercise. The other twelve conditions, both individually and collectively, appear to impose mere inconveniences on First Lutheran rather than exerting substantial pressure on First Lutheran to change is religious practices.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    <strong>\n     b.

The Resolution's text makes that clear. Even assuming that aiding the enforcement of trespassing is a compelling governmental interest, entry onto First Lutheran's property after hours is not trespassing because First Lutheran consents to people being on church property after hours.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.605\">\n     Minn.

Ct. App. 1995) (defining civil trespass). Thus, the resolution does not serve the City's interest in punishing or reducing trespassing because no trespassing occurs on First Lutheran's property. Thus, the sign-posting requirement does not further a compelling governmental interest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    With respect to the twenty-person limit, the City claims that the condition furthers the governmental interest in maintaining the residential character of the neighborhood.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    St. Paul Legislative Code \u00a7 60.103(i), (l), (m). The limit purportedly furthers this interest in two ways: by reducing the number of guests and thereby preventing overcrowding of a residential neighborhood, and by reducing petty offenses allegedly committed by guests. But, in practice, the limit is unlikely to further the City's interest in either way.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    First, it is unclear whether or how the limit will reduce overcrowding. As noted, demand is high for First Lutheran's and Listening House's services. As news spreads about the twenty-person limit, it is likely that more prospective guests will line up early in hopes of being admitted, which would cause more overcrowding in the morning hours. It is possible that overcrowding will be reduced later in the day if some prospective guests find out that the twenty-person limit has already been reached. But it is also possible that some prospective guests will not receive word that the limit was reached (or that there is a limit at all) and will arrive at Listening House only to be turned away. Turning people away will likely result in more people occupying First Lutheran's outdoor property and the neighborhood generally. Ultimately, the Court is not persuaded that the twenty-person limit will reduce overcrowding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Second, the limit is unlikely to reduce petty offenses. To begin with, these offenses are not caused by First Lutheran or Listening House; rather, they are the understandable effects of homelessness and\n    poverty, not the organizations that serve people who are homeless or poor. If Listening House closed its doors tomorrow, its guests who are homeless or poor would still be homeless or poor, and the City would continue to experience the effects of homelessness and poverty. Moreover, assuming that all of the petty offenses are committed by Listening House and First Lutheran guests - an assumption First Lutheran vigorously disputes - the twenty-person limit means that prospective guests will either be turned away and head into the nearby neighborhood (thereby possibly increasing the incidence of such petty offenses in the neighborhood) or remain in other areas of the City because they chose not to visit Listening House or First Lutheran in the first instance (thereby increasing the incidence of such petty offenses elsewhere in St. Paul). Thus, the twenty-person limit does not further a compelling governmental interest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    <strong>\n     c. Least Restrictive Means\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Finally, the Court must determine whether the sign-posting requirement and the twenty-person limit are the least restrictive means of furthering the City's interests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    As to the sign-posting requirement, there are no means the City can take to enforce non-existent crimes or civil infractions. As long as First Lutheran consents to guests remaining on church property after hours, any sign-posting requirement so restricting after-hours use of church property is overly restrictive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    As to the twenty-person limit, the City has less restrictive means of furthering its interest in maintaining the residential character of the neighborhood. To begin with, the per-day character of the limit is overly restrictive. Listening House and First Lutheran operate on a mostly come-and-go basis, so they could serve twenty people by mid-morning and remain empty the rest of the day. Moreover, the number itself is overly restrictive. The City's comparison of Listening House to a yoga studio - simply because both are in a church - raises serious questions about whether the City can carry its burden to show that the twenty-person limit is the least restrictive means, given that the City gave the number only perfunctory consideration before imposing the twenty-person limit. Finally, the Court doubts on the present record that a numerical limit at all is the least restrictive means. At least with respect to petty offenses being committed in the neighborhood, again, First Lutheran and Listening House are not the cause of those offenses. First Lutheran suggests that a more robust police presence with a strong emphasis on true community policing will allow the City to maintain the residential character of the neighborhood without substantially burdening First Lutheran's religious exercise, or at least that such an arrangement would be the least restrictive means of serving the governmental interest. That might very well be true. But the Court need not determine what means is the least restrictive; it suffices for the present motion to conclude that the twenty-person, per-day limit is not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    First Lutheran has shown that it is likely to prevail on its RLUIPA substantial-burden claim with respect to the sign-posting requirement and the twenty-person limit contained in Resolution 18-145.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    <strong>\n     2.

This standard is consistent with the standard First Lutheran asks the Court to employ: that \"the comparison of use should be based on the underlying lawful, zoning-relevant interests at play (such as health, safety, and welfare) that the city seeks to regulate.\" (Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. (\"Mem. Supp.\") at 27, Apr. 10, 2018, Docket No. 7.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    On the current record and at this early stage, First Lutheran has not shown a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of its equal-terms claim. First Lutheran alleges that Resolution 18-145 puts it on less than equal terms with secular institutions in the same neighborhood and zoning district. Specifically, First Lutheran argues that the twenty-person limit, the sign-posting requirement, and the patio ban do not apply to Metropolitan State University, Dayton's Bluff Library, or The Goat Coffee House. (Compl. \u00b6 66.) But this unsupported allegation is the extent of First Lutheran's analysis and evidence. The Court is not convinced - because First Lutheran has given no explanation - that these three institutions are appropriate comparators, i.e., similarly situated to First Lutheran with respect to the regulatory purposes of Resolution 18-145 or the RT1 zoning criteria.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     City of St. Michael\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201014\">\n     205 F.Supp.3d at 1036\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding a church not similarly situated to a movie theater because \"[a] church is not in the business of selling items to the public and, as a non-profit entity, does not generate taxable revenue\"). Thus, First Lutheran has failed to show at this early stage and on this limited record that Metropolitan State University, Dayton's Bluff Library, or The Goat Coffee House are sufficiently similar to First Lutheran for purposes of its RLUIPA equal-terms claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    This is not to say that First Lutheran cannot, on a more developed record, prevail on its equal-terms claim. For example, First Lutheran alleges that the City invited neighbors to appeal the City's Determination of Similar Use over three months after issuing it (substantially beyond the ten-day window provided in the Zoning Code), and that the City has never before done anything like that. If true, the Court would find that practice troubling, and such disfavored treatment could possibly form the basis for a permanent injunction against Resolution 18-145 in its entirety. But without more information about the City's practices, and on this limited record, the Court cannot conclude at this time that the City has treated First Lutheran on less than equal terms under RLUIPA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    <strong>\n     3.

The remaining\n    <em>\n     Dataphase\n    </em>\n    factors also favor First Lutheran. As such, First Lutheran has shown that it is entitled to a preliminary injunction with respect to those two conditions. The Court will grant First Lutheran's motion in part and enjoin the City from enforcing the sign-posting requirement and the twenty-person limit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n    <strong>\n     IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n    </strong>\n    that Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction [Docket No. 5] is\n    <strong>\n     GRANTED IN PART\n    </strong>\n    .
