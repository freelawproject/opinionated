INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant Cigna Corporation (\"Cigna\") filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction at docket 9. Plaintiff opposes this motion, and filed a motion to permit discovery on the structure, operation, control and funding of Cigna Group claims offices at docket 15. For the following reasons, Plaintiff's motion for discovery at docket 15 is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , and Cigna's motion to dismiss at docket 9 is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff, in his complaint, brings claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff was an employee at Swift Technical Services, LLC (\"STS\") when he became disabled on October 13, 2015, following a left knee replacement surgery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff explains that STS is the sponsor and administrator of the Swift Technical Services, LLC Long Term Disability Plan (the \"STS LTD Plan\"), and that STS pays premiums for an insurance policy providing long term disability benefits to STS employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Plaintiff, STS LTD Plan benefits are provided through a long term disability policy issued by the Life Insurance Company of North America (LINA), and the claim administrator is Cigna, which is also the parent company of LINA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff states that Cigna discontinued Plaintiff's long term disability benefits under the STS LTD Plan on July 10, 2016, and contends that Cigna \"abused its discretion\" in denying these benefits to Plaintiff and in failing to rule on Plaintiff's administrative appeal in a timely manner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also argues that Cigna \"abused its discretion\" in claiming an overpayment of benefits to Plaintiff, in failing to provide an adequate explanation for this claim, and in failing to respond to Plaintiff's appeal of this claim in a timely manner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff names STS, LINA, and Cigna as defendants, and seeks declaratory relief, an award of benefits, and injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   STS and LINA both filed answers to the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 5, 2018, Cigna filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cigna contends that, in contrast to STS and LINA, \"Cigna Corporation is not an insurance company, but a stock holding company with no involvement with the Plan and no contacts with Alaska sufficient to permit this court to exercise of personal jurisdiction over Cigna Corporation consistent with due process.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Cigna argues, the Court does not have either general or specific personal jurisdiction over Cigna.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response, Plaintiff argues that the Court has personal jurisdiction over Cigna pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2), which establishes a broader basis for personal jurisdiction over ERISA defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff contends that Cigna is a proper defendant under \u00a7 1132 and meets the test for personal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1132(e)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also filed a motion for jurisdictional discovery seeking \"an order allowing Plaintiff to conduct discovery on the structure, operation, control and financing of CIGNA Group Claims.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs explains that he alleged that Cigna was the STS LTD Plan Administrator \"based on the written communications from the claim administrator office, which identified itself in every letter as CIGNA or CIGNA Group Claims.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff notes that Cigna Corporation has stated that it does not administer benefits claims, but has not disclosed \"which corporate entity operated, controlled and funded the CIGNA Group claims office that handled Plaintiff's LTD claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks permission to conduct discovery on the structure of \"CIGNA GROUP Claims,\" including \"which corporate entities operate, control and fund the CIGNA Group Claims offices.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff further notes that discovery is necessary \"to determine whether and to what degree CIGNA Group Claims offices have a conflict of interest due to their relationship with the LTD insurer, LINA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cigna filed a combined reply to its motion to dismiss and response in opposition to Plaintiff's motion for discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cigna argues that Cigna is not a statutory plan administrator or \"de facto\" plan administrator for the STS LTD Plan or Plaintiff's benefits claim, and therefore that Cigna is not a proper defendant under \u00a7 1132.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cigna thus contends that the Court should not permit jurisdictional discovery \"on the basis of unsupported assertions,\" and notes that any concerns about conflict-of-interest are questions for the merits stage, rather than a basis for jurisdictional discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiff filed a reply to the motion for discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff reiterates that Cigna's name is included on a number\n   of documents related to insurance claims, and argues that this evidence, at a minimum, \"provides a prima facie case for concluding CIGNA corporation is in fact directly or indirectly involved in selling disability insurance and handling disability claims\" and warrants additional discovery. Plaintiff also cites the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Leeson v. Transamerica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and argues that, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Leeson\n   </em>\n   , \"the civil procedural rules mandate that the Plaintiff be allowed to conduct discovery before the party status of CIGNA is decided.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Cigna's motion to dismiss and Plaintiff's motion for discovery are now ripe for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    A.

These letters contain the Cigna logo and a return address referencing \"Cigna\" along with a PO Box in Phoenix, Arizona, and are signed by Cigna employees, including a \"Group Claims Associate,\" \"Claim Manager,\" and \"Appeal Specialist.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also notes that Cigna's promotional materials for Long Term Disability insurance reference \"[o]ur experienced LTD claim managers,\" and that Cigna \"hires claims persons and managers under the name CIGNA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff therefore maintains that he has \"established genuine issue of material fact regarding who CIGNA Group Claims is.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In response, Cigna points out that the letters submitted by Plaintiff contain notices stating that \" 'Cigna' and the 'Tree of Life' logo are registered service marks of Cigna Intellectual Property, Inc., licensed for use by Cigna Corporation and its operating subsidiaries,\" and that \"[a]ll products and services are provided by or through such operating subsidiaries, including Life Insurance Company of North America, Connecticut General Life Insurance Company and Cigna Life Insurance Company of New York, and not by Cigna Corporation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letters also expressly list \"Life Insurance Company of North America\" as the \"Underwriting Company\" for the STS LTD policy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   and LINA, in its answer in this case, admits sending the letters contained in Plaintiff's claims file concerning Plaintiff's termination of benefits and his appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court concludes that Cigna should be dismissed from this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Plaintiff has submitted evidence suggesting on first glance that \"Cigna,\" in some capacity, might have been involved in reviewing Plaintiff's insurance claim, a closer look at these documents clarifies the extent of Cigna's involvement. The letters expressly state that the Cigna name and logo are registered service marks and that Cigna Corporation itself does not provide products and services, which are instead provided through Cigna's operating subsidiaries, including LINA. LINA acknowledges sending the letters containing substantive decisions on Plaintiff's benefits claims. In light of this evidence, Cigna's specific denials of involvement, and LINA's admissions, there is nothing to suggest that Cigna Corporation is connected to this lawsuit,\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   or that additional discovery will\n   lead to additional jurisdictionally relevant facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
