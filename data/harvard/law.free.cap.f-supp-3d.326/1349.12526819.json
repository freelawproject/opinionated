According to the settlement agreements, Defendant also agreed to keep certain matters about the released claims and the settlement agreements confidential. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant recently breached\n   the settlement agreements when she, through her lawyer, revealed information about the released claims and the agreements to other lawyers while attempting to obtain another settlement for the previously released claims. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages as well as injunctive relief prohibiting Defendant from further breaching the confidentiality provisions. Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint. Because Plaintiff's Complaint states a plausible claim for relief, Defendant's motion to dismiss (ECF No. 15) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   MOTION TO DISMISS STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"To survive a motion to dismiss\" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \"a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

After the hearing and based on a review of the draft complaint and the 1992 and 1993 Settlement Agreements, the Court found that Plaintiff had shown a substantial likelihood that the public filing of the draft complaint would violate the confidentiality provisions of the settlement agreements, that Plaintiff would suffer irreparable injury by the public disclosure of such confidential information, and that the public interest would not be harmed by granting temporary injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.

The Court found that requiring Plaintiff to file the draft complaint and related matters under seal and sealing the present action was appropriate because the parties agreed that such matters should remain confidential and because the harm to the public's interest in disclosure was reduced in light of the temporary nature of the access restriction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court entered temporary injunctive relief as follows: (1) restricting access to any documents filed in the present action to the parties to this action, their counsel, and court personnel; (2) requiring Defendant to file any matters related to the draft complaint, including the complaint itself, under seal; and (3) prohibiting Defendant and anyone acting on her behalf from publicly disclosing or discussing the subject matter of the draft complaint and any other documents required to be sealed or restricted by the Court's order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant subsequently filed her Complaint under seal as directed by the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., [redacted], No. 4:18-CV-83 (M.D. Ga. May 1, 2018), ECF No. 1.

The Settlement Agreements Are Valid Contracts Under Georgia Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant contends that the settlement agreements are not valid contracts because Plaintiff never signed them.

Thus, Georgia's public policy against prohibitions on such disclosure simply does not save Defendant under the circumstances alleged in Plaintiff's Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, Georgia law does not support the proposition that a confidentiality agreement is void in its entirety simply because the agreement does not expressly allow a party to \"testify or otherwise comply with a subpoena, court order, or applicable law,\"\n   <em>\n    Barger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"362950\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/231/723/\">\n    499 S.E.2d at 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In those cases, the courts have instead found that the confidentiality agreements implicitly allow for such disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"362950\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/231/723/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (implying term allowing disclosure pursuant to subpoena in the agreement and holding the trial court erred when it concluded that a confidentiality agreement prohibited a party from disclosing matters during civil discovery);\n   <em>\n    Camp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"744156\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/246/275/\">\n    539 S.E.2d at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that trial court erred in directing verdict that party to confidentiality agreement breached the agreement by cooperating with police because permission to cooperate with investigative authorities is an implied term of the agreement). It follows that the confidentiality provisions in the settlement agreements here are not void just because they fail to express what Georgia courts would imply under well-established law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant further argues that enforcing the confidentiality provisions would violate her First Amendment right to engage in protected speech. The parties quibble over whether enforcing the provisions would involve \"state action\" and whether she knowingly waived her First Amendment rights when she signed the settlement agreements. But even assuming that enforcing the provisions involves \"state action,\" Defendant's argument remains unpersuasive. In\n   <em>\n    Cohen v. Cowles Media Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107879\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/663/\">\n    501 U.S. 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107879\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/663/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107879\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/663/\">\n    115 L.Ed.2d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991), the Supreme Court addressed whether enforcement of a newspaper's promise to keep an informant's identity a secret under a state-law promissory estoppel theory would violate the newspaper's First Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107879\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/663/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107879\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/663/\">\n    at 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107879\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/663/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court decided that \"the First Amendment does not confer on the press a constitutional right to disregard promises that would otherwise be enforced under state law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107879\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/663/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107879\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/663/\">\n    at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107879\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/663/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, the First Amendment does not confer on a private party a constitutional right to disregard promises that are otherwise enforceable under Georgia contract law. Accordingly, the Court finds that enforcing the confidentiality provisions under the circumstances alleged in the Complaint would not violate Defendant's First Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Defendant's Fraud/Duress &amp; Material Breach Defenses Are Premature\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff's Complaint should be dismissed because the settlement agreements were procured by fraud and duress and because Plaintiff materially breached the agreements. These arguments rely on matters outside the Complaint, which the Court cannot consider when deciding the pending motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grossman v. Nationsbank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11235497\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/1228/#p1231\">\n    225 F.3d 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1231 (11th Cir. 2000) (explaining that on a motion to dismiss a Court's review is generally cabined to the complaint and the documents attached to it).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, these arguments, which are more suitable for summary judgment, are rejected as grounds for granting Defendant's presently pending motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Plaintiff Sufficiently Alleged Breaches of the Settlement Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Lastly, Defendant argues that even if the settlement agreements are enforceable, no breach occurred because neither the demand letter nor the draft complaint revealed any information subject to the confidentiality provisions in those agreements. Defendant is mistaken. For example, the confidentiality provisions of both settlement agreements prohibit Defendant from revealing \"the fact or existence of\" the settlement agreements, among other matters. 1992 Settlement Agreement at 2; 1993 Settlement Agreement at 3. Both the demand letter and the draft complaint disclose the existence of the 1992 Settlement Agreement. Demand Letter at 4; Draft Compl. \u00b6 102. The draft complaint additionally discloses the existence of the 1993 Settlement Agreement. Draft Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 120-21. And if [redacted] sent [redacted]'s lawyers the demand letter and draft complaint on Defendant's behalf as Plaintiff alleges, Defendant at a minimum breached her agreement to keep the fact and existence of the settlement agreements confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Georgia courts recognize the near universally accepted principle that \"[t]he law ... favors compromise, and when parties have entered into a definite, certain, and unambiguous agreement to settle, it should be enforced.\"\n   <em>\n    Newton v. Ragland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4114002\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/325/371/\">\n    325 Ga.App. 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4114002\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/325/371/\">\n    750 S.E.2d 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 770 (2013) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Greenwald v.

Based on the allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint, the settlement agreements are valid contracts, and they contain enforceable confidentiality provisions. The demand letter and the draft complaint contain at least some information that Defendant unambiguously agreed to keep confidential pursuant to those provisions. And Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached the confidentiality provisions when Defendant's lawyer sent those documents to third parties on Defendant's behalf. Accordingly, Plaintiff's Complaint states a plausible claim for breach of contract under Georgia law. Defendant's motion to dismiss (ECF No. 15) is therefore denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED, this 7th day of August, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The temporary injunctive relief does not prohibit Defendant from discussing matters related to the present action or the draft complaint with [redacted] or reporting other specifically identified matters.

Balancing these competing interests, the Court directs that this case be unsealed such that the existence of this action, the identities of the parties, and today's Order by the Court shall be shown on the public docket. However, until further order of the Court, all previous and future filings in this action shall be maintained and filed in a restricted manner such that they are accessible only by the parties, their counsel, and appropriate court personnel.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
