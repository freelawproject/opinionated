Wright, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After Defendant St. Jude Medical S.C., Inc., terminated Plaintiff Herbert H. Hall from his employment, Hall initiated this lawsuit, alleging retaliation in violation of public policy. Currently before the Court is St. Jude's motion to dismiss the amended complaint. For the reasons addressed below, the motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   St. Jude, a Minnesota corporation that manufactures medical devices, hired Hall, a Michigan resident, as a sales representative in August 2014. The parties signed a two-year employment agreement that provides that, at the conclusion of the agreement, Hall would become an at-will employee and the other terms of the agreement would remain in effect. The agreement contains the following clause: \"\n   <em>\n    Governing Law\n   </em>\n   . This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the state of Minnesota without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws of any jurisdiction.\" The agreement also contains a forum selection clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Exclusive Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   . All actions or proceeding relating to this Agreement will be tried and litigated only in the Minnesota State or Federal Courts .... Employee submits to the exclusive jurisdiction\n   of these courts for the purpose of any such action or proceeding, and this submission cannot be revoked. Employee understands that Employee is surrendering the right to bring litigation against [St. Jude] outside the state of Minnesota.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2015, Hall became a clinical specialist, providing support to St. Jude customers for their use of certain medical devices sold by St. Jude. Hall routinely operated and serviced medical equipment for Dr. Abdul Alawwa, a Michigan doctor who purchased the majority of his medical devices from St. Jude. In October 2016, an employee at Dr. Alawwa's office asked Hall whether St. Jude would sponsor a party for Dr. Alawwa's office. Hall refused because of his concern that sponsoring a party would violate the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7h, and the Anti-Kickback Statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b. Shortly thereafter, in response to St. Jude's recall of certain cardiac devices, Dr. Alawwa requested that a St. Jude employee access Dr. Alawwa's patient files to facilitate the recall notification process. Mitch Gilbert, an area sales representative who worked with Hall at St. Jude, ordered Hall to access Dr. Alawwa's patient files, but Hall refused to do because he believed that accessing the files would violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1320d\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hall alleges that, after these events, Dr. Alawwa filed with Gilbert falsified complaints about Hall's work performance and Gilbert relayed those complaints to Hall's supervisors. St. Jude punished Hall for these complaints, Hall alleges, by declining to include him in a January 2017 training session. At a performance review shortly thereafter, Hall was advised that St. Jude was preparing to terminate his employment because clients had complained about his performance. On February 6, 2017, Hall's supervisor informed him that he would be placed on a \"performance improvement plan\" and that Hall's employment likely would be terminated within a month of completing the plan. Hall never received a performance improvement plan, and St. Jude terminated his employment on February 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hall subsequently initiated this lawsuit in Michigan state court, alleging that St. Jude terminated him in retaliation for his refusal to violate the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute, and HIPAA, in violation of Michigan's public policy against retaliation. After St. Jude removed the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, the lawsuit was transferred to the District of Minnesota and Hall amended his complaint to allege that St. Jude's retaliatory termination of his employment violated Minnesota law as well as Michigan law. Currently before the Court is St. Jude's motion to dismiss Hall's amended complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. State Law Governing the Retaliation Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Hall argues that the governing-law clause in the agreement requires the application of Minnesota law to the retaliation claim. St. Jude counters that the retaliation claim is not covered by the governing-law clause and that the Court must employ Minnesota's choice-of-law analysis to determine whether Michigan law or Minnesota law applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Agreement's Governing-Law Clause Does Not Apply to the Retaliation Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hall argues that his retaliation claim must be governed by Minnesota law because\n   the claim falls within the agreement's governing-law clause. St. Jude counters that the governing-law clause is narrow and does not apply to the tort-based retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A federal court sitting in diversity applies the choice-of-law rules of the forum state-in this case, Minnesota\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -to determine whether to give effect to an agreement's governing-law clause.\n   <em>\n    Fla.

A governing-law clause that \"provide[s] that the contract will be 'governed by' or 'construed' under the laws of a particular state\" is a narrow clause.\n   <em>\n    Fla.

Under both Michigan law and Minnesota law, the cause of action for retaliation is a public-policy exception to the presumption that an at-will employee may be dismissed at any time for any reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kimmelman v. Heather Downs Mgmt. Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3596082\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/278/569/\">\n    278 Mich.App. 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=753%20N.W.2d%20265\">\n    753 N.W.2d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 268 (2008) ;\n   <em>\n    Dukowitz v.

The origins of the cause of action in the at-will-employment context indicate that retaliation claims can be (and ordinarily are) resolved without reference to any contract between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phipps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10654094\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/396/588/#p592\">\n    396 N.W.2d at 590-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing origins of public-policy exceptions to presumption that at-will employment may be terminated at any time for any reason). And the elements of a retaliation claim generally do not require any analysis of an employment agreement: to state a claim for retaliation under Minnesota law, an employee must allege that the employee was terminated for refusing to participate in an activity that the employee, in good faith, believed violated a state or federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dukowitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7334151\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/841/147/#p150\">\n    841 N.W.2d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (listing elements of retaliation claim). To state a claim for retaliation under Michigan law, an employee must allege that the employee was discharged as a result of the employee's refusal to violate a law in the course of employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kimmelman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=753%20N.W.2d%20265\">\n    753 N.W.2d at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same). Neither state's law requires an employee to state any facts concerning a contract between the parties prior to termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hall argues that his retaliation claim is closely related to the agreement, mandating the application of Minnesota law. The Court cannot award damages without interpreting the agreement, Hall maintains, because the agreement addresses the compensation and benefits he received as an employee of St. Jude. But Hall provides no legal authority in support of the position that a plaintiff must establish the precise amount of damages to which he is entitled to establish a defendant's liability for retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Hall also argues that St. Jude is judicially estopped from asserting that the governing-law clause does not cover Hall's retaliation claim. In support of its motion to transfer this lawsuit from the Eastern District of Michigan to this District, St. Jude argued that the retaliation claim\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   \"relate to\" the agreement, and Hall maintains that St. Jude should not be permitted to argue now that the retaliation claim does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   relate to the agreement. Hall's argument is unavailing. Judicial estoppel prevents a party from adopting a position that clearly is inconsistent with an earlier position that the party persuaded the court to accept, and from which that party would derive an unfair advantage.\n   <em>\n    Warner Bros. Entm't, Inc. v. X One X Prods.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175232\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/971/#p979\">\n    840 F.3d 971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 979 (8th Cir. 2016). But St. Jude's earlier position-that the broad forum-selection clause requires the parties to litigate\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   Minnesota-is not clearly inconsistent with St. Jude's present position that the narrow governing-law clause does not require the\n   <em>\n    application\n   </em>\n   of Minnesota law to the retaliation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inacom Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090542\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/683/#p687\">\n    254 F.3d at 687-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (contrasting a broad clause, which applies to all rights and duties\n   <em>\n    relating\n   </em>\n   to an agreement, with a narrow clause, which provides that an agreement itself is\n   <em>\n    governed\n   </em>\n   by a certain state's law) (citing\n   <em>\n    Caton v. Leach Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536971\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/896/939/\">\n    896 F.2d 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 943 n.3 (5th Cir. 1990) ). And no court adopted St. Jude's earlier position. After St. Jude moved to transfer this lawsuit from the Eastern District of Michigan to this District, Hall\n   <em>\n    stipulated\n   </em>\n   to the transfer. The order compelling the transfer did not address the merits of any argument by St. Jude. St. Jude is not judicially estopped from arguing that the governing-law clause does not apply to Hall's retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In short, the governing-law clause in the agreement does not apply to the retaliation claim because the claim sounds in tort and the Court can resolve the claim without interpreting the terms of the agreement. As the governing-law clause does not apply,\n   the Court employs Minnesota's choice-of-law analysis to determine whether to apply Michigan law or Minnesota law to the retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Minnesota's Choice-of-Law Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   St. Jude argues that Minnesota's choice-of-law analysis provides for the application of Michigan law to the retaliation claim. Hall counters that Minnesota's choice-of-law analysis mandates that the Court apply Minnesota law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   When performing a choice-of-law analysis under Minnesota law, a court determines whether there is a conflict between the laws of the states in question, evaluates whether each state's law can constitutionally be applied, and considers five choice-influencing factors to determine which state's law to apply.\n   <em>\n    Jepson v.

Here, each state's cause of action for retaliation differs. Under Minnesota law, a plaintiff need only allege a good-faith belief that the action the employer asked the plaintiff to perform violated the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phipps v.

Under Michigan law, however, a plaintiff must allege that the required action would actually violate a law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Piasecki v. City of Hamtramck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1091180\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/249/37/\">\n    249 Mich.App. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20N.W.2d%20885\">\n    640 N.W.2d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 888 (2001). There is a conflict between each state's law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To apply a state's substantive law in a constitutionally permissible manner, the state must have a significant contact or aggregation of contacts with the parties or events such that the choice of the state's law is neither arbitrary nor fundamentally unfair.\n   <em>\n    Jepson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10594964\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/513/467/#p469\">\n    513 N.W.2d at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Hall is a resident of Michigan who was employed to work in Michigan for St. Jude, an organization authorized to conduct business in Michigan.

Hall argues that the recall exception does not apply because he \"is not a person with responsibility for the recalled product\" and he is not personally under the FDA's jurisdiction. But Hall provides no legal authority in support of a determination that he, an individual employed by a medical-device manufacturer subject to the FDA's jurisdiction, is not also subject to the FDA's jurisdiction for the work he performs. Hall contends that the computer containing information about patients who had received the recalled product also contained identifiable health information for individuals not affected by the recall. Because he\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have obtained private information unrelated to the recall, Hall argues, any use of the computer would have violated HIPAA. Hall's argument is untethered to any legal authority. That one has access to protected information is not synonymous with the requirement to\n   <em>\n    unlawfully\n   </em>\n   access that information. In short, Hall alleges no facts and cites no legal authority to support his contention that accessing private health information for the purposes of effectuating a device recall would have violated HIPAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Hall fails to allege facts that support his claim that any of the actions he refused to undertake would have been unlawful. For this reason, Hall fails to state a claim for retaliation under Michigan law.
