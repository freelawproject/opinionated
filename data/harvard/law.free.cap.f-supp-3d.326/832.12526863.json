Also at issue are two motions that were filed by Plaintiffs in response to Defendants' motions: (1) Plaintiffs' unopposed motion to dismiss two counts of the Amended Complaint (Filing No. 33), which will be granted; and (2) Plaintiffs' motion to file evidence under restricted access (Filing No. 39), which will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs, Lisa Stamm (\"Stamm\") and Vanessa Humaran (\"Humaran\"), are employed by the Nebraska Crime Commission (\"Commission\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is not a party to this action. Named as Defendants are the Sheriff of Cheyenne County, Nebraska, John Jenson (\"Jenson\"), the Chief of Police of the City of Scottsbluff, Nebraska, Kevin Spencer (\"Spencer\"), and the Sheriff of Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska, Mark Overman (\"Overman\"), together with the political subdivisions they each represent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Humaran claims her personal information stored on the Nebraska Criminal Justice Information System (\"NCJIS\"), which is maintained by the Commission, was illegally accessed by Spencer in June and September 2016, and was then unlawfully distributed to Jenson and Overman, to other employees or officials of their political subdivisions, and possibly to law enforcement agencies in other counties in western Nebraska (Amended Complaint [Filing No. 24], \u00b6\u00b6 22, 25). Similarly, Stamm claims her personal information on NCJIS was illegally accessed by Jenson in June 2017 and then unlawfully disseminated (Amended Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 31, 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Stamm also claims that Overman and Spencer filed frivolous written complaints with the Nebraska Attorney General about Stamm's private postings on Facebook regarding the use of medicinal marijuana, and she alleges on information and belief that her Facebook account was illegally accessed (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 27). In addition, Stamm alleges on information and belief that one or more Defendants made \"harassing, threatening and intimidating\" telephone calls to her during July and August 2017, calling her a \"cop hater\" and telling her to \"quit putting dead babies on the highway.\" (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 30) She also alleges upon information and belief that one or more Defendants used unlawful means to obtain her private telephone number (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The NCJIS searches on Humaran were conducted \"shortly after\" she assumed some of the duties of administering the Justice Assistant Grant (\"JAG\"), which for approximately 25 years had provided funding for the Western Intelligence Narcotic Group (\"WING\"), a drug task force comprised of law enforcement agencies located in the Nebraska panhandle. Participating agencies included the Scottsbluff Police Department and the Cheyenne County and Scotts Bluff County Sheriff's Departments (Amended Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17, 24). JAG funding for the WING program was discontinued in May 2017 (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sometime during 2016, Humaran was \"a member of the JAG strategic planning group, attend[ed] JAG meetings, and participat[ed] in the staff review group that made recommendations for funding JAG programs such as the WING program.\" (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 13) Humaran does not allege that she actually played any role in making a funding recommendation for the WING program, but she claims the NCJIS searches Defendant Spencer performed in June and September 2016 were done \"for the sole purpose of harassing and intimidating [her].\" (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 24) However, there are no facts alleged to indicate in what manner she was harassed or intimidated by the searches. Humaran states that \"at all time alleged\" she was the Juvenile Justice Administrator for the Commission, but also alleges that in 2017 she became the Assistant Grant Administrator (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 13). Again, there are no facts alleged to show that she actually played any part in discontinuing JAG funding for the WING program in her capacity as Assistant Grant Administrator, or, for that matter, that she was subjected to any allegedly unlawful conduct during 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Stamm \"at all time alleged\" was the Grants Division Chief for the Commission, and her duties \"also included administering the Justice Assistance Grant which is funded through the U.S. Department of Justice.\" (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 12) There is no indication of what role, if any, Stamm played in the discontinuance of JAG funding for the WING program, but it is alleged that \"[f]ollowing the defunding of the WING grant in May, 2017 due to their egregious and habitual non-compliance, Plaintiff Stamm has been subjected to unlawful, intimidating, threatening, and harassing conduct by the Defendants,\" including the complaints made to the Attorney General about her private Facebook postings and the telephone calls she received in July and August 2017 (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Both Plaintiffs also assert a gender-based equal protection claim against all Defendants, alleging that \"[m]ale members of the Nebraska Crime Commission ... who worked with the Defendants on their unsuccessful grant application, ... [or] who voted to deny the WING grant were not subjected to unlawful NCJIS searches\n   or the other unlawful actions.\" (Amended Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 35, 52) It is further claimed that \"due to the Plaintiffs' gender (female), Defendants Jenson, Spencer and Overman by and through a mutual understanding and meeting of the minds, sought to deprive the female Plaintiffs equal protections under the law through their conspiracy and together they conspired to prevent by force, intimidation, or threat the Plaintiffs from discharging their duties and/or hindering, impeding or interrupting their official duties and/or conspiring to deprive Plaintiffs of their statutorily and constitutionally protected rights to equal protection, equal privileges, immunities, free speech (Stamm only), privacy, liberty, and against unlawful search and seizure in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 34) In addition, a section 1983 conspiracy claim is asserted against all Defendants (Amended Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 39, 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint contains a total of ten claims (or counts), seven of which are alleged by both Plaintiffs against all Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Defendants have violated Plaintiffs' constitutional and statutory right to privacy in contradiction of the Constitutions of the State of Nebraska (Art. 1, \u00a7 3), the United States of America (14\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Amendment) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Following a police investigation into the complaint, Eagle pleaded guilty in an Arkansas trial court to felony theft of property. Eagle had no prior criminal record and entered his plea pursuant to an enactment that allows Arkansas judges to indefinitely defer further proceedings and place first time felons on a tentative term of probation. If the defendant violates the requirements of his probation, the judge may declare him guilty and impose the punishment otherwise provided by law. On the other hand, the statute directs the court to dismiss the case and expunge the defendant's record if he \"fulfill[s] ... the terms and conditions of probation or [is] release[d] by the court prior to the termination period thereof.\" Moreover, these measures occur \"without court adjudication of guilt.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   The trial court accepted Eagle's plea and required him to spend forty-five days in the county jail, serve six years probation, and pay $25,000 in restitution .... Approximately three years later, a state judge terminated Eagle's probation and entered an order expunging his criminal record. The expungement decree expressly provided that it \"restored [Eagle] to [his] civil and constitutional rights as if [the felony theft of property] had never been committed,\" and as a matter of law it \"completely exonerate[d] [Eagle] of any criminal purpose.\" Additionally, the state legislature has decreed that an expunged record should be treated as confidential and released only to the individual whose record was expunged and, in certain circumstances, to judicial or law enforcement personnel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   After the state court struck the felony theft of property from Eagle's record, he began working as an auditor for the City. In the course of his employment, Eagle performed an audit of certain Jonesboro Police Department (\"JPD\") records and conducted a police salary survey to determine whether local officers were receiving competitive wages. The fruits of Eagle's labor, however, apparently displeased some law enforcement workers; several curious officers accessed the National Crime Information Center (\"NCIC\") and the Arkansas Crime Information Center (\"ACIC\") computer systems in an effort to confirm rumors that Eagle had a felony record. State guidelines governing the use of the ACIC system dictate that the computer network should, as relevant here, only\n   be available to \"criminal justice agencies in their official capacity,\" and the pertinent federal provision restricts NCIC access to \"criminal justice agencies for criminal justice purposes[.]\" Despite these restrictions, JPD was not carrying on an official investigation of Eagle's criminal activity at the time the officers in this case made their inquiries. Further, because the responsible authorities had failed to file notification of the expungement of Eagle's record, the report obtained by the officers did not indicate that the listed felony offense had been stricken.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   This information regarding Eagle's criminal history was for some time also available from at least one other source. Before receiving belated notice that the felony had been removed from Eagle's record, the Arkansas State Police, in response to requests made pursuant to the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act, released to certain members of the public, including at least four reporters, unaltered copies of Eagle's criminal case file.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   On August 16, 1993, in an admitted effort to \"throw doubt on [Eagle's police salary] survey results,\" appellant Rohnny McDaniel at a Jonesboro City Council meeting revealed the auditor's criminal history by publicly reading the following excerpt from Eagle's case file:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   At approximately 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, January 15, 1987, an investigator met with the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney and was advised that he had received information of a possible theft of materials from Ridout Lumber Company. According to the Deputy Prosecutor, it was believed that David Eagle had stolen building materials. On March 5, 1987, David Eagle pled guilty to one count of 41-2203, theft of property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Interestingly, McDaniel is the only individual appellant who did not personally access the NCIC/ACIC computer systems to verify the rumors about Eagle, but Eagle maintains that McDaniel gained his knowledge through the efforts of his police colleagues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Eagle subsequently initiated this action against sundry JPD officers, individually and in their official capacities, and the City. Eagle asserts that the individual state actors violated his constitutional right to privacy when they conducted unjustified searches on the ACIC/NCIC computer databases and by causing the public disclosure of information about his expunged criminal record. Also, he contends that the City is liable because these constitutional violations were a result of the municipality's failure to properly train its employees in the use of the computer networks and because the alleged invasion of privacy occurred pursuant to an official custom or policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046028\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/620/#p628\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046028\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/620/#p628\">\n    at 622-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (statutory and regulatory citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Eighth Circuit determined that the disclosure of Eagle's criminal history did not infringe upon his right to confidentiality because \"[f]ar from being 'inherently private,' the details of Eagle's prior guilty plea are by their very nature matters within the public domain.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046028\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/620/#p628\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046028\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/620/#p628\">\n    at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While troubled by the officers' conduct in accessing Eagle's criminal record from the NCIC and ACIC computer networks, the Court of Appeals also determined that their searches did not violate Eagle's constitutional right to privacy. The Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [W]e must not forget the type of database accessed in this case. Eagle has alleged that the officers used the ACIC and NCIC systems to search his criminal history files. Regulations on the use of these computer networks provide that criminal history information includes \"identifiable descriptions and notations\n   of arrests, detentions, indictments, informations, or other formal criminal charges, and any disposition arising therefrom, sentencing, correctional supervision, and release.\" Additionally, the Department of Justice has stated that criminal history information in the NCIC does not include \"[i]ntelligence or investigative information (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , suspected criminal activity, associates, hangouts, financial information, ownership of property and vehicles).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   As we have discussed earlier in this opinion, the type of information contained within these criminal history files is not the sort of data over which an individual can successfully assert a right to privacy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <em>\n    Nilson v.

Each count merely states a theory of recovery and a claim for damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Because this case involves multiple Plaintiffs and Defendants, and different transactions or occurrences, this form of pleading does not strictly comply with Rule 10(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that \"[a] party must state its claims or defenses in numbered paragraphs, each limited so far as practicable to a single set of circumstances.\" For example, in Count 1, the alleged invasion of privacy involves at least three separate sets of circumstances: (1) Spencer accessing Humaran's NCJIS information; (2) Jenson accessing Stamm's NCJIS information; and (3) Overman and Spencer obtaining Stamm's Facebook posting. Humaran and Stamm cannot assert a claim for a violation of the other's privacy, nor can Jenson, Overman, and Spencer be held liable for each other's actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Despite this pleading problem, the court believes the Amended Complaint is understandable because the factual allegations are set out in separate numbered paragraphs that are limited to a single set of circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1324 (3d ed. 2011) (\"Common sense suggests that a district court should have discretion to order separation when there is a possibility of confusion and to follow the text of the rule and not order separation when the existing pleading is comprehensible.\"). And, more importantly, because the facts alleged fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted against any Defendant, there is no need to require Plaintiffs to separate their claims in order to conform to Rule 10(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In summary, the Fourteenth Amendment \"right to privacy\" claims alleged by Plaintiffs against Sheriff Jenson, Chief Spencer, and Sheriff Overman in their individual capacities will be dismissed based on the doctrine of qualified immunity. Plaintiffs' claim brought against these Defendants in their official capacities, and against Cheyenne County, the City of Scottbluff, and Scotts Bluff County will be dismissed because the facts alleged are not sufficient to create a plausible inference that Plaintiffs were deprived of their Fourteenth Amendment \"privacy\" rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.
