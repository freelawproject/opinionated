Before the Court is Synaptek's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue or, in the alternative, to transfer this action to the Eastern District of Virginia. (Dkt. 17.) For the following reasons, the motion is DENIED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Synoptek is a limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of California and its principal place of business is in Irvine, California. (Compl. \u00b6 1.) \"Synoptek provides information technology management services and support to organizations worldwide,\" including \"core infrastructure management, management and hosting of cloud services, in-depth security tools and services, using advanced toolsets supported by our 24x7 Enterprise\n   Operations Centers, IT consulting, custom development, applications support, business continuity/disaster recovery services and 24x7 end-user service and support.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Synoptek is the owner of the SYNOPTEK trademark, U.S. Trademark\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%203%2C424%2C720%2C\">\n    Registration No. 3,424,720,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   filed on August 7, 2006, and registered as of May 6, 2008; it began using the mark as early as January 1, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Synaptek is a Virginia corporation with its principal place of business in Reston, Virginia. (Dkt. 16-2 [hereinafter \"Jinnah Decl.\"] \u00b6 1.) It provides information technology services including providing wifi installation and support. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13.) Synaptek primarily works as a government contractor; it was one of several subcontractors to Harris Corporation on a contract to provide wifi services for the Department of Veterans Affairs (\"VA\") and specifically in the VA's 331 medical centers throughout the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) In that capacity, Synaptek field engineers would first perform wireless site surveys \"to determine signal penetration throughout the facilities in order to accurately determine the placement of access points to achieve the best wireless coverage.\" (Dkt. 25 Ex. 1 at 172.) Those surveys were performed onsite. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Then, Synaptek employees would take the resulting map of the entire facility offsite, where senior core engineers would review it, process it, and then submit it to Harris Corporation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 173.) Harris Corporation, and ultimately the federal government, would review the Synaptek plan for wifi implementation, and return it either with approval or with requested changes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 173.) To incorporate changes into the plan, a return to the site could conceivably be necessary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 173.) Once a wifi implementation plan is finalized, then Harris Corporation employees will go to the site to install the components; Synaptek core engineers would monitor installation remotely. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 174.) After installation, there is post-installation validation testing done by Synaptek field engineers; any post-installation modifications were done remotely by core engineers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 174-75.) Some final documentation is prepared and delivered to Harris Corporation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 176;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 25 Exs. 10, 18-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Synaptek followed this procedure at seven or eight VA medical centers in California, including a facility in Long Beach, California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 176; Jinnah Decl. \u00b6 14.) Four of Synaptek's former employees reside in California-Mr. Talamantes (who did not work onsite at any VA medical center), Mr. Mowat (a field engineer who worked onsite at VA medical centers inside and outside of California), Mr. Oatham (a principal wireless engineer and later a CORE engineer, overseeing site surveys, designs, and implementation), and Mr. Goecke (employed to support a Washington D.C. customer who was not involved in, nor did he work with, California VA medical centers). (Dkt. 25 Ex. 5 at 9.) In addition, Synaptek was the prime contractor with the Defense Logistics Agency in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; in that capacity, Synaptek commissioned a subcontractor based in Manteca, CA, to perform electrical services work at a data center in Tracy, California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Finally, fourteen other current or former Synaptek employees are not California residents but likely were called upon and dispatched by Synaptek to support the work at California VA medical centers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7; Dkt. 25 Ex. 1 at 131-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the duration of his employment with Synaptek, Mr. Goecke worked out of his Tracy, California home. (Dkt. 25 Ex. 2 at 21-22.) His offer of employment letter was sent by Synaptek to his home, and it contained both Synaptek's name and logo. (Dkt. 25 Ex. 6.) Synaptek also provided him with business cards containing its name and logo. (Dkt. 25 Ex. 2 at 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Finally, Synaptek sent him a jacket with its logo and name embroidered on it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Oatham received his employment letter by email at his home in San Jose, California. (Dkt. 25 Ex. 3 at 10.) He was recruited by Synaptek and was interviewed twice before being offered employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) Synaptek gave him with business cards, when he would arrive at a site he would introduce himself as a Synaptek employee, and he had a Synaptek email address. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21, 24-25, 37.) He also had a similar jacket to Mr. Goecke's and he would try to wear it on the first day he worked at a site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-46, 74.) In general, Mr. Oatham would travel to a site for two weeks and then work from his California home for two weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.) He was given a corporate card to pay for his airfare and hotels; Synaptek paid him a per diem and reimbursed him for other expenses such as his cell phone and internet connection after he filled out a Synaptek reimbursement form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28, 38-39.) Synaptek provided him with a laptop and monitor, shipped to his home via Federal Express, and at least some of his work involved filling out Synaptek-specific forms that had Synaptek's name and logo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Synaptek sent equivalent employment letters to its other two California employees. (Dkt. 25 Exs. 9, 10.) During the time Synaptek employed California residents, Synaptek reported taxable income to the State of California. (Jinnah Decl. \u00b6 15; Dkt. 25 Ex. 2 at 26; Dkt. 25 Ex. 3 at 74-75.) Finally, Synaptek maintains a website, www.synaptekcorp.com, which is accessible in California, and through which California individuals could contact Synaptek. (Jinnah Decl. \u00b6 8; Dkt. 25 Ex. 1 at 39.) However, Synaptek does not sell services through its website, and it does not otherwise advertise in California or solicit business in California.

(Dkt. 25 Exs. 6, 7, 8, 9;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p472\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2 at 25;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p472\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 at 34;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p472\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1 at 135-36.) The fact that some portion of these contacts occurred at VA medical centers, even assuming that all of such centers constitute federal enclaves, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16-1 [hereinafter \"Mot.\"] at 7; Dkt. 30 at 12), is irrelevant to the Court's analysis,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swanson Painting Co. v.

Frankly, the Court is perplexed that Synaptek would describe its contacts with California as \"attenuated,\" would characterize its employees' use of California infrastructure as not invoking the benefit and protection of California laws, and would argue that its connection to California is caused unilaterally by Synoptek. (Mot. at 7-8 (repeatedly invoking\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   , which held that actions\n   <em>\n    in a foreign state\n   </em>\n   that caused harm to a forum state's residents who were in that foreign state when they returned to the forum state did not suffice for the exercise of jurisdiction, for the proposition that Synaptek's interactions with California residents\n   <em>\n    in California\n   </em>\n   is irrelevant for jurisdictional analysis).) Finally, as to foreseeability of harm, when a party brings a claim for infringement of intellectual property, the Ninth Circuit has held that \"[i]t is foreseeable that the loss will be inflicted ... in the forum where the infringement took place.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Washington Shoe Co. v.

Synoptek has demonstrated that Synaptek used the allegedly infringing mark, its name, in California through,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , reports, presentations, business cards, emails, and clothing. (Dkt. 25 Exs. 10-16, 18-27;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655061\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/668/#p679\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 at 45-46.) Accordingly, Synaptek, by purposefully directing its actions to California, knew the infringement was likely to occur there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The next requirement is that the claims at issue \"arise[ ] out of or relate[ ] to the defendant's forum-related activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Picot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074343\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/1206/#p1211\">\n    780 F.3d at 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Contrary to Synaptek's argument that the relevant activities must take place\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   California, (Mot. at 8), the Ninth Circuit has made clear that actions outside of a forum state that cause harm in a forum state suffice for the \"but for\" test,\n   <em>\n    Harris Rutsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140262\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/328/1122/#p1128\">\n    328 F.3d at 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"B &amp; C had ongoing contacts with the forum state over a four-year period, and its alleged tortious conduct\n   <em>\n    in London\n   </em>\n   had the effect of injuring ASR in California. But for B &amp; C's conduct, this injury would not have occurred. We are satisfied that ASR's claims arise out of B &amp; C's California related activities.\"). The Court is once again perplexed that Synaptek would claim that, despite it hiring California residents to work in California, sending other employees to California to work at California VA medical centers, and engaging a California company as a subcontractor, \"Synoptek's dispute with Synaptek has nothing to do with California.\" (Dkt. 30 at 13.) Simply stated, Synaptek is wrong that the \"but for\" test mandates that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   potentially actionable conduct occur in California. (Mot. at 8.) The fact that Synaptek\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   used their name at 181 VA medical centers outside of California does not mean personal jurisdiction cannot arise in California. (\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140262\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/328/1122/#p1128\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) On the contrary, a \"single forum state contact can support jurisdiction if the cause of action arises out of that particular purposeful contact of the defendant with the forum state.\"\n   <em>\n    Yahoo!\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881117\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/1199/#p1205\">\n    433 F.3d at 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, but for Synaptek's actions directed toward California, Synoptek's cause of action in California would not have arisen, and accordingly the relatedness requirement is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As Synoptek has satisfied the first two elements, the burden now shifts to Synaptek to \"set forth a compelling case that the exercise of jurisdiction would not be reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    CollegeSource, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3821123\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/653/1066/#p1076\">\n    653 F.3d at 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Courts in the Ninth Circuit evaluate seven factors in making that determination: \"(1) the extent of defendants' purposeful injection into the forum state's affairs; (2) the burden on the defendant of defending in the forum; (3) the extent of conflict with the sovereignty of the defendant's state; (4) the forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute; (5) the most efficient judicial resolution of the controversy; (6) the importance of the forum to the plaintiff's interest in convenient and effective relief; and (7) the existence of an alternative forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Dole Food Co., Inc. v. Watts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11436760\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/1104/#p1114\">\n    303 F.3d 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1114 (9th Cir. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Synaptek has not set forth a compelling case that exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable. Even though work was primarily done at\n   <em>\n    VA\n   </em>\n   medical facilities in California, (Mot. at 9), as discussed above, that does not negate Synaptek purposefully injecting itself into California's affairs. Likewise, litigation in California is inherently somewhat burdensome on corporations based elsewhere; if Synaptek's purported burden (having its corporate leaders travel away from the corporate headquarters), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10), sufficed to preclude jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction would never exist and companies would only be able to be sued in their principal\n   place of business. Sovereignty is neutral as there is no conflict between Virginia and California in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11436760\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/1104/#p1114\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 25 at 15.) California has a strong interest in providing its residents with an effective means of redress for torts. In addition, while the early stage of the case and Synaptek's claim that fifteen witnesses will have to travel from Virginia to California indicate that Virginia would be at least as efficient as California, the significance of those facts is mitigated by the fact that this factor is only weighted slightly given advances in communication and travel.\n   <em>\n    Panavision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191776\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/141/1316/#p1321\">\n    141 F.3d at 1323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Litigating in California is important to Synoptek's interest in convenient and effective relief, given the presence of many of its witnesses in or near California. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 25-1 \u00b6\u00b6 5-9.) Finally, while the Eastern District of Virginia is an alternative forum, the mere fact that its docket is lighter than the Central District of California does not make jurisdiction in this Court unreasonable and the traditional elements considered in this factor (location of evidence and witnesses,\n   <em>\n    Panavision\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191776\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/141/1316/#p1321\">\n    141 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1323 ), is neutral, as there is evidence and witnesses in both fora. For these reasons, this Court has personal jurisdiction over Synaptek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Venue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Synaptek argues that this case should be dismissed for improper venue or, in the alternative, transferred to the Eastern District of Virginia. (Mot. at 12-17.) Once venue is challenged, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that venue is proper.\n   <em>\n    Piedmont Label Co. v. Sun Garden Packing Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"493819\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/598/491/#p496\">\n    598 F.2d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 496 (9th Cir. 1979).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Venue is governed by 28 U.S.C. 1391.

Since Synaptek is a corporation, it is deemed to reside in this district for venue analysis if its contacts in the Central District of California would subject it to personal jurisdiction in this district (or if such contacts, while not meeting the threshold of personal jurisdiction, are more substantial than its contacts in any other California district).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Synoptek has demonstrated that Synaptek hired an employee in Long Beach and provided approximately eight months of services to the Long Beach VA medical center under its name. (Dkt. 25 Exs. 8, 20.) Those contacts would suffice for personal jurisdiction in the absence of any other California contacts, and accordingly venue is proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Thus, Synaptek's motion to dismiss for improper venue is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Even given proper venue in this district, a \"district court has discretion to transfer a civil action \"for the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice,\" to \"any other district or division where it might have been brought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Under section 1404(a), two findings are required for proper transfer: (1) the transferee district court is one where the action might have been brought, and (2) the convenience of the parties and witnesses and the interest of justice favor transfer.\n   <em>\n    Hatch v.

Regarding the convenience of the parties and witnesses, and the interests of justice, a court may consider several factors in determining whether the interests of justice favor transfer, including: \"(1) the location where the relevant agreements were negotiated and executed, (2) the state that is most familiar with the governing law, (3) the\n   plaintiff's choice of forum, (4) the respective parties' contacts with the forum, (5) the contacts relating to the plaintiff's cause of action in the chosen forum, (6) the differences in the costs of litigation in the two forums, (7) the availability of compulsory process to compel attendance of unwilling non-party witnesses, and (8) the ease of access to sources of proof,\" in addition to the relevant public policy of the forum state.\n   <em>\n    Jones v. GNC Franchising, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1743591\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/211/495/#p498\">\n    211 F.3d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 498-99 (9th Cir. 2000). The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating that transfer is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Cal. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Synaptek has not met its burden of demonstrating that transfer is appropriate. Even though Synaptek is located in Virginia, Synoptek is located in California, so the convenience to the parties, the convenience to the witnesses, the availability of compulsory process, and the location of the evidence is neutral. As the claims here are based substantially on federal law, neither state is more familiar with the governing law and that factor is neutral. The parties' contacts with the respective forums counsels against transfer as Synaptek directed its activities to California and Synoptek is based in this district, (Dkt. 25-1 \u00b6 4), while there is no evidence that Synoptek has contacts with the Eastern District of Virginia. Plaintiff's choice of forum in California also counsels against transfer. Contacts relating to Synoptek's cause of action slightly weigh toward transfer, as the decision to use the name Synaptek, to hire California employees, and to direct employees to California was made in the Eastern District of Virginia, while the actual alleged infringement occurred,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , in this district. Finally, the costs of litigation are likely slightly higher in this district than in the Eastern District of Virginia due to this district's heavier caseload. However, given that this district is the busiest district court in the nation, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. Ex. A), the Court declines to weigh this factor heavily as it would always counsel for transfer. When all these factors are considered, Synaptek has not met its burden: the majority of factors are neutral, two factors weakly support transfer and two strongly support rejecting transfer. The Court accordingly declines to transfer this action to the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Synaptek's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, to dismiss for improper venue, and in the alternative to transfer venue to the Eastern District of Virginia is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Having read and considered the papers presented by the parties, the Court finds this matter appropriate for disposition without a hearing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.
