We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-18\">A jury convicted Tolliver for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, aiding and abetting that possession, and carrying a firearm during those drug trafficking offenses. The conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Tolliver, </em>No. 93-04438, 19 F.3d 16 (5th Cir.1994)(unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-19\">In 1996, Tolliver filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, challenging his conviction for carrying a firearm. The motion was granted. His request to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion was denied. (Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), permission must be received from a court of appeals to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b923-20\">In November 1999, Tolliver filed the \u00a7 2241 petition in issue, contending \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective, because the motion would be denied as successive. The petition was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-21\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-22\">Section \u00a7 2255 is the primary means of collaterally attacking a federal sentence. <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990). Section \u00a7 2241 is used to attack the manner in which a sentence is executed. <em>United States v. Cleto, </em>956 F.2d 83, 84 (5th Cir.1992). A \u00a7 2241 petition which attacks errors that occur at trial or sentencing is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>properly construed under \u00a7 2255. <em>Solsona v. Warden, F.C.I., </em>821 F.2d 1129, 1131\u201432 (5th Cir.1987). Nevertheless, a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking a federally imposed sentence may be considered <em>if </em>the petitioner establishes the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>Cox, </em>911 F.2d at 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">We join our sister circuits that have held that a prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion, or the inability to meet AEDPA\u2019s \u201csecond or successive\u201d requirement, does <em>not </em>make \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 757-58 (6th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Barrett, </em>178 F.3d 34, 50 (1st Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 120 S.Ct. 1208, 145 L.Ed.2d 1110 (2000); <em>Caravalho v. Pugh, </em>177 F.3d 1177, 1179 (10th Cir.1999); <em>In re Davenport, </em>147 F.3d 605, 608 (7th Cir.1998). Tolliver is simply attempting to circumvent the limitations on filing successive \u00a7 2255 motions. Correspondingly, his contention that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, because it would be dismissed as successive, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the denial of \u00a7 2241 habeas relief is</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
