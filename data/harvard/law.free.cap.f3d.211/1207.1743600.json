This argument, however, is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Lowery, </em>166 F.3d 1119 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-15\">Riley\u2019s second argument is that he is entitled to a new trial because the Government presented perjured testimony. Following Riley\u2019s conviction, but before his sentencing, the Government submitted a letter to the district court explaining that a coconspirator who testified against Riley may not have told the truth about another coconspirator\u2019s participation in one of the robberies. Based on this new evidence, Riley filed a motion for a new trial. We review the district court\u2019s denial of this motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>13 F.3d 1464, 1472 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-16\">Riley argues that the fact that the co-conspirator committed perjury undermines the jury\u2019s verdict such that a new trial would probably produce a different result. The Government responds that the discovery of the witness\u2019s perjury is merely impeaching evidence on a collateral issue and insufficient to warrant a new trial. We conclude that Riley has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying a new trial under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-17\">Next, Riley argues that the district court erred by refusing to produce an imprisoned coconspirator to testify for the defense and by refusing to'admit evidence regarding the mandatory minimum sentences for firearm possession, the putative-witness coconspirator\u2019s criminal record, and the plea agreements of Riley\u2019s coconspirators. We review these rulings for abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Wright, </em>63 F.3d 1067 (11th Cir.1995) and <em>United States v. Walker, </em>59 F.3d 1196, 1197 (11th Cir.1995), and conclude that Riley has failed to establish any such abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-18\">Finally, Riley argues that the district court erred by imposing an enhanced penalty under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) based on its finding, at sentencing, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>Riley carried a semiautomatic assault weapon. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the statute de novo. <em>See United States v. McArthur, </em>108 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.1997). Riley argues that the type of firearm being carried is an element of the offense which must be established beyond a reasonable doubt at trial, and is not merely a sentencing consideration. Riley contends that <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999) calls into question our holding in <em>United States v. Alborola-Rodriguez, </em>153 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir.1998) (concluding that under \u00a7 924(c)(1) the type of firearm is a valid sentencing factor, not an element of the offense). The Government responds that <em>Jones </em>does not affect <em>Alborola-Rodriguez </em>because \u00a7 924(c)(1) reflects Congress\u2019s clear intent to treat the type of firearm being carried as a sentencing factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-4\">Our understanding of <em>Jones </em>concurs with the Government\u2019s. We have interpreted <em>Jones </em>to instruct that when a court finds a statute and its legislative history unclear, the court should resolve the doubt in favor of the defendant and consider any factor that increases the maximum penalty for the offense to be an element of the offense. <em>See United States v. Hester, </em>199 F.3d 1287, 1291-92 (11th Cir.2000). <em>Pre-Jones, </em>we concluded, based on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis of the structure and legislative history of \u00a7 924(c)(1), that the type of firearm being carried was a sentencing factor, not an element of the offense. <em>See Alborola-Rodriguez, </em>153 F.3d at 1272, citing <em>United States v. Branch, </em>91 F.3d 699, 740 (5th Cir.1996). Moreover, \u00a7 924(c)(1) has been amended since <em>Alborola-Rodriguez, </em>and the amended version of the statute has made it even clearer that the type of firearm being carried is a sentencing factor and not an element of the offense. <em>Jones </em>does not alter our interpretation of \u00a7 924(c)(1). <em>Accord United States v. Eads, </em>191 F.3d 1206 (10th Cir.1999), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 120 S.Ct. 2663, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -(2000); <em>United States v. Baldwin, </em>186 F.3d 99 (2d Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, Baldwin v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 120 S.Ct. 558, 145 L.Ed.2d 433 (1999); <em>United States v.
