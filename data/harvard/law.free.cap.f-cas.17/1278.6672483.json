In this case it would be useless to give an opinion at length, as the law which governs it has been long and uniformly settled. We do not think that the attorney in fact of an executor or administrator can maintain an action for the benefit of the estate in his own name, in any instance, and therefore the demurrer, setting forth this ground to defeat the action, should have been sustained.
