The surveyor states, that \u201cat the time of making the survey, T. Armstrong made pretensions to the land, under an order No. 64, but the special order, on which I returned the survey, was not then come to hand.\u201d Campbell died; and his widow and administratrix, by order of the orphan\u2019s court, legally sold the above land to James Christie, in 1773, which she regularly conveyed to him. In 1796, Bobert Milligan was appointed attorney in fact by Christie, to sell this land, and in the year 1800, he sold and conveyed it to the lessor of the plaintiff. . It appeared in evidence, that when Christie purchased the land, in 1773, he placed upon it a servant man and his wife, indentured for five years, in order to retain the possession, and take care of the land. The servant man died before the expiration of the five years, and his widow married one Hadabaugh who continued to live on the land, without paying rent, till about six years ago, when he left it, and the defendants [Dickson and others] took possession. In 1796, Hadabaugh came to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>attorney of Christie, in order to buy this land, and offered as much for it as it was afterwards sold for, but it was not then accepted. The defendants claimed under a lottery order, dated April 3d, 1769, No. 64, for three hundred acres, on the forks of the Conemaugh and M\u2019Gee\u2019s run, to include a spring. The defendants proved a settlement, near twelve months prior to April, 1769; in March of that year, Campbell dis-seized him, and made improvements, and continued to hold it, before and after his survey. It was proved that the land in question is fifteen miles from Ligonier, and that there was no fort at all on the Conemaugh in 1769, nor does the land join Samuel Duncan; in all other respects, the survey fits the order of April 1st, 1769. It was also proved, that no such order as the one recited in the survey of May 24th, 1769, was to be found on the books of the land office, or amongst the papers. That of the 1st of April, was found duly recorded. It did not appear, that either of the parties had paid any thing to the state for this land. The power of attorney from Christie to Milligan, or rather an exemplificatilon of it, was certified by the lord provost and chief' magistrate of Edinburgh, to have been acknowledged by Christie before him, and was certified under the city seal.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A28\">[NOTE. The case was removed to the supreme court unon a division of opinion of the judges as to the admissibility of the power of attorney from Christie to Milligan, but the case was sent back under an agreement of the parties that this single question should be decided.

Second; the lessor of the plaintiff, having only a survey, without payment of the consideration to the proprietors or to the state, has not obtained a legal title to authorize a recovery in ejectment. Third; the plaintiff has not a right of entry by possession, because it does not appear that those who held the possession, held under Christie; nor did they pay rent; which were necessary, in order to make their possession the possession of Christie.

Whether the survey for Campbell does or does not fit the application, is a question of some difficulty, but you may discharge your minds from this subject, since the plaintiff places his chief reliance upon his possessory-title; and if that will not support him, he cannot recover in the present action upon his paper title, for that does not give him a legal title. The question, then, for your consideration, is, whether the plaintiff has shown a right of entry? From 1769 to 1778, it is clear, that the premises were in the possession of Campbell, under whom the lessor claims; or of Christie, by his servants. It does not appear that Hadabaugh paid rent to Christie; nor, from any positive declarations from him, whether he held under or adversely to Christie. Whether you will consider his offer, in 1796, to purchase the land, and his subsequent abandonment of it, as evidence of the former, or not, is the question. If you are of opinion that he held under Christie, then it is unimportant whether he paid rent, or not; and In that case, you should find for the plaintiff. If you think that he held in opposition to the title of Christie, then your verdict should be for the defendants, since an order and survey, without payment of the consideration, does not give a legal right of entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">Verdict for defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
