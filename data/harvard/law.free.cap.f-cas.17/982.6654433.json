It was admitted by the counsel on each side, that the fact was truly stated, and thereupon THE COURT ordered the bill to be dismissed, being of opinion that an alien enemy has no persona standi in judicio, and cannot prosecute any suit in the courts of this country. Daubigny v. Davallon, 2 Anstr. 462. Bill dismissed.</p><p id=\"b984-30\">Mr. Burrill, for complainant.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
