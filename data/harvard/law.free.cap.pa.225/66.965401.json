J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-8\">The petitioners are entitled under the will of the testator to the income of $15,000 each for life; on the death of the testator\u2019s wife or daughter, to the income for life to each of an additional sum of $5,000. The testator died December 30,1893. In February, 1903, the petitioners with other parties in interest, authorized by a writing in the nature of a power of attorney, counsel to represent them at the audit of the executor\u2019s account. By the adjudication of that account which was confirmed by agreement of counsel for all parties, on April 7, 1903, the sum of $30,000 invested in a certain mortgage of that amount, was set aside in the hands of the executors, to secure the payment of the aforesaid income to the petitioners, and the income has ever since been regularly paid. The petitioners aver that they received no notice of the audit nor of the award, and that their earliest knowledge of the action of the court, was had in January, 1908. They aver that the income payable to them, and the principal out of which it arises, are, by the terms of the will, charged upon the residuary estate, and that it was error to award to them the security in question; and they pray that a sum shall be secured to them upon the residuary estate, sufficient to yield an assured income free from all contingencies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-9\">Assuming the facts set up by the petitioners to be true, and their conclusions of law to be correct, their unexplained delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>of. four years and nine months, and their continuous receipt of income under the will during that period, are an acquiescence in the acts of the executors and of the court, which, of itself, effectually bars them from the relief prayed for: Scott\u2019s Appeal, 112 Pa. 427. They have not shown that they have suffered any loss nor incurred any risk by the acts now complained of. On the contrary, it is quite probable that the mortgage will yield a larger return than the income from the investments of the estate, which the testator directed to be averaged, and paid according to that average, to the cestuis que trusts.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ap_\">May 20, 1909:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">For the reasons stated, the petition for review is dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree dismissing the petition.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-7\"><em>Horace M.
