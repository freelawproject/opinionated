T., 1908, by plaintiffs, from order of C. P. Luzerne Co., June T., 1902, No. 129, refusing to take off nonsuit in case of E. W. Mulligan et al. v. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"APe\">Before Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Potter and Elkin, JJ.</judges>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A-B\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-5\">Trespass to recover damages for injury to land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\">At the trial the court entered a compulsory nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-7\">On a motion to take off the nonsuit Fuller, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-8\">Order of the court below denying motion to take off compulsory nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-9\">The action is trespass for damages inflicted upon plaintiffs by alleged negligence in construction and maintenance of a certain sewer, causing obstruction in the same and consequent overflow of water upon plaintiffs\u2019 property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-10\">Upon conclusion of plaintiffs\u2019 testimony, a motion for compulsory nonsuit was made on the grounds, (1) that the plaintiffs failed to prove any negligence on the part of the defendant which produced the damage and injury complained of in their declaration or statement filed; (2) the evidence \u00f3n the part of the plaintiffs shows that their damage or loss was caused by extraordinary flood or storm, for which the defendant is not responsible; (3) the plaintiffs failed to show that their sewer was built in an improper, defective or unworkmanlike manner or of improper materials; (4) the plaintiffs failed to show that the sewer was blocked, choked or obstructed, and that by reason thereof the water was cast upon their premises at the time of the flood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-11\">The Court said: This case presents three fundamental questions, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-12\">1. Was the sewer sufficient in capacity and condition at the time of the injury, February 28, 1902, to carry off what we will designate \u201cordinary water\u201d ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>2. If it was not sufficient to carry off ordinary water, then, was the water on February 28, 1902, extraordinary?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-4\">3. If the water was extraordinary, then, notwithstanding its extraordinary character, did defendant\u2019s negligence in failing to maintain a sewer of sufficient capacity and in proper condition to carry off ordinary water, concur with the extraordinary water as an actual producing cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 damage?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-5\">The testimony adduced by the plaintiffs establishes the fact that the water which caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injury on February 28,1902, was extraordinary in its character. It therefore devolved upon the plaintiffs to show that notwithstanding the extraordinary character of the water, the defendant\u2019s failure to maintain a sewer of sufficient capacity and in condition to carry off ordinary water on February 28,1902, was the actual producing cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-6\">I am of the opinion that the plaintiffs have failed to sustain this burden of proof by sufficient evidence to submit to the jury, and I must therefore sustain the motion for a compulsory nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-7\">Plaintiffs concede that the water was extraordinary in character and that, therefore, the burden of proof did devolve upon them as above stated, but contend that this burden was fully sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-8\">Careful consideration of the testimony confirms the conclusion reached upon the trial, and, therefore, now, November 11,1907, the motion to take off nonsuit is denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-9\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-10\"><em>James L.
