To make this determination, we must decide whether the carrier has \u201cincome from Virginia sources,\u201d as defined in Code \u00a7 58-151.02(g). If the carrier meets the statutory test so as to render it liable to Virginia income taxes, we must further determine whether the Virginia statutory scheme constitutes an undue burden upon interstate commerce, repugnant to the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">B. J. McAdams, Inc., is an Arkansas corporation engaged in the transportation of commodities in interstate commerce. The Virginia Department of Taxation exchanged correspondence with McAdams over a period of years, in which the Department advised McAdams that it was required to file Virginia corporate income tax returns and that it was liable to taxation upon that part of its income which was derived from Virginia sources. Ultimately, the Department informed McAdams that, in default of compliance with the Virginia tax laws, McAdams would be deprived of the necessary stamps and documents needed to operate its equipment on Virginia highways, pursuant to Code \u00a7 56-304.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">On January 28, 1980, McAdams filed this proceeding in the court below, seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the Commonwealth, the State Tax Commissioner, the State Corporation Commission, and its three Commissioners. Subsequently, the court dismissed the State Corporation Commission and its members, ruling that they were unnecessary parties and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>that complete relief could be afforded if the Commonwealth, through the State Tax Commissioner, remained as the sole party defendant. The case was submitted to the court on a written stipulation of facts and memoranda of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The court ruled that, under the stipulated facts, McAdams\u2019 activities in Virginia were <em>de minimis, </em>essentially insubstantial, and inseparable from its interstate activities. Relying primarily upon <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Imperial Coal Co., </em>161 Va. 718, 167 S.E. 268 (1933), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub n\u00f3m. Virginia </em>v. <em>Imperial Coal Sales Co., Inc., </em>293 U.S. 15 (1934), the Court found that McAdams had no income from Virginia sources within the contemplation of the statute and was therefore not subject to Virginia corporate income taxes. The Commonwealth agreed not to attempt collection of the taxes and not to invoke Code \u00a7 56-304.5 against McAdams unless and until it was successful on appeal. McAdams agreed to file annual sealed income tax returns with the trial court until further order of that court. Accordingly, a declaratory judgment was entered in McAdams\u2019 favor, but no injunction was requested or entered. We granted the Commonwealth an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">During the years 1975 through 1979, McAdams held all requisite certificates from the Interstate Commerce Commission to operate as an \u201cirregular route motor common carrier transporting commodities in foreign and/or interstate commerce for compensation.\u201d During the same years, McAdams was registered with and authorized by the Virginia State Corporation Commission to transport commodities over Virginia highways in interstate, but not intrastate, commerce. McAdams had no income from intangible property located in Virginia, did not own or store property in Virginia, did not execute any contracts in Virginia, and did not have any salesmen or officers in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The highway miles driven by McAdams\u2019 equipment in Virginia were an insubstantial part of McAdams\u2019 total miles, as indicated by the following tabulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Year Total Intercity Intercity Miles Miles Travelled Travelled in Va. Percent of Total Miles Travelled in Virginia</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATW\">1974 9,096,058 249,224 2.74%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMm\">1975 8,673,136 138,727 1.60%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8J\">1976 13,408,102 259,657 1.94%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXE\">1977 20,660,618 253,716 1.23%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATQ\">1978 27,126,050 435,328 1.60%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A19\">1979 35,182,928 1,103,670 3.14%</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">McAdams\u2019 pick-ups and deliveries in Virginia were also insubstantial in the context of its total business, as indicated by the following tabulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-13\">Deliveries into Virginia Pick-ups in Virginia From Points Outside for Delivery Outisde Year The State The State</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-14\">1973 - 1977</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-15\">(average) 35 7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-16\">1978 40 9</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-17\">1979 51 1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-18\">There were no intrastate pick-ups and deliveries. The interstate pick-ups and deliveries tabulated above, which either began or ended in Virginia, constituted only 5% of the miles McAdams\u2019 vehicles travelled within the state. The remaining 95% of the miles travelled in Virginia by McAdams were \u201cbridge miles,\u201d that is, miles driven through Virginia from a point of origin outside the state to a destination outside the state, without any pick-ups or deliveries within the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-19\">McAdams\u2019 income is derived from transportation charges based on miles travelled, applied to the weight of the cargo. The Commonwealth concedes the essentially interstate character of McAdams\u2019 operations, but says that the ratio of Virginia miles (including \u201cbridge miles\u201d), to total miles travelled in any tax year, by McAdams\u2019 vehicles, constitutes the part of McAdams\u2019 total income which is derived from \u201cVirginia sources,\u201d and which is thus subject to Virginia income taxes. The Commonwealth would apply the following formula to determine McAdams\u2019 tax liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Miles in Virginia McAdams\u2019 Net \u201e j?? _ Virginia Miles Everywhere Income rate)** Income Tax</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Code \u00a7 58-151.03(c) provides in pertinent part: \u201c[a] tax . . . is hereby annually imposed on the Virginia taxable income . . . of every foreign corporation having income from Virginia sources; . . .\u201d Code \u00a7 58-151.032 provides that Virginia taxable income is the same as federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments. Code \u00a7 58-151.078 requires that foreign corporations \u201chaving income from Virginia sources\u201d file annual Virginia corporate income tax returns with the Department. Code \u00a7 58-151.02(g) defines \u201cincome . . . from Virginia sources\u201d to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">(1) Items of income . . . attributable to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">(i) The ownership of any interest in real or tangible personal property in this State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">(ii) a business, trade, profession or occupation carried on in this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">(2) Income from intangible personal property. . . to the extent that such income is from property employed by the taxpayer in a business, trade, profession, or occupation carried on in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-10\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Imperial Coal Co., </em>161 Va. 718, 167 S.E. 268 (1933), involved an attack upon \u00a7 52 of the Tax Code of 1930 which provided: \u201cEvery domestic corporation . . . doing business in this State . . . shall pay ... a tax . . . upon the entire net income ... of such corporation, derived from business done, property located or sources in this State . . . .\u201d We then held that the tax was only authorized where two essential elements were shown: (1) doing business in this State; and (2) net income derived from business, property, or sources in this State. <em>Imperial Coal, </em>161 Va. at 723, 167 S.E. at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Applying these principles to the corporation then under consideration, we held that it did business in Virginia only incidental to, and as an inseparable part of, its interstate business. Because our earlier cases had held that business in Virginia, to be reached by state taxation, must be \u201csubstantial in its essence\u201d and such as \u201cmay reasonably be separated from its interstate commerce,\u201d we held that Imperial Coal failed to meet the \u201cdoing business in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>State\u201d test, and that it, therefore, was not subject to Virginia income taxes. <em>Id. </em>at 724, 167 S.E. at 269-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The Commonwealth also points out that, having decided <em>Imperial Coal </em>on the first essential predicate for taxation, \u201cdoing business,\u201d we did not reach the second predicate, \u201cincome from Virginia sources.\u201d The Commonwealth argues that the \u201cdoing business\u201d predicate has been deleted from the tax law since <em>Imperial Coal </em>was decided, and that now only the \u201cincome from Virginia sources\u201d predicate remains. Therefore, the Commonwealth contends, <em>Imperial Coal, </em>upon which the trial court based its ruling, is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">McAdams argues that the only provision of the present Virginia tax law which could apply to it is that which defines \u201cincome from Virginia sources\u201d as \u201cincome . . . attributable to ... a business, trade ... or occupation carried on in this State.\u201d Code \u00a7 58-151.02(g). Therefore, McAdams says, there has, in reality, been no change in the operative predicate for taxation since <em>Imperial Coal </em>was decided. It argues that \u201cdoing business in this State\u201d differs little from \u201cbusiness carried on in this State.\u201d <em>Imperial Coal </em>controls, says McAdams, and must be overruled if the Commonwealth is to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We do not agree. The \u201cdoing business\u201d test, which governed <em>Imperial Coal, </em>was based upon a term of art heavily freighted with meaning, derived from countless decided cases. It furnished a useful shield against any infringement by state taxation upon interstate commerce, which was then considered to be entirely immune from most burdens imposed by local taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">This sacrosanct view of the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution was materially altered by the Supreme Court in <em>Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>358 U.S. 450 (1959). There, the Court held constitutional a general state net income tax upon revenues derived from interstate commerce, which apportioned to the state that part of the taxpayer\u2019s interstate business fairly attributable to operations within the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">In the wake of <em>Northwestern, </em>the General Assembly moved promptly to amend the Virginia tax laws by deleting the \u201cdoing business\u201d test entirely. In 1960, the statutory scheme was amended to rely on the \u201cincome from Virginia sources\u201d test as the sole predicate for taxation. Acts 1960, c. 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">The \u201cincome from Virginia sources\u201d test serves to require a sufficient nexus between the taxing state and the taxpayer\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>state business to pass constitutional scrutiny under the \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\u201d standard of <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945). The requirements of such a nexus are a far cry from the nearly total immunity from state taxation which interstate commerce formerly enjoyed. The requisite nexus may be shown by the fact that the foreign taxpayer enjoys some benefits from the taxing state. <em>National Geographic Society </em>v. <em>California, </em>430 U.S. 551 (1977). It is unnecessary to quantify the value of the benefits conferred by the taxing state. <em>Standard Pressed Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>419 U.S. 560 (1975). The taxpayer\u2019s use of the Virginia highway system, enjoyment of police protection, and like benefits, are sufficient to furnish the requisite nexus for taxation. <em>See Miller Bros. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>347 U.S. 340, 345 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">In <em>Spector Motor Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>340 U.S. 602 (1951), the Supreme Court struck down as an unconstitutional burden upon interstate commerce a Connecticut tax on the \u201cprivilege of carrying on or doing business within the state\u201d as applied to an interstate trucking firm, even though the tax was fairly apportioned to interstate activities carried on in, or through, Connecticut. <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>430 U.S. 274 (1977), however, overruled <em>Spector. Complete Auto </em>held that a state tax constitutionally may be imposed on business conducted <em>exclusively </em>in interstate commerce, and that interstate business may bear a direct and fair share of the burden of state taxation. The prerequisites for such taxation are four: (1) the activity taxed must have a sufficient nexus to the state, (2) the tax must not discriminate against interstate commerce, (3) the tax must be fairly apportioned, and (4) the tax must be fairly related to services provided by the state. <em>Id., </em>430 U.S. at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><em>Imperial Coal, </em>as we have seen, has been rendered inapposite by later legislative changes in the Virginia tax laws. Evolving principles of Federalism have made it clear that the present Virginia income tax laws, as applied to interstate commerce, are not only constitutional, but are also a fair and reasonable recompense for the services and benefits provided to interstate carriers by the taxpayers of Virginia. The burden of proving that the statutory scheme of taxation fails to meet the prerequisite requirements of <em>Complete Auto, supra, </em>rests upon the taxpayer. <em>See Moorman Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Bair, </em>437 U.S. 267, 275 (1978). McAdams has carried no such burden here.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>In order to conform to the Due Process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, the General Assembly, in 1977, added a <em>de minimis </em>provision to the taxation scheme, Code \u00a7 58-151.050. Acts 1977, c. 658. It excludes carriers which travel less than 50,000 miles annually through Virginia or which make fewer than twelve round trips annually into the state from income tax liability. The evidence shows that McAdams\u2019 use of Virginia highways substantially exceeds these minima.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Finding that the declaratory judgment was based upon erroneous principles, we will reverse it and remand the case for the entry of a declaratory judgment below, not inconsistent with this opinion, requiring McAdams to file its Virginia income tax returns in the manner prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
