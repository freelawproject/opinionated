Here, disposition of a drug charge was in accordance with a statute that permitted the court, upon a first oifender\u2019s plea of guilty, to refrain from entering a judgment of guilt, to place the accused on probation, and ultimately to discharge the person and dismiss the proceeding against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">In June of 1975, Watson W. Gregg was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana in violation of former Code \u00a7 54-524.101:2. At the September 1975 trial in the General District Court of Northumberland County, defendant pled guilty and was placed on probation pursuant to former Code \u00a7 54-524.101:3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, the charge was dismissed in March of 1976, the judge noting on the warrant: \u201cDismissed on first offense. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>In June of 1983, Gregg initiated the present proceeding in the Circuit Court of Northumberland County. Relying on Code \u00a7 19.2-392.2 (hereinafter, the expungement statute),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he petitioned the court to expunge the police and court records relevant to the prior charge. The Commonwealth opposed Gregg\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">After a hearing, the trial court ruled against Gregg and dismissed the petition. The court decided that the former charge \u201cis not a proper charge to be expunged. . . We conclude the trial court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>\u201cThe purpose for which a statute is enacted is of primary importance in its interpretation or construction.\u201d <em>Norfolk So. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Lassiter, </em>193 Va. 360, 364, 68 S.E.2d 641, 643 (1952). The several statutes dealing with expungement of criminal records are codified in Chapter 23.1 of Title 19.2. The first statute of the chapter, Code \u00a7 19.2-392.1, contains the following statement of policy: \u201cThe General Assembly finds that arrest records can be a hindrance to an innocent citizen\u2019s ability to obtain employment, an education and to obtain credit. This chapter is intended to protect the innocent persons who are arrested from unwarranted damage which may occur as a result of being arrested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Gregg argues that because the charge against him was \u201cdismissed\u201d under the first offender statute, he qualifies as one who was \u201cotherwise dismissed\u201d under subparagraph (A)(2) of the ex-pungement statute. Moreover, Gregg says, he is to be considered legally \u201cinnocent\u201d within the meaning of the statutory policy statement because the charge against him was dismissed. Thus, he contends, the trial court erred in deciding he is not a member of the class of persons protected by the expungement statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The expungement statute applies to innocent persons, not to those who are guilty. Under the first offender statute, probation and ultimate dismissal is conditioned on a plea of guilty or a finding of guilt. In the present case, the accused pled guilty. One who is \u201cguilty\u201d cannot occupy the status of \u201cinnocent\u201d so as to qualify under the expungement statute as a person whose charge has been \u201cotherwise dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-11\"> That section (1974 Repl. Vol.), repealed by Acts 1975, ch. 589, provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS7\">\u201c\u00a7 54-524.101:3. Persons charged with first offense may be placed on probation; discharge. \u2014 Whenever any person who has not previously been convicted of any offense under this chapter or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic drugs, or has not previously had a proceeding against him for violation of such an offense dismissed as provided in this section, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of possession of a controlled substance under \u00a7 54-524.101:2, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, may defer further proceedings and place him on probation upon terms and conditions. Upon violation of a term or condition, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against him. Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt and is a conviction only for the purposes of applying this section in subsequent proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">The subject matter of the repealed statute presently is found in Code \u00a7 18.2-251.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-6\"> The expungement statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">\u201c\u00a7 19.2-392.2.

The petition with a copy of the warrant or indictment if reasonably available shall be filed in the circuit court of the county or city in which the case was disposed of by acquittal or being otherwise dismissed and shall contain, except where not reasonably available, the date of arrest and the name of the arresting agency. Where this information is not reasonably available, the petition shall state the reason for such unavailability. The petition shall further state the specific criminal charge to be expunged, the date of final disposition of the charge as set forth in the petition, the petitioner\u2019s date of birth, and the full name used by the petitioner at the time of arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">C.

If the court finds that the continued existence and possible dissemination of information relating to the arrest of the petitioner causes or may cause circumstances which constitute a manifest injustice to the petitioner, it shall enter an order requiring the expungement of the police and court records relating to the charge. Otherwise, it shall deny the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-13\">E. The Commonwealth shall be made party defendant to the proceeding.
