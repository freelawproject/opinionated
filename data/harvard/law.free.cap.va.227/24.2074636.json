The dispositive question is whether the Commission erred in refusing to reopen the matter after the default had been declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">On October 15, 1982, the Commission ordered Blinder, Robinson &amp; Company, Inc., a Denver-based securities dealer, and four of its employees (collectively, the defendants)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to appear before the Commission and show cause why they should not be penalized for, and enjoined from, violating the Virginia Securities Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.1-501 to -527.01. The orders fixed January 20, 1983, as the date for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">On the scheduled date, neither the defendants nor their counsel appeared. After noting of record this lack of appearance, the Commission proceeded to hear the testimony of Paul Spacek, a broker-dealer examiner for the Commission\u2019s Division of Securities and Retail Franchising (Securities Division). Spacek testified that Blinder, Robinson and its agents had failed to register with the Commission and had made eighty-six sales involving forty unregistered securities to fifty-six Virginia customers. This information, Spacek stated, came from \u201cevidence . . . obtained from Blinder, Robinson.\u201d Following Spacek\u2019s testimony, the Commission declared the defendants \u201cin default by not appearing or responding in any way.\u201d The Commission then took the matter under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">On March 1, 1983, the defendants filed a \u201cPetition to Reopen Hearing and to Schedule a Date.\u201d The petition alleged that the defendants\u2019 Colorado counsel had \u201cunderstood . . . that the Hearing [scheduled for January 20, 1983] would be continued to a later date\u201d and that, \u201caccordingly, the non-appearance by [the defendants] at the hearing was no fault of the [defendants].\u201d The petition prayed that the matter be reopened and a new date scheduled for the presentation of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Attached to the defendants\u2019 petition was an affidavit signed by Philip E. Lowery, a Colorado attorney who, the affidavit stated, had been engaged to represent Blinder, Robinson \u201cin matters pending before state securities divisions.\u201d The affidavit stated further that on December 20, 1982, Lowery \u201cspoke with Taylor Nel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>son, Broker/Dealer Examination Coordinator\u201d for the Commission\u2019s Securities Division and that he, Lowery, had made notes of the telephone conversation. These notes, the affidavit continued, indicated Lowery\u2019s \u201cunderstanding that Joe Peck, Associate General Counsel for the . . . Commission . . . would extend the Order to Show Cause which had been issued to Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co., Inc. and set for hearing on January 20, 1983.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The Securities Division filed a response to the defendants\u2019 petition to reopen. In the response, the Division denied Taylor Nelson had told Lowery that the show-cause hearing would be continued. The defendants then filed an answer to the Division\u2019s response. Noting the conflict concerning what was said in the December 20, 1982 telephone conversation between Nelson and Lowery, the defendants asked both that the \u201cHearing be reopened\u201d and that \u201cLowery be given the opportunity to testify with regard to whether or not he was advised that the Hearing would be continued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">On May 3, 1983, the Commission entered an order denying the defendants\u2019 petition to reopen and their request that Lowery be permitted to testify concerning his telephone conversation with Nelson. On the same day, the Commission also entered orders finding the defendants in violation of the Virginia Securities Act. These orders imposed fines of $25,000 upon Blinder, Robinson and $1,000 upon each of the individual defendants and, in addition, enjoined all the defendants from violating the Act in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">On appeal, the defendants contend that U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1, Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 H, and Va. Code \u00a7 12.1-28 require a hearing before sanctions may be imposed upon a party. The defendants then argue that the refusal of their petition to reopen and of their request to permit Lowery to testify constituted a denial of due process of law. The requirement of due process, the defendants maintain, \u201coutweighs any possible administrative inconvenience placed upon the Commission, especially where there can be no showing that the Commission would be harmed by reopening the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The defendants argue further that the \u201cCommission\u2019s failure to set aside the default judgment was an abuse of discretion.\u201d Generally, the defendants maintain, \u201ca reasonable misunderstanding will relieve a party from a default judgment if that misunderstanding is caused by \u2018excusable neglect.\u2019 \u201d They \u201chonestly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>reasonably believed that a continuance had been granted in this case,\u201d the defendants submit; hence, their failure to appear was excusable, and the Commission should have given them \u201cthe opportunity to present [their] case once the misunderstanding was revealed.\u201d At \u201cthe very least,\u201d the defendants conclude, \u201cthe Commission should have heard evidence to substantiate the reasonableness of that misunderstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The defendants state correctly that \u201c \u2018within the limits of practicability\u2019 ... a State must afford to all individuals a meaningful opportunity to be heard if it is to fulfill the promise of the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Boddie </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 379 (1971). And, as the defendants point out, this due process right includes \u201can effective opportunity to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses and by presenting . . . arguments and evidence orally.\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 268 (1970); <em>VEPCO </em>v. <em>Corp. Comm., </em>226 Va. 541, 312 S.E.2d 25 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">It is clear, however, that in the foregoing statement of principles, the key word is \u201copportunity.\u201d In the context of the type of case now under consideration, due process requires only that, before sanctions may be imposed upon a party, the <em>opportunity </em>for a hearing must be provided, not that the party must \u201cactually have a hearing on the merits.\u201d <em>Boddie, </em>401 U.S. at 378. The failure to appear after due notice, or the unjustifiable violation of some procedural rule affecting the orderly adjudication of cases, may result in a waiver of the hearing required by due process and an entry of judgment by default. <em>Id. </em>at 378-79; <em>Central Operating Co. </em>v. <em>Utility Workers of America, </em>491 F.2d 245, 251-52 (4th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Whether relief from a default should be granted is a question resting in the sound discretion of the trial tribunal. <em>Morriss </em>v. <em>White, </em>146 Va. 553, 568-69, 131 S.E. 835, 839 (1926). And where, as here, the basis of the requested relief is excusable neglect, the pivotal question, quoted from the defendants\u2019 reply brief, is \u201cthe sufficiency of the [defendants\u2019] excuse for failing to appear at the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">In resolving this question, we need not go beyond the affidavit of Philip E. Lowery, attached to the defendants\u2019 petition to reopen. We must assume that the defendants set forth in this affidavit their best possible case for relief, and we are willing to accord the affidavit\u2019s factual recitations absolute verity. Yet, the affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>davit does not establish sufficient excuse for the defendants\u2019 failure to appear at the January 20, 1983 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The affidavit states that, on December 20, 1982, Lowery \u201cspoke with Taylor Nelson, Broker/Dealer Examination Coordinator\u201d for the Commission\u2019s Securities Division. Thus, the affidavit shows on its face' that Nelson was a mere administrative employee of the Commission; there is no indication in the affidavit or anywhere else in the record that Lowery was led to believe that Nelson had any authority to speak for the Commission on the subject of granting a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The affidavit states further that Lowery took notes of his conversation with Nelson and that these notes indicate Lowery\u2019s \u201cunderstanding that Joe Peck, Associate General Counsel for the . . . Commission . . . would extend the Order to Show Cause which had been ... set for hearing on January 20, 1983.\u201d Thus, the statement concerning a continuance, made by Nelson in the conversation, dealt with something someone else <em>would </em>do, an act in futuro by a person over whom Nelson obviously had no control.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">It is not reasonably conceivable that an attorney, exercising due care for his client\u2019s interests, would accept such an equivocal statement from one without any apparent authority and act upon the statement with complete confidence that a binding agreement had been reached concerning a continuance. Neither is it reasonably conceivable that, following his conversation with Nelson, Lowery would fail to contact the Commission before the scheduled hearing date to ascertain whether the matter had in fact been continued. Both these lapses constitute inexcusable neglect amounting to a waiver of \u201cthe hearing required by due process.\u201d <em>Boddie, </em>401 U.S. at 378. And the fault appears so clearly from Lowery\u2019s affidavit that the Commission was fully justified in refusing to reopen the case or to hear Lowery\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The defendants argue, however, that the neglect was Lowery\u2019s, not theirs, and that they \u201cshould be relieved from judgment because they were not at fault.\u201d The difficulty with this argument is that the defendants themselves <em>were </em>at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Lowery\u2019s affidavit stated that he. did not obtain a copy of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice and Procedure until January 21, 1983, the day after the scheduled hearing date. The affidavit stated further that Lowery was not aware on December 20, 1982, the date of the telephone conversation in question, that \u201cJoe Peck would not have the authority to extend the hearing date for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Show Cause hearing pursuant to [Lowery\u2019s] conversation with Taylor Nelson.\u201d Yet, it is a concession in the case that, on November 22, 1982, approximately one month before the Lowery-Nelson conversation, Peck sent a copy of the Commission\u2019s rules to George S. Yochmowitz, house counsel for Blinder, Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Since Lowery did not obtain a copy of the Commission\u2019s rules until January 21, 1983, it is obvious that Blinder, Robinson\u2019s copy had not been made available to Lowery at the time he talked with Taylor Nelson on December 20, 1982. Had Lowery been given the copy before that time, this whole unfortunate situation could have been averted; Lowery would have known that Commission Rule 6:6 made the obtaining of a continuance a formal matter, not left to the whim of an administrative employee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence, Blinder, Robinson\u2019s failure to deliver the copy to Lowery contributed to his violation of a Commission rule affecting the orderly adjudication of cases and to the waiver resulting therefrom. <em>Boddie, </em>401 U.S. at 378-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Finding no denial of due process or abuse of discretion in the proceedings before the Commission, we will affirm the order denying the defendants\u2019 petition to reopen. We will also affirm the several orders penalizing the defendants for, and enjoining them from, violating the Virginia Securities Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-8\"> Blinder, Robinson is the appellant in Record No. 831429, Fred Steven Sager in Record No. 831430, Edwin R.
