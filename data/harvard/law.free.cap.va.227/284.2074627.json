The statute provides, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-13\">\u201cA surviving spouse shall be entitled to a dower or curtesy interest in fee simple of one third of all the real estate whereof the deceased spouse or any other to his use was at any time seized during coverture of an estate of inheritance, unless such right shall have been lawfully barred or relinquished..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">Code \u00a7 64.1-21 permits a wife\u2019s grantor to defeat a husband\u2019s curtesy right by creating a sole and separate equitable estate, but does not explicitly allow a husband\u2019s grantor likewise to defeat a wife\u2019s dower interest. The statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-15\">\u201cA surviving husband shall not be entitled to curtesy in the equitable separate estate of the deceased wife if such right thereto has been expressly excluded by the instrument creating the same, or if such instrument, . . . describes the estate as her sole and separate equitable estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>In 1973, a plurality of the Supreme Court of the United States held that, under the Federal Constitution, classifications based upon sex, like classifications based upon race, alienage, and national origin, are inherently suspect and must be subjected to close judicial scrutiny. <em>Frontiero </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>411 U.S. 677, 682 (1973). Apparently in response to <em>Frontiero </em>and other Supreme Court decisions involving gender-based classifications, <em>see, e.g., Reed </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>404 U.S. 71 (1971); <em>Weinberger </em>v. <em>Wiesenfeld, </em>420 U.S. 636 (1975); <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Boren, </em>429 U.S. 190 (1976), the General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 64.1-19.1 in 1977. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">\u201cWhere the word \u2018curtesy\u2019 appears in this chapter of the Code, it shall be taken to be synonymous with the word \u2018dower\u2019 as the same appears in this chapter or this Code, and shall be so construed for all purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The present case was tried on a stipulation of facts. In 1960, Henry Leroy Foltz and Leona C. Foltz, his wife, purchased a parcel of land in Prince William County as tenants by the entirety with the right of survivorship. He died in 1975. While a widow, she executed a will devising the property to her daughter and granddaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">On April 8, 1977, the widow recorded a deed conveying the property to herself as her sole and separate equitable estate. Later that day, she married the appellant, Jack E. Jacobs. She died in 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">In February of 1981, the husband filed a renunciation of the will of his wife under Code \u00a7 64.1-13 and filed the present suit seeking to enforce his curtesy rights in the real estate. Named as party defendant was the daughter, appellee Cheryl Lynn Meade, who qualified as executrix of the estate of her deceased mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The executrix defended on the basis the wife held the realty as an equitable separate estate. The husband claimed \u00a7 64.1-21 is unconstitutional on equal protection grounds because the statute fails to grant husbands the same rights granted wives.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">The trial court did not reach the constitutional question. Holding that \u00a7 64.1-21 and \u00a7 64.1-19.1 must be construed together, the chancellor ruled in favor of the executrix and decided that husbands, like wives, are able to create sole and separate equitable estates in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>On appeal, as in the trial court, the husband concedes that the language of the 1977 deed is sufficient to create in the wife a sole and separate equitable estate in the subject property. He agrees that the wife clearly intended to reserve the property to pass to her daughter and granddaughter under a \u201ccarefully detailed scheme described in her Will.\u201d He also concedes that, if \u00a7 64.1-21 is valid, it bars his right to curtesy in the property. He contends, however, the trial court erred in ruling that when \u00a7 64.1-21 and \u00a7 64.1-19.1 are construed together, they enable a husband to create a sole and separate equitable estate in realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The husband argues that the operative people-designating nouns in \u00a7 64.1-21 are \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cwife,\u201d and the operative pronoun in the last clause is \u201cher.\u201d He contends that while \u00a7 64.1-19.1 allows \u201cdower\u201d and \u201ccurtesy\u201d to be interchanged, the statute does not provide for the substitution of \u201chusband\u201d for \u201cwife\u201d and \u201chim\u201d for \u201cher.\u201d He says that \u00a7 64.1-19.1 \u201crepresents the worst possible legislative draftsmanship\u201d and that this \u201c \u2018Band-Aid\u2019 Statute\u201d should not be interpreted to achieve the broad result of \u201cdesexing\u201d \u00a7 64.1-21. He argues that \u00a7 64.1-19.1 \u201cmay be inadvisable at best and ridiculous at worst,\u201d but this Court should not rewrite the statute to make the words \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cwife\u201d and \u201chim\u201d and \u201cher\u201d interchangeable in \u00a7 64.1-21. To do so, the husband says, would amount to prohibited judicial legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The husband also contends the trial court erred in not addressing the constitutional issue and in not deciding, on the basis of <em>Frontiero, </em>that \u00a7 64.1-21 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. But he also concedes that if we reject his first argument, we do not reach the latter issues. We address only the threshold question.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Every act of the legislature is presumed to be constitutional. Moreover, \u201ca statute will be construed in such a manner as to avoid a constitutional question wherever this is possible.\u201d <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>176 Va. 330, 339, 10 S.E.2d 893, 897 (1940). Thus, in the face of a constitutional attack, the trial court properly concentrated on construing \u00a7 64.1-21. We shall do likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">For many years, the \u201cconsistent trend\u201d in Virginia, and throughout the nation, has been to make the law governing a spouse\u2019s rights to both real and personal property uniformly applicable to husband and wife. Spies, <em>Property Rights of the Surviving Spouse, </em>46 Va. L. Rev. 157, 160 (1960). Code \u00a7 64.1-19.1 was enacted in the latter part of the 1970s amid the foregoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>trend that was accelerated by the sex-classification cases already mentioned, which were decided earlier in that decade.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Against this background, we examine \u00a7 64.1-19.1 to determine its meaning and scope. Plainly, \u201cdower\u201d and \u201ccurtesy\u201d are made synonymous by the enactment. Explicitly, the synonymity applies to all related sections of Chapter 2 of Title 64.1, including \u00a7 64.1-21. Importantly, the terms shall be synonymous <em>\u2018\u2018for all </em>purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">While clear in most respects, \u00a7 64.1-19.1 is ambiguous and incomplete, however, as to the treatment to be given words that may be associated with \u201cdower\u201d and \u201ccurtesy\u201d in statutes. But when \u00a7 64.1-19.1 and \u00a7 64.1-21 are read together, it is manifest that a husband can acquire a sole and separate equitable estate in realty in Virginia. To hold otherwise would be to decide that \u201cdower\u201d and \u201ccurtesy\u201d are synonymous in \u00a7 64.1-21 for a limited purpose or for no purpose at all. In other words, \u201cdower\u201d and \u201ccurtesy\u201d would be interchangeable in the section, but the nouns and pronoun designating people in the statute would remain unchanged, thereby creating an absurdity. It is the court\u2019s duty, however, to construe statutes so as to avoid absurd results. <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>McNorton, </em>193 Va. 455, 461, 69 S.E.2d 445, 449 (1952). Thus, interchange of \u201ccurtesy\u201d and \u201cdower\u201d requires substitution of \u201chusband\u201d for \u201cwife\u201d and \u201chim\u201d for \u201cher.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Consequently, we hold that, when construed with \u00a7 64.1-19.1, \u00a7 64.1-21 provides that a surviving <em>wife </em>shall not be entitled to <em>dower </em>in the equitable separate estate of the deceased <em>husband </em>if such right thereto has been expressly excluded by the instrument creating the same, or it such instrument describes the estate as <em>his </em>sole and separate equitable estate. <em>See God </em>v. <em>Hurt, </em>218 Va. 909, 913 n., 241 S.E.2d 800, 803 n. (1978). <em>Cf. </em>Code \u00a7 1-13.7 (\u201cA word importing the masculine gender only may extend and be applied to females and to corporations as well as males\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Accordingly, we are of opinion the trial court correctly construed \u00a7 64.1-21. The judgment appealed from will be</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
