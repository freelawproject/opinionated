Kremposky, contends that the Industrial Commission erred in holding that it had failed to establish its defense of willful violation of a known safety rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">An employer who invokes such a defense has the burden of proving that the claimant\u2019s injury was \u201c[d]ue to willful failure or refusal to use a safety appliance ... or the willful breach of any rule or regulation adopted by the employer and approved by the Industrial Commission and brought prior to the accident to the knowledge of the employee.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The industrial accident occurred May 3, 1982. Claimant, a network lineman, was attempting to clean a \u201cbus\u201d, one of the electrical conductors on an underground network protector, an automatic switching device located on the lower side of a transformer. A strand of the steel wool claimant was using to clean one bus contacted another conductor, created an arc, and caused an explosion in which the claimant was severely injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">Kremposky had been a Vepco employee for 18 years and, for the last eight months, had been working on energized network protectors. When he was first employed in 1964, Vepco gave him a copy of its \u201cAccident Prevention Manual\u201d for which he signed a \u201cReceipt\u201d stating: \u201cI further certify that I will study and familiarize myself with the rules and regulations outlined in the Manual that pertain to my work\u201d.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> When he needed replacement copies of the manual, he returned his old copy and signed a new receipt containing the same pledge. Vepco supplies its supervisors with supplemental material used in weekly safety meetings. In addition, safety personnel conduct periodic \u201cgeneral safety meetings\u201d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>and each employee is required to attend at least three such meetings a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Kremposky testified that, before he began the cleaning operation, he removed the \u201cinsulative protective boards\u201d separating the buses and put on a glove \u201c[b]ecause it was energized.\u201d He explained that he had performed this task before and had found \u201cit was quite difficult to clean\u201d the bus with the insulator in place. Asked if he could have used the rubber blanket, Kremposky replied, \u201cI don\u2019t even think I gave it a thought of using a rubber blanket in my haste of trying to get the job done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Carlton Utterback, Vepco\u2019s safety director, talked with the claimant in the hospital. Utterback testified that \u201che just told us that he had messed up and the fact that he did not use the necessary protective equipment to protect himself\u2019. Wesley Childs, the claimant\u2019s foreman, also talked with him after the accident. Childs said that Kremposky \u201cmade mention that it was dangerous and you have to be careful when you do this\u201d and \u201c[h]e did mention that he had made a mistake.\u201d Childs told him he should have used \u201ca rubber blanket or barrier to protect himself\u2019, and Kremposky responded that he \u201crealized that was true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Utterback was asked to describe Vepco\u2019s policy and practice concerning safety rule violations. He testified that safety supervisors prepare field reports of \u201cunsafe observations\u201d and submit them to the district manager. The district manager transmits the reports to the department head and to the employee\u2019s supervisor and recommends what action should be taken. Utterback reviews disposition of \u201cevery case\u201d in order \u201cto make sure that we do take appropriate action on violations of safety rules.\u201d Violations \u201care dealt with,\u201d he said, \u201ceither in counseling, orally or written, possibly a reprimand and there could even be suspension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Kremposky and two of his co-workers testified that they had observed fellow employees working on energized buses without installing rubber blankets and that they had never known anyone to be disciplined for such violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The hearing commissioner found that Vepco\u2019s rules \u201cwere adopted for the safety of the employees and were brought to the attention of the employees through thrice yearly safety meetings\u201d but that \u201cthe network linemen frequently violated the rule without disciplinary action by the employer\u201d and, hence, that \u201ccompensation is not barred.\u201d In a split decision, the full Commission ruled that the evidence \u201cfails to preponderate in establishing that claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ant had direct knowledge of the rule or, and more importantly, that it was strictly enforced\u201d and confirmed an award in favor of Kremposky.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">On appeal, the Commission\u2019s findings of fact are \u201cconclusive and binding\u201d, Code \u00a7 65.1-98, but when there is \u201cno conflict in the evidence, the question of the sufficiency thereof is one of law\u201d, <em>City of Norfolk </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>205 Va. 877, 880, 140 S.E.2d 655, 657 (1965), and the same is true when there is no credible evidence to support the Commission\u2019s factual findings, <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Bragg, </em>203 Va. 204, 207, 123 S.E.2d 393, 395 (1962). <em>Accord Eccon Company </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>221 Va. 786, 790, 273 S.E.2d 797, 799 (1981); <em>Goodyear </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>219 Va. 830, 833, 252 S.E.2d 310, 312 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We consider first whether the evidence was sufficient to show, as Code \u00a7 65.1-38 requires, that the safety rule was \u201cbrought prior to the accident to the knowledge of the employee\u201d. The majority of the Commission found the evidence insufficient to support Vepco\u2019s allegation. In defense of that finding, the claimant argues that, even if the evidence was sufficient to show \u201cconstructive knowledge\u201d, the defense fails because the statute \u201crequires actual knowledge of a rule to constitute a willful violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Kremposky relies upon <em>King </em>v. <em>Empire Collieries Co., </em>148 Va. 585, 139 S.E. 478 (1927), where the employer invoked a willful-violation defense, relying upon the legal fiction that everyone is presumed to know the law. Construing a predecessor to Code \u00a7 65.1-38, we held that this presumption \u201cwas excluded from the operation of section 14 by the use of the word \u2018wilful\u2019 immediately preceding \u2018failure or refusal\u2019 \u201d and that, standing alone, proof of an employee\u2019s violation of a penal statute does not bar compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 592, 139 S.E. at 480. Explicating our holding, we said that the evidence is sufficient to establish the defense if \u201cthe employer can show that [the employee] had knowledge of the statute, or that reasonable steps had been taken to bring home to him notice of its existence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Kremposky\u2019s reliance on <em>King </em>is misplaced; he overlooks the distinction we drew between knowledge implied in law and knowledge implied in fact. Knowledge can be shown, and often can only be shown, by proof of facts and circumstances which negate a claim of ignorance. When there is no proof of ignorance, the only question is whether knowledge is reasonably implied by the facts in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Here, there was no proof of ignorance. Indeed, there was no <em>claim </em>of ignorance. Although Kremposky had ample opportunity to deny Vepco\u2019s allegation that he had prior knowledge of the safety rule, he never asserted that the accident occurred because he was unaware of the rule. Rather, he explained that he had found it difficult to clean the conductors with an insulator in place and that he had not given a thought to using the rubber blanket. Vepco\u2019s witnesses testified that, following the accident, Kremposky acknowledged that he had \u201cmessed up\u201d by not using \u201cthe necessary protective equipment\u201d, that he had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d, and that he \u201crealized\u201d he should have used the rubber blanket prescribed by the safety rule. In the face of that testimony, the burden of going forward with the evidence shifted to the claimant. Yet, Kremposky, testifying in rebuttal, made no claim that he was unaware of the rule at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We conclude that this was because the evidence of knowledge left no room for a claim of ignorance. Vepco furnished Kremposky with a copy of the safety manual and required him to sign a pledge to familiarize himself with all rules pertaining to work around energized equipment. During the 18 years Kremposky engaged in such work, Vepco supervisors conducted weekly safety meetings and, as the hearing commissioner found, safety rules \u201cwere brought to the attention of the employees through thrice yearly safety meetings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We believe these were \u201creasonable steps\u201d within the meaning of our opinion in <em>King, </em>and we hold that the evidence was sufficient to show that Kremposky had prior knowledge of the safety rule within the intendment of Code \u00a7 65.1-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">We turn now to the question whether, as the majority of the Commission ruled, the evidence \u201cfails to preponderate in establishing that . . . the rule . . . was strictly enforced.\u201d That ruling is not binding on appeal, because this is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Iron Company </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>207 Va. 399, 403, 150 S.E.2d 120, 123 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">In <em>Iron Company, </em>\u201c[t]he dominant question presented . . . [was] whether claimant\u2019s employer strictly enforced the oral work rule\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 402, 150 S.E.2d at 123. Reversing the commission\u2019s holding, we found the evidence sufficient to support the employer\u2019s defense. We reaffirm the principles underlying our decision in that case. Proof of a pattern or practice of failing to discipline employees guilty of willful violations of a safety rule defeats the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>afforded an employer by Code \u00a7 65.1-38, but only when such violations occur \u201c \u2018under circumstances charging the employer with knowledge and acquiescence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Iron Company </em>at 404, 150 S.E.2d at 124 (quoting from 1 Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 33.30 at 485). By definition, acquiescence presupposes knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The majority based its ruling upon the single finding that \u201ctwo linemen . . . both testified that co-workers had been observed violating the rule without being reprimanded.\u201d But, as the dissenting commissioner noted, \u201cthere is absolutely no evidence in this record to show that anyone in a supervisory capacity representing the employer was aware of said violation [s].\u201d Hence, there is no proof of a pattern or practice of non-enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">On the other hand, Utterback\u2019s unchallenged testimony was that every rule violation which came to the attention of enforcement personnel was \u201cdealt with\u201d by \u201ccounseling\u201d, \u201creprimand\u201d, or \u201csuspension\u201d. We hold, therefore, that the majority of the Commission erred in ruling that the evidence was insufficient to support the defense Vepco invoked, and we will reverse the award and dismiss the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-11\">The rule pertinent to this appeal provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">Rubber or composition protective equipment. . . shall be used to protect employees when performing work on or near energized electrical conductors and equipment. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">This equipment shall be placed so as to adequately cover all energized conductors or equipment . . . within the working zone or within reaching distance.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
