Because of citizen complaints about the quality of service rendered by Clear-View, the TTown Council called a special meeting and held a public hearing in September of 1980 to consider terminating the franchise. Following the meeting, Council unanimously adopted an ordinance revoking the franchise \u201cimmediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Because Clear-View failed to cease operations, the Town instituted the present proceeding four days after Council\u2019s action by filing a petition for a writ of mandamus, as authorized by Code \u00a7 15.1-315.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Town asked that a writ be issued compelling Clear-View to comply with the franchise agreement and to cease immediately the use of public places of the Town. On the same day, Clear-View filed a bill for injunction in the trial court seeking an order staying the effect of the revocation ordinance. Within a month, the court entered an order restraining the Town from terminating the franchise. Following ore tenus hearings in January and February of 1981, the trial court denied the request for mandamus. We awarded the Town an appeal from the June 1981 final order in the mandamus proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The 1976 franchise ordinance (hereinafter, the franchise), which renewed a prior franchise awarded Clear-View in 1968, allowed the company as \u201cgrantee\u201d to use the streets and other public places of the Town for the company\u2019s poles, wires, conduits, cables and fixtures to construct, install, operate, and maintain a CATV service in and along the streets, alleys, and other public places in the Town. The franchise also provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\n<em>\u201cSec. 9. Operation and Maintenance of the System. Complaints.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">(a) The grantee shah render efficient service, make repairs promptly, and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. Such interruptions, insofar as possible, shall be preceded by notice and shall occur during periods of minimum use of the system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">(b) The grantee shall maintain an office in Giles County, Virginia, which shall be open during all usual business hours, have a listed telephone, and be so operated that complaints and request for repairs or adjustments may be received at any time during usual business hours. During evening hours up to 11 PM and during weekends and holidays from 8AM to 11 PM that complaints may be received at an advertised telephone number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>\u201cSec. 15. Safety Requirements.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">(d) The grantee shall maintain a force of one or more resident agents or employees at all times and shall have sufficient employees to provide safe, adequate, and prompt service for its facilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">\n<em>\u201cSec. 26. Forfeiture of Franchise.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">(a) In addition to all other rights and powers pertaining to the Town by virtue of this Franchise or otherwise, the Town reserves the right to terminate and cancel this Franchise and all rights and privileges of the grantee hereunder in the event that the grantee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">(1) Violates any provision of this Franchise or any rule, order, or determination of the Town or Town Council made pursuant to this Franchise, except where such violation . . . is without fault or through excusable neglect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-11\">(4) Attempts to evade any of the provisions of this Franchise or practices any fraud or deceit upon the Town;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-12\">(b) Such termination and cancellation shall be by ordinance duly adopted after thirty (30) days notice to the grantee and shall in no way affect any of the Town\u2019s rights under this Franchise or any provision of law. In the event that such termination and cancellation depends upon a find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>ing of fact, such finding of fact as made by the Town Council or its representative shall be conclusive. Provided, however, that before this Franchise may be terminated and cancelled under this Section, the grantee must be provided with an opportunity to be heard before the Town Council.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">During the period 1976-1980, according to minutes of Council meetings, numerous complaints about the operation and maintenance of the cable system were received by Council members and the Town Manager. These complaints were communicated to C. Harry Anglin, president of Clear-View and a resident of Martins-ville. The minutes also show that Anglin was invited to meet with Council to discuss the problems but did not always appear. The Town Manager reported to Council in February of 1977 \u201cthat all efforts to contact Mr. Anglin . . . have been exhausted as he will not answer correspondence, nor will he accept any telephone calls made to him.\u201d The minutes further reflect that Anglin failed to provide an advertised telephone number for night and weekend service, made \u201cunfilled promises\u201d about improving repair service and picture quality, and failed to provide sufficient service personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Finally, in August of 1980, Council decided to hold a special meeting pursuant to Section 26 of the franchise to consider passage of an ordinance \u201cterminating and cancelling\u201d the franchise. Notice for a September 15 hearing stated the grounds for the revocation to be that Clear-View had \u201cviolated provisions of said Franchise through fault and willfully\u201d and had \u201cattempted to evade provisions of the Franchise or [had] practiced fraud or deceit upon the Town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Anglin appeared without counsel at the public hearing, which was conducted by the Town Attorney. According to the transcript of the Council meeting, a number of Town residents voiced complaints about the performance of Clear-View. Anglin actively participated in the hearing by responding to many of the citizens\u2019 complaints and to questions from members of Council. The subjects covered by the complaints included Clear-View\u2019s failure to provide prompt repair service, to improve poor picture quality, to respond to requests for service, to provide an advertised telephone number for contact by subscribers with the company, and to fulfill promises for improved service. During the hearing, Anglin was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>sarcastic, argumentative, and evasive when responding to legitimate questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">At the conclusion of citizen participation, Anglin was afforded the opportunity to make additional comments to close the hearing. Following an executive session lasting 40 minutes, Council adopted the revocation ordinance, deciding Clear-View had violated the franchise. The ordinance provided, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">\u201cCouncil . . . finds the following facts after public hearing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">(1) That Clear-View Cable TV, Inc. has not rendered efficient service, made repairs promptly, or interrupted service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">(2) That Clear-View Cable TV, Inc. has not maintained sufficient employees to provide safe, adequate and prompt service for its facilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">(3) That Clear-View Cable TV, Inc. has attempted to evade provisions of the franchise agreement with the Town of Narrows, Virginia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">After the ordinance was read publicly and after Anglin was reminded that Clear-View should cease operation in the Town at once, he stated that Council\u2019s action was not \u201clegal.\u201d He said, \u201cI will continue to operate as usual until it is proven in Court that I do not have the right to do so. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">During the subsequent court hearings, the following documents, among others, were received as exhibits: Excerpts from the Council minute book, the transcript of the Council meeting, and a 1980 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) system performance testing of the Town\u2019s CATV system, prepared by an independent consulting engineer who testified on behalf of Clear-View. Court testimony on behalf of the Town established essentially the same facts that had been presented during the public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">Witnesses on behalf of Clear-View testified that its CATV system met or exceeded FCC technical standards, that there were approximately 950 subscribers to the Town\u2019s system, and that the market value of the system was \u201cin the neighborhood of 450 to 500 thousand dollars.\u201d Clear-View also presented evidence that the poor performance of the system was due, for example, to electric power outages, breaks in cable due to motor vehicle accidents and falling tree limbs, unforeseen equipment failure, vandalism to equipment, weather changes, and ineptness of the subscribers in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>adjusting their individual television sets. There was also evidence that if Clear-View\u2019s system was \u201cturned off . . . today,\u201d six to nine months would elapse before another system could be installed to provide service to the Town. Clear-View offered further evidence to show that ongoing attempts had been made to respond promptly to requests for service and that great difficulty had been experienced in persuading qualified technicians to locate permanently in the community to service the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Within two weeks of the final hearing, the trial judge announced his decision in open court, finding in favor of Clear-View. The court was \u201cimpressed with the fact\u201d of \u201ca very definite conflict in personalities\u201d between Anglin and Town officials. The judge noted that he found no \u201cspecific objections to the operation by Clear-View,\u201d but stated there were \u201cmany general objections.\u201d The court further observed there was no open discussion among Council after the executive session and said that if the findings of fact as stated in the ordinance \u201cwere actually made,\u201d it appeared to the court they were made during the closed session.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The trial judge further noted that only Clear-View presented evidence about the technical operation of the system and this evidence showed \u201cthat the equipment . . . was average, nothing particularly sophisticated but that it was acceptable.\u201d The court commented on the \u201cvery drastic [mandamus] procedure\u201d which could result in a forfeiture, noting the financial investment involved and the number of persons affected by termination of the franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">In conclusion, the trial court decided that the notice for the special Council meeting was vague, \u201cmore vague than the provisions of the franchise itself,\u201d that the \u201cfindings of fact as set forth in the [ordinance] . . . are conclusions and not findings of fact,\u201d that the action of Council \u201cwas very drastic, unreasonable, and arbitrary in that to have forced the action upon the citizens in the town would have been to deny those citizens of the town T.V. service,\u201d and that the whole matter \u201ccould have been handled without the drastic forfeiture proceeding that we have before us.\u201d The judgment order denying mandamus incorporated by reference the court\u2019s oral opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The Constitution of Virginia, art. VII, \u00a7 9 and Code \u00a7 15.1-307 authorize cities and towns to grant, as well as to terminate, franchises to use public property. Code \u00a7 15.1-23.1 empowers the governing body of any county, city, or town to franchise, tax, and regulate CATV systems. We are dealing here, of course, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>validity of an ordinance terminating a franchise, and not with an enactment that grants such a privilege.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Municipal corporations are prima facie the sole judges of the necessity and reasonableness of their ordinances, and \u201cthe presumption of their validity governs unless it is overcome by unreasonableness apparent on the face of the ordinance or by extrinsic evidence which clearly establishes the unreasonableness. This presumption is based upon the broad general principle that every intendment will be made in favor of the lawfulness of the exercise of municipal power.\u201d <em>National Linen Service </em>v. <em>Norfolk, </em>196 Va. <em>277, 279, </em>83 S.E.2d 401, 403 (1954); <em>see Repass </em>v. <em>Town of Richlands, </em>163 Va. 1112, 1115, 178 S.E. 3, 5 (1935). Even though there is a presumption in favor of the propriety and validity of such legislative action, the judicial branch has the authority to declare the legislative acts void if the municipality\u2019s enactments are unreasonable, inconsistent with the general law and public policy, nonuniform in their operation, or destructive rather than promotive of lawful business and occupation. <em>National Linen Service </em>v. <em>Norfolk, </em>196 Va. at 280, 83 S.E.2d at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The parties actually do not disagree about application of the foregoing general principles to this proceeding. The Town argues that the court \u201cmay review the Town\u2019s decision to determine if the process of decision was performed according to the law and the franchise agreement, was not reached in an arbitrary or capricious manner, or was the product of fraud or collusion.\u201d Clear-View says that \u201cwhere a municipality seeks to revoke or cancel the franchise of its franchisee, it is a question of law for the court to decide whether the municipality acted reasonably, lawfully, and based its decision on facts drawn from competent evidence.\u201d Consequently, the basic question for the trial court, upon reviewing the legislative action, was to decide whether the action of the Town Council was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The litigant attacking legislative action as unreasonable has the burden tQ establish unreasonableness. <em>Loudoun County </em>v. <em>Lerner, </em>221 Va. 30, 34, 267 S.E.2d 100, 102 (1980). As we have stated in cases involving zoning ordinances, legislative action is reasonable if the matter in issue is fairly debatable. <em>County of Fairfax </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>186 Va. 675, 680, 44 S.E.2d 9, 12 (1947). If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the presumptive reasonableness of legislative action is challenged by probative evidence of unreasonableness, the challenge must be met by evidence of reasonableness. If such evidence of reasonableness is sufficient to make the issue fairly debatable, the legislative action must be sustained; if not, the evidence of unreasonableness defeats the presumption and the legislative act cannot be sustained. <em>Fairfax County </em>v. <em>Snell Corp., </em>214 Va. 655, 659, 202 S.E.2d 889, 893 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Upon review of a trial court\u2019s determination that a municipality\u2019s action in revoking a franchise was arbitrary and capricious, we accord the court\u2019s finding, as in the usual case, a presumption of correctness. We also, however, give full credit to the presumption of validity of the challenged legislative action and then, considering both presumptions, we examine the record to determine whether the evidence sustains the court\u2019s finding. <em>See Fairfax County </em>v. Pyles, 224 Va. 629, 638, 300 S.E.2d 79, 84 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Against this background, we examine Clear-View\u2019s argument in support of the judgment below. Initially, the company claims the trial court decided correctly that Council\u2019s findings were not findings of fact within the meaning of Section 26(b) of the franchise. We do not agree. Under these circumstances, factual findings of a municipal legislative body are not required to meet the standards of the most efficient legal technician. Even though conclusory, the findings particularize the factual bases on which Council acted with sufficient clarity to advise the grantee about the grounds of revocation. Nothing more is required, and the trial court erred in finding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Next, Clear-View contends the trial court found correctly \u201cthat the Town Council acted arbitrarily, capriciously and unreasonably.\u201d That contention likewise is without merit. It is unnecessary to rehash the evidence presented during the Council meeting as opposed to that offered during the court hearings. While there was testimony presented by Clear-View that Council\u2019s action in terminating the franchise was unreasonable, nonetheless, there was abundant evidence presented to Council to support the reasonableness of its action. We disagree with the trial court\u2019s observation that no specific objections to the operation by Clear-View were presented to Council. Sincere, vocal, and reasoned statements were made by numerous concerned citizens about Clear-View\u2019s deficiencies that extended over a period of at least four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>years. The citizens, as well as members of Council, related specific instances of inefficient service, dilatory conduct, and negligent performance by the president and employees of Clear-View, all in violation of the precise terms of the franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">When, as here, evidence of unreasonableness is met with evidence of reasonableness, a classic case of a \u201cfairly debatable\u201d issue is presented. Under these circumstances, it is the legislative body, and not the court, which has the prerogative to decide the issue. <em>See Fairfax County </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>221 Va. 328, 335, 269 S.E.2d 381, 386 (1980). Because the issue is fairly debatable, the legislative judgment must stand. Thus, it follows that the trial court usurped the legislative prerogative in reversing Council\u2019s action. <em>Id., </em>269 S.E.2d at 386. We have considered both operative presumptions and conclude that the trial court erred in deciding Council\u2019s action was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Finally, Clear-View urges that the trial court was correct in finding that the notice given for the special meeting was vague. We also reject that argument. Notice was served personally on Anglin a month and a day before the scheduled hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A notice also was published in a Giles County newspaper for four successive weeks prior to the hearing. It stated the time, date, and place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>of the meeting and related the purpose: \u201cto consider passage of an ordinance terminating and cancelling the franchise granted to Clear View Cable TV, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">We hold the notice served on Anglin fully satisfied due process requirements of reasonableness. <em>See Commission of Fisheries </em>v. <em>Hampton Roads Oyster Packers and Planters Ass\u2019n, </em>109 Va. 565, 585, 64 S.E. 1041, 1048-49 (1909). The notice was timely and reasonably specific; it afforded Clear-View an opportunity to prepare a defense to the charges and informed the company of the subjects to be considered at the hearing. If Anglin was in doubt about the scope of the hearing, he had ample time to seek more specific information from the Mayor or Town Attorney. He testified he failed to do so, or to contact his own attorney for advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">For these reasons, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the proceeding for entry forthwith of a writ of mandamus in accordance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 15.1-315 requiring Clear-View to comply with the termination provisions of the franchise and the ordinance of revocation dated September 15, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-6\">As pertinent here, \u00a7 15.1-315 provides that \u201cthe circuit courts of the counties in which towns may be situated shall have jurisdiction by mandamus, according to the provisions of [Chapter 25 (\u00a7 8.01-644 to -653) of Title 8.01], to enforce compliance by the . . . towns and by all grantees of franchises . . . with all the terms and contracts and obligations of either party, as contained in franchises.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\"> The Town\u2019s petition for appeal was granted in April of 1982. The trial court entered an order a month later in this case at the request of counsel for both parties. The order, noting a previous agreement to consolidate the mandamus and injunction proceedings, purported to consolidate the matters in the trial court <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>to supplement the record in this appeal to include pleadings in the injunction suit, and to consolidate the cases in this Court. Such action was beyond the trial court\u2019s authority. When, as here, the record on appeal has been transmitted in compliance with Rule 5; 15 by the clerk of the trial court to the clerk of this Court and an appeal has been awarded, the record on appeal cannot be enlarged except upon our grant of a writ of certiorari under Code \u00a7 8.01-673. <em>Old Dominion Iron &amp; Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>VEPCO, </em>215 Va. 658, 212 S.E.2d 715 (1975). No request was made for certiorari. Thus, we will take no further notice of the injunction proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\"> For a review of cases involving the validity and construction of municipal ordinances regulating CATV service, see Annot., 41 A.L.R.3d 384.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u201cAugust 12, 1980</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u201cTO: CLEAR VIEW CABLE T.V.
