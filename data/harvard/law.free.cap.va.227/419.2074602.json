He was convicted by a jury on November 22, 1982, and his case was continued for sentencing to December 27, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">On December 7, 1982, defense counsel filed a motion for mistrial. The motion alleged that one of the members of the defendant\u2019s jury (1) was intoxicated during the trial, (2) was asleep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>through a \u201clarge portion\u201d of the trial, and (3) was interviewed by the trial judge during a recess without notice to, and in the absence of, the defendant and his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The trial court heard the mistrial motion on the date set for sentencing. During the hearing, the defendant submitted testimony showing that the juror in question \u201cnodded off-\u201d twice during the trial for a \u201cfew seconds\u201d on each occasion. Further testimony showed that the juror had an odor of alcohol \u201cemanating form his person\u201d during the trial but that he was \u201cvery coherent\u201d and gave no other indication that he was \u201cunder the influence of anything.\u201d Other testimony revealed that, during a recess, the bailiff escorted the juror from the jury room to the judge\u2019s chambers, where the juror stayed for approximately two minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">When defense counsel indicated he had no further evidence to present on the motion for mistrial, the judge said he thought it was \u201cincumbent upon the Court to make a statement.\u201d The judge stated that he had observed the juror in question and noticed \u201chis head drop and his eyes close ... a couple of times . . . during the [state] chemist\u2019s testimony.\u201d The judge said further that, \u201crather than embarrass the gentleman\u201d before everyone in the courtroom, he declared a recess and directed the bailiff to \u201ctake the jury out\u201d and to escort the particular juror to chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Continuing, the judge stated the juror admitted he had been \u201cdozing\u201d because \u201cshort of sleep\u201d as a result of his work. The judge told the juror that \u201cthis was a very serious case and that he would have to stay awake.\u201d The juror indicated that he \u201ccould do so.\u201d Then, detecting \u201ca slight odor of alcohol about [the juror],\u201d the judge inquired whether he had been drinking. The juror denied having anything to drink that day, but said he \u201cdid drink some the day before.\u201d Satisfied with this explanation, but still concerned whether the juror could \u201cremain awake,\u201d the judge told the juror that he \u201chad to stay with things,\u201d impressing upon him \u201cthe importance of [the] trial to the defendant\u201d and the \u201cheavy penalty [which] could be given if [the defendant] was found guilty.\u201d The juror \u201cassured [the judge] that he would [stay with things].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court denied the motion for mistrial. The court then sentenced the defendant to serve twenty years in the penitentiary and to pay a fine of $15,000, in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>On appeal, the defendant concedes the evidence did not support his allegations that the juror in question was intoxicated and had slept through a \u201clarge portion\u201d of the trial. The defendant argues, however, that \u201calcohol was indeed affecting [the juror]\u201d because he fell asleep twice and, therefore, did not hear \u201call the evidence presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We reject this argument. The trial judge\u2019s statement, which we take at face value, shows that a \u201cslight odor of alcohol\u201d was the only indication the juror gave of having partaken of ardent spirits. The judge was satisfied with the juror\u2019s denial of drinking on the day of trial, and the judge found specifically that the juror was \u201cin condition to try [the] case as far as sobriety was concerned.\u201d Hence, there was no reason to believe that alcohol affected the juror to the extent of impairing his \u201creasoning powers,\u201d inflaming his \u201cpassions,\u201d or influencing his \u201copinions.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>49 Va. (8 Gratt.) 637, 659 (1851).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Furthermore, according to the judge\u2019s statement, the juror let \u201chis head drop and his eyes close ... a couple of times\u201d during the testimony of the state chemist. At the point in trial when the judge declared a recess to talk to the juror, the chemist had not testified to anything of substance, having only recited her credentials and identified the envelope in which she received the drug samples involved in the case. During the recess, the juror assured the judge he could and would stay awake during the balance of the trial; and, as the judge stated, \u201che was all right after that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Whether the juror was indeed of sufficient sobriety and wakefulness to continue with the trial was a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s action in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion; we find no abuse in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">With respect to the third ground, <em>viz., </em>the juror was interviewed by the trial judge without notice to, and in the absence of, the defendant and his counsel, the defendant argues that this action violated his right under Code \u00a7 19.2-259 to be \u201cpersonally present during the trial.\u201d Citing <em>Bilokur v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 467, 469, 270 S.E.2d 747, 749 (1980), the defendant states that the statutory phrase \u201cduring the trial\u201d means \u201c \u2018every stage of the trial from [the accused\u2019s] arraignment to his sentence, when anything is to be done which can affect his interest.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">The defendant opines that the juror \u201cmust have been intimidated and could have deduced from the judge\u2019s statement relative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>to a heavy penalty that the judge felt [the defendant] was guilty and deserved a lengthy sentence.\u201d The defendant asserts further that the judge\u2019s statement \u201ccould have also easily affected [the juror\u2019s] interpretation of the evidence, and he may have consciously or unconsciously felt he should convict and impose a heavy sentence to appease the judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We disagree with the defendant. We do not believe that the trial judge\u2019s conference with the juror constituted a part of the defendant\u2019s trial, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-259. Rather, we think that the judge\u2019s action was merely administrative in nature and, accordingly, that he was not obligated to notify the defendant and his counsel in advance of the conference or to advise them afterward what took place in chambers. This duty of notification and advice arises only when \u201can <em>ex parte </em>communication relates to some aspect of the trial.\u201d <em>Rushen </em>v. <em>Spain, </em>464 U.S. 114, 119 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Furthermore, the trial judge\u2019s remarks were innocuous. As we read the record, the trial judge merely sought to impress upon the juror the necessity to hear and consider every word of testimony before deciding whether to convict the defendant. And, in telling the juror that the case was a serious one carrying a heavy penalty, the judge only stated what was fact. Indeed, in a few moments, the judge would tell all the jurors in a formal instruction that if they found the defendant guilty, they should fix his punishment \u201cat a term of imprisonment of not less than five (5) nor more than forty (40) years and a fine of not more than $25,000.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">As indicated previously, the trial judge\u2019s action in conferring with the juror was merely administrative in nature. In this connection, we adopt the following observation from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Woodner, </em>317 F. 2d 649, 652 (2d Cir. 1963): \u201cWe have enough confidence in the integrity and fairness of the [circuit court judges of this Commonwealth] to assume that they will not make unfair remarks to jurors while undertaking administrative duties of this nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Finally, the defendant argues that, under the holding in <em>Rushen </em>v. <em>Spain, </em>an undisclosed communication between a judge and a juror amounts to constitutional error. The defendant then cites <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18 (1967), where the Supreme Court ruled that \u201cbefore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>We note that, in <em>Rushen </em>v. <em>Spain, </em>the Court did not hold that an undisclosed communication between a judge and a juror amounts to constitutional error; the Court said that \u201c[b]ecause [it found] that no actual prejudice was shown, [it would] assume, without deciding, that [the prisoner\u2019s] constitutional rights to presence and counsel were implicated in the . . . case.\u201d 464 U.S. at 118 n.2. The Court then indicated that \u201cthe alleged constitutional error [was] harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">We make the same assumption concerning the constitutional error alleged by the defendant in this case, without deciding the point. And, experiencing no difficulty at all, we hold that any such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\n<em>Affirmed</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
