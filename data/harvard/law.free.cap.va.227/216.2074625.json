He seeks reversal on the ground that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence tape recordings of. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>intercepted telephone conversations relating to other crimes. Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s action, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The record shows that on September 14, 1981, the Circuit Court of the City of Lynchburg authorized the Department of State Police to intercept wire communications of Gregory Allen Mahanes and certain other named individuals \u201cto and from\u201d a telephone in Mahanes\u2019 residence. The wiretap was authorized to obtain information concerning felony violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-248, involving the possession and distribution of controlled substances, and Code \u00a7 18.2-256, involving conspiracy to distribute controlled substances. On October 13, 1981, the court extended the authorization for thirty days and added the name of the defendant to the list of those whose communications could be monitored.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Based upon information obtained from the intercepted conversations, the defendant was indicted on February 1, 1982, for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Before trial, he filed a motion in limine to prohibit the use at trial of any intercepted conversations relating to offenses other than those specified in the order authorizing the wiretap. In arguing the motion on the morning of trial, defense counsel stated it was \u201capparent a number of the conversations that are intended to be introduced today have nothing to do with cocaine, but instead have to do with marijuana\u201d and \u201cany evidence that pertains to marijuana is inadmissible by Statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. During presentation of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the court admitted a number of tapes containing conversations relating to marijuana. The court told the jury that the evidence concerning marijuana was admitted for the \u201climited purpose\u201d of aiding the jurors\u2019 understanding of other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">In arguing below that evidence pertaining to marijuana \u201cis inadmissible by Statute,\u201d the defendant apparently was referring to the provisions of Title 19.2, Chapter 6 of the Code, entitled \u201cInterception of Wire or Oral Communications\u201d and embracing \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-61 to -70. Code \u00a7 19.2-66, as it read at the time of the wiretap in question,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> permitted the Attorney General to apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>an appropriate judge for an order authorizing the interception of wire or oral communications when such interception might reasonably be expected to provide evidence of the commission of extortion, bribery, felonious drug violations under Code \u00a7 18.2-248, or conspiracy to commit any of these offenses. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Under Code \u00a7 19.2-67(3),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> any person may disclose the contents of a communication, intercepted in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 6 of Title 19.2, while testifying in any criminal proceeding for an offense specified in Code \u00a7 19.2-66. But under Code \u00a7 19.2-67(5), as it read at the time of the wiretap in question,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the contents of communications relating to offenses other than those specified in the order of authorization, and evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>derived therefrom, could not be disclosed or used, \u201cunless such communications or derivative evidence relate[d] to. crimes of violence or official corruption punishable as a felony.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>And Code \u00a7 19.2-65\u00ae provides that no part of the contents of an intercepted communication and no information derived therefrom may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding if the disclosure of the information would be in violation of Chapter 6 of Title 19.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The defendant correctly points out that wiretaps previously were permitted for felonious marijuana offenses; prior to 1979, Code \u00a7 19.2-66 incorporated Code \u00a7 18.2-248, which then regulated marijuana as well as cocaine and other drugs. As a result of 1979 amendments, marijuana was removed from Code \u00a7 18.2-248 and made the subject of separate regulation under a new Code section, 18.2-248.1. Code \u00a7 19.2-66, however, was not amended to incorporate the new Code section until 1982, well after the 1981 wiretap occurred in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">From this, the defendant argues that because marijuana offenses were neither included within the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-66 in 1981 nor classified as crimes of violence or official corruption under Code \u00a7 19.2-67(5), as it then read, the disclosure at trial of intercepted communications relating to marijuana violated the latter section and, hence, the communications were inadmissible under Code \u00a7 19.2-65. As a result, the defendant concludes that he is entitled to a new trial excluding evidence of marijuana offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">We disagree with the defendant, and, because our wiretap statute is patterned on a federal statute covering the same subject,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we borrow from a federal decision for the rationale of our disposition of this case. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Campagnuolo, </em>556 F.2d 1209 (5th Cir. 1977), the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>considered the application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517(5), the counterpart of our Code \u00a7 19.2-67(5). The federal code section provides that intercepted communications relating to offenses other than those specified in the order authorizing a wiretap may be disclosed in testimony only when approved by a judge upon subsequent application.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In <em>Campagnuolo, </em>the Government secured an order authorizing a wiretap to obtain information concerning violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955, a gambling statute which does not require proof of interstate activity. The information obtained from the wiretap was presented to a grand jury and, in an effort to establish a violation of \u00a7 1955, the prosecutor, in questioning a witness, used intercepted information which tended to show violations of other federal gambling statutes, namely, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1084 and 1952, by whose terms proof of interstate activity is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Unsuccessful in establishing any violation of \u00a7 1955, the prosecutor decided to seek an indictment for violations of \u00a7\u00a7 1084 and 1952. Because these offenses were different from those specified in the original wiretap order, the prosecutor obtained an order pursuant to \u00a7 2517(5) permitting disclosure of the intercepted information concerning interstate activity. When this information was presented to the same grand jury, it returned an indictment under \u00a7\u00a7 1084 and 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The district judge suppressed the evidence obtained in the wiretap and dismissed the indictment. This decision was based upon the fact that the Government had failed to obtain an order permitting disclosure of the information concerning other offenses prior to the time such information was used before the grand jury on the first occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The Court of Appeals reversed. The Court pointed out that \u00a7 2517(5) was intended to \u201cassure that the Government does not secure a wiretap authorization order to investigate one offense as a subterfuge to acquire evidence of a different offense for which the prerequisites to an authorization order are lacking.\u201d 556 F.2d at 1214. In light of this objective, the Court stated that the term \u201crelating,\u201d in the context of \u00a7 2517(5), \u201cis best understood in terms of how the intercepted conversation is used by the Government and the Government\u2019s purpose in disclosing it.\u201d 556 F.2d at 1214-15. Continuing, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>In this sense, it is difficult to perceive how section 2517(5) would be violated where the Government used intercepted conversations to secure an indictment solely under the very statute named in the authorization order, but where those same conversations also evidenced some element of a different offense for which an indictment was neither sought nor returned. We believe that when wiretap evidence is probative of both the offense named in the authorization order and some other unnamed offense, the relationship of the evidence to the unnamed offense becomes important in terms of 2517(5) only when the Government attempts to use it with respect to that offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1215. The Court noted that the record negated any inference the prosecutor had sought at the first grand jury hearing to use the information relating to the unnamed offenses for any purpose other than to obtain an indictment for the offense specified in the authorization order. Hence, the Court concluded, the disclosure of the information relating to other offenses was valid when made during the first grand jury hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The record here similarly negates any inference that the Commonwealth sought at the defendant\u2019s trial to use information relating to marijuana for any purpose other than to secure a conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, the very crime named in the authorization order. Nothing in the record suggests that the Commonwealth has made any effort to charge the defendant with, or to try him for, a marijuana offense. So far as Code \u00a7 19.2-67(5) is concerned, therefore, the disclosure of the marijuana information at the defendant\u2019s trial was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">This does not end our inquiry, however; the defendant also contends that the evidence concerning marijuana was inadmissible under common law principles. He argues that admission of the marijuana evidence violated the \u201cwell established general rule that evidence of other crimes is inadmissable to show the commission of the particular crime charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The exceptions to the general rule, however, are as well established as the rule itself. Under one of the exceptions, evidence of other offenses is admissible if it \u201cis connected with or leads up to the offense for which the accused is on trial.\u201d <em>Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Com</em>monwealth, 211 Va. 269, 272, 176 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1970). Under another exception, such evidence is admissible where the other of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>fense constitutes part of the general scheme of which the crime charged is also a part and the two are so closely related that proof of one tends to establish the other. <em>Id:, O\u2019Boyle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>100 Va. 785, 792, 40 S.E. 121, 123 (1901). And application of the general scheme exception is \u201cparticularly appropriate\u201d where, as here, the accused is on trial for conspiracy. <em>Dorantes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 222 </em>Va. 383, 385, 281 S.E.2d 823, 824 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In the taped conversations played before the jury at the defendant\u2019s trial, the transactions relating to marijuana are so inextricably connected with those concerning cocaine as to leave little doubt that both drugs were involved in a general scheme undertaken by the defendant and others to distribute controlled substances in the Lynchburg area. Indeed, the intercepted conversations show a relationship between the two drugs so close that proof of a conspiracy to distribute one tends to establish a conspiracy to distribute the other. Hence, the evidence relating to marijuana fits clearly within the indicated exceptions to the general rule concerning evidence of other offenses and, accordingly, was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-9\"> \u00a7 19.2-66.
