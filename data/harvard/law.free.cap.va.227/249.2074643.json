Plaintiff Deborah Culberson contends that the trial court erred in striking her evidence as to defendants Leon Alston, t/a Alston\u2019s Exxon Servicenter (Alston), and Al\u2019s Brake Service and Supply, Inc. (Al\u2019s). Plaintiff also challenges a \u201csudden emergency\u201d jury instruction granted defendant Randosa McCloud.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">Culberson was injured when the car she was driving was struck in the rear while stopped at a traffic signal. The car which struck her was a 1964 Chevrolet sedan operated by McCloud. The Chevrolet, titled in the name of McCloud\u2019s wife, was a gift from her mother, Marie Lawson. McCloud testified that when he attempted to stop behind Culberson, \u201cthe brakes went right to the floor.\u201d The investigating officer inspected the Chevrolet after the accident and found that the brake pedal went \u201cto the floor . . . indicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>. . . brake failure.\u201d McCloud, who had driven the car several times following his recent return from a tour of service in the Army, had experienced no prior trouble with the brakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Mitchell Sarvis, called as a witness for Culberson, qualified as an expert in brake repair. Sarvis examined the Chevrolet some 18 months after the accident. He found the master brake cylinder empty. He testified that the brakes had failed because the brake shoes installed on the front wheels, which he described as \u201cfairly new\u201d and less worn that those on the rear wheels, were the wrong size. The two front brake assemblies had been adjusted to compensate for the error, but the left front \u201cwheel cylinder popped out of the boring and caused the [brake] fluid to run out.\u201d Sarvis said that \u201cyou could have a brake pedal one minute\u201d but \u201c[w]hen you lose all your fluid you don\u2019t have anything.\u201d He explained that because a 1964 automobile has only one reservoir for the brake fluid, when one brake fails in this manner, none work.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Culberson introduced evidence to show that the brakes on the Chevrolet had been repaired a \u201ccouple of months\u201d before the accident. Testifying for Culberson, Marie Lawson said that she had taken a car to Alston\u2019s service station and asked him to check it for defects in advance of a state inspection. Alston recommended brake repairs, and because his station did not do such work, referred Lawson to Al\u2019s. Alston accompanied her when she delivered the car to Al\u2019s and when she returned to pick it up. Lawson recalled that she had paid Al\u2019s approximately $30 but could not produce the receipted invoice showing what repairs had been made. Neither Lawson nor Alston had inquired about the nature of the repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Shown a picture of the Chevrolet on direct examination, Lawson identified the car as the vehicle she and Alston had taken to Al\u2019s. On cross-examination she was asked if she had not \u201ctaken more than one car to Mr. Alston to get work done on it\u201d. She replied that she had and that she had \u201ccarried two cars [to Al\u2019s] but at different times\u201d and \u201cthat might be the wrong car, so really I am not sure.\u201d Alston said that \u201cit was a Chevrolet that she came up there in\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t remember whether it was a station wagon or just ordinary sedan or what.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">At some point unclear from the record, Lawson returned to Alston, complaining that her car was \u201cpulling\u201d to one side. Alston jacked up the front end, rotated the wheels, found that they \u201cturned freely\u201d, and told Lawson \u201c[t]here\u2019s nothing wrong with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>[the brakes].\u201d Alston received no compensation for the services he rendered Lawson.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">At the conclusion of plaintiffs case in chief, the trial court sustained motions to strike filed by Alston and Al\u2019s but denied McCloud\u2019s motion. The trial proceeded against McCloud, the court granted his instruction on sudden emergency, the jury returned a verdict against Culberson, and the court entered final judgment in favor of all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Actionable negligence requires proof of a legal duty to exercise ordinary care for the safety of another person or his property, a breach of that duty, and an injury proximately resulting from that breach. <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>220 Va. 160, 162, 257 S.E.2d 761, 762 (1979). We find no proof of a legal duty Alston owed Culberson, and we uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling on Alston\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">We also agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Culberson\u2019s evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support a verdict against Al\u2019s. Culberson\u2019s counsel acknowledged in oral argument that Lawson \u201chad two vehicles, one a station wagon and one a sedan\u201d, and that \u201cthere was evidence on cross-examination that she wasn\u2019t real sure which vehicle\u201d Al\u2019s had repaired. Nevertheless, we believe, and counsel for Al\u2019s agreed at bar, that other testimony raises a reasonable inference that the car McCloud was driving was the vehicle Lawson and Alston delivered to Al\u2019s, and on Al\u2019s motion to strike, Culberson was entitled to the benefit of that inference. The record is devoid of any proof, however, of the kind of brake work Al\u2019s had performed. Such proof was indispensable to Culberson\u2019s theory of recovery against Al\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Clearly, someone at some time installed the wrong brake shoes on the front wheels of the Chevrolet, and Lawson paid Al\u2019s for performing some kind of brake service. But there was no evidence, testimonial or documentary, to show that the $30 bill Lawson paid was the charge for installing brake shoes, and neither Lawson nor Alston knew what work it represented. For all the evidence proves, the repair work Al\u2019s performed may have been limited to the master cylinder, the brake lines, or some other component of the brake system. Culberson\u2019s evidence on the issue of Al\u2019s liability invites speculation, conjecture, and random judgment, and such evidence is insufficient to raise a jury question. <em>See Farren </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>224 Va. 407, 297 S.E.2d 668 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Culberson asks us to reverse the judgment for McCloud on the ground the sudden emergency instruction was a \u201cfinding in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>struction\u201d and not \u201cbased upon the evidence in the case.\u201d We find no merit in this assignment of error. Proof of the sudden mechanical failure was uncontroverted, McCloud was unaware of the defect in the brakes, and there was no evidence that McCloud was guilty of any act or omission which brought about the emergency with which he was confronted. <em>See Cook </em>v. <em>Basnight, </em>207 Va. 491, 151 S.E.2d 408 (1966); <em>Rountree </em>v. Rountree, 198 Va. 658, 96 S.E.2d 113 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
