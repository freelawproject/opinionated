The sole issue is whether the trial court erred in striking the plaintiffs evidence at the conclusion of her case in chief. Under familiar principles, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Plaintiff Christine K. Brill, age 72, was shopping for dog food in a grocery store operated by defendant Safeway Stores, Inc. Small packages of the product were displayed on three shelves located beneath large windows in the front wall of the store. The shelves were separated from a row of checkout stands by an aisle approximately five feet wide, affording room for \u201conly two people . . . [to] walk side by side\u201d. Plaintiff was standing upright and motionless at a point \u201cabout four inches\u201d from the shelves with her back to the aisle. She testified that, while holding and inspecting one of the packages, \u201cI heard a swish come by and came very close, kicked my heel, and down I went.\u201d Plaintiff suffered a fracture of the femur in her fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The parties stipulated that William Betzler, defendant\u2019s employee, \u201ccame into contact\u201d with plaintiff. While plaintiff was lying on the floor waiting for an ambulance, Betzler exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry it happened. I\u2019m sorry I did that.\u201d Brenda Herr, another Safeway employee, confirmed that the \u201ccollision\u201d had occurred while she and Betzler were \u201cwalking up the aisle side by side\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\"> The trial court concluded as a matter of law that plaintiffs evidence was insufficient to raise a jury question on the issue of primary negligence. We disagree. It is true, as the court observed, that \u201cnegligence cannot be presumed from the mere happening of an accident\u201d and that \u201c [i]t is incumbent on the plaintiff who alleges negligence to show why and how the accident happened\u201d. But \u201cnegligence . . . may be established by circumstantial evidence. In establishing negligence it is not necessary that the plaintiff negate every theory or possibility that the accident occurred in some manner which would relieve the defendants of liability.\u201d <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>Langley Cabs, Inc., </em>211 Va. 202, 208, 176 S.E.2d 417, 421 (1970). Indeed, facts and circumstances surrounding an accident may be sufficient \u201cto warrant the jury in inferring how the accident happened, and that it was the result of . . . <em>gross </em>negligence\u201d. <em>Hackley </em>v. <em>Robey, </em>170 Va. 55, 61, 195 S.E. 689, 691 (1938) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Here, the facts and circumstances are uncontroverted. Betzler was \u201cwalking up the aisle side by side\u201d with Brenda Herr. The aisle, only five feet wide would not accommodate three people positioned abreast. Plaintiff was standing at the edge of the aisle in full view of Betzler and Herr as they approached. Betzler\u2019s foot \u201ckicked\u201d plaintiffs heel and she fell. At the time defendant\u2019s motion was offered, there was no evidence that plaintiff, with her back to the aisle, was aware of Betzler\u2019s approach, that she moved into his path, or that she was guilty of any other act or omission which contributed to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We are of opinion plaintiffs evidence in chief was sufficient to show how and why the accident occurred, <em>viz., </em>that Betzler failed to maintain the reasonable lookout required by the standard of ordinary care defendant owed its business invitees. We hold that the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion to strike, and we will reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial. <em>See Trail </em>v. <em>White, </em>221 Va. 932, 935, 275 S.E.2d 617, 620 (1981); <em>Semones </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>217 Va. 293, 294-95, 227 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1976); <em>Meador </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>214 Va. 759, 761, 204 S.E.2d 285, 287 (1974); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>214 Va. 307, 309, 199 S.E.2d 515, 517 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
