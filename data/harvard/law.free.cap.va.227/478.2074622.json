Porter was injured in an accident which arose out of and during the course of her employment with King\u2019s Market. Her injury was diagnosed as \u201c[1] umbo-thoracic spinal strain with nerve root irritation\u201d resulting in \u201c[ijntercostal neuralgia, [bjrachial neuralgia\u201d. King\u2019s insurance carrier, Pacific Employer\u2019s Insurance Company, paid Mrs. Porter compensation until May 13, 1979 when she returned to work. This was the first of four periods for which temporary disability compensation was paid pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement approved by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">In October 1979, Mrs. Porter consulted Dr. James Foster, an orthopedist, who found \u201c[cjhronic sprain of neck, lumbar spine, and dorsal spine\u201d. The printed medical report form published by the Commission provides spaces for the attending physician to indicate whether his patient suffers \u201cDisability for Work\u201d and, if so, the \u201cDate Disability Began\u201d, \u201cDate Able to Return to Light Work\u201d, and \u201cDate Able to Return to Regular Work\u201d. Dr. Foster\u2019s report left these spaces blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">In December following Dr. Foster\u2019s examination, Dr. Jacques Botton, a neurosurgeon, performed an anterior cervical fusion to relieve neck pain. A neurological examination conducted in March 1980 showed that Mrs. Porter had \u201csome residual discomfort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>across her right scapular\u201d. Dr. Botton advised that she could return to work \u201cany time\u201d but, because she was experiencing \u201ca certain amount of low back pain which she has had since the injury\u201d, she should consult Dr. William Frank, an orthopedist, \u201cbefore she returns to work\u201d. Mrs. Porter was paid compensation from December 3, 1979 until she returned to work March 24, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Payment of compensation was resumed for the third time in May 1980. A letter from Dr. Botton concerning an examination conducted in July of that year reported that Mrs. Porter was \u201cdoing fairly well except for some complaints of pain across her right shoulder.\u201d Compensation was terminated in October 1980 when Mrs. Porter returned to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The last period of compensation began April 28, 1981 and ended July 13, 1981. During that period, Mrs. Porter was examined by Dr. Foster and Dr. Frank. Dr. Foster found that Mrs. Porter was \u201c[sjtill having neck and shoulder pain\u201d which he attributed to the industrial accident. A prescription pad signed by Dr. Frank noted that Mrs. Porter had undergone a \u201ccervical fusion\u201d, and that \u201c[s]he\u2019ll . . . live with pain.\u201d Both Dr. Foster and Dr. Frank left the work-capacity spaces on the medical report form blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">With Dr. Frank\u2019s consent, Mrs. Porter returned to work July 13, 1981, the last date for which compensation was paid. Later that day, she consulted Dr. James Massie complaining of \u201cBack Right Shoulder and Right Hip Pain\u201d. The diagnosis listed on the form filed by Dr. Massie was \u201cPain ? Etiology\u201d; the work-capacity spaces were blank. Mrs. Porter did not report for work the next day, and during the months of July, August, and September, she worked only 10 hours per week. So far as the record discloses, she has not worked since September 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">In July 1982, Mrs. Porter, alleging a change in condition, applied for a hearing and reinstatement of compensation, and the deputy commissioner considered medical evidence submitted since the last payment of disability benefits. In a letter relating to an examination conducted July 16, 1981, Dr. Frank reported that Mrs. Porter \u201ccomplained of severe back and neck pain\u201d, that the examination \u201cdisclosed a good range of motion of the lumbar and cervical spine\u201d, that \u201c[njeurological examination was totally normal\u201d, and that he had advised his patient to return to Dr. Botton for \u201cfollow up care and treatment.\u201d In July and August of that year, Mrs. Porter consulted Dr. Botton and his associate Dr. G. A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Hurt, concerning pain in her right shoulder and arm. Both concluded that there had been no neurological change and left the work-capacity spaces in the medical report form blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Reviewing this evidence and finding \u201cno medical basis to sustain [the claimant\u2019s] position as to work incapacity\u201d, the deputy commissioner denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In December 1982, Mrs. Porter filed a second change-in-condition claim and submitted a letter dated October 12, 1982 in which Dr. Frank stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">Ms. Porter has severe degenerative changes in her cervical spine. A cervical fusion has been tried in the past which was unsuccessful. The patient has many subjective complaints of pain, which I believe to be real. She has a normal neurological examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">I have given Ms. Porter a no work slip, to excuse her from same. I have rated Ms. Porter as having 15% disability to her cervical spine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The \u201cno work slip\u201d, dated October 4, 1982, was based upon a diagnosis of \u201ccervical arthritis\u201d. A second letter from Dr. Frank, dated four days before the hearing, reported that, in light of the results of an examination conducted January 11, 1983, Mrs. Porter \u201ccontinues on a no work status.\u201d The deputy commissioner ruled that \u201cwork incapacity commenced, according to medical documentation, on October 4, 1982\u201d and entered an award reinstating compensation effective that date. Upon review of the record, the full Commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Appealing from this award, the employer challenges the sufficiency of the employee\u2019s evidence to prove causal connection between the industrial accident and work incapacity. The full Commission ruled that \u201cit is no longer necessary that the claimant establish an actual pathological or physical change in his condition but can prevail on an application where it is established by a preponderance of the evidence that the attending physician has had a change in his opinion concerning the employee\u2019s work capacity.\u201d Applying that rule, the Commission based its decision upon the evidence that Dr. Frank had changed his opinion concerning Mrs. Porter\u2019s work capacity in October 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The Commission relied upon our opinion in a recent case. Construing an amendment to the statutory definition of the term \u201cchange in condition\u201d, we held that \u201ca change in an attending physician\u2019s opinion concerning an employee\u2019s ability to resume work meets the criteria detailed in Code \u00a7 65.1-8 [as amended].\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Mace </em>v. <em>Merchants Delivery, </em>221 Va. 401, 405, 270 S.E.2d 717, 719-20 (1980). This holding, however, did not alter the basic rule that an employee claiming reinstatement of disability benefits on account of a change in condition bears the burden of proving \u201cthat his present condition resulted naturally and unavoidably from the accident\u201d. <em>Old Dominion Co. </em>v. <em>Messick, </em>149 Va. 330, 335, 141 S.E. 132, 133 (1928). Our opinion in <em>Mace </em>recognizes that capacity to work is a \u201ccondition\u201d. If the attending physician, reversing his former opinion, determines there has been a change in that condition sufficient to justify reinstatement of disability benefits, the inquiry is whether that change is causally connected with an injury suffered in an industrial accident. Absent proof of such connection, the change in condition is not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The Commission\u2019s misconstruction of <em>Mace </em>results from its failure to distinguish between an employer\u2019s application for termination of disability benefits and an employee\u2019s application for reinstatement of disability benefits. <em>Mace </em>involved an employer\u2019s application for termination of benefits based upon a change in condition. With respect to such application, the only question is whether the employee\u2019s prior condition of work incapacity has changed; the question of causal connection is not an issue. On the other hand, when an employee files an application for reinstatement of disability benefits, two questions arise: (1) has there been a change in the employee\u2019s capacity to work; (2) if so, is the change due to a condition causally connected with the injury originally compensated.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In October 1982, more than three years after Mrs. Porter\u2019s accident and nearly 15 months after the last payment of disability benefits, Dr. Frank found that she was suffering with \u201ccervical arthritis\u201d and \u201cdegenerative changes in her cervical spine\u201d and that she was no longer able to work. There is nothing in his medical reports or elsewhere in the record, however, which establishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>a causal connection between the disability resulting from these conditions and the April 1979 injury. As the employer points out and the medical treatises confirm, these conditions may develop from causes other than injury, such as infection, deficiency in the blood supply, excessive function, or the natural wear and tear associated with the aging process.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Proof of the causal connection between the industrial accident and the disabling condition underlying the employee\u2019s application must go beyond the realm of conjecture. If it is just as likely that the disabling condition resulted from a cause which is not compensable as it is that it resulted from an accident covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the employee has failed to establish the requisite causal connection. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Hercules Powder Co., </em>182 Va. 282, 288, 28 S.E.2d 736, 738 (1944). \u201cPossibility is not enough.\u201d <em>Rust Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>194 Va. 975, 979, 76 S.E.2d 195, 198 (1953) (alleged causal connection between heavy lifting and cerebral hemorrhage). Evidence that disability \u201c \u2018may be due\u2019 \u201d to an industrial accident \u201cis not sufficient.\u201d <em>Old Dominion Co. </em>at 337, 141 S.E. at 134 (alleged causal connection between injury to a hand and palsy). <em>See also Eccon Company </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>221 Va. 786, 273 S.E.2d 797 (1981) (alleged causal connection between injury to leg and cardiac arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">We hold that the Commission erred in its interpretation of the effect of our decision in <em>Mace, </em>and because the record is devoid of evidence establishing a causal connection between the April 1979 injury and the work incapacity resulting from the conditions diagnosed in October 1982, we will reverse the award and dismiss the application for reinstatement of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> \u00a7 65.1-8. \u201cChange in condition\u201d defined. \u2014 Change in condition as used in this Act means a change in physical condition of the employee as well as any change in the conditions under which compensation was awarded or terminated which would affect the right to, amount of, or duration of compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
