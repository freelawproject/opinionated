J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaJ\">Defendants and appellants, Cory Travion Rushing and Nakia Hubbard, appeal the judgments entered following their convictions for first degree murder (Hubbard) and second degree murder (Rushing), with gang enhancements (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 186.22, subd. (b)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants were sentenced to state prison for terms of 25 years to life (Hubbard) and 15 years to life (Rushing).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">1. <em>Prosecution evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\">On the evening of October 5, 2007, Gregory Powe was driving with his 13-year-old foster son, R.R., in the car. Powe was 55 years old and, although retired, he worked part time as a school crossing guard. R.R. testified some \u201cgang bangers\u201d were blocking their way, so Powe got out and asked them \u201cif they could please move.\u201d One of the gang bangers started punching Powe in the chest and the face. Powe tried to defend himself, but the beating continued. Then R.R. saw \u201ca whole bunch of the gang bangers around\u201d Powe, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>who was now on the ground. Someone called the police from a nearby house. R.R. saw the paramedics arrive and treat Powe. R.R. could not identify the people who had beaten Powe.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">V.S. knew defendants Rushing and Hubbard because she had grown up with them. That evening, she was about 15 feet from the intersection of 105th Street and Lou Dillon Avenue. She was standing on top of a milk crate and looking over a fence. It was \u201c \u2019Hood Day\u201d and there were 20 to 25 people in the street. V.S. had been standing on the crate for a while watching the festivities. She saw Powe get out of his car and heard him say, \u201cCould you guys please move out of the way?\u201d Within seconds, Hubbard and Rushing started beating Powe with their hands and feet. Hubbard kicked Powe in the head between 10 and 20 times. Powe tried to get back into his car, but Hubbard prevented his retreat. Hubbard kicked Powe in the face again. When Hubbard slammed the back of Powe\u2019s head onto the street, V.S. heard \u201ca big pop noise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">A.G., who was 14 years old at the time of trial, testified she had been near the intersection of 105th Street and Lou Dillon Avenue that evening while walking to a friend\u2019s house. She saw \u201ceveryone arguing and then they just started fighting.\u201d Powe was being punched in the face and kicked in the face and the stomach. By the second or third time Powe got hit, he fell to the ground. His attackers continued to beat him while he was on the ground. There were two people beating Powe and a lot of other people stood around watching. A.G. testified the fight lasted less than a minute, after which she continued on to her friend\u2019s house. A.G. subsequently identified Hubbard and Rushing from photo arrays as the two men who had beaten Powe.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Powe\u2019s wife, Estella, saw him at Kaiser Hospital in Bellflower on the night of the beating. He was lying on his stomach as he received stitches to the back of his head. Powe\u2019s eyes were open, but he did not speak to her. He stayed at the hospital that night. The next day, he was not speaking, and when he was released from the hospital the day after that he was still unable to speak. Estella was concerned about his condition, but hospital personnel said he was ready to leave so she took him home to Moreno Valley. She helped him into bed and he fell asleep. About 1:45 a.m. that morning, he asked her to help him to the bathroom. When he was unable to urinate, she helped him back to . bed. Powe lay down, began shaking, and then he moaned. Estella called 911. He died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Dr. Mark McCormick, a forensic pathologist at the Riverside County Sheriff-Coroner\u2019s Bureau, conducted the autopsy. McCormick concluded the \u201ccause of death was pulmonary thromboemboli due to deep-vein thrombosis, due to immobility, due to blunt impact injuries to the head.\u201d In other words: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>\u201cThe combination of the [head] trauma and his immobility [first at the hospital and then at home] led him to form clots around [a filter in his] inferior vena cava .... Subsequently, those clots broke loose . . . .\u201d These formed pulmonary thromboemboli, which caused Powe\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Powe had suffered a prior incident of blood clot formation in 1994, when a bum injury immobilized him for a sustained period. At that time, he was treated with the blood thinner Coumadin and a filter was inserted into his inferior vena cava. According to McCormick, the inferior vena cava is \u201cthe large vessel that returns blood from the lower part of the body .. . back to the heart and also to the lungs.\u201d The filter was intended to catch blood clots that formed in Powe\u2019s legs before they could travel to his heart. McCormick explained that Powe\u2019s earlier bum injury, like the head trauma he sustained in the beating, released factors into the blood which lowered his threshold for clot formation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">McCormick opined that treating Powe at the hospital with Coumadin to thin his blood would not have been a good idea because there was evidence of internal head bleeding. Although the hospital doctors could have properly recommended semimobility as a prophylaxis against the formation of blood clots, given the presence of the vena cava filter it would have been proper to recommend \u201cbed rest over mobility.\u201d Asked if \u201cit would have been below the medical standard of care to release Mr. Powe the way they did without any follow-up instructions or care,\u201d McCormick testified, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe so.\u201d McCormick opined that keeping Powe in the hospital for another day or two \u201cwould [not] have changed anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Los Angeles Police Officer Samuel Marullo testified as a gang expert. He was familiar with the Fudge Town Mafia Crips gang, which had 76 documented members, about 40 of whom were active. The gang\u2019s members were predominantly African-American. The gang\u2019s primary activities included drug trafficking, robbery, weapons crimes, assault and murder. October 5 was considered \u2019Hood Day for the Fudge Town Mafia Crips gang: \u201cAll gangs have \u2019Hood Days where they celebrate being gang members of a particular neighborhood. Usually . . . that day is selected based on the street that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>affiliate themselves with. In this case it\u2019s 105th Street.\u201d \u2019Hood Day was a celebration of gang membership and it typically entailed the commission of violent acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The Fudge Town Mafia Crips make their money by selling drugs and committing robberies. Because their revenue is primarily earned by committing crimes against the people who live within their own territory, the gang tried to foster community respect based on fear because fearful victims will not cooperate with the police. If a Fudge Town member committed murder, his status would rise and it would make no difference whether the victim was a rival gang member or an ordinary citizen. In Marullo\u2019s opinion, both defendants were members of Fudge Town.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Given a hypothetical based on the facts of this case, Marullo testified Powe\u2019s assault had been committed for the benefit of the Fudge Town Mafia Crips. Because the gang\u2019s members truly believed the neighborhood belonged to them, having someone ask them to move out of the way on \u2019Hood Day would have been viewed as extremely disrespectful.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">2. <em>Defense evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Los Angeles Police Detective Mark Hahn was one of the two investigating officers. He testified A.G. said she had been on her friend\u2019s porch, three houses away from the intersection, when she saw people starting to fight. Hahn was unclear if A.G. meant she had been on that porch during the entire incident, but she did not say she had been walking through the crime scene as the incident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">A defense investigator testified he went to the scene and measured the distance from where V.S. testified she had witnessed the incident to the northwest comer of Lou Dillon Avenue. The investigator testified that distance was 85.4 feet, and the fence V.S. had been standing behind was seven and one-half feet high.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">Donnavette Raby testified she knew Hubbard from having grown up in the neighborhood, although she no longer lived there. She was good friends with Hubbard\u2019s sister. Raby\u2019s grandfather lived near the 105th Street/Lou Dillon Avenue intersection. That day, Raby was visiting her grandfather just after dark. There were 50 or more people out on the street. She parked near Hubbard\u2019s car and went to her grandfather\u2019s house. Her grandfather\u2019s wife introduced Raby to Powe, saying he was a fellow church member. Raby went outside and spoke to Hubbard and his sister. Traffic on 105th Street was backed up in both directions. She heard noise from the comer but could not see anything because of the crowd and the traffic congestion. Hubbard said to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>her, \u201cThem niggers probably down there doing something they don\u2019t have no business doing. I\u2019m out of here.\u201d He got into his car and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Raby then heard a woman screaming, so she walked to the intersection to see what was going on. The crowd was scattering and Raby saw Powe \u201chit the ground.\u201d Raby ran back to her grandfather\u2019s house to tell them to call the police. She did not recognize anyone in the crowd. Raby spoke to the police that night and told them what she told the jury. She acknowledged having lied to Detective Hahn when she said she did not know Hubbard\u2019s real name, but that was because she did not think it was relevant since Hubbard had had nothing to do with assaulting Powe. Raby acknowledged the father of her child was serving a life prison term in connection with his membership in the Fudge Town Mafia Crips.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">3. <em>Rebuttal evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Detective Hahn testified he measured the distance from the point at which V.S. had been viewing the events to the eastern curb of Lou Dillon Avenue at 105th Street. It was 43 feet, although this measurement did not include the distance across Lou Dillon Avenue to where the incident occurred. Hahn testified the fence was six and one-half feet tall.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">1. There was <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">2. The trial court erred by admitting certain gang evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">3. There was insufficient evidence to sustain Hubbard\u2019s conviction for first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">4. There was insufficient evidence to sustain the gang enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">5. The trial court erred by refusing to give a modified version of CALCRIM No. 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">6. There was prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">7. There was cumulative error.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">1. <em>Defendants did not make out a prima facie case of </em>Batson/Wheeler <em>error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Defendants contend the trial court erred when it ruled the defense failed to make out a prima facie case of discrimination based on the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenge of a single African-American prospective juror. This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">a. <em>Legal principles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Under <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 79 [90 L.Ed.2d 69, 106 S.Ct. 1712], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748], \u201c[a] party may not use peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors solely on the basis of group bias. Group bias is a presumption that jurors are biased merely because they are members of an identifiable group distinguished on racial, religious, ethnic, or similar grounds.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fuentes </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 707, 713 [286 Cal.Rptr. 792, 818 P.2d 75].)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court recently reiterated the applicable legal standards. \u2018First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case \u201cby showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\u201d [Citations.] Second, once the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the \u201cburden shifts to the State to explain adequately the [apparently discriminatory] exclusion\u201d by offering permissible . . . justifications for the strikes. [Citations.] Third, \u201c[i]f a [nondiscriminatory] explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide . . . whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful . . . discrimination.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] [f] In order to make a prima facie showing, \u2018a litigant must raise the issue in a timely fashion, make as complete a record as feasible, [and] establish that the persons excluded are members of a cognizable class.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gray </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 168, 186 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 451, 118 P.3d 496].)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">The analysis begins with the presumption a party exercising a peremptory challenge is doing so on a constitutionally permissible ground. <em>(People v. Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 278.) \u201c[T]he law recognizes that a peremptory challenge may be predicated on a broad spectrum of evidence suggestive of juror partiality. The evidence may range from the obviously serious to the apparently trivial, from the virtually certain to the highly speculative, [f] For example, a prosecutor may fear bias . . . because [a juror\u2019s] clothes or hair length suggest an unconventional life-style.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 275.)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>A trial court\u2019s ruling on a <em>Wheeler </em>motion is reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>(People v. Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 196 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365].) \u201cThe determination of whether a defendant has established a prima facie case \u2018is largely within the province of the trial court whose decision is subject only to limited review. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] On appeal, we examine the entire record of voir dire for evidence to support the trial court\u2019s ruling. [Citation.] Because of the trial judge\u2019s knowledge of local conditions and local prosecutors, powers of observation, understanding of trial techniques, and judicial experience, we must give \u2018considerable deference\u2019 to the determination that appellant failed to establish a prima facie case of improper exclusion. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wimberly </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 773, 782 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 152].) \u201cIf the record \u2018suggests grounds upon which the prosecutor might reasonably have challenged\u2019 the jurors in question, we affirm.\u201d <em>(People v. Howard </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1132, 1155 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 268, 824 P.2d 1315].)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">b. <em>Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Prospective Juror No. 9144 (hereafter, Juror 4) was part of the initial panel of 20 prospective jurors. She told the trial court she was a stay-at-home mother married to a mail carrier. They lived in Downey, where she home-schooled their two children. She had never been the victim of, or a witness to, any crime and she did not have any prior jury experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Question No. 7 on the written juror questionnaire asked: \u201cA party, witness, or attorney may come from a particular national, racial, or religious group or may have a lifestyle different from your own. Would that fact in any way affect your ability to be a fair and impartial juror?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Juror 4 told the trial court she had answered affirmatively to \u201cpart\u201d of that question. Asked to elaborate, she said, \u201cI think the religious part\u201d because, \u201cdepending on the person\u2019s view\u201d of \u201creligion or God, it affects their whole outlook on everything.\u201d Asked if that was \u201cgoing to be an issue for you as a juror?,\u201d Juror 4 replied, \u201cMaybe.\u201d When the court asked her to explain, she said, \u201c[I]f somebody doesn\u2019t believe in God then I think just their whole outlook on everything [s/c].\u201d When the trial court asked \u201chow does that affect how you would view them as a juror?,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not exactly sure. I guess it would just depend.\u201d She concurred with the court\u2019s assessment that she \u201cdisagree[d] with some religions.\u201d Juror 4 also said she did not believe her views would prevent her from being a fair juror, and that she understood this was not a religious court.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>None of the other prospective jurors in the initial 20-person venire responded affirmatively to question No. 7 of the written questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Hubbard\u2019s attorney asked Juror 4 why she thought people became gang members, and she replied, \u201cDifferent reasons. I know a lot because background [jz'c], they had nowhere else to turn to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">After the prosecutor used a peremptory challenge, the defendants jointly used a peremptory challenge against a second prospective juror. The prosecutor then used a peremptory challenge against Juror 4 and Hubbard\u2019s counsel made a <em>Wheeler </em>motion. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">\u201c[Hubbard\u2019s counsel]: Yes, Judge. Three African-Americans on the panel out of the entire 20. I mean, totally unrepresented. This case involves African-American on Hispanic and almost the entire rest of the panel is Hispanic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">\u201c[Rushing\u2019s counsel]: African-American on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">\u201c[Hubbard\u2019s counsel]: I\u2019m sorry. The witnesses are all Hispanic. The witnesses against the defendant are all Hispanic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">\u201cThe Court: But the victim is African-American.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-10\">\u201c[Hubbard\u2019s counsel]: That\u2019s true.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] My client obviously is African-American. So when the panel is under-represented, I think counsel should give us a plausible reason why he would use a peremptory against one-third of all the African-Americans of the 20.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-11\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-12\">\u201c[Rushing\u2019s counsel]: Submitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-13\">' \u201cThe Court: Okay. I don\u2019t find that\u2019s a prima facie case [defense counsel] has made. And having said that, if you want to state your reason for the record, you may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-14\">\u201c[The prosecutor]: . . . No, thank you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">After the defendants used another peremptory challenge, the trial court continued with the voir dire of a new group of prospective jurors, none of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>whom had responded affirmatively to question No. 7. Neither of the two subsequently chosen alternate jurors had answered question No. 7 affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The record does not reflect whether the jury that ultimately heard defendants\u2019 case included any African-Americans.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">c. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Hubbard argues Juror 4 \u201cwas a person with no recognizable biases\u201d and that a comparative analysis with the other prospective jurors who went unchallenged reveals there was impermissible discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">However, our Supreme Court has said: \u201cAs we have explained, \u2018[w]hatever use comparative juror analysis might have in a third-stage case for determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s proffered justifications for his [or her] strikes are pretextual, it has little or no use where the analysis does not hinge on the prosecution\u2019s actual proffered rationales . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Taylor </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 574, 617 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 87, 229 P.3d 12].)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">Moreover, the record suggests several race-neutral reasons for challenging Juror 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Juror 4 expressed some degree of sympathy for gang members when she said she believed people joined gangs because they had nowhere else to turn. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 191 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 123, 940 P.2d 710] [that prospective juror might be sympathetic to defendant because of his high school familiarity with Blood gang members warranted peremptory challenge].)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">Juror 4\u2019s husband worked for the post office. Occupation can be a permissible, nondiscriminatory reason for exercising a peremptory challenge. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Trevino </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 396, 411 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 61] [\u201cit could be hypothesized the People were exercising their challenges based on a belief those members who had some connection with providing [health] care or social services would not be sympathetic to their case\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Landry </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 785, 790-791 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 824] [race-neutral factors included job in youth services agency and background in psychiatry or psychology]; <em>People v. Perez </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1315 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 299] [no prima facie case where challenged members shared characteristic of being single and working in \u201csocial services or caregiving fields\u201d]; <em>People v. Barber </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 378, 394 [245 Cal.Rptr. 895] [proper to challenge kindergarten teacher based on belief teachers are generally liberal and less prosecution oriented].) The occupation of a prospective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>juror\u2019s spouse may be a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for a peremptory challenge. (See <em>People v. Trevino, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 411 [\u201ceach of the [jurors] challenged had a connection [either directly or through a spouse] with an organization that provided health care\u201d].) Courts which have directly addressed the issue of exercising peremptory challenges against postal workers have viewed this as a race-neutral reason.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">And, contrary to Hubbard\u2019s assertion that Juror 4 was unbiased, she acknowledged a religious prejudice against atheists which might have prevented her from being a fair juror. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Mills </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 158, 184 [106 Cal.Rptr.3d 153, 226 P.3d 276] [prospective juror who \u201cbelieved Satan controls this world and the people in it\u201d was properly challenged for \u201cstrident . . . religious views\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 378, 384 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 147] [prosecutor properly challenged Jehovah\u2019s Witness whose voir dire answers indicated her \u201creligious views might render her uncomfortable with sitting in judgment of a fellow human being\u201d].) Hubbard argues this bias would not matter because \u201creligious beliefs were not an issue in the case nor would the religious beliefs of any of the witnesses or defendants ever become part of the trial.\u201d We disagree. The prosecutor could have been legitimately concerned Juror 4 might discover or assume that any one of the trial participants (e.g., witnesses, attorneys, etc.) was a nonbeliever and, accordingly, view that person in a negative light.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Hubbard argues Juror 4\u2019s \u201cresponses to further inquiry showed that she would not allow her [religious] beliefs to affect her service.\u201d But the prosecution is not required to accept at face value a prospective juror\u2019s assurance that, despite an answer indicating the contrary, she would have no problem being neutral. In such cases, the juror\u2019s apparent uncertainty is a legitimate reason for exercising a peremptory challenge. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th 574, 643, fn. 19 [prosecutor legitimately could have believed prospective juror who worked as nurse would be inclined to credit defense mental health experts, despite her questionnaire statement to the contrary]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Young </em>(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1149, 1174 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 112, 105 P.3d 487] [even though prospective juror who worked as therapist \u201cgave assurances she harbored no biases or opinions that would affect her ability to be open-minded and fair, the prosecutor might have reasonably exercised a challenge to excuse [her] on this basis\u201d because there might be evidence of \u201cextreme mental disturbance\u201d at penalty phase].)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>In sum, the \u201crecord \u2018suggests grounds upon which the prosecutor might reasonably have challenged\u201d Juror 4 <em>(People v. Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1155) because there was evidence \u201csuggestive of juror partiality\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 275). Hence, there was substantial evidence to support the trial courts\u2019 ruling that defendants failed to make out a prima facie case of <em>Batson/Wheeler </em>error.
