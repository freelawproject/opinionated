We agree with the respondent that his commission of a crime before the birth of the child in this case, Carla C. (Carla), is not a parental act of commission or omission, as that basis for termination properly is understood. We also agree with the respondent that when a custodial parent has interfered with an incarcerated parent's visitation and other efforts to maintain an ongoing parent-child relationship with the parties' child, the custodial parent cannot terminate the noncustodial parent's parental rights on the ground of no ongoing parent-child relationship. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court granting the petition of the petitioner mother, Glenda G., for termination of the respondent's parental rights as to Carla.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts and procedural history, as found by the trial court or as undisputed in the record, inform our resolution of the respondent's appeal. The parties began a relationship in September, 2008, shortly after which the petitioner became pregnant. On January 9, 2009, while the petitioner was pregnant, the respondent was involved in a drive-by shooting in Torrington. Carla was born six months later on July 13, 2009. On July 29, 2009, the respondent executed an acknowledgment of paternity as to Carla.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 4, 2009, the respondent was arrested and charged in connection with the drive-by shooting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On\n   June 3, 2011, the respondent pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59 (a)(1) and 53a-48 (a), and one count of assault in the first degree as an accessory in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a)(1). The respondent subsequently was sentenced to a total effective term of twenty years incarceration, execution suspended after nine years, with five years probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The respondent's maximum release date is May 7, 2018.\n   On seven occasions between August 26, 2009, and August 19, 2011, the petitioner took Carla to visit the respondent in prison. She then decided that she no longer wanted to be in a relationship or raise a child with the respondent. Accordingly, she unilaterally decided that visits with the respondent were no longer in Carla's best interest. The respondent has not seen Carla since August 19, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the meantime, the petitioner met and began a relationship with Steve M. (Steve), whom she described as a \"real man\" and \"[the] father figure that [Carla] deserves.\" The petitioner and Carla moved into Steve's home in the summer of 2011 and remained there until May, 2014, when the relationship ended for a time and the petitioner and Carla moved into their own apartment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner and Steve resumed their relationship in early 2015. Since then, Steve and the petitioner,\n   together with Carla, frequently stay at each other's home. Carla refers to Steve by name and as \"Dad\" or \"Daddy Steve.\" Steve, who shares with the petitioner the cost of Carla's dance lessons and day care, intends to adopt Carla if the respondent's parental rights are terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Since his last visit with Carla in 2011, the respondent has sent her cards and letters. The petitioner threw away all of the cards and letters without showing them to Carla, including letters and drawings that the respondent had asked Carla's attorney to give to the petitioner to give to Carla. The respondent last spoke to Carla by telephone on her birthday in 2014, when she was at the Florida home of the petitioner's mother. He acknowledged that during that call, Carla did not recognize him as her father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early 2012, after she had decided she no longer wanted the respondent in Carla's life, the petitioner obtained an order from the MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution (MacDougall-Walker), where the respondent was incarcerated, directing the respondent to cease all oral and written communication with the petitioner and Carla, either directly or through a third party. The order notified the respondent that his failure to comply with it would result in disciplinary action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The petitioner subsequently initiated a separate custody action in the judicial district of Litchfield, pursuant to which, on June 26, 2012, the parties entered into a stipulation awarding the petitioner sole legal and physical custody of Carla, and permitting the respondent one visit with Carla every sixty days. The stipulation\n   provided that the respondent's mother would transport Carla to and from MacDougall-Walker. The stipulation also provided that the respondent's parenting access was to be reevaluated upon his release from prison. Although the petitioner believed that visits between the respondent and Carla in prison were not in\n   Carla's best interest, she did not seek to modify the visitation order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Despite the parties' stipulation, none of the bimonthly visits provided for in the stipulation took place. As a result, the respondent filed a number of motions for contempt in which he sought to enforce the visitation provided for in the stipulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to these motions, the court issued orders on April 18, and October 8, 2013, that the respondent be given visits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court ordered that the visits were to occur on May 19 and November 24, 2013. Neither of the visits took place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While incarcerated, the respondent, whose employment history consists of two weeks of work at a Wendy's restaurant in Florida, has obtained a general equivalency diploma and a diploma in business management. He also has completed course work in real estate appraisal. The respondent's mother, who has supported the respondent financially throughout his life, has paid for his education in prison. At the time of the trial on the petition for termination of parental rights, the\n   respondent expected to enroll in anger management and parenting programs provided by the Department of Correction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 18, 2013, the petitioner filed a petition for termination of the respondent's parental rights in Torrington Probate Court. In the petition, the petitioner alleged two statutory grounds for termination: (1) that Carla had been denied the care, guidance, or control necessary for her physical, educational, moral, or emotional well-being, by reason of the respondent's act of commission or omission; see footnote 1 of this opinion; and (2) that there was no ongoing relationship between the respondent and Carla, and to allow further time for the establishment of the relationship would be detrimental to Carla's best interest. See footnote 2 of this opinion. The petitioner submitted an accompanying affidavit in which she averred the following: that the respondent was incarcerated following a conviction for assault and risk of injury to a child; that the respondent had participated in a drive-by shooting of a house in which a child was present; that the respondent will be incarcerated until 2018; that the respondent had seen Carla only a handful of times; and that visiting the respondent in prison was not in Carla's best interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   By motion dated December 20, 2013, the petitioner sought to suspend the respondent's visitation with Carla. In the motion to suspend visitation, the petitioner represented that although the respondent's mother had attempted to facilitate visitation, the arrangement was unworkable, and that, in any event, visiting the respondent in prison was not in Carla's best\n   interest. By notice dated February 21, 2014, the court granted the petitioner's motion to suspend visitation, pending the outcome\n   of the Probate Court proceedings on the petition to terminate the respondent's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By motion dated February 21, 2014, the respondent successfully sought transfer of the action to the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters. The Superior Court for Juvenile Matters subsequently transferred the action to the Child Protection Session at Middletown. On September 12, 2014, the respondent moved for an order of visitation with Carla pending the resolution of the petition for termination of parental rights. The court,\n   <em>\n    Ginocchio, J.,\n   </em>\n   consolidated for trial the respondent's motion for visitation and the petition for termination of parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court,\n   <em>\n    C. Taylor, J.,\n   </em>\n   held a trial on the consolidated petition for termination of parental rights and motion for visitation on June 5 and 9, 2015, with closing arguments on June 23, 2015. By memorandum of decision dated October 13, 2015, the court concluded that the petitioner had proven both alleged grounds for termination and that termination was in Carla's best interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court made no ruling on the respondent's motion for visitation. Accordingly, the court granted the petition for termination of parental rights. This appeal followed. Additional facts will follow as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The respondent presents three principal claims on appeal, one pertaining to the first ground for termination and two pertaining to the second. With regard to the first ground, the respondent claims that the court erred as a matter of law in determining that the respondent deprived Carla of the care necessary to her well-being. With regard to the second ground, the respondent\n   claims that (1) as a matter of law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   a parent may not prevent the other parent from maintaining a relationship with their child and then successfully petition to terminate parental rights on the ground that there is no ongoing parent-child relationship, and (2) the respondent's incarceration, standing alone, is an insufficient basis on which to terminate his parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"A hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases: the adjudicatory phase and the dispositional phase. During the adjudicatory phase, the trial court must determine whether one or more grounds for termination of parental rights set forth in ... General Statutes ...

Specifically, he argues that the trial court could not properly conclude that this ground for termination had been established because it did not find either (1) that Carla had suffered a serious physical or emotional injury or (2) that he had committed an act of parental commission or omission. To the extent that the court did find that he had committed an act of\n   parental commission or omission, he argues, the court improperly based its finding on conduct that occurred before Carla was born-namely, his participation in the drive-by shooting for which he currently is incarcerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The petitioner counters that the denial of care, guidance, and control that must be proven to establish this ground for termination does not require a finding of serious physical or emotional injury. She also argues that the court properly found that the respondent had engaged in an act of commission or omission. She characterizes this act as \"the respondent's voluntary absence from his daughter's life ... which continued for at least six years after Carla's birth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under our well established law, to provide a basis for termination of parental rights on the ground set\n   forth in \u00a7 45a-717 (g)(2)(B) ; see footnote 1 of this opinion; an act of parental commission or omission must occur after the birth of the child. \"[P]arental conduct justifying termination of parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 [45a-717 (g)(2)(B) ] must occur after birth and ... the statute does not contemplate termination of parental rights upon the basis of prenatal conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Valerie D.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"527578\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/223/492/#p513\">\n    223 Conn. 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 513,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%20748\">\n    613 A.2d 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) ; id., at 525,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%20748\">\n    613 A.2d 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (mother's injection of cocaine hours before child's birth could not justify termination of mother's parental rights on ground of act of parental commission or omission).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the present case, on the basis of our review of the court's memorandum of decision, we conclude that the court improperly based its conclusion that the respondent had engaged in an act of parental commission or omission on its finding that the respondent was involved in the 2009 drive-by shooting while the petitioner was pregnant with Carla. The trial court characterized the petitioner's alleged ground for termination as follows: \"[The petitioner] ... claims that [the respondent's] act or acts of parental commission or omission revolve around his involvement in the criminal activities that culminated in his participation in the Torrington drive-by shooting in [January],\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   2009, and his substantial jail sentence resulting from his criminal activities.\" The court concluded that \"the petitioner has proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that [the respondent] has denied Carla ... the care, guidance or control necessary for Carla's physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being as a result of his criminal activities, which resulted in his incarceration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, the court made the following findings. \"The clear and convincing evidence shows that [the respondent], no tyro to the criminal justice system, knew ... in [January], 2009, that [the petitioner] was pregnant with his child. He further knew that further involvement with the criminal justice system would have dire consequences for his probation. He also knew that involvement in a drive-by shooting had the potential to result in a substantial period of incarceration, as it actually did. [The respondent] had to know the potential for the enforced separation from his child throughout her childhood that would result if he were incarcerated. This potentiality did, [in] fact, come to fruition as a result of [the respondent's] felony convictions in 2011. The clear and convincing evidence also shows that [the respondent] will be incarcerated for an additional, substantial period\n   of time and will be on probation following his discharge from [the Department of Correction].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court identified the \"act or acts of parental commission or omission\" forming the basis of the ground for termination of parental rights identified in \u00a7 45a-717 (g)(2)(B) as the respondent's \"criminal activities which resulted in his incarceration\"-specifically, his involvement in the drive-by shooting in January, 2009, of which he was convicted and currently is incarcerated. In January, 2009, however, Carla had not yet been born. The court's conclusion that the respondent's conduct prior to Carla's birth constituted an \"act or acts of parental commission or omission\" contemplated by \u00a7 45a-717 (g)(2)(B) contravenes the clearly established rule that a parent's prenatal conduct may not be the basis for termination of parental rights on this ground.\n   <em>\n    In re Valerie D.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"527578\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/223/492/#p513\">\n    223 Conn. at 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%20748\">\n    613 A.2d 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the court's conclusion that the petitioner proved this ground for termination cannot stand. Because the respondent's participation in a drive-by shooting prior\n   to Carla's birth may not constitute the requisite act of commission or omission, we need not determine whether the court found that Carla suffered a serious physical or emotional injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   NO ONGOING PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The respondent next claims that the court's conclusion that he had no ongoing parent-child relationship with Carla was legally incorrect under the circumstances of this case. The respondent's argument in support of this claim is twofold: first, as a matter of law, this ground for termination may not be established where a custodial parent unreasonably has interfered with the development of the other parent's relationship with the parties' child; second, in the alternative, the court improperly terminated the respondent's parental rights on the basis of his incarceration alone. We agree with the respondent that a parent whose conduct inevitably has led to the lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship may not terminate parental rights on this ground.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The following additional procedural history is relevant to this claim. In concluding that the petitioner had established this ground for termination, the court in its memorandum of decision determined that \"no parental relationship ever existed between this respondent and Carla\" because the respondent had never provided Carla with the necessities to meet her daily needs, and Carla had not formed any positive memories of the respondent. Although the court found that \"[c]learly,\n   the [petitioner] was not in favor of Carla visiting [the respondent] [in prison] and did not go out of her way to facilitate visitation,\" it concluded that \"the proximate cause of the lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship was the fault of [the respondent] himself. [The respondent was] a gang member ... who decided to involve himself in a drive-by shooting despite ... the possibility that he would be\n   unable to appropriately parent his child due to incarceration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Despite finding that the petitioner had refused to facilitate visits between the respondent and Carla, the court found that there nevertheless was no evidence that more visits would have led to the development of an ongoing parent-child relationship: \"This matter does not hinge upon the visits in [prison]. There was evidence in the trial that [the respondent] was going to receive only one visit in [prison] with Carla every sixty days. The lack of an ongoing relationship solely relates to Carlos' incarceration-a matter about which he had total and absolute control.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The following foundational principles governing the judicial severance of the parent-child relationship undergird our resolution of this claim. \"[T]he termination of parental rights is defined ... as the complete severance by court order of the legal relationship, with all its rights and responsibilities, between the child and\n   his parent.... It is, accordingly, a most serious and sensitive judicial action.... Although the severance of the parent-child relationship may be required under some circumstances, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the interest of parents in their children is a fundamental constitutional right that undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection.\n   <em>\n    Stanley v.

Termination of parental rights\n   <em>\n    does not follow automatically from parental conduct justifying the removal of custody.\n   </em>\n   The fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State. Even when blood relationships are strained, parents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of their family life.\n   <em>\n    Santosky v.

With regard to the latter, it was undisputed at trial that after fewer than ten visits, the petitioner stopped bringing Carla to visit the respondent as of August, 2011. She then obtained an order from the correctional facility that barred the respondent from initiating any contact with her or Carla, on pain of disciplinary action. Subsequently, she sought and obtained sole custody of Carla, stipulating that the respondent would have bimonthly visits with Carla at the prison. She nevertheless neither facilitated those visits nor moved to modify visitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the petitioner has not told Carla that the respondent is her father or shown her\n   pictures of the respondent; indeed, she has discarded the defendant's cards and letters to Carla.

This court finds as a matter of law that this principle should extend not only to state actors, but to private individuals as well.

See id.; cf.\n   <em>\n    In re Valerie D.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"527578\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/223/492/#p513\">\n    223 Conn. at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%20748\">\n    613 A.2d 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notwithstanding the hurdles erected by the petitioner, the respondent has demonstrated his positive feelings toward Carla through his varied efforts to maintain contact with her. Given Carla's very young age at the time the petitioner\n   began denying the respondent visitation and the respondent's demonstrated attempts to maintain contact in light of the limited means at his disposal, we conclude that under the circumstances of this case, the petitioner could not prove the lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship by clear and convincing evidence. Accordingly, the court's termination of parental rights on this ground cannot stand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner nevertheless argues that a custodial parent's interference with the development of a parent-child should be viewed differently from the interference that occurred in\n   <em>\n    In re Valerie D.,\n   </em>\n   in which the respondent was pitted against the power of the state. We disagree. Whether the party seeking termination of an individual's parental rights is the commissioner or the custodial parent, the state's interest in preserving family integrity remains the same. See\n   <em>\n    In re Caleb P.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12170197\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-supp/53/329/#p346\">\n    53 Conn.Supp. at 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20A.3d%20507\">\n    113 A.3d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Supreme Court's observation in\n   <em>\n    In re Valerie D.\n   </em>\n   is no less applicable here: \"To permit [the respondent's] acquiescence [to the petitioner's assumption of sole custody] to ripen into a ground for termination of parental rights ...\n   simply by virtue of the practical impossibility of maintaining the kind of contact with the child required to establish an ongoing parent-child relationship, would turn the statutory promise of appropriate care for the child into a cruel statutory hoax of termination of parental rights.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Valerie D.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"527578\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/223/492/#p513\">\n    223 Conn. at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%20748\">\n    613 A.2d 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    In re Jessica M.,\n   </em>\n   our Supreme Court observed that a stringent standard for establishing no ongoing parent-child relationship is equally vital where the party petitioning for termination is the child's relative: \"When a child is committed to the custody of the state, the state has a duty to provide supportive services to the parents to enhance the possibility of eventual reunification of the family.... Although we recognize that no such statutory duty exists when ... legal guardianship of the child is vested in a private party, the public policy concern for protection of familial integrity is nevertheless the same. If a court were authorized to find that day-to-day absence alone proved that no ongoing parent child relationship existed, a parent whose child needed a temporary placement would otherwise have to consider the risk that his or her parental rights might be terminated if the guardian subsequently wished to adopt. Such a standard for termination would create an incentive for a parent to yield temporary custody to a stranger rather than to an interested relative who might develop a strong bond with the child.\n   <em>\n    Creating a disincentive for a parent to choose the guardian most likely to love and protect the child while the parent was unable to provide daily care\n   </em>\n   would contravene the state's interests in protecting both family integrity and the best interests of the child.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis added; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Jessica M.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"543799\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/217/459/#p464\">\n    217 Conn. at 470-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=586%20A.2d%20597\">\n    586 A.2d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The petitioner also argues that where a custodial parent petitions for termination on the ground of no\n   ongoing parent-child relationship, a court must ignore the \"root cause\" of the lack of a relationship to safeguard the custodial parent's constitutional rights \"to determine that a prison was a harmful environment for a child, that a sick child should not travel and have visits, or that a mother should be able to refuse calls and contact from a man who had physically abused her.\" We are not persuaded.

Nevertheless, nothing in the record indicates that this is a case in which, as the petitioner argues, \"denying the other parent visitation may be necessary to insulate a custodial parent from being held responsible for failing to protect the parties' child.\" For example, there is no evidence that the respondent behaved inappropriately or threateningly toward Carla during any of their visits or that the petitioner's defiance of the visitation order and subsequent motion to suspend visitation were motivated by safety concerns.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"28\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    As noted previously in this opinion, the respondent moved for an order of visitation with Carla pending the resolution of the petition for termination of parental rights, which motion was consolidated with the petition for trial. In light of its decision terminating the respondent's parental rights, no ruling on the motion for visitation was necessary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
