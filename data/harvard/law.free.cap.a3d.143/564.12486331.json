(VitalWorks),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Cerner Physician Associates, Inc. (Cerner), had violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   by making misrepresentations in connection with the sale of certain practice management and electronic medical records software to the plaintiff. The plaintiff contends that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that, under applicable choice of law principles, the law of New Mexico, rather than CUTPA, governs the plaintiff's unfair trade practices claim. We conclude that the Appellate Court correctly determined that that claim is governed by New Mexico law. Contrary to the determination of the Appellate\n   Court, however, we conclude that the case must be remanded for a new trial so that New Mexico law can be applied to the plaintiff's unfair trade practices claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following facts, as found by the trial court, and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff is a dermatological clinic with two offices located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. VitalWorks is a Delaware corporation that, at all times relevant to this appeal, had its corporate headquarters in Ridgefield, Connecticut, and was engaged in the marketing and selling of software designed to assist physicians in efficiently managing patient appointments, billing, and medical records. VitalWorks' software development and technical support facility is located in Alabama. Cerner is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Missouri. In January, 2005, Cerner purchased VitalWorks' Alabama operations and continued to market, service, and develop the software thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March, 2003, the plaintiff's representative attended a medical conference in San Francisco, California, where VitalWorks was demonstrating its software. At the time, the plaintiff did not contemplate the purchase of new software because it was satisfied with older software that it had been using in its practice since 1997. At the conference, however, Tim Holman, a VitalWorks' salesperson, and Terri Cannady, a representative from the company that marketed the older software, informed the plaintiff's representative that the plaintiff would need to replace the older software because it was going to be phased out and would no longer be supported. As a replacement for the older software, the plaintiff was offered VitalWorks' software. Holman told the plaintiff that VitalWorks' software was \"user-friendly\" and would increase the plaintiff's efficiency\n   and save it money by streamlining the preparation of medical notes and billing statements. Specifically, Holman represented that the new software would allow the plaintiff's receptionist to confirm a patient's information upon the patient's arrival and create a note that, with \"[a] click [of] a button,\" would be sent to the physician, who would fill it out while examining the patient, thereby creating a billing statement with the required diagnostic codes and necessary prescriptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September, 2003, Holman traveled to one of the plaintiff's Albuquerque offices to conduct a follow-up demonstration. Following that demonstration, Holman sent the plaintiff a letter stating that, on the basis of the plaintiff's then existing monthly transcription expense of $2500,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiff would realize \"a return on investment in two years\" were it to purchase the new software. Holman also informed the plaintiff that, by purchasing the new software\n   prior to the end of 2003, it would avoid a 15 percent price increase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Having been told that the older software no longer would be supported and that a price increase for the new software was imminent, the plaintiff agreed to purchase the new software for $44,170.30, which included software training by VitalWorks employees. On December 19, 2003, the plaintiff signed a standard form contract produced by VitalWorks' Connecticut headquarters. The choice of law provision of the contract provided that \"[the] [a]greement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the [s]tate of Connecticut and any dispute shall be resolved in a forum located in the [s]tate of Connecticut.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As soon as the new software was installed, the plaintiff began experiencing technical difficulties while attempting to use it. Contrary to the representations\n   made by Holman, the plaintiff's physicians and staff found the software neither fast nor user-friendly. The plaintiff experienced a wide variety of problems with the software, including (1) loss of access to the system while attempting to schedule appointments, (2) the need to change passwords on multiple occasions, (3) claims not closing when payments were posted, thereby requiring the plaintiff to manually enter secondary billing statements, (4) uninitiated user log offs, (5) disappearing toolbar buttons, (6) inaccurate patient ledgers, and (7) blank screens that required a complete reboot of the system. In addition to these fundamental software flaws, the physicians were not able to use the system while seeing patients because the software did not have preinstalled dermatological terminology and did not allow users to indicate the number and size of lesions and biopsies, the name or dosage of prescribed medication, or whether the patient had been informed about the potential risks and benefits of medication. As a result of these defects, creating medical notes with the new software took far longer than it did to create those notes manually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When the plaintiff complained to VitalWorks about the new software's poor performance, VitalWorks denied that the problems were software related and recommended additional training for the plaintiff's employees. Despite that training, however, the plaintiff's problems persisted because, in fact, they were primarily software related. Indeed, the plaintiff never was able to bill a patient, generate a prescription or complete a real time checkout using the software, and, as a consequence, the plaintiff ultimately abandoned it in May, 2005. The plaintiff commenced the present action against the defendants in August, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its second amended complaint, the plaintiff alleged six counts: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of warranty; (3) fraud; (4) negligent misrepresentation; (5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   unjust enrichment; and (6) a violation of CUTPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a bench trial, the court concluded that the plaintiff had proven its case against VitalWorks on the breach of contract, breach of warranty, negligent misrepresentation, and CUTPA counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also found in favor of\n   the plaintiff on its CUTPA claim against Cerner, concluding that Cerner was liable under CUTPA pursuant to the continuity of enterprise exception to the successor in interest doctrine. The court further concluded that, following the acquisition of VitalWorks' Alabama operations, Cerner itself had violated CUTPA by engaging in unfair trade practices while being involved in trade or commerce that was intimately associated with Connecticut.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the defendants filed motions to reargue and for articulation, and the plaintiff filed motions for costs, attorney's fees, prejudgment interest, and punitive damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its motion to reargue, VitalWorks asserted, among other things, that the trial court improperly had failed to subject the plaintiff's unfair trade practices claim to a choice of law analysis and, instead, appeared to have \"automatically\" assumed that Connecticut law applied to that claim. VitalWorks further argued that, under a choice of law analysis, it was clear that New Mexico rather than Connecticut law should govern the plaintiff's claim because New Mexico had the most significant contacts with the occurrence and the parties. In its memorandum of decision on VitalWorks' motion to reargue, the trial court noted that it had applied Connecticut choice of law principles to the facts and determined that Connecticut was the state that had the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties involved. The trial court explained that, in evaluating the choice of law issue, it had utilized the principles set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 6(2) and 145(1) of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws. See 1 Restatement (Second), Conflict of Laws \u00a7 6(2), p. 10 (1971) ; 1 id., at \u00a7 145(1), p. 414. In a subsequent memorandum of decision on VitalWorks' motion for articulation, the trial court further explained that \"the strongest and most predictable contact\" in the present case was Connecticut because \"Ridgefield, Connecticut was the corporate headquarters for VitalWorks. Corporate responsibility for product development, marketing, sale and delivery of a functioning product is most strongly connected to Connecticut. The sales agreement was drafted in Connecticut by VitalWorks.... Among the terms [of that agreement] ... was a standardize[d] choice of law/forum provision [that] required that Connecticut law apply to contract interpretation and required [Connecticut] to be the locus of dispute resolution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to its choice of law argument, VitalWorks contended that, even if Connecticut law did apply to the plaintiff's unfair trade practices claim, VitalWorks'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   conduct, as alleged by the plaintiff, did not fall within the purview of CUTPA because VitalWorks had not engaged in any trade or commerce in Connecticut. The trial court rejected this argument, noting that the facts that it found supported the\n   conclusion that the actions that gave rise to the plaintiff's claims \"occurred in Connecticut or were the result of [VitalWorks'] corporate [decision] to market and sell software systems [that] it knew had not been fully developed and [that] would not operate as represented to [the plaintiff].\" Specifically, the trial court explained that \"[t]he contract in question qualified as trade or commerce within the state of Connecticut.... It [was] the genesis of the relationship between [the] plaintiff and VitalWorks....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal to the Appellate Court, VitalWorks and Cerner both claimed, inter alia, that the trial court incorrectly had determined that Connecticut law governed the plaintiff's unfair trade practices claim.

The defendants further argued that, even if Connecticut law applies to that claim, the trial court incorrectly concluded that the plaintiff had satisfied the requirements of CUTPA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    Id., at 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    78 A.3d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, the court referred to the evidence demonstrating that the plaintiff was located in New Mexico, and the first and second product demonstrations by VitalWorks took place in California and New Mexico, respectively.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    Id., at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    78 A.3d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also observed that (1) the software and hardware\n   purchased under the contract were installed in New Mexico, and the concomitant services were also performed in that state;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    id., at 200-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    78 A.3d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) the VitalWorks employees with whom the plaintiff dealt were located in Alabama, and those employees remotely installed the new software in New Mexico;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    id., at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    78 A.3d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (3) all of the development work on the new software from 2001 forward had been performed in Alabama.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   On the basis of this evidence, the court concluded that the plaintiff had no cause of action under CUTPA because no \"trade\" or \"commerce\" within the meaning of CUTPA had occurred in Connecticut.

In particular, the Appellate Court concluded that the application of the factors outlined in \u00a7 145(2) of the Restatement (Second) militated in favor of applying New Mexico law because that state had the \"greatest contact\" with the parties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    Id., at 207-208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    78 A.3d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Under the established [conflict of law] principles ... and the facts of this case, did the Appellate Court properly\n   determine that [CUTPA] applies to this case?\"\n   <em>\n    Western Dermatology Consultants, P.C. v. Vitalworks, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20955\">\n    310 Conn. 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20A.3d%201182\">\n    81 A.3d 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). \"2. If the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, did the Appellate Court properly determine that the plaintiff failed to satisfy the requirements of CUTPA because, under the facts of this case, no trade or commerce occurred in the state of Connecticut?\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20A.3d%201182\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \"3.

Therefore, we consider it necessary to reformulate those questions so that they reflect the actual issues presented. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Rosado v. Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3991121\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/276/168/#p191\">\n    276 Conn. 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 191,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=884%20A.2d%20981\">\n    884 A.2d 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (court may \"reformulate ... the certified question to reflect ... accurately the issues presented\"). Accordingly, we set forth the following revised certified questions: 1. Under established choice of law principles, did the Appellate Court properly determine that CUTPA does not apply to the plaintiff's unfair trade practices claim? 2. If the answer to the first question is in the negative, did the Appellate Court properly determine that the plaintiff failed to satisfy the requirements of CUTPA because, under the facts of this case, no trade or commerce occurred in the state of Connecticut? 3. If the answer to the second question is in the negative, did the trial court properly decline to award prejudgment interest, punitive damages and certain requested litigation costs?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the Appellate Court incorrectly determined that the law of New Mexico should govern the plaintiff's unfair trade practices\n   claim because (1) the defendants waived their right to argue that New Mexico law should apply to that claim by failing to allege and establish in the trial court that there exists an outcome determinative conflict between the laws of Connecticut and New Mexico, and (2) under the test set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 6(2) and 145 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, Connecticut law governs its unfair trade practices claim. The defendants dispute the plaintiff's contention and argue, in addition, that, in light of the Appellate Court's disposition of the case against the plaintiff on all counts, there are no remaining facts to support the plaintiff's CUTPA claim, and, consequently, the appeal is moot. We conclude that the plaintiff's appeal is not moot and that the Appellate Court correctly determined that New Mexico law governs the plaintiff's unfair trade practices claim. We therefore remand the case for a new trial at which the plaintiff's unfair trade practices claim shall be decided under New Mexico law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We first address the defendants' contention that this appeal is moot. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    In re Jorden R.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147456\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/539/#p555\">\n    293 Conn. 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 555,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=979%20A.2d%20469\">\n    979 A.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) ( \"[m]ootness is a question of justiciability that must be determined as a threshold matter because it implicates [a] court's subject matter jurisdiction\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). As we previously indicated, the defendants argue that the appeal is moot because the Appellate Court's reversal of the trial court's judgment on the breach of contract, breach of warranty and negligent misrepresentation counts eliminated all of the possible factual bases for the alleged CUTPA violation. In addition, Cerner separately argues that there is no factual basis to support the plaintiff's CUTPA claim against it because the trial court found in favor of the defendants on the plaintiff's\n   unjust enrichment claim, and because the plaintiff alleged in its complaint that Cerner violated CUTPA only on the basis of the allegations in the unjust enrichment count. We disagree with both contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   With respect to the first contention, the record reveals that the Appellate Court reversed the trial court's judgment on the plaintiff's breach of contract claim not because the trial court's factual findings relating to that claim were unsupported but, rather, because the plaintiff failed to comply with the notice requirements in the parties' contract and the Uniform Commercial Code for bringing such a claim. See\n   <em>\n    Western Dermatology Consultants,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    P.C. v. VitalWorks, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415496\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/146/169/#p197\">\n    146 Conn.App. at 182-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    78 A.3d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, the Appellate Court reversed the trial court's judgment on the breach of warranty and negligent misrepresentation claims not because the trial court's factual findings relating to those claims were unsupported but, rather, because the trial court improperly had determined that the merger clause of the parties' contract did not limit the plaintiff to the warranties expressly provided thereunder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    Id., at 191, 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    78 A.3d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We also reject Cerner's separate contention because the record shows that the unjust enrichment count was not the only count that provided a factual basis for the unfair trade practices count. Specifically, in its CUTPA count, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants' conduct, \"including but not limited to their misrepresentations, their sale of nonfunctioning products, their refusal to comply with their obligations under the contract, their refusal to return [money] paid by the plaintiff for which the plaintiff received nothing of value, and their attempt to contract through false pretenses ... constitute[s] unfair and deceptive trade practices....\" Thus, it is clear that the plaintiff did not predicate its CUTPA count against Cerner solely on the allegations contained in the unjust enrichment count. Accordingly, we conclude that this appeal is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We turn, therefore, to the merits of the plaintiff's contention that the Appellate Court incorrectly determined that, contrary to the conclusion of the trial court, the law of New Mexico, rather than the law of Connecticut, governs the plaintiff's unfair trade practices claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We\n   begin our analysis by setting forth the legal principles\n   that govern our review of this claim.

With respect to \u00a7 145(2)(b), the Appellate Court concluded that the injury causing conduct occurred in New Mexico, \"where the goods were installed, service was provided, and training occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Western Dermatology Consultants P.C. v.

We do not agree completely with the Appellate Court's conclusion. Our review of the pertinent facts reveals that the events that the Appellate Court relied on were the consequences of an earlier occurrence, namely, VitalWorks' decision to make a binding offer for sale of the new software to the plaintiff from its headquarters in Connecticut, which, in turn, was the\n   result of VitalWorks' earlier demonstrations of the software to the plaintiff in California and New Mexico. We thus are persuaded that the injury causing conduct in this case occurred in California, New Mexico, and Connecticut. With regard to \u00a7 145(2)(c), we conclude that it is a neutral factor: the plaintiff is located in New Mexico, whereas VitalWorks was, at the time, headquartered in Connecticut, and Cerner is headquartered in Missouri. Finally, with respect to \u00a7 145(2)(d), we agree with the Appellate Court that the relationship between the parties was centered in New Mexico, where the plaintiff \"reviewed and signed the contract, beginning the [legal] relationship ... [and where] [t]he goods and concomitant services contracted for\n   were delivered, installed, and performed....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    Id., at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    78 A.3d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As we previously have explained, \"it is the significance, and not the number, of \u00a7 145(2) contacts that determines the outcome of the choice of law inquiry under the Restatement [Second] approach.

Although the trial court found that \"[t]he sales agreement was drafted in Connecticut by VitalWorks,\" and that \"Connecticut was the state where the parties' relationship initiated,\" these factors alone do not outweigh the significant contacts to New Mexico. Consistent with the determination of the Appellate Court, therefore, we conclude that, on balance, \"New Mexico had the greatest contact with the parties in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Western Dermatology Consultants P.C. v.

Section 6(2)(a), the needs of the interstate\n   and international systems, supports neither state's law. With regard to \u00a7 6(2)(b), the relevant policies of the forum, we conclude that, although Connecticut undoubtedly has an interest in applying its law to ensure that local businesses do not engage in unfair trade practices in this state, that interest is not especially strong in the present case in view of the limited nature of the contact that occurred between the parties in Connecticut.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   New Mexico's interest in protecting its citizens and commercial enterprises from unfair or deceptive trade practices, however, is especially strong in the present case considering the facts that the plaintiff conducts its business exclusively in New Mexico and that the majority of the dealings between the parties took place in that state. Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 6(2)(c), which requires consideration of the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states, also supports application of New Mexico law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Turning to \u00a7 6(2)(d), the protection of justified expectations, we agree with the Appellate Court that there was \"no justified expectation that Connecticut law, including CUTPA, would apply to tort claims not arising from the construction and interpretation of the contract itself.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    Id., at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    78 A.3d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As we explained, the Appellate Court reached its determination on the basis of the choice of law provision in the parties' contract, which designated Connecticut as the forum state but expressly limited the application of Connecticut law to \"the construction and interpretation of the contract itself.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Thus, on the basis of the breadth and depth of the parties' contacts with New Mexico, we agree with the Appellate Court that it was much more reasonable for the parties to expect New Mexico law to govern any\n   consumer protection related dispute arising out of their business relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We also agree with the Appellate Court that \u00a7 6(2)(e), the basic policies underlying the particular field of law, is a neutral factor because the unfair trade practice statutes of both New Mexico and Connecticut are intended to effectuate the same policies, namely, \"[t]he deterrence of tortious\n   conduct and the provision of compensation for the injured victim....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20167\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   quoting 1 Restatement (Second), supra, at \u00a7 145, comment (b), p. 416. The remaining factors, \u00a7 6(2)(f) and (g), direct us to examine the certainty, predictability and uniformity of result, and the ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied, respectively. As we observed in\n   <em>\n    O'Connor,\n   </em>\n   these factors \"should 'not be overemphasized' \";\n   <em>\n    O'Connor v.

Once again, we agree with the Appellate Court that, to the extent they are relevant, the factors set forth in \u00a7 6(2)(f) and (g) militate in favor of applying New Mexico law \"because the vast majority of the plaintiff's contact with the defendants happened in New Mexico. It would, therefore, be predictable and uniform, as well as easy, to determine and apply\" the law of that state.\n   <em>\n    Western Dermatology Consultants P.C. v.

Logically, however, once the Appellate Court had been apprised of the multistate nature of the relationship between the parties and of the potential outcome determinative conflict between the laws of the various states involved, it should have addressed the broader question of which state's law governs the dispute before determining whether any law had been violated.

The defendants argued, rather, that the New Mexico statute of limitations barred the plaintiff's claim. In fact, the statute of limitations for actions brought under the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act is four years, one year longer than CUTPA's limitation period. Compare\n    <em>\n     Nance v. L.J.

See footnote 14 of this opinion. Generally, however, choice of law claims must be raised in the trial court in a timely manner; otherwise, they are deemed to be waived. E.g.,\n    <em>\n     Harty v.

If the trial court had decided the choice of law issue correctly, however, that court would have been required to apply New Mexico law to the plaintiff's claim. In such circumstances, the defendants, having asked the trial court to apply New Mexico law to the plaintiff's unfair trade practices claim-presumably because they believed that that state's statute of limitations favored them-have no cause to complain about a remand so that New Mexico law can be applied. Such a remedy simply places them in the position that they would have been in if the trial court had decided the choice of law issue correctly, in accordance with the defendants' request.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
