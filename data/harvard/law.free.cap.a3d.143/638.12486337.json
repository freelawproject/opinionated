On appeal, the defendants claim that the court erred in rendering summary judgment as to liability only in favor of the substitute plaintiff because: (1) the court improperly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Karen Aubut was provided with preacceleration notice of default in the manner required by the terms of the mortgage; (2) the court improperly accepted an affidavit submitted in support of the substitute plaintiff's motion for summary judgment; and (3) the court improperly concluded as a matter of law that the defendants could\n   not prevail with respect to their special defenses. We agree, in part, with the defendants' third claim. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 29, 2009, the defendants executed and delivered a note and mortgage deed to the original, named plaintiff in this action, Bank of America, N.A., in order to obtain a loan to purchase a home in Middletown. The defendants subsequently defaulted on their payments beginning with the payment due on August 1, 2011. On September 16, 2011, the original plaintiff mailed a preacceleration notice of default that was addressed to David Aubut, indicating that the defendants were in default and that it would accelerate the balance on the loan if they did not cure the default on or before October 16, 2011. The defendants failed to cure the default and the debt was accelerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 20, 2012, the original plaintiff commenced a foreclosure action against the defendants. In its complaint, the original plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that the defendants had defaulted on their mortgage payments and that they had failed to cure the default. The original plaintiff alleged that, as a result, it had elected to accelerate the balance due on the note and to foreclose the mortgage on the defendants' home. On June 5, 2012, the defendants requested to participate in a foreclosure mediation program. Although the defendants did participate in the mediation program from June 9, 2012, to May 30, 2013, they were unsuccessful in reaching an amicable resolution. The defendants filed for bankruptcy in June, 2013. On or about November 13, 2013, the original plaintiff filed a notice of relief from the bankruptcy stay due to the fact that the bankruptcy case had been closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 28, 2014, the original plaintiff executed an assignment of the mortgage, whereby the substitute\n   plaintiff, as the original plaintiff's attorney in fact, assigned the mortgage to itself. The substitute plaintiff's involvement in the foreclosure action began after the court granted the original plaintiff's June 18, 2014 motion to substitute on June 30, 2014. On July 18, 2014, the defendants filed their disclosure of defense, as well as their answer, which contained special defenses and a three count counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 30, 2014, the substitute plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment. The substitute plaintiff, in its memorandum of law in support of the motion, argued that there were no genuine issues of material fact regarding the defendants' liability under the note and the mortgage, and that summary judgment was proper because the defendants' special defenses and counterclaim were legally insufficient. In support of its motion, the substitute plaintiff submitted copies of several documents, including, in relevant part: the note and the mortgage deed that the defendants had executed and delivered to the original plaintiff; the September 16, 2011 preacceleration notice of default mailed by the original plaintiff; the March 28, 2014 assignment of mortgage wherein the substitute plaintiff had assigned itself the mortgage; records documenting the defendants' mortgage payment history; and an affidavit of Fay Janati, an employee of the substitute plaintiff, in which she averred that the defendants were in default and that they were liable to the substitute plaintiff for the balance of the mortgage loan that they had failed to pay pursuant to their mortgage agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 13, 2015, the defendants filed their opposition to summary judgment and an accompanying memorandum of law. In support of their opposition, the defendants also submitted copies of several documents, including: paragraph twenty-two of the mortgage deed; a January 13, 2015 notice sent by the defendants' counsel notifying the original plaintiff and the substitute\n   plaintiff that Karen Aubut was rescinding the mortgage pursuant to\n   \u00a7 1635 of the federal Truth in Lending Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. ; a printed copy of Janati's LinkedIn profile; a job description of the \"Litigation Research Analyst\" position posted by the substitute plaintiff; the March 28, 2014 assignment of mortgage; Janati's affidavit; and an affidavit of David Aubut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 26, 2015, the court issued a memorandum of decision wherein it rendered summary judgment as to liability only in favor of the substitute plaintiff. Thereafter, the court rendered judgment of strict foreclosure in favor of the substitute plaintiff. This appeal followed. Additional procedural history and facts shall be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendants first claim that the court erred in rendering summary judgment in the substitute plaintiff's favor because it improperly concluded that there was no genuine issue with respect to whether Karen Aubut, as a \"Borrower\" listed under the mortgage deed, was provided with preacceleration notice of default in the manner required by the terms of the mortgage. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The following additional procedural history and facts are relevant to this claim. In their opposition to the substitute plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, the defendants argued that the preacceleration notice of default that the substitute plaintiff sent to David Aubut created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the substitute plaintiff had established a prima facie case to institute the foreclosure action. Specifically, in their opposition memorandum of law, the defendants argued the following with respect to this issue: \"In its complaint and affidavit in support of its motion [for] summary judgment, [the substitute plaintiff] alleges that it gave proper notice of intent to accelerate to [the\n   defendants] as borrowers as required by paragraph [twenty-two] of the subject mortgage.... A review of the notice reveals that it is deficient as follows ... It is only addressed to David Aubut and not Karen Aubut (consistent with [the Truth in Lending Act] failure to provide notice of [the] right to rescind).... Based on the foregoing, [the substitute plaintiff] cannot make its prima facie case, as it did not, as [a] condition precedent to the institution of foreclosure, properly provide [the defendants] with a notice of default in compliance with the terms of the mortgage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court, relying on Janati's affidavit, stated that \"[b]y letter dated September 16, 2011, and sent by certified mail to the property address [for the home subject to the mortgage], [the original plaintiff] notified the defendants of the default. The defendants have failed to cure the default.\" At the conclusion of its memorandum of decision, the court stated that the substitute plaintiff had \"presented evidence that it sent a [preacceleration notice of default] which complied with the terms of the loan documents.\" The court set forth in its legal analysis of the substitute plaintiff's prima facie case for its foreclosure action, and the court also discussed the evidence submitted in support of summary judgment with respect to this issue: \"As evidenced by the mortgage deed, the defendants gave the [substitute] plaintiff's predecessor in interest a mortgage to secure the payment of the note. The terms of the mortgage determine the [substitute] plaintiff's right to foreclosure [of] the mortgage.... In the present case, the note and mortgage deed provide that upon a default under the promissory note, the [substitute] plaintiff is entitled to foreclosure on the mortgage, to demand immediate payment of all sums due and owing, and to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing its remedy. When\n   the [substitute] plaintiff establishes its ownership of the note and satisfies the court of a\n   defendant's failure to make payments according to the note, the [substitute] plaintiff establishes its right to avail itself of such security as the mortgage affords.... In other words, in order to make out a prima facie case in [a] foreclosure action, the [substitute] plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it [is] the owner of the note and mortgage and that [the defendant has] defaulted on the note.... In this case, it is alleged that the defendant, David Aubut, executed the note in the original principal amount of $189,957. The [substitute] plaintiff has presented evidence that the [substitute] plaintiff is the holder of the note and mortgage, which mortgage was executed by the defendants; the note and mortgage are in default; the [substitute] plaintiff has elected to accelerate the indebtedness; and the defendants were duly notified in writing of the default. Again, the party opposing a summary judgment motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. It is not enough for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of a disputed issue. The defendants have not provided such foundation.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court also noted that in addition to their properly pleaded special defenses, the defendants had attempted to raise additional defenses to the foreclosure in their opposition to the substitute plaintiff's motion for summary judgment: a defense asserting a violation of the Truth in Lending Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., as well as a defense alleging \"failure to give proper notice of the acceleration of the note.\" The court then stated that \"[t]he defendants have not pleaded these defenses in their special defenses,\" and that the substitute plaintiff had \"presented evidence that it sent a notice of acceleration which complied with the terms of the loan documents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal, the defendants argue that a genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to whether they were sent proper preacceleration notice of default. They assert, correctly, that in order to establish its prima facie case to commence a foreclosure action, the substitute plaintiff must prove that all conditions precedent to foreclosure have been satisfied. The defendants argue that, pursuant to the terms of the mortgage, the proper delivery to both defendants of the preacceleration notice of default was a condition precedent to foreclosure. The defendants allege that no evidence was submitted to demonstrate that Karen Aubut received the preacceleration notice of default. The defendants argue that a genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to the propriety of the preacceleration notice of default because although the evidence submitted by the parties in support of or in opposition to summary judgment shows that the preacceleration notice of default was addressed to one defendant, David Aubut, and that only he had signed the note, paragraph twenty-two of the mortgage deed provides that \"Borrower\" shall be given preacceleration notice, and the first page of the deed defines \"Borrower\" as \"David J. Aubut and Karen Z. Aubut.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The substitute plaintiff argues that the court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the preacceleration notice of default. The substitute plaintiff argues that the defendants' argument that notice to both David Aubut and Karen Aubut was a condition precedent to the foreclosure action is flawed because, despite the fact that the mortgage deed defines both David Aubut and Karen Aubut as \"Borrower,\" the note identifies only David Aubut as the borrower\n   and also provides, in paragraph 6(C), that \"If\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   am in default, the Note Holder may send\n   <em>\n    me\n   </em>\n   a written notice telling me that if\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   do not pay the overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder\n   may require\n   <em>\n    me\n   </em>\n   to pay immediately the full amount of Principal which has not been paid and all the interest\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   owe on that amount.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) Alternatively, the substitute plaintiff asserts that even if notice to David Aubut and Karen Aubut was a condition precedent to the foreclosure action, the defendants never submitted any evidence to the court to contradict Janati's affidavit wherein she averred that, on September 16, 2011,\n   <em>\n    both defendants\n   </em>\n   were given preacceleration notice of default on their mortgage payments. We agree with the substitute plaintiff that the court did not err in concluding that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the preacceleration notice of default that was sent to the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We begin our analysis with the appropriate standard of review. \"On appeal, [w]e must decide whether the trial court erred in determining that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [O]ur review is plenary and we must decide whether the [trial court's] conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear on the record....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Practice Book [\u00a7 17-49 ] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits, and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"A material fact is a fact that will make a difference in the outcome of the case....

To oppose a motion for summary judgment successfully, the nonmovant must recite specific facts ... which contradict those stated in the movant's affidavits and documents....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[B]ecause the [substitute] plaintiff sought summary judgment in a foreclosure action, which is an equitable proceeding, we note that the trial court may examine all relevant factors to ensure that complete justice is done.... The determination of what equity requires\n   in a particular case, the balancing of the equities, is a matter for the discretion of the trial court....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"In order to establish a prima facie case in a mortgage foreclosure action, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it is the owner of the note and mortgage, that the defendant mortgagor has defaulted on the note and that any conditions precedent to foreclosure, as established by the note and mortgage, have been satisfied.... Thus, a court may properly grant summary judgment as to liability in a foreclosure action if the complaint and supporting affidavits establish an undisputed prima facie case and the defendant fails to assert any legally sufficient special defense.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v.

Assuming, as the defendants argue, that such notice to both defendants was required, we conclude that the defendants failed to demonstrate that a genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to whether such\n   notice had been given. On the basis of our review of the documentary proof submitted by the substitute plaintiff in support of its motion for summary judgment, as well as the documentary proof submitted by the defendants in support of their opposition, we conclude that the court did not err in its determination that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the propriety of the preacceleration notice of default. The definitions section of the mortgage deed defines \"Borrower\" as \"David J. Aubut and Karen Z. Aubut,\" and paragraph twenty-two of the mortgage deed sets forth the following with respect to acceleration: \"Lender shall give notice to Borrower prior to acceleration following Borrower's breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument....\" The September 16, 2011 preacceleration notice of default was addressed only to David Aubut. We note, however, that only David Aubut signed the note and that the note provides that he is entitled to receive preacceleration\n   notice of default. Furthermore, Janati, a representative of the substitute plaintiff, averred in her affidavit that \"[b]y letter dated September 16, 2011 and sent by certified mail to the subject property address on that date,\n   <em>\n    the Defendants\n   </em>\n   were duly notified of the default.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In support of their opposition to the substitute plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, the defendants submitted, inter alia, paragraph twenty-two of the mortgage deed, a January 13, 2015 notice sent by the defendants' counsel notifying the original plaintiff and the substitute plaintiff that Karen Aubut was rescinding the mortgage pursuant to \u00a7 1635 of the federal Truth in Lending Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., Janati's affidavit, and an affidavit of David Aubut. Potentially, an affidavit submitted by Karen Aubut would have been significant with respect to the issue of whether she had received notice, but the defendants did not submit proof of such nature\n   to the court. Furthermore, David Aubut did not make any averments, from personal knowledge, that Karen Aubut had not received proper preacceleration notice of default as required by the terms of the mortgage deed and the note. We iterate that the defendants were required to \"recite specific facts ... which contradict those stated in the movant's affidavits and documents\" in order to defeat the substitute plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v.

The substitute plaintiff, through the documentary proof submitted in support of its motion for summary judgment, met its burden of establishing the nonexistence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the preacceleration notice of default. Given that the defendants, in their opposition to the substitute plaintiff's motion, did not state\n   <em>\n    specific facts\n   </em>\n   to contradict the proof submitted by the substitute plaintiff showing that both defendants were sent preacceleration notice of default, we conclude that the defendants failed to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the preacceleration notice of default. Thus, we conclude that the court did not err in determining that there was no genuine issue concerning whether the original plaintiff-and the substitute plaintiff, through assignment of the mortgage-thereby satisfied all of the conditions precedent to institute the foreclosure action against the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Next, the defendants claim that the court erred in rendering summary judgment because it accepted Janati's affidavit, which had been submitted to the court in support of the substitute plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The following additional procedural history and facts are relevant to this claim. In her affidavit, Janati averred\n   that she was employed by the substitute plaintiff as a \"Litigation Resolution Analyst.\" Janati averred that, in this capacity, she had reviewed the records of the defendants' mortgage payments and that she was personally familiar with these records. Janati averred that the defendants were in default under the terms of the mortgage and that they were sent preacceleration notice of default on September 16, 2011. Janati also averred that the substitute plaintiff was the mortgagee, that it was the holder of the note, that it was in possession of the note, and that it had satisfied \"any and all conditions precedent to enforcing this [mortgage] instrument.\" The acknowledgement portion of the affidavit, which appears at the very end of the affidavit, states in relevant part: \"Subscribed and\n   sworn to before me on this 29 day of October, 2014, before me, the undersigned officer, personally appeared, Fay Janati, who acknowledged himself/herself to be\n   <em>\n    the Assistant Secretary of Nationstar Mortgage, LLC,\n   </em>\n   and that s/he, as such officer, being authorized to do, executed the foregoing instrument for the purposes therein contained and subscribed, swore and acknowledged the same to be his/her free act and deed and the free act and deed on behalf of Nationstar Mortgage, LLC.\" (Emphasis added.) Below the acknowledgement appears the signature of the notary public before whom Janati appeared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The defendants, in support of their opposition to summary judgment, submitted, inter alia, Janati's affidavit, a printed copy of Janati's LinkedIn profile, a job description of the \"Litigation Research Analyst\" position posted by the substitute plaintiff, and an affidavit of David Aubut. The court, in its memorandum of decision, discussed and indicated its reliance upon Janati's affidavit in rendering its decision, wherein it concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that the substitute plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On appeal, the defendants claim that the court improperly accepted Janati's affidavit in support of the substitute plaintiff's motion for summary judgment because it reflects that Janati held two different positions for the substitute plaintiff. The defendants claim that this fact somehow casts doubt on her ability to testify competently about the subject matter of her affidavit. In opposition, the substitute plaintiff argues that, in terms of whether the affidavit was properly accepted by the court, it is inconsequential that Janati averred that she occupied two different positions for the substitute plaintiff, a private entity, because that fact does not suggest anything improper. Furthermore, the substitute plaintiff argues that the court properly accepted the affidavit because the defendants did not submit a legally sufficient affidavit or other documentation to contradict the averments in Janati's affidavit or to challenge her ability to testify competently with respect to the matters in the affidavit. We agree with the substitute plaintiff that the court did not err in accepting Janati's affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We begin our analysis of this claim with the appropriate standard of review. \"In reviewing the legal basis for summary judgment, this court properly may consider facts contained in the affidavits submitted in support of, or in opposition to, the motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Cogswell v.

Janati averred that she was employed by the substitute plaintiff as a litigation resolution analyst and that, in that capacity, she had\n   reviewed and had acquired personal knowledge of the defendants' obligations under their mortgage. Janati averred that she had personal knowledge of \"payment histories, loan histories, servicing records, and default notices\" as they applied to the defendants. Janati averred that these records were maintained in the ordinary course of the substitute plaintiff's business, that she had personal knowledge of the process by which the records were created and maintained, and that she knew that the records were accurate.

The affidavit describes Janati as having acknowledged herself also to be the \"Assistant Secretary\" of the substitute plaintiff. The mere fact that the affidavit reflects that Janati held two different positions with the substitute plaintiff does not call into question her competence to testify about the records concerning the defendants' mortgage with the substitute plaintiff. The defendants did not submit any proof that cast doubt on Janati's competence to testify with respect to the matters set forth in the affidavit, and her averments concerning the defendants' mortgage records were adequate to establish her personal knowledge concerning the matters set forth in the affidavit.

In the defendants' answer, they set forth two special defenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first special\n   defense was entitled, \"Predatory Lending,\" and the second special defense alleged a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its memorandum of law in support of its motion for summary judgment, the substitute plaintiff argued that it could not be subject to the defendants' special defenses because they were not recognized defenses, they were legally insufficient,\n   and they could not be raised against the substitute plaintiff because of its status as an assignee of the mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court rejected the defendants' CUTPA defense, concluding in its memorandum of decision that the defendants had failed to assert a traditional equitable defense challenging the making, validity, or enforcement of the note or the mortgage. The court also rejected the defendants' \"predatory lending\" defense, stating: \"As [pleaded] by the defendants in the instant action, the ... special defense of 'predatory lending' is neither a legally recognized special defense which can stand on its own, nor could the allegations contained therein be construed to constitute a valid, legally sufficient, or traditionally recognized special defense to a foreclosure action. The defendants do not allege that there were any elements of fraud, misrepresentation, or any other form of inducement on the part of any party, and certainly do not allege any such conduct on the part of the [substitute plaintiff]. Since the defense or claim of predatory lending is nonexistent, no amount of repleading could cure such a defect and, as a result, the special defense and counterclaim is properly challenged by a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"Even assuming that a special defense of 'predatory lending' exists, the defendants have failed to plead sufficient facts which would satisfy the definition contained in [\n   <em>\n    Monetary Funding Group, Inc. v.

Also, the defendants argue that the court erred in its conclusion that the special defenses were not legally viable. The substitute plaintiff argues that the court properly concluded that it could not be subject to the defendants' special defenses because it was an\n   assignee of the mortgage and did not expressly assume any of the original plaintiff's liabilities.

If, on the other hand, the mortgagor responds to the foreclosure action by filing a counterclaim based upon his alleged overpayment of the loan prior to the assignment, the mortgagor must bring a separate claim against the assignor to recover the alleged overpayment unless the assignee has assumed liability for the assignor's preassignment conduct.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n   <em>\n    Hartford v.

Pursuant to this same rule, however, the substitute plaintiff did take the note subject to all defenses that could be asserted by the defendants, including equitable defenses. Thus, the court erred in its conclusion that the defendants could not raise special defenses against the substitute plaintiff solely because of its status as an assignee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Having concluded that the defendants were not precluded as a matter of law from raising special defenses against the substitute plaintiff, we next consider\n   whether the court, in rendering summary judgment, properly concluded that the defendants' purported special defenses were not legally viable.

In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful that, by its express terms, CUTPA provides a cause of action for its violation, but it does not expressly provide a defense by invalidating, or otherwise rendering unenforceable, agreements that are the product of unfair trade practices. See General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. ; see also 12 R. Langer et al., supra, at \u00a7 6.13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Some trial courts have expressed the view that a CUTPA violation may be raised as a special defense in a foreclosure action, against an assignee, in cases in which the assignee \"was somehow involved in the unfair trade practice or had an agency relationship with the loan originator....\"\n   <em>\n    PHH Mortgage Corp. v.

Even if we were to adopt this type of broader view of CUTPA, it would not benefit the defendants in the present case. In their special defense alleging a CUTPA violation, the defendants failed to allege that the\n   <em>\n    substitute plaintiff\n   </em>\n   engaged in any conduct that ran afoul of CUTPA, but alleged that the original plaintiff had originated the loan at issue. The defendants failed to allege that an agency relationship existed between the original plaintiff and the substitute plaintiff, but alleged in conclusory fashion that the substitute plaintiff was liable for all of the actions of the original plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   See footnote 3 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the court properly concluded that the alleged CUTPA violation was not a valid special defense, and that it therefore did not preclude the rendering of summary judgment in the substitute plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Predatory Lending\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The defendants also argue that the court erred by concluding that its predatory lending special defense did not preclude the rendering of summary judgment in the substitute plaintiff's favor. The defendants argue that predatory lending is properly pleaded as an independent special defense, and they urge this court to deem predatory lending to be a recognized equitable defense with respect to the making, enforcement, and validity of the note and mortgage. The defendants also\n   argue, alternatively, that their predatory lending allegations should be recognized as falling within the legal ambit of other recognized special defenses, such as fraud, unclean hands, unconscionability, and equitable estoppel. The substitute plaintiff argues that the court properly rendered summary judgment because the defendants' reliance on a special defense of predatory lending was legally unsound, as predatory lending is not a recognized special defense and the defendants' allegations were legally insufficient to withstand summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As we have set forth previously, the court concluded that the defendants' predatory lending special defense was not legally viable. Our research reveals that some Connecticut trial courts have considered allegations of \"predatory lending\" to constitute special defenses, but there is no legal authority that coherently defines such a defense. Similarly, there is a dearth of Connecticut case law analyzing predatory lending allegations. The defendants, however, argue that their predatory lending allegations should be considered within the context of the recognized equitable defenses of fraud, unclean hands, unconscionability, and equitable estoppel. In their memorandum of law in opposition to the substitute plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, the defendants raised a similar argument before the trial court. The defendants argue on appeal that the court erred in rendering summary judgment in the substitute plaintiff's favor because it should have interpreted their predatory lending allegations in the context of these other recognized special defenses. Moreover, the defendants argue that they demonstrated that a genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to\n   their allegation that the substitute plaintiff-through its actions with the defendants-had engaged in behavior that implicated these recognized special defenses.\n   We first must focus our analysis on the precise nature of the special defense at issue. \"The interpretation of pleadings is always a question of law for the court.... Our review of the trial court's interpretation of the pleadings therefore is plenary.... Furthermore, we long have eschewed the notion that pleadings should be read in a hypertechnical manner. Rather, [t]he modern trend, which is followed in Connecticut, is to construe pleadings broadly and realistically, rather than narrowly and technically.... [T]he complaint must be read in its entirety in such a way as to give effect to the pleading with reference to the general theory upon which it proceeded, and do substantial justice between the parties.... Our reading of pleadings in a manner that advances substantial justice means that a pleading must be construed reasonably, to contain all that it fairly means, but carries with it the related proposition that it must not be contorted in such a way so as to strain the bounds of rational comprehension.... [T]he practice of reading pleadings broadly applies to special defenses as well.... As long as the pleadings provide sufficient notice of the facts claimed and the issues to be tried and do not surprise or prejudice the opposing party, we will not conclude that the complaint is insufficient to allow recovery.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Flannery v.

Notably, the defendants set forth detailed allegations concerning the financial circumstances of David Aubut at the time of the making of the\n   loan at issue.

Although the defendants did not explicitly characterize their special defense in terms of fraud, unconscionability, unclean hands, or equitable estoppel, their failure to do so is not dispositive in our analysis. The allegations, read broadly and realistically, set forth a general theory that the facts known to the original plaintiff concerning the financial situation of David Aubut were such that, at the time that the parties entered into the subject loan, the original plaintiff knew or should have known that the loan would fail. Stated otherwise, the defendants assert that because the facts were such that the original plaintiff offered David Aubut a loan that it knew or should have known was \"destined to fail from [its]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   inception,\" the substitute plaintiff should not be permitted to enforce the subject note and mortgage. Thus, the allegations fairly put the substitute plaintiff on notice that, on equitable grounds, the defendants intended to challenge the making of the note, mortgage, or both. As we have explained previously, a special defense of such nature is legally valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Having concluded that the defendants set forth a legally viable special defense, we also conclude that the defendants, in opposing summary judgment, demonstrated the existence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the special defense. The court had before it the note, the mortgage deed, and other records concerning the defendants' payment history. Among the materials submitted in their opposition to summary judgment, the defendants provided the court with an affidavit of David Aubut, consisting of thirty-two numbered paragraphs, in which he made factual averments concerning the making of the loan as well as his financial situation at the time of the making of the loan. These averments supported the allegations made in his special defense. Additionally, David Aubut averred: \"We struggled from the first payment until the last payment we\n   were able to make on this loan. Eventually we just could not afford it any longer.\" Also, he averred: \"We were told by the lender's representative that the loan was affordable based on our household income and expenses. I believed the lender's representative had my best interest in mind but now know better.\" The substitute plaintiff did not make any attempt to counter these allegations by way of affidavit or other documentary evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   By means of David Aubut's affidavit, as well as other evidence concerning the loan, mortgage, and payment history that was before the court, we conclude that the defendants amply demonstrated that a genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to their special\n   defense that, on equitable grounds, challenged the making of the loan agreement at issue. The defendants presented proof of David Aubut's financial situation at the time of the origination of the loan, as well as proof that a representative of the substitute plaintiff had made statements with respect to the affordability of the loan, statements on which David Aubut had relied to his detriment. The proof presented concerning the loan and the conduct of the substitute plaintiff with respect to the loan was sufficient to give rise to a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the equitable defenses of fraud, unconscionability, unclean hands, and equitable estoppel applied. Because we conclude that the defendants' special defense implicated valid, equitable doctrines and that they demonstrated that a genuine issue of material fact existed with respect thereto, we conclude that the court erroneously rendered summary judgment in the substitute plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the substitute plaintiff's motion for summary judgment only as to the defendants' special defense of predatory lending and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    In this opinion, we shall refer to David Aubut and Karen Aubut collectively as the defendants, but we also shall refer to each of them by their respective names when it is necessary to refer to either of them individually.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The substitute plaintiff also argues that the defendants' claim is improper because it was never raised in the pleadings, but was raised for the first time in their memorandum of law in opposition to summary judgment. The court implicitly agreed with this conclusion in its memorandum of decision, as it stated: \"In their opposition to the [m]otion for [s]ummary [j]udgment, the defendants raise additional defenses ... [including the substitute plain-tiff's] failure to give proper notice of the acceleration of the note. The defendants have not pleaded these defenses in their special defenses.... [The substitute plaintiff] has presented evidence that it sent a notice of acceleration which complied with the terms of the loan documents.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    To the extent that the substitute plaintiff argues that the court was barred from considering the defendants' claim as to the preacceleration notice of default because it was not raised in the pleadings and was raised for the first time at the summary judgment stage, we disagree. In order for the substitute plaintiff in the present case to establish its prima facie case for foreclosure of the defendants' mortgage, it had to prove \"by a preponderance of the evidence that it [was] the owner of the note and mortgage, that the defendant mortgagor [had] defaulted on the note and that any conditions precedent to foreclosure, as established by the note and mortgage, [had] been satisfied.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v.

raised a claim of error related to the court's rendering of summary judgment in favor of the substitute plaintiff on their counterclaim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Although in their opposition to summary judgment the defendants argued that \"a high level, fiduciary relationship\" existed between the substitute plaintiff and the original plaintiff, this type of relationship is at odds with an agency relationship. Moreover, the defendants did not present proof to demonstrate that the substitute plaintiff was the original plaintiff's agent, or that it otherwise had assumed its liabilities.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
