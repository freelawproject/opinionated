The arbitrator concluded that the City's effort to assign a case manager to monitor the Heart and Lung Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   benefits paid to a firefighter was not authorized by the parties' collective bargaining agreement (CBA) and, thus, sustained the grievance. The City contends that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction over the grievance and exceeded his authority under the CBA. We affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Gregory Freitas has been employed as a firefighter by the City since September 1999. On April 23, 2014, while on duty, he injured his knee. When x-rays revealed no broken bones, he returned to work. However, shortly thereafter, while working at a fire, Freitas' knee \"acted up\" while he was dragging a hose. Arbitration Award at 5. On April 29, 2014, Freitas filed an accident report, which the City forwarded to its third-party benefits administrator, Excalibur Insurance Management Services, Inc. On July 9, 2014, Freitas had surgery on his knee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the interim, in June of 2014, Freitas received a telephone call from Patricia Timlin, who identified herself as an employee of Vocational Rehabilitation Services. Timlin explained that she had received his file from Excalibur Insurance Management Services and offered to help Freitas with his \"comp\" injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Arbitration Award at 6. Freitas, who had not filed a workers' compensation claim, rejected her offer. Thereafter, Timlin sent Freitas a release to permit her access to his medical records, which Freitas declined to sign. When Timlin appeared at one of Freitas' medical appointments in Allentown, Pennsylvania,\n   he objected to her presence; she voluntarily left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 2, 2014, the Union filed a grievance that stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   No agreement exists that [Union Firefighters] will use a City Doctor nor has there been an agreement regarding the sharing of medical info[rmation] for injured [Firefighters] with VOC rehab or any other case manager. Not only is it a HIPAA\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   violation it is a violation of the CBA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Reproduced Record at 87a (R.R. 1056). On April 1, 2015, the American Arbitration Association assigned Stanley L. Aiges as arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After a hearing, the arbitrator sustained the grievance. He saw the core question to be whether the City had improperly interfered with Freitas' rights under Article 12 of the CBA, which guarantees firefighters injured on the job medical benefits and full pay until they return to work. He noted that the Union argued that the CBA did not give the City the right to impose the \" 'officious oversight' permitted under Workers' Compensation to Heart and Lung benefit recipients.\" Arbitration Award at 8. The City responded that the CBA did not preclude it from monitoring Heart and Lung benefits. The arbitrator agreed with the Union and explained his decision as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   I am convinced that there is only one logical explanation for the failure of the parties to address the question of \"monitoring\" Fire Fighters receipt of Heart and Lung benefits: they saw no need to do so. They were fully cognizant of the difference between the Heart and Lung Act and the Workers' Compensation Act. Only the latter allowed for an employer to screen and monitor an injured employee's recuperation....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Any possible question as to that was set to rest by the strongly worded decision of Arbitrator Duff in 1989. And, for the next 24 years the City administered its Heart and Lung program without incident. In that time period, the record establishes, it never sought to impose the monitoring program it used for Workers' Comp recipients on those receiving Heart and Lung benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   That fact, standing alone, fully supports the Union's position.... There is no valid reason for me to conclude the City-by virtue of a change in administration-suddenly acquired a right to monitor Heart and Lung cases it had never had or exercised before.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I am unwilling now to read Article 12 as granting such a right to the City.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I find that the City's effort to seek to assign a \"Case Manager\" to monitor Freitas was a violation of his rights under Article 12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Arbitration Award at 13-14. The arbitrator did not award monetary damages but directed the City to cease and desist from any future effort to monitor those firefighters who are eligible for and receive Heart and Lung benefits. The City appealed the arbitration award to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 13, 2015, the trial court affirmed. In its decision, the trial court noted that because there was no record, it assumed that the \" 'evidence presented is as recounted in the arbitrator's award.' \" Trial Court op. at 3 (citation omitted). Given the deferential and limited review of arbitration, the trial court found no reason to vacate the award. The City then appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, the City argues that the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction and authority under the CBA. The City does not challenge Freitas' entitlement to Heart and Lung benefits, and the Union does not assert that Freitas has not received these benefits. Because the CBA is silent on how it will monitor Heart and Lung benefits, the City argues it was free to use Excalibur or Vocational Rehabilitation to monitor their payment to Freitas. The City argues that the award impinges upon its inherent managerial rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response, Union argues that Act 111 provides that firefighters have the right to bargain collectively concerning \" 'the terms and conditions of their employment, including ... other benefits....' \" Union Brief at 15 (citation omitted). Heart and Lung benefits, which are based on an employee's negotiated salary, constitute a term and condition of employment and, thus, a mandatory subject of bargaining. Stated otherwise, the City had to bargain over the monitoring of the payment and administration of Heart and Lung benefits, and it did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Review of a grievance arbitration award arising under Act 111 is conducted under a standard of narrow\n   <em>\n    certiorari.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    City of Beaver Falls v.

In the instant case, the City argues that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction and exceeded his powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We begin with Article 12 of the CBA, entitled \"Injury Leave-Sick Leave-Insurance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   It states, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Section 1.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Whenever a member of the Fire Department is incapacitated from duty because of sickness contracted as a result of working conditions or an injury sustained in the performance of his duty, he shall be entitled to sickness or injury leave with full pay during the period which he is unable to perform his duties until such time as he has been accepted for retirement by the Firemen's Pension System.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Whenever a member is injured or becomes ill or becomes partly or permanently disabled in the line of duty while being engaged in Fire Fighting Services rendered to other communities through the Mutual Agreement Plan with other communities, he shall be entitled to all benefits under this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Section 2.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The City shall pay the hospital, medical and surgical expenses incurred by any member of the Department who is injured in the performance of his duties. If a Fire Fighter is injured while performing job related activities and is not compensated for hospital transportation by Worker[s'] compensation, the City shall provide such transportation free of charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   R.R. 33a-34a. Article 12 guarantees a firefighter who suffers a work-related injury \"full pay during the period which he is unable to perform his duties\" and medical benefits; it says nothing about how these benefits will be monitored by the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Article 16 of the CBA, entitled \"Grievance Procedure,\" is also relevant to the question of the Arbitrator's jurisdiction. Article 16 states, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Section 1.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The purpose of the grievance procedure shall be to settle all grievances between the Fire Department and the Union as quickly as possible, so as to insure efficiency and promote employees' morale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Should any employee or group of employees feel aggrieved as a result of\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any condition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    arising out of the employee-employer relationship,\n   </em>\n   including the claim of unjust discrimination on any matter or condition affecting health and safety beyond those normally encountered in all phases of fire fighting, adjustment shall be sought as follows by the employee, with the assistance of the Union....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   R.R. 44a (emphasis added). The Union argues that because Freitas' grievance relates to a \"condition arising out of the employee-employer relationship,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   Heart and Lung Act benefits under Article 12 of the CBA, the arbitrator had jurisdiction to decide the grievance. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As our Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia v. International Association of Firefighters, Local 22,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4198867\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/606/447/\">\n    606 Pa. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4198867,7287773\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/999/555/\">\n    999 A.2d 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 564 (2010), the \"jurisdiction prong of narrow certiorari\" relates to whether the arbitrator may address a \"general class\" of controversy. Article 12 and Article 16 gave the arbitrator jurisdiction over \"any condition arising out of the employer-employee relationship,\" which includes Heart and Lung benefits. Accordingly, the arbitrator's jurisdiction was not limited to timely payment but \"any condition\" relating to Heart and Lung benefits, such as the appointment of a case manager to monitor an injured firefighter. It is the type of controversy that is subject to grievance arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   An arbitrator exceeds his powers under the narrow\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   test if \"he mandates ... an illegal act ... or requires a public employer to do that which the employer could not do voluntarily.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Scranton v.

This Court concluded that \"the relevant collective bargaining agreement d[id] not even mention probationary officers;\n    <em>\n     a fortiori,\n    </em>\n    the agreement fails to refute the at-will employment status of probationary officers.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8350185\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/930/618/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8350185\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/930/618/\">\n     at 625\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In examining the relevant CBA, this Court observed that it was \"dead silent on probationary officers\" and \"[f]rom silence, one cannot infer a specific intent to effect a change in Hall's status from an at-will employee to one with grievance rights.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8350185\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/930/618/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8350185\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/930/618/\">\n     at 625-26\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Jenkintown\n    </em>\n    teaches that an arbitrator may not add words to a CBA that is silent on the matter. If anything, it supports the award at issue here. Articles 12 and 16 of the CBA expressly state that the arbitrator has jurisdiction over \"any condition arising out of the employer-employee relationship,\" such as Heart and Lung benefits, which is the subject of Freitas' grievance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    For example, the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania State Troopers' Association, effective July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2004, states in Article 28, Section 9, that \"[m]atters dealing with Heart &amp; Lung shall be addressed in AR 4-4 as agreed to. Subsequent changes in AR 4-4 Heart &amp; Lung Procedures shall be subject to bargaining.\"\n    <em>\n     https://www.dol.gov/olms/regs/compliance/cba/pdf/cbrp1647.pdf\n    </em>\n    (last visited July 18, 2016).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    In his grievance, Freitas also challenged the City's sharing of his medical information with a third-party provider or Vocational Rehabilitation as a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
