On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court erred (1) in concluding that the defendants, as cosigners of the lease, were responsible to the plaintiff for any unpaid damages and rent incurred only during the specifically defined term of the lease; and (2) in considering evidence extrinsic to the lease in order to discern the parties' intent when the court determined that the intent of the parties was fully reflected in the four corners of the lease and no\n   ambiguity has been claimed or identified. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 16, 2014, the plaintiff instituted this action for damages, resulting from the breach of a residential lease, against the\n   tenants and the defendants. Following a two day trial, the court on March 16, 2015, rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff on his claim for damages against the tenants. The court, however, rendered judgment in favor of the defendants as to all claims against them. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following factual findings of the court and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On or about September 16, 2011, the plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement for a term beginning on September 16, 2011, and ending on September 30, 2012, with the tenants for a residential property in Danielson. The defendants cosigned the lease, agreeing to be \"jointly liable for the lease, its payments, and other responsibilities, until the lease has expired....\" After September 30, 2012, the end of the term of the lease, the tenants continued to occupy the premises pursuant to a month-to-month tenancy until May 5, 2014. The tenants failed to pay rent from April 1 to May 5, 2014, when they left the property. When the tenants vacated the premises, there was damage to the property that had not existed when the plaintiff visited the premises in November, 2012. The plaintiff hired a contractor to repair the damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court, applying the usual civil fair preponderance of the evidence standard, determined that whether the defendants could be held liable for damages to the property and for nonpayment of rent that occurred during the month-to-month tenancy created by the tenants' consensual holdover was a question of fact. The court reasoned: \"The hold over by the tenants in this case created a new tenancy,\n   and while the original lease made the [tenants] subject to the terms and conditions of the original lease in the new month-to-month tenancy, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants ... as nontenant cosigners of the original written lease cannot be held liable for damages arising from the new month-to-month tenancy created by the lessee[s] holding over with the consent of the lessor.\" The court also found that the guarantee of the defendants as nontenant cosigners was not a term or condition of the original lease within the meaning of the holdover provision of the lease, but instead it was a contract separate from that lease. Accordingly, the court found that any liability of the defendants expired on September 30, 2012, when the lease expired. Having already found that any damage to the property occurred after the plaintiff visited the property in November, 2012, the court found that the defendants were not liable for any damages claimed in this action because their liability was extinguished by the expiration of the lease on September 30, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the pendency of this appeal, and in compliance with an order of this court, the trial court issued an articulation of its decision in which it clarified that the only evidence outside of the four corners of the lease that it considered was (1) the fact that the lease was drafted by the plaintiff;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) that the plaintiff failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the intent of the parties was anything other than that shown in the document the plaintiff drafted and that was initialed where agreed to by the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the court erred in concluding that the defendants, as nontenant cosigners, were\n   responsible to him for the tenants' obligations only during\n   the term of the lease, which ended on September 30, 2012. The plaintiff argues that, pursuant to the unambiguous contract language, the defendants were liable for any damage to the subject property and nonpayment of rent after September 30, 2012. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we set forth the standard of review and guiding principles. The resolution of this appeal requires us to interpret the language of two written agreements: the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendants (guarantee),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the lease between the plaintiff and the tenants. The guarantee and the lease are contracts. See\n   <em>\n    Welk v.

Williston, Contracts (4th Ed.2012) \u00a7 32:6, p. 709.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the present case, the defendants' guarantee, which appeared on the last page of the lease document and was entitled \"Non tenant Co-signers,\" provided, in its entirety: \"By signing, we understand that we are jointly liable for this lease, its payments, and other responsibilities,\n   <em>\n    until the lease has expired,\n   </em>\n   or until the landlord secures a new lessee (in the case that the tenants choose to vacate the premises prior to the term of this lease).\" (Emphasis added.) Although the defendants' guarantee is contained in the same document as the lease, that guarantee is a contract separate from the lease. Additionally, the guarantee is not of unlimited duration because there is an outside time limit on its applicability. It is effective \"until the lease has expired.\" Because the guarantee itself did not set forth a specific date, e.g., September 30, 2012, when the lease ended, we must look to the lease for that date. See\n   <em>\n    Regency Savings Bank v. Westmark Partners,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1047969\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/59/160/#p164\">\n    59 Conn.App. at 164-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=756%20A.2d%20299\">\n    756 A.2d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The lease provided in paragraph 3: \"If the tenant decides to vacate the premises prior to the term of the lease, tenants will be responsible for monthly rent payments until the lease expires (September 30, 2012), or until Owner secures another tenant, whichever happens first....\" We read\n   similar or identical terms and words throughout a contract to have a consistent meaning. Accordingly, the lease expired on September 30, 2012, which is consistent with the term of the lease set forth at the beginning of the document as running from September 16, 2011 through September 30, 2012. Consequently, the guarantee obligated the defendants to be jointly liable for the \"lease, its payments and other responsibilities, until\" September 30, 2012. The unambiguous language of the guarantee, read in conjunction with the unambiguous language of the lease,\n   informs and supports our legal conclusion that the defendants' liability for any of the tenants' lease obligations did not include any of those obligations occurring on dates after the lease expired on September 30, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The plaintiff argues, however, that the lease did not expire until any extensions of the lease expired and that the holdover of the tenants, contemplated in paragraph 17 of the lease, constituted an extension. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The holdover provision contained in paragraph 17 of the lease provides: \"Should Tenants remain in possession of the Premises with the consent of Owner after the expiration of this Lease, a new tenancy from month to month shall be created between Owner and Tenant which shall be subject to all the terms [and] condition[s] hereof, but shall be terminable on thirty days written notice served by either party to the other party.\" The plaintiff argues that paragraph 17 does not create a new contract or lease, but merely extends the period of the tenants' occupancy under the original lease. Relying on principles governing extensions and covenants to renew,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiff distinguishes paragraph 17 from a covenant to renew with a new lease for a distinct term and argues that it acts to extend the original lease with all of its terms and conditions. He argues, therefore, that the lease did not expire until the extensions expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This analysis is flawed, however, in its claimed application to the defendants' guarantee. The plaintiff's extension argument is inconsistent with the limit of the application of the guarantee to tenant obligations occurring on or before September 30, 2012, the defined expiration date of the lease. As a separate contract; see\n   <em>\n    JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. Winthrop Properties, LLC,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20662\">\n    312 Conn. at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20A.3d%20622\">\n    94 A.3d 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the guarantee was not a term or condition of the lease. The text of the lease between the plaintiff and the tenants, for example, did not incorporate the guarantee between the plaintiff and the defendants into the lease, and paragraph 17, the holdover provision, does not incorporate or otherwise refer to the guarantee. Conversely, the guarantee between the plaintiff and the defendants did not contain any provision continuing or extending the defendants' guarantee obligation beyond September 30, 2012, in the event of the creation of a new month-to-month tenancy between the plaintiff and the tenants. Accordingly, the plain language and meaning of the relevant term of the guarantee between the plaintiff and the defendants is\n   that the defendants' guarantee ended when the lease expired on September 30, 2012, and, thus, the parties did not agree to hold the defendants liable for the tenants' obligations occurring after that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Moreover, while holding over under a lease could operate to extend the lease if that was provided for in the lease, the lease in this case does not include any such language. The holdover provision instead states that after the expiration of the lease-September 30, 2012-a new tenancy from month-to-month arises upon the agreement of the plaintiff on the same terms and conditions contained in the lease. Although many of the responsibilities and obligations between the plaintiff and the tenants remained the same as under the lease, the type of tenancy, notice provisions, and duration changed.

Thus, the claimed damages occurred after September 30, 2012. Additionally,\n   the rent was not paid for April and May, 2014. The plaintiff does not challenge these findings. Consequently, because their liability ended when the lease expired on September 30, 2012, and was not extended by the terms of either of the two agreements, the defendants are not liable for these claimed damages arising after that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court noted in its memorandum of decision that the defendants and tenants initialed certain paragraphs of the lease. In its articulation, the court added that \"the [plaintiff] failed to show ... that the intent of the parties was anything other than that shown in the document he drafted\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    was initialed where agreed to by\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    the defendants\n   </em>\n   ].\" (Emphasis added.) The court further stated that, if concerns remained after the expiration of the original term of the lease about the tenants' credit, \"[the plaintiff] should have insisted on\n   a [cosigner] for the new tenancy created, as the original document he drafted was not initialed and agreed to by [the defendants] in the operative paragraph 17.\" The court also noted that it considered that the plaintiff drafted the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The plaintiff makes several arguments that the court erred in considering extrinsic evidence in this case, including, inter alia, that the court improperly considered that he had drafted the lease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the only reasonable construction of the language of the guarantee, read in conjunction with the lease, is that the defendants' liability for the obligations of the tenants did not extend to the tenants' obligations occurring after the lease expired on September 30, 2012, we conclude that the relevant language of these agreements was unambiguous. Accordingly, we agree that the court's consideration of any evidence extrinsic to these documents was improper, as was its analysis of the guarantee as an issue of fact. Nevertheless, when a trial court reaches a correct decision but on improper grounds, this court may affirm if a proper basis exists to support the decision.\n   <em>\n    Favorite v.
