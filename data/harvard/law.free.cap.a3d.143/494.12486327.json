More specifically, Theodore M. Dunn and Lori N. Dunn (Objectors) ask whether the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County (trial court) erred in affirming a decision of the Middletown Township Zoning Hearing Board (ZHB) that granted Revonah Construction Company's (Applicant) requests for three variances from the Middletown Township Zoning Ordinance (zoning ordinance). Because the ZHB erred in granting variance relief based on the facts presented, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Applicant owns a 79,954 square foot parcel located at 1755 Fulling Mill Road in Langhorne, Middletown Township (Township), Pennsylvania (property). The property is improved with a vacant, ranch style, single-family detached home with an access walkway and driveway. Objectors own an adjacent property at 1737 Fulling Mill Road. Both properties lie within an RA-2 Residence Agricultural Zoning District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Applicant proposes to demolish the vacant home on the property and subdivide the property into three lots. Lot 1 would be 30,008 square feet and accommodate a single-family home. Lot 2 would be 30,152 square feet and accommodate an additional single-family home. Lot 3 would be 19,794 square feet; Applicant proposes to merge this undeveloped lot with a contiguous property, which is already improved with a single-family home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In August 2014, Applicant filed an application with the ZHB seeking three variances from Section 500-503 of the zoning ordinance. In particular, Applicant sought two variances from Section 500-503(B) of the zoning ordinance, which requires a minimum lot width of 125 feet, to allow a lot width of 106.73 feet on Lot 1 and a lot width of 107.24 feet on Lot 2. Applicant also sought a variance from Section 500-503(C) of the zoning ordinance to allow a density of 1.45 dwelling units per acre rather than the required maximum 1.2 dwelling units per acre.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The ZHB held a hearing on Applicant's variance requests. William Hess, Applicant's President (Applicant's President), testified the homes Applicant proposes to construct on Lots 1 and 2 would be \"high-end\" single-family homes marketed at approximately $630,000. ZHB Dec., 10/13/14, Finding of Fact No. 8. Applicant's President testified the house currently located on the property is in very poor condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Heath Dumack, who the ZHB qualified as a civil engineering expert (Applicant's Engineer), testified the property is approximately 212 feet wide and 410 feet deep. Applicant's Engineer testified Lots 1 and 2 would meet all of the dimensional requirements for the RA-2 zoning district except the minimum lot width and maximum lot density requirements. Applicant's Engineer testified there was no adjoining property for sale that would allow Applicant to meet the minimum width requirement and the width of the proposed lots would be deficient by approximately 15 percent. Applicant's Engineer testified Applicant would comply with local storm water runoff regulations, and Applicant would plant vegetation on the sides of the proposed subdivided lots as a buffer between adjoining properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Nine\n   </em>\n   neighbors testified in opposition to Applicant's variance requests. These witnesses testified Applicant could make use of the existing home on the property without any variance relief. They also expressed concern about storm water runoff. These witnesses also testified the proposed two-story homes on Lots 1 and 2 would disrupt the character of the neighborhood, which consists of one-story ranch homes. They also testified the proposed homes would devalue their properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Jim Schurr, a Township resident, testified he is familiar with Applicant and its President. He testified Applicant's proposed homes would enhance the neighborhood. Schurr also testified the existing home on the property is the least aesthetically attractive house on Fulling Mill Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Based on the evidence presented, the ZHB made the following conclusions of law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1. The [property] has been developed and used as is permitted by right in the RA-2 [district].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2. The proposed subdivision creates two building lots that meet all of the dimensional requirements of the [zoning] [o]rdinance with the exception of the lot width at building set back line, which is required to be 125 feet per [zoning] [o]rdinance \u00a7 500-503.B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   3. As the law requires that conflicts within [z]oning [o]rdinances be resolved in favor of the property owner, the maximum density requirement of 1.2 dwelling units per acre, contained at \u00a7 500-503.C, in this instance, would require a building lot greater in size than the minimum lot area requirement of 30,000 square feet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   4. Accordingly, the [ZHB] concludes that a variance from \u00a7 500-503.C is necessary and warranted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   5. This is not an application for a use variance, rather only one for a minor\n   deviation from one of the dimensional requirements of the [zoning] [o]rdinance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   6. Based upon all of the competent and credible evidence received by the [ZHB], it concludes that the construction of the two homes proposed will enhance both the [property] specifically and the neighborhood generally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   7. Any potential stormwater impacts will be mitigated by compliance with the stormwater management requirements of [the] Township and other appropriate governmental agencies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   8. There was no evidence presented by the opponents to the application that the construction of these two homes would negatively impact property values. Rather, only supposition and conjecture were offered by the opponents in this regard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   9. The subdivision of the [p]roperty as proposed, and the creation of two new single-family residences, as proposed, will have no negative impact upon surrounding properties or uses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   10. Although the opponents made reference to a 1989[ZHB] decision which denied a subdivision of the [property] into two lots, that decision was based upon the creation of a flag lot which only had a 25 foot width at building set back line. This application resolves that major variance from the [zoning] [o]rdinance and satisfies the [ZHB] that [Applicant] is seeking the minimum variance necessary to afford it relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   11. Accordingly, the Members of the [ZHB], determined, unanimously, to grant [Applicant's] request[s] for relief as is set forth hereafter:\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ZHB Dec., Concls. of Law Nos. 1-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Objectors appealed to the trial court. Without taking additional evidence, the trial court affirmed. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Objectors argue the trial court erred in determining the ZHB did not err or abuse its discretion in granting Applicant three variances to subdivide the property, raze an existing home on the property and construct two new homes on the property. They further assert the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   variance doctrine, cited by the trial court, but not relied on by the ZHB, does not justify the ZHB's grant of Applicant's three variance requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Objectors first argue the ZHB erred in granting Applicant's variance requests where Applicant did not establish unnecessary hardship would result if the ZHB denied the variances. Reviewing the standards for the grant of a variance, and applying those standards to the facts presented here, Objectors assert, makes it patently clear that the ZHB erred in granting the variances. To that end, the property has been and can continue to be utilized in conformity with the zoning ordinance, and Applicant did not even attempt to argue any variances were necessary to enable reasonable use of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Further, Objectors contend Applicant cannot argue economic hardship exists here. Indeed, Applicant purchased the property intending to subdivide it for its economic gain. Objectors also maintain that, assuming, without conceding, that denial the requested relief would cause Applicant economic hardship, it is well-settled that economic hardship alone is insufficient to justify the grant of a variance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hertzberg v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of City of Pittsburgh,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"765971,765949\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/554/249/\">\n    554 Pa. 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"765971,11785291,765949,11785390\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/721/43/\">\n    721 A.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). Here, Applicant was aware of the property's zoning classification and the existing, conforming use of the property; his desire to subdivide the property is driven solely by economics. Objectors argue the ZHB here completely disregarded the provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (MPC),\n   <em>\n    Hertzberg\n   </em>\n   and the remaining body of Pennsylvania law that make it clear that Applicant was in no way entitled to the three variances sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Objectors further maintain that\n   <em>\n    Cardamone v. Whitpain Township Zoning Hearing Board,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11097664\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/771/103/\">\n    771 A.2d 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Cmwlth.2001), in which a landowner sought a dimensional variance in connection with his proposal to subdivide a property into two lots, also compels reversal of the ZHB's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In addition, Objectors note the ZHB's Conclusion of Law No. 9 states: \"The subdivision of the [property] as proposed, and the creation of two single-family residences, as proposed, will have no negative impact upon surrounding properties or uses.\" Objectors argue the record does not support this determination. Rather, the overwhelming weight of the evidence regarding the proposed development's impact on surrounding properties and landowners indicated the proposal would adversely impact the surrounding neighborhood. Objectors contend the ZHB abused its discretion in reaching a contrary determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Objectors also maintain the ZHB's Conclusion of Law No. 5 is both an abuse of discretion and an error of law. It states: \"5. This is not an application for a use variance, rather only one for a minor deviation from one of the dimensional requirements of the [zoning] [o]rdinance.\" On this point, Objectors assert\n   <em>\n    Leonard v. Zoning Hearing Board of City of Bethlehem,\n   </em>\n   136 Pa.Cmwlth. 182,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1408292\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/136/182/\">\n    583 A.2d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) controls. There, this Court declined \"to establish ... that a subdivision creating a 6% plus deviation from the ordinance lot size minimum may be permitted solely on the basis that such deviation is\n   <em>\n    de minimis.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1408292\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/136/182/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1408292\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/136/182/\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Objectors argue Applicant's requested variances are not minor deviations for purposes of the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   doctrine because they constitute a 15% deviation from the minimum lot width requirement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section 500-503(B) of the zoning ordinance, and a 17% deviation from the maximum density requirement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section 500-503(C) of the zoning ordinance. Objectors contend, for the ZHB to conclude a 15% to 17% deficiency from a dimensional requirement is a \"minor deviation\" disregards settled law and is, therefore, an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Objectors maintain Applicant merely seeks to profit on its purchase of a two-acre property, which is already improved with a single-family home. Objectors argue Applicant needs to subdivide the property in order to maximize profit, and unfortunately for Applicant, the property is not wide enough to accommodate two homes instead of one. Objectors also note a prior owner of the property unsuccessfully attempted to do precisely what Applicant proposes here, subdivide the property, and the ZHB correctly rejected that request as the owner did not prove any hardship that would justify the grant of a lot width variance, the same type of variance Applicant now seeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition, Objectors argue the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   variance doctrine does not justify the dimensional variances granted here. They maintain the trial court conceded the\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    minimis\n   </em>\n   doctrine is a narrow exception to the heavy burden of proof involved in seeking a variance. Objectors assert\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   and other appellate cases hold the doctrine is to be applied in rare instances where only a minor deviation from a zoning ordinance is sought. As argued above, Objectors contend, for the ZHB to conclude a 15% to 17% deficiency from a zoning ordinance's minimum dimensional requirement is \"minor\" where, as here, the ZHB seems focused on the profit to be made by the developer if it is granted relief from the zoning ordinance's requirements, is a clear abuse of discretion as well as a disregard of settled law regarding\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   variances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The ZHB\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Applicant counter that the credited evidence establishes Applicant's zoning plan would preserve the essential character of the RA-2 district and would not be detrimental to the public welfare. They argue the ZHB credited Applicant's Engineer's testimony that Applicant would plant vegetation buffers around the property and would comply with local storm water runoff requirements. The ZHB and Applicant point out the ZHB did not credit the objecting landowners' testimony that Applicant's proposed development would decrease property values or otherwise interfere with surrounding properties. The ZHB and Applicant argue the ZHB credited Applicant's Engineer's testimony that Applicant's zoning plan would benefit neighboring properties by allowing them to connect to water and sewer utilities. They also maintain the ZHB credited Schurr's testimony that Applicant's proposed homes would enhance the aesthetics of the neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The ZHB and Applicant also assert the ZHB properly granted the variance from the maximum density requirement set forth in Section 500-503(C) of the zoning ordinance as that requirement would conflict with Applicant's ability to comply with the minimum lot area requirement in Section 500-503(A) of the zoning ordinance. To that end, Section 603.1 of the MPC,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   In interpreting the language of zoning ordinances to determine the extent of the restriction upon the use of the property, the language shall be interpreted, where doubt exists as to the intended meaning of the language written and enacted by the governing body, in favor of the property owner and against any implied extension of the restriction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   53 P.S. \u00a7 10603.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, the ZHB and Applicant argue the zoning ordinance requires a maximum density of 1.2 dwellings per acre in the RA-2 district. The zoning ordinance also requires a minimum lot size of 30,000 square feet. However, in order to enforce the maximum density requirement, a lot must exceed the 30,000 square-foot minimum lot area requirement. Here, they assert, each of the proposed lots meets, and even exceeds, the minimum lot area requirement, yet the proposed development still fails to meet the maximum density requirement of 1.2 dwellings per acre. The ZHB and Applicant contend this creates a conflict between two separate provisions of the zoning ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The ZHB and Applicant further argue the ZHB properly concluded Applicant's two requested variances from the minimum lot width requirement were\n   <em>\n    de minimis.\n   </em>\n   Zoning hearing boards have discretion to grant or deny a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   variance.\n   <em>\n    Hawk v.

The ZHB and Applicant argue the degree of variation is only one of many factors the ZHB could consider in deciding to grant a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   variance. They contend the circumstances presented here warrant a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   variance as the credited evidence established Applicant's zoning plan would preserve the essential character of and be beneficial to the surrounding neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The ZHB and Applicant also argue this case is factually distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Leonard,\n   </em>\n   relied on by Objectors. In\n   <em>\n    Leonard,\n   </em>\n   the landowner sought to subdivide his property into two 7,500 square foot lots and build a home on each lot. The landowner sought a variance from the local ordinance, which set the minimum lot size at 8,000 square feet. The zoning board granted the landowner a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   variance, and the common pleas court affirmed. On appeal, this Court reversed, concluding the variance was not\n   <em>\n    de minimis.\n   </em>\n   This Court's decision was based in part on its determinations that the property at issue was not irregularly shaped and its subdivision would not maintain any open and undeveloped space. The ZHB and Applicant maintain, in contrast to\n   <em>\n    Leonard,\n   </em>\n   here the property is almost twice as deep as it is wide and there is no additional property for sale that would correct its irregular shape. The ZHB and Applicant assert this case is also distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   because Applicant's plan to merge the proposed undeveloped Lot 3 with a contiguous property would maintain open and undeveloped space. Instead, this case is more akin to\n   <em>\n    West Bradford Township v.

Additionally, because Applicant could use the property for one compliant home without the need for zoning relief, the variance is not the minimum variance that would afford relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Nevertheless, the ZHB granted the \"variance\" from the maximum density requirement on the ground that it conflicted with the minimum lot area requirement.

F.F. No. 15. In granting relief from the 125-foot lot width requirement set forth in Section 500-503(B), a deviation of approximately 15%, the ZHB stated Applicant's request involved only a \"minor deviation from one of the dimensional requirements of the [zoning] [o]rdinance.\" Concl. of Law No. 5. The ZHB also determined the construction of the two proposed new homes would enhance the property and the neighborhood, Concl. of Law No. 6, and would not adversely impact property values or have a negative impact on surrounding properties or uses.

To that end, Applicant will need the two lot width variances because it intends to create two new undersized lots where none currently exist. As such, Applicant will be creating the undersized lot hardship it seeks to remedy. Further, while Applicant asserts the property is irregularly shaped because it is twice as wide as it is deep, the ZHB made no finding that this purported irregular shape necessitated variance relief. And, in any event, the property as it currently exists is over 200 feet wide, which is substantially greater than the minimum lot width required under the zoning ordinance. Moreover, it is beyond dispute that no variance is needed for Applicant to make reasonable use of the property for\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   single-family home (indeed, a single-family home currently exists on the property). Rather, Applicant seeks variance relief in order to subdivide the property and construct\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   single-family homes in an effort to maximize profitability.
