(Mercury) ], as an investment property. Neither the plaintiff nor his attorney recorded the warranty deed reflecting the sale in Hartford's land records. The real estate taxes were not paid on the property from January 1, 2004 through July 1, 2007. The defendants [city and Rosario] filed tax liens against the\n   property on June 11, 2004, May 2, 2005, June 16, 2006, and May 25, 2007. On July 12, 2007, the defendants executed a tax levy on the property for unpaid taxes in the amount of $18,698.94, and sold the property to the highest bidders at a tax sale. Prior to executing the tax sale, the defendants attempted to provide notice to all record owners/taxpayers, lienholders, mortgagees and encumbrancers of the property after performing a search of the Hartford land records, city\n   assessor's records and tax division records to determine who was entitled to receive notice. The search of the records revealed that the owner of record was Mercury and that the law firm of Hunt, Leibert, Chester &amp; Jacobson, P.C. (Hunt Leibert), the Metropolitan District Commission (Metropolitan) and the city held liens on the property. There was no record of the plaintiff's interest in the property on Hartford's land records or in the assessor's records. Additionally, there was no record of the plaintiff ever having paid taxes on the property.\" Id., at 5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%201144\">\n    51 A.3d 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The plaintiff claimed that the city sold the property without providing proper notice of the sale to him. Rosario was named as a defendant in the action. The plaintiff subsequently amended his complaint to add a count, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for money damages stemming from the alleged violation of his constitutional due process rights. Thereafter, the plaintiff and the defendant each filed a motion for summary judgment. On February 1, 2011, the court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiff's motion\n   for summary judgment.

In that motion, the defendant claimed that she had incurred $120,114.84 in legal fees and costs in defending the plaintiff's action. The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that it was untimely with regard to the fees incurred at trial and premature with regard to the fees incurred on appeal. On March 24, 2014, the defendant filed a second motion for attorney's fees and costs, claiming that she had incurred $139,285.01 in legal fees and costs at the trial court and on appeal. The court initially denied the defendant's motion due to her failure to appear at a hearing to justify the fees or to respond to the plaintiff's arguments against allowance of the fees. The court subsequently allowed reargument, and both sides presented arguments on the merits. At this time, the defendant supplemented her request for attorney's fees and costs, seeking a total award of $140,955.51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By decision dated July 28, 2014, the court found that the defendant's request for attorney's fees and costs initially incurred\n   in the trial court was untimely. The court further found that the defendant's request for appellate attorney's fees and costs, as well as fees and costs incurred postjudgment to secure the judgment, were recoverable. In sum, the court awarded the defendant a total of $40,824.11 for attorney's fees and costs. The plaintiff subsequently appealed, and the defendant cross appealed from this judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff claims that \u00a7 12-140 allows for the recovery of only costs and not attorney's fees. The defendant counters that \u00a7 12-140 plainly and unambiguously provides for the recovery of attorney's fees. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff's claim raises a question of statutory interpretation. \"The principles that govern statutory construction are well established.

Section 1988 of title 42 of the United States Code gives no indication that Congress intended to preempt state laws regarding municipal property taxation, an area typically occupied by the state. Under the plaintiff's reasoning, if a plaintiff raises a \u00a7 1983 claim as part of a challenge to a tax sale, a municipality\n   would be unable to recover the attorney's fees and costs incurred to defend the tax sale unless there was a showing that the plaintiff's action was \"frivolous, unreasonable or groundless, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

In her cross appeal, the defendant claims that the court erred in denying her motion for attorney's fees related to the initial proceedings in the trial court.

The fees of collectors upon a levy and sale shall be as follows: For each levy on real or personal property, twenty cents; for each notice posted, filed, published or sent by mail, as required by law, twenty-five cents; for each mile of travel from the residence of the collector to the farthest point where he is by law required to take a notice, or to go to levy upon personal property, and thence back to his residence once, twenty cents; for each sale of real or personal property, four dollars; for each deed or bill of sale, two dollars.\n    <em>\n     All other reasonable and necessary costs or expenses\n    </em>\n    for necessary advertising, postage on notices, and reasonable sums paid town clerks or other persons for examining records to ascertain encumbrances upon property sold, for preparing notices at the direction of the tax collector, for drafting collector's deeds,\n    <em>\n     for attorney's fees, for all costs incurred by the municipality in defending any civil action brought as a result of a tax sale or an alias tax warrant\n    </em>\n    or which seeks to enjoin or declare unlawful any tax sale or alias tax warrant, for the services of auctioneers, clerks and other persons retained to assist the collector in conducting the tax sale and\n    <em>\n     for any other fees and expenses incurred,\n    </em>\n    shall be added to the above fees. All fees and additions provided for by this section shall be paid by the delinquent taxpayer or as provided in section 12-157.\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 12-140. Even if the plaintiff is correct and the court should have cited the earlier revision of the statute, the prior revision of the statute also provided for the recovery of attorney's fees by the defendant. The plaintiff, therefore, cannot prevail on this claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    In considering this claim, the trial court, citing\n    <em>\n     Simms v.

While we agree that federal law is not binding when interpreting a state statute, we note that\n    <em>\n     Simms\n    </em>\n    did not involve a claim of federal preemption.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The plaintiff argues that the defendant's motion for attorney's fees and costs was not filed until March 24, 2014. According to the plaintiff, the court improperly \"reiterated\" the defendant's claim for attorney's fees made on December 18, 2012. Contrary to the plaintiff's contention, our review of the record reveals that a motion for attorney's fees and costs was filed on December 18, 2012. That motion requested trial and appellate attorney's fees. The plaintiff objected to the motion on the ground, inter alia, that \"[t]he time limit for certification to the United States Supreme Court is ninety days from the denial of certification to the Connecticut Supreme Court, which occurred on November 27, 2012. The appeal period has not expired, and consequently the ultimate 'prevailing party' which may allow an award of\n    <em>\n     appellate\n    </em>\n    attorney's fees under certain circumstances, has not been determined.\" (Emphasis in original.) The defendant filed another motion for attorney's fees and costs on March 24, 2014. That motion sought attorney's fees related to the initial trial court proceedings, the fees expended in defending the plaintiff's appeals to the Connecticut Appellate Court, the Connecticut Supreme Court, and the United States Supreme Court, as well as the plaintiff's motion to open the judgment and motion to reargue the denial of his motion to open the judgment. The court considered both motions in its ruling, specifically noting that the defendant's March 24, 2014 motion \"supplemented an earlier, similar motion dated December 18,2012\" and that her motion was \"further supplemented at a hearing held on June 30, 2014.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    We disagree with the plaintiff that the motion for attorney's fees and costs was untimely because it was not filed within thirty days of October 7, 2013, the date that the United States Supreme Court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The court denied the defendant's request for certain attorney's fees that were related to her failure to appear at the initial hearing on her motion for attorney's fees and costs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
