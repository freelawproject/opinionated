Czarnecki (Petitioner) petitions for review from a decision and order of the State Employees' Retirement Board (Board) that excluded pay for on-call service from the amount of compensation in calculating his retirement benefit under the State Employees' Retirement Code, 71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5101 -5957 (Retirement Code). Petitioner challenges the denial of his request for recalculation of his final average salary to include compensation he earned as an \"on call\" staff physician of the Department of Public Welfare\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Department) at the Harrisburg State Hospital, an inpatient mental health facility. He argues the Board's exclusion of on-call services from his benefits calculation violated his due process rights. Concluding the Board erred as a matter of law, we reverse and remand for a recalculation of benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petitioner was a staff physician for the Department at the hospital from 1981 until his retirement in June 2005. During that time, he volunteered to provide on-call service to ensure 24-hour patient care. In that capacity, Petitioner answered patient-care questions on the telephone, and he was required to be within 20 minutes of the hospital at all times to provide in-person treatment as needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A collective bargaining agreement (CBA) governed Petitioner's compensation throughout his employment. The CBA required that each \"on call\" physician provide a telephone number where he could be reached and be available for service within 20 minutes of a call. The CBA provided that physicians who serve in an on-call status \"shall, at the employee's discretion, either be paid 25% of their base hourly rate for such 'on-call' time or receive compensatory time equivalent to 25% of such 'on-call' time ...\" Bd. Op., 6/22/15, at 3 (quoting Article 12, Section 14 of the CBA). When called in to the hospital, a physician received \"emergency duty\" compensation at 100% of his base rate for a minimum of three hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From 1981 until the early 1990s, the Department reported Petitioner's on-call service to SERS. The Department reported on-call time and pay separately from his regularly-scheduled service. Petitioner received retirement credit for the on-call services reported. For unknown reasons, the Department stopped reporting Petitioner's on-call hours to SERS as of January 1, 1993. Nevertheless, SERS continued to receive reports of on-call pay, and accepted pickup contributions and employer contributions from the Department for Petitioner through 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2000, SERS discovered that since 1993, the Department did not provide SERS with Petitioner's on-call hours or information necessary for crediting that service. Accordingly, SERS contacted the Office of Administration (OA) advising that without the requisite information (hours, employer and employee contributions and compensation) the member could not receive retirement credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Also in 2000, SERS advised OA that it would no longer accept \"on-call\" service information based on a new interpretation of the Retirement Code. As a result, the Department stopped reporting Petitioner's on-call service to SERS and stopped making employer contributions for his service. Therefore, from 2000 until Petitioner's retirement in 2005, Petitioner did not earn retirement credit for his on-call service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Petitioner obtained a retirement benefit estimate from SERS around this time, and he learned the on-call service was not included. He retired in 2005. In 2007, Petitioner asked SERS to \"correct the improper calculation\" of his retirement benefits in order to include his on-call service. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 152a. SERS denied the request, explaining: \"Employees on standby overtime are not actually working for the Commonwealth and do not receive\n   <em>\n    regular\n   </em>\n   remuneration for the time spent waiting to be called to work.\" R.R. at 154a, SERS Ex. 4 (emphasis in original). SERS determined an on-call physician who is not at the hospital is not \"actually engaged in work\" for the Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (relying on\n   <em>\n    Hoerner v. Pub.

Petitioner appealed that denial, thereby initiating the formal appeal process before a hearing officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After holding a hearing in July 2010, a hearing officer issued a proposed adjudication (Adjudication) recommending denial of Petitioner's claim. Specifically, she found that 10% of the time he was on call, Petitioner did not need to report to the hospital. Hr'g Officer Adj., 2/1/11, Finding of Fact (F.F.) No. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Petitioner filed exceptions to the Adjudication, to which SERS filed a brief in opposition. SERS did not file exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Four years later, in a split decision, the Board adopted the Adjudication, denying Petitioner's appeal. The Board determined on-call service, which was compensated at 25% of the base rate, did not qualify for compensation. Accordingly, the Board did not include Petitioner's pay for on-call service in the calculation of his final average salary. It explained service, salary and contributions were \"inseparable components\" of retirement benefits. Bd. Op., 6/22/15, at 9. Based on\n   <em>\n    Hoerner,\n   </em>\n   the Board reasoned Petitioner's on-call service did not qualify as \"creditable\" because he was not \"actually engaged in work\" when not at the hospital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Thus, it equated on-call service to standby overtime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Petitioner filed a petition for review of the Board's decision. After briefing and oral argument, the matter is ready for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioner argues SERS erred in construing the definition of compensation under the Retirement Code to exclude the on-call pay he earned as a state employee from the calculation of his retirement-covered compensation. He asserts the compensation he received for on-call services should be credited toward his final average salary used for determining his pension benefit. He also contends SERS' exclusion of on-call service from the benefit calculation after decades of including it, without notice, amounts to an unconstitutional deprivation of his pension rights without due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Retirement-Covered Compensation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The question before us is limited to whether the on-call service Petitioner provided to the Department, which was compensated at 25% of his base rate throughout his employment, should have been included in the final average salary component of SERS' calculation to determine his retirement benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the outset, we recognize the Board is entitled to considerable deference in its construction of the statute and its attendant regulations.\n   <em>\n    Weaver v.

The governing CBA provided for payment to officers on union leave at a higher rate. After a hearing, the Board determined the higher rate of pay, including union stipends, qualified as retirement-covered compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In so determining, the Board examined the definition of \"compensation\" in Section 5102 of the Retirement Code, 71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5102.

The incidence or amount of on-call pay is not dependent on chance. Rather, it is set by the CBA. Petitioner earned on-call pay at 25% of his base rate in direct exchange for hours performing on-call service. Further, on-call pay is not at the Department's discretion. Payments for on-call service were made on a regular basis, as contractually owed. These characteristics favor inclusion of on-call pay as retirement-covered compensation.\n   <em>\n    OA v.

Accordingly, we conclude SERS' exclusion of on-call pay from retirement-covered compensation is clearly erroneous and unsupported by the Retirement Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Hoerner\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In lieu of applying the principles of statutory construction generally employed when discerning whether payments to a state employee qualify as compensation, the Board argues its exclusion of on-call pay from compensation is compelled by our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hoerner.\n   </em>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Hoerner\n   </em>\n   involved the retirement of a public school employee whose salary was increased in termination agreements. The retiree argued the increases qualified as compensation, whereas PSERS excluded them as severance payments. Relevant here, our Supreme Court held the increases were properly excluded from compensation for purposes of calculating final average salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Board's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Hoerner\n   </em>\n   is misplaced for several reasons. First, from a statutory construction standpoint,\n   <em>\n    Hoerner\n   </em>\n   involves interpretation of the Public School Employees Retirement Code (PSERC), 24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8101 -8536. Case law construing PSERC only applies to construction of the Retirement Code when the provisions are the same or similar.\n   <em>\n    OA v. SERB;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v. State Emps. Ret. Sys.,\n   </em>\n   156 Pa.Cmwlth. 83,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1447084\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/156/83/\">\n    626 A.2d 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) (cases construing PSERC may be used when construing sufficiently similar provisions under the Retirement Code).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In the instant case, the definitions of the operative term, \"compensation,\" materially differ.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Section 5102 of the Retirement Code, 71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5102,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Section 8102 of PSERC, 24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8102. The definition of compensation applicable to school employees under PSERC contains more exclusions than Section 5102 of the Retirement Code. PSERC explicitly excludes \"other emolument[s] received by a school employee during his school service\n   <em>\n    which is not based on the standard salary schedule\n   </em>\n   under which he is rendering service....\" 24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8102 (emphasis added). The Retirement Code does not contain such broad exclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, in\n   <em>\n    Hoerner,\n   </em>\n   the former employee argued that increases agreed to as part of termination agreements qualified as retirement-covered compensation. Our Supreme Court reasoned such payments were equivalent to severance payments explicitly excluded from the definition of compensation. In its analysis, the Court considered the nature of the payment and its relationship to the employee's activities. The Court held the increases were severance payments because the purpose of the payment was to resolve disputes and to terminate the employee's service. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Hoerner\n   </em>\n   is consistent with our decisions in\n   <em>\n    Beardsley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    OA v. SERB\n   </em>\n   in that enumerated exclusions from compensation were not included in the final average salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Importantly,\n   <em>\n    Hoerner\n   </em>\n   is both legally and factually distinguishable. The fact that\n   the member in\n   <em>\n    Hoerner\n   </em>\n   was no longer employed, and so was not providing\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   service at the time of his payment triggered the Supreme Court's admonishment that credit for service required the performance of actual work. Consequently,\n   <em>\n    Hoerner\n   </em>\n   implicated different legal definitions and concepts as to the award of time when the member was not working as a state employee at the time for which he sought credited service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The amount of credited service, which is the years of service component of the benefit calculation, is not in dispute here. Because Petitioner was a full-time state employee at the time he provided on-call service, he received credit for all his years of service. The only issue before us is the salary part of the benefit calculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bd. Op. at 10, n. 10; Pet'r's Br. at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The findings the Board adopted did not include a finding that on-call pay constituted a severance payment that lacked any connection to work. Indeed, on-call pay directly corresponds to on-call services performed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On-call pay was certain and paid on a regular basis pursuant to the CBA. The CBA recognized on-call services as work, albeit at a reduced rate of pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Com. v. Pa. State Troopers Ass'n,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203665,4204268\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/611/56/\">\n    611 Pa. 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7282720,4203665,4204268,7282775\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/23/966/\">\n    23 A.3d 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (plurality op.) (CBA may provide for different rate of pay, which results in an increase in the amount of benefits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Nevertheless, the record reflects Petitioner performed \"actual work\" while on-call, but not at the hospital, for 10% of the time he was \"on-call.\" R.R. at 70a-75a. While not at the hospital, Petitioner took calls, directing hospital staff on patient care issues and making medical judgments as to whether he needed to go into the hospital to render in-person patient care (which he did 90% of the time). R.R. at 74a. Although Petitioner was ostensibly free to sleep and perform personal tasks, he was restrained to activities that would allow him to be ready to treat a patient at the hospital within 20 minutes. Essentially, in reversing its position as to inclusion of on-call pay, SERS divorced services performed from compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In sum, SERS' contention that on-call service does not qualify as \"work\" because it does not occur at the worksite or involves idle time engrafts a new limitation on the definition of compensation. The Retirement Code does not require compensation to correspond to actual work performed. Nor does our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hoerner.\n   </em>\n   By adding a \"performance of actual work\" prerequisite in the definition of compensation, the Board erred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Other Considerations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Lastly, we consider whether our interpretation of compensation to include on-call service is consistent with other sections of the Retirement Code. The Board argues the on-call pay provision in the CBA does not govern the meaning of compensation, as that would elevate the CBA above the Retirement Code in determining pension benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Inclusion of on-call pay in the final average salary calculation does not violate Section 5955 of the Retirement Code, 71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5955.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is simply a case in\n   which the CBA affected the amount of pension benefits because it set the rate of pay.\n   <em>\n    Pa. State Troopers Ass'n; OA v. SERB.\n   </em>\n   Affecting the amount of benefits is not the same as defining pension benefits in contravention of the Retirement Code.\n   <em>\n    Weaver.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Regarding SERS' assertion that it merely corrected a prior error as permitted by Section 5954(b) of the Retirement Code, 71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5954(b), we are unpersuaded. SERS offered no explanation as to why its prior interpretation was erroneous, or why it reversed its position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the provision allows adjustment for \"mistake[s] in records,\" not for changes in policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7282720,4203665,4204268,7282775\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/23/966/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
