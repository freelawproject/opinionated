We agree and accordingly reverse the judgment of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following procedural history is relevant to this appeal. On October 15, 2009, Astoria Federal Mortgage Corporation (Astoria) filed a four count complaint against Genesis Limited Partnership (Genesis) and the defendant, seeking, inter alia, foreclosure of two mortgages that Genesis had executed and delivered to Astoria for property located at 89 Minerva Street in Derby (Derby property). In the complaint, Astoria alleged that it was in possession of two notes that were secured by two mortgages on the Derby property: (1) a note dated May 14, 2004, wherein Genesis had promised to pay Astoria $210,000; and (2) a note dated June 20, 2005, wherein Genesis had promised to pay Astoria $165,000. Furthermore, Astoria acknowledged that the defendant maintained an encumbrance of record on the Derby property, which it alleged was subordinate in right to the claimed mortgages, \"by virtue of a [m]echanic's [l]ien in the original principal amount of [$293,800] dated September 8, 2009, and recorded in volume 589 at page 253 of the Derby land records.\" On October 23, 2009, Astoria filed a motion for default against the defendant for its failure to appear, which the court denied on October 27, 2009. On December 10, 2009, Astoria filed a demand for disclosure of defense against the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 21, 2009, the defendant filed its disclosure of defense and its answer and special defense. In its disclosure of defense and as a special defense, the defendant asserted that it held a valid mechanic's lien on the Derby property, which was security for construction work\n   on the Derby property that it had commenced on March 12, 2002, and which it alleged was a claim prior in right to the mortgages claimed by Astoria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 19, 2010, Genesis filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the pendency of Genesis' bankruptcy proceedings, the defendant, on August 13, 2011, assigned its mechanic's lien on the Derby property to Viking Acquisitions, LLC (Viking). On September 30, 2011, this assignment was recorded at volume 633, page 273 of the Derby land records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 12, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court issued an \"Order Regarding Limited Relief from the Automatic Stay,\" which stated the following: \"The court having held a hearing on March 20, 2012, with respect to the motion for relief from stay filed by [the plaintiff] on January 10, 2011 ... and the motion for immediate order of relief from stay for violation of court ordered stipulations filed by [the plaintiff] on February 13, 2012 ... the parties having requested limited relief at the hearing to allow the parties to move forward with proceedings in Connecticut Superior Court as to the extent, validity, and priority of the mechanic's lien ... allegedly held by [the defendant] on [the Derby property]; and the court having determined that cause exists to grant limited relief from stay as requested by the parties, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Ordered that relief from the automatic stay is granted, for cause, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) to allow the parties to move forward with proceedings\n   in Connecticut Superior Court for the limited purpose of determining the extent, validity and priority of the [defendant's mechanic's lien]; and it is hereby further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Ordered that relief from the automatic stay is also granted to allow the parties to proceed in Connecticut state court with any appeals from any decision of the Connecticut Superior Court as to the extent, validity, and priority of [the defendant's mechanic's lien] ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 18, 2012, Astoria moved to substitute the plaintiff in the foreclosure proceeding. The court granted Astoria's motion on May 14, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 20, 2012, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for a determination of priorities and ordered the following: \"The court finds the priorities\n   to be (1)\n   the first mortgage dated May 14, 2004, and (2) the second mortgage dated June 20, 2006. No further determination is made.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 12, 2012, Viking assigned the defendant's mechanic's lien back to the defendant, but this assignment was not recorded in the Derby land records until June 26, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 18, 2014, the bankruptcy court dismissed Genesis' chapter 11 bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 16, 2014, the defendant filed a cross claim against Genesis, in which it sought, inter alia, to foreclose the mechanic's lien that it held on the Derby property. In its cross claim, the defendant alleged that it had \"furnished materials and rendered services to Genesis in the construction, raising, removal or repairs to the property owned by Genesis,\" and that it had \"commenced to furnish materials and render services on or about March 12, 2002, and ceased furnishing materials and rendering services on August 20, 2009.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 17, 2014, the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the defendant's cross claim. In the motion, the plaintiff asserted that the defendant's cross claim should be dismissed because \"[a]t the time the cross claim was filed, [the defendant] was not the holder of the [mechanic's] lien and therefore [did] not have standing to pursue foreclosure.\" In its memorandum of law in support of the motion, which was also filed on June 17, 2014, the plaintiff argued, inter alia, that the defendant did not have standing to foreclose its mechanic's lien on the Derby property because it had failed to record the October 12, 2012 assignment whereby Viking assigned the mechanic's lien back to\n   the defendant. Therefore, the plaintiff argued, the defendant did not have standing because it was not the record holder of the lien on April 16, 2014, which was the date on which it filed its cross claim seeking foreclosure of the lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 15, 2014, the defendant filed its opposition to the plaintiff's motion to dismiss, wherein it argued that it did have standing to bring its cross claim against Genesis because the October 12, 2012 assignment was valid despite the defendant's failure to record the assignment prior to its commencement of the foreclosure action. The defendant also asserted that on June 26, 2014, it had recorded the October 12, 2012 assignment in volume 696, page 51 of the Derby land records. The defendant attached a copy of the recorded assignments to its opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 14, 2014, the court held a hearing on the plaintiff's motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 22, 2015, the court\n   issued a memorandum of decision wherein it granted the plaintiff's motion to dismiss the defendant's cross claim. In its memorandum of decision, the court stated the following: \"On April 16, 2014, the defendant\n   ... filed a cross [claim] against codefendant Genesis ... seeking to foreclose a mechanic's lien, dated September 8, 2009, against Genesis....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Prior thereto, [the defendant] assigned its mechanic's lien to Viking ... on August 13, 2011.

This second assignment was not recorded until 4:01 p.m. on June [26], 2014, at volume 696, page 51, of the Derby land records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[The plaintiff], successor to Astoria ... by virtue of a valid assignment of a note and mortgage, dated September 29, 2010, challenges the standing of [the defendant] to file the present cross claim. It argues that [the defendant] did not own or possess the mechanic's lien as [the defendant] had assigned its mechanic's lien to Viking ... and Viking ... was the owner of record of the mechanic's lien on April 16, 2014....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Reference to General Statutes \u00a7 47-10(a) provides resolution of the issue of standing here. Section 47-10(a) provides in relevant part: 'No conveyance shall be effectual to hold any land against any other person but the grantor and his heirs, unless recorded on the records of the town in which the land lies....' The failure to record renders an assignee without standing to maintain an action against any party except the grantor and his heirs.... This court finds that the assignment of the mechanic's lien, dated October 12, 2012, but not recorded until June 26, 2014, was not effectual against\n   any [party] except Viking ... and that [the defendant] did not have standing to file the April 16, 2014 cross claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The motion of [the plaintiff] to dismiss the April 16, 2014 cross claim is granted.\" (Citation omitted; footnote in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 11, 2015, the defendant filed a motion to reargue with respect to the plaintiff's motion to dismiss. The court denied the defendant's motion on the same date. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We address the defendant's claim that the court erred in granting the plaintiff's motion to dismiss because it improperly concluded that the defendant lacked standing as a result of its failure to record, prior to filing its cross claim, the October 12, 2012 assignment of the mechanic's lien. The defendant makes two arguments with respect to this claim: (1) the court erred by improperly interpreting and applying \u00a7 47-10 to the unrecorded October 12, 2012 assignment of the mechanic's lien; and (2) the court erred by relying on other nonbinding trial court decisions. We reverse the court's judgment on the basis of the defendant's first argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We begin our analysis of this argument by setting forth the appropriate standard of review. \"The standard of review for a court's decision on a motion to dismiss ... is well settled.\" (Internal quotation\n   marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Manning v.

Specifically, the defendant argues that the court erred in this regard because its conclusion did not harmonize the statutory requirements of \u00a7 47-10 with those of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-10,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   49-17,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 49-33.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In opposition, the plaintiff argues that the\n   court's conclusion was proper because \u00a7 47-10 applies to assignments of mechanic's liens, thereby requiring the defendant, as an assignee of such a lien, to record the October 12, 2012 assignment prior to seeking\n   foreclosure of the lien in order to have standing. Because we conclude that noncompliance with the recording requirement of \u00a7 47-10 is not fatal to a party's standing to bring an action to foreclose a mechanic's lien, we therefore conclude that the court in the present case erred in its determination that the defendant lacked standing to bring its cross claim by virtue of its failure to record the October 12, 2012 assignment prior to filing its cross claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[A] party must have standing to assert a claim in order for the court to\n   have subject matter jurisdiction over the claim....

Thus, pursuant to this statute, a valid assignee of a mortgage note has standing to foreclose irrespective of whether that assignee records the assignment prior to instituting the action. Two leading commentators on Connecticut foreclosure actions have refined the principle codified in \u00a7 49-17 :\n   \"Although it should be clear that the assignee of a mortgage\n   <em>\n    deed\n   </em>\n   cannot foreclose without prior compliance with ... \u00a7 49-10 and ... \u00a7 47-10, such is clearly not the situation with the assignee or holder of a mortgage\n   <em>\n    note\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis in original.) 1 D.

Indeed, our Supreme Court has observed that there are \"clear differences\" between mortgages and mechanic's liens: \"A mechanic's lien, unlike a mortgage, is not an agreement or contract between parties but rather a lien upon real estate which the plaintiff seeks to take by force of law and eventually to foreclose.... Unlike a mortgage deed, which may be reformed to reflect the contracting parties' mutual intent, the placement of a mechanic's lien is a unilateral act in which the lienor bears the burden of demonstrating statutory compliance.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    First Constitution Bank v.

The defendant, in its cross claim, asserted that it commenced providing materials and services to the Derby property on March 12, 2002, and that it ceased such provision on August 20, 2009. The defendant also asserted in its cross claim that a principal balance amounting to $293,800 remained due and owing to it for the services and materials provided, that on September 8, 2009, its president caused a certificate of mechanic's lien in writing to be recorded at volume 589, page 253 of the Derby land\n   records, and that on this same date, it also gave written notice to Genesis communicating its intent to claim a mechanic's lien. In support of its cross claim, the defendant attached an April 16, 2014 notice of lis pendens \"claiming a foreclosure\n   of a mechanic's lien from [Genesis] to [the defendant] in the principal amount of [$293,800] plus interest and legal fees, recorded on September 8, 2009 on the Derby [land records] in volume 589, page 253,\" along with the property description that was filed in the same land records. In support of its motion in opposition to the plaintiff's motion to dismiss, the defendant submitted a July 7, 2014 affidavit wherein the defendant's president, Domenic Paniccia, averred, inter alia: that the defendant had filed a mechanic's lien against the Derby property, dated September 8, 2009, at volume 589, page 253 of the Derby land records; that it had assigned the mechanic's lien to Viking on or about August 13, 2011; and that Viking had assigned the mechanic's lien back to the defendant on October 12, 2012. The defendant also filed a certified copy of the August 13, 2011 assignment of the mechanic's lien, which was recorded in the Derby land records on September 30, 2011, as well as a certified copy of the October 12, 2012 assignment of the mechanic's lien, which was recorded in the Derby land records on June 26, 2014.

Counsel for the defendant also represented to the court that the plaintiff was not prejudiced by the defendant's failure to record the October, 2012 assignment of the mechanic's lien, that the defendant was the lien holder, that it had performed the work subject to the lien, and that it was the party which had an interest in its foreclosure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    \"The court declines any comment regarding the legal sufficiency or validity of the assignments of the mechanic's lien herein-such as, for instance, whether the validating act, General Statutes \u00a7 47-36aa, cured any defects-as those are questions for another time.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Because we agree with the defendant's first argument and reverse the court's decision on this ground, we need not address the defendant's other argument.
