On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court abused its discretion by denying his petition for certification to appeal and by rejecting his claims that his\n   trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Having thoroughly reviewed the record, we conclude that the habeas court properly denied the petition for certification to appeal, and, accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as set forth by this court in the petitioner's direct appeal or found by the habeas court, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. \"[O]n December 24, 2005, the [petitioner] met\n   the victim, Jose Morales, in a bar. After conversing with the victim, the [petitioner] accompanied the victim to the victim's apartment in Hartford. Later that evening, after the victim had fallen asleep, the [petitioner] entered the victim's bedroom and stabbed the victim numerous times with a knife, thereby causing his death. The [petitioner] left the victim's apartment with the keys to the victim's automobile as well as the victim's wallet and cellular telephone. The [petitioner] drove away from the scene in the victim's automobile, later renting the automobile to Henry Garcia. The [petitioner] used the victim's cellular telephone and, later, stashed the victim's wallet and house keys in the apartment where he had been living at the time of the crimes. Later, police discovered the murder weapon and the bloodstained clothing worn by the [petitioner] at the time of the murder, both of which contained the victim's genetic material, in the [petitioner's] apartment. By means of statements that the [petitioner] made to the police, he fully implicated himself in the victim's murder. Referring to the victim's death, the [petitioner] stated to the police, 'He got what he deserved. I did what I had to do.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The petitioner alleged that the performance of his trial counsel, Michael J. Isko,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was deficient\n   because he failed to\n   present expert psychiatric evidence at trial to establish a diminished capacity defense, and because he failed to object to the trial court's jury instructions regarding whether the burglary offense, which was the predicate felony for the felony murder offense, could itself be based on an intent to commit assault or an intent to commit larceny. On June 9, 2014, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Fuger, J.,\n   </em>\n   held a trial in which it heard testimony from Isko and Radhika Mehendru, a psychiatrist at the Institute of Living, who had evaluated the petitioner days prior to the commission of the crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After trial, the habeas court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court concluded that Isko's failure to offer expert testimony concerning the diminished capacity defense was not deficient performance and did not prejudice the petitioner. The habeas court further concluded that the petitioner had abandoned his claim that Isko's failure to object to the jury instructions was ineffective assistance, and, even if this claim was not abandoned, the petitioner had failed to establish prejudice. The petitioner filed a petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the habeas court, which the habeas court denied. This appeal followed.

Specifically, the petitioner contends that had expert testimony been offered regarding the mental disorder from which he allegedly suffered at the time of the commission of the crimes, the trial court would have instructed the jury on his diminished capacity defense. The respondent, the Commissioner\n   of Correction, contends that the habeas court properly concluded that Isko's performance was not deficient because his decision not to offer testimony from an expert witness concerning a diminished capacity defense was a reasonable, strategic decision. We agree with the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. During the underlying criminal trial, Isko did not offer testimony from an expert witness concerning the petitioner's mental health at the time of the commission of the crimes. Rather, Isko attempted to establish through lay witnesses that the petitioner had diminished capacity, and, thus, was incapable of forming the requisite intent to commit murder. To effectuate this strategy, Isko cross-examined Sergeant Timothy Shaw of the Hartford Police Department, who testified that the petitioner had claimed to suffer from bipolar disorder. Specifically, the petitioner had told Shaw that he heard voices and that drinking water felt like he was drinking blood. Isko also offered the testimony of Annette Deonarine, a woman with whom the petitioner claimed to be in a romantic relationship. Deonarine testified at trial that not only had she never been in a romantic relationship with the petitioner, but that he was obsessed with her and was delusional, as evidenced by his belief that he was in a romantic relationship with her. After the petitioner rested his case, Isko requested that the jury be instructed on diminished capacity. The court declined to instruct the jury on diminished capacity,\n   concluding that there was no evidence to support such an instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The habeas court determined that the petitioner had alleged that Isko \"was ineffective because he failed to produce expert psychiatric evidence at trial to support a jury instruction of diminished mental\n   capacity in order to support a jury instruction that his diminished mental capacity precluded him from forming the requisite specific intent to commit [murder]. In support of this claim, the petitioner presented [testimony from Mehendru and Isko]....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"According to [Mehendru], she evaluated the petitioner on December 14 and 19, 2005, merely days prior to the offense date of December 24, 2005. The petitioner, at the time she evaluated him, suffered from substance induced mood disorder and antisocial personality disorder. [Mehendru] testified that someone with these disorders nevertheless wilfully decides to break the law. Although the petitioner reported hearing voices, he was able to isolate his inner world from the real world. Similarly, he reported hallucinatory images, but he had no problems dealing with them. The petitioner did not lose touch with reality even though he had a psychotic symptom. The psychosis experienced by the petitioner was not a primary feature or diagnosis. [Mehendru] further noted that although the petitioner had difficulties with impulsivity, she found his impulse control to be adequate. The petitioner had made a suicide attempt before and had suicidal ideations ; however, he never mentioned homicidal ideations. [Mehendru] also noted that there were many inconsistencies in what the petitioner self-reported and that she suspected that he was malingering. On cross-examination, [Mehendru] described the petitioner as manipulative and demanding, and as someone who would push the limits of what he could get away with. The petitioner, according to [Mehendru], knew right from wrong and chose to break the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The only other witness to present testimony about asserting a diminished mental capacity defense was [Isko]. According to [Isko], the defense team evaluated whether a defense of mental disease or defect was a viable defense. To that end, the defense team consulted\n   with an expert at Yale University, but that expert concluded that the petitioner's psychosis was drug induced and, therefore, not a viable basis for a defense of mental disease or defect [pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 (b) ].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, a personality disorder also would not support such a defense.... Isko further testified that the defense team, which had the petitioner's records from the Institute of Living, looked at whether there was a diminished mental capacity to form intent. The petitioner's behavior was drug driven, and his use of drugs precluded diminished mental capacity from being a viable defense.\" (Footnotes altered.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the basis of this testimony, the habeas court concluded that \"the petitioner here has failed to present any evidence\n   that diminished mental capacity was a viable and meritorious defense. Counsel investigated and considered both mental disease and diminished mental capacity defenses. These defenses, however, were unsupported. The court concludes that the petitioner has failed to prove that trial counsel rendered deficient performance. Additionally, none of the evidence presented in the habeas proceeding in any way undermines this court's confidence in the outcome of the jury trial, which is necessary to prove the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prejudice prong.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With this factual and procedural history in mind, we turn to the legal principles that guide our analysis. \"In\n   any case presenting an ineffectiveness claim, the performance inquiry must be whether counsel's assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.... Judicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential and courts must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Veal v.

He consulted with an expert at Yale University, read the petitioner's medical records from the Institute of Living, and spoke to lay witnesses concerning the petitioner's mental health. After this thorough investigation, Isko made a strategic decision not to call an expert witness at trial. The testimony of Mehendru establishes that this strategic decision was reasonable because, even if an expert had testified, such testimony likely would have established that the petitioner's mental health issues were caused by voluntary intoxication, and, thus, could not be a basis for establishing diminished capacity. Additionally, expert testimony, if offered, likely would have tended to show that near the time of the commission of the crime, the petitioner had adequate impulse control and wilfully decided to break the law, and, thus, was capable of forming the requisite intent to commit murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In sum, Isko conducted a thorough investigation into the petitioner's mental health and, on the basis of that investigation, made the reasonable, strategic decision not to call an expert witness at the underlying criminal trial. Accordingly, the habeas court did not abuse its discretion by denying the petition for certification to appeal because it is not debatable amongst jurists of reason whether it was deficient performance for Isko to make the reasonable, strategic decision to not offer expert testimony regarding diminished capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The petitioner next claims that the habeas court abused its discretion by denying his petition for certification to appeal because (1) he did not abandon his claim that Isko provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to the jury instruction on felony murder, and (2) it is debatable amongst jurists of reason whether he was prejudiced by Isko's failure to object to the jury instructions and the state's closing argument regarding the intent element of felony murder, and by his failure to poll the jury regarding the intent element of felony murder. Specifically, the petitioner contends that, on the basis of a prior ruling at a probable cause hearing, the jury should have been instructed that it could find him guilty of felony murder only if it determined that he had committed the\n   murder in the course of a burglary with the intent to commit larceny in the sixth degree, and that it could not rely upon the alleged assault as a predicate for the felony murder charge. Thus, according to the petitioner, Isko's performance was deficient, and he was prejudiced by Isko's actions because, had the court properly instructed the jury, the jury would have acquitted him of the felony murder charge on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that he had the intent to commit a larceny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The respondent argues that the petitioner abandoned this claim at the habeas trial because he offered no evidence regarding this claim. Alternatively, the respondent contends that the petitioner failed to establish that he was prejudiced by Isko's failure to object to the jury instruction and the state's closing argument regarding felony murder because it is unclear from the record whether the jury found the petitioner guilty of felony murder based upon a subordinate conclusion that he had committed a burglary with the underlying intent to commit an assault, or the underlying intent to commit a larceny. Additionally, the respondent argues, in\n   response to the petitioner's claim that he was prejudiced, that there was sufficient evidence for the jury reasonably to find that the petitioner had the intent to commit larceny in the sixth degree. Although we agree with the petitioner that he did not abandon this claim, we decline to review his argument that he was prejudiced by Isko's actions because his argument on appeal was not raised before the habeas court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following additional facts, as found by the habeas court, are relevant to this claim. \"[T]he court,\n   <em>\n    Sheldon, J.,\n   </em>\n   held a probable cause hearing during which time the state requested a finding of probable cause for the crimes of murder and felony murder.

The court referred to the fact that it had held charge conferences with counsel that were not on the record. The court referred to several topics that it had discussed with counsel during those conferences, stating in relevant part: I asked the state particularly ... what crimes it claimed were the underlying crimes of burglary, which is an issue in both the burglary [in the first degree] count and the felony murder count.... [The] state indicated at that time that [it was] requesting larceny [in the] sixth [degree]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   and assault [in the] third [degree] as the specific crimes intended by the defendant for [the] claim underlying the concept of burglary.

After referring to these various matters discussed at the charge conference, the court asked, [d]oes anybody have any ... summation, disagreements, additions, subtractions from my summary of the charge conference? At that time, [Isko] objected to the\n   court's refusal to deliver an instruction regarding diminished capacity, but did not raise any other concerns or objections to the matters specifically discussed by the court, including the state's requested instruction. After a recess, the court asked counsel if they were ready to proceed, and, following an affirmative reply by defense counsel, it proceeded to closing arguments....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[T]he prosecutor argued to the jury that, for purposes of the felony murder count, the [petitioner] could be found to have committed burglary if he unlawfully remained in the victim's residence while intending to assault the victim or intending to steal from the victim.

As to the sufficiency of the evidence claim, on direct appeal we did not reach the merits of the claim, but rather held that even if there was insufficient evidence to find that the petitioner had the requisite intent to commit larceny in the sixth degree as the predicate intent to burglary in the first degree, there was an alternative ground-intent to commit assault in the third degree-upon which the jury could\n   have found that the petitioner committed burglary in the first degree as a predicate for felony murder.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20A.3d%209\">\n    Id., at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20A.3d%209\">\n    20 A.3d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Subsequently, in his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus and his pretrial memorandum of law, the petitioner \"allege[d] that counsel was deficient for failing to object at the charge conference to the proposed felony murder instructions, as well as failing to object to the state's closing arguments. The petitioner also allege[d] that counsel was deficient for failing to ask the court to inquire of the jury as to whether [it] found the predicate burglary to be based on the intent to commit an assault, or whether the burglary was based on the intent to commit a larceny. If the jury found it to be based on an assault, counsel would further be deficient for failing to move for a directed verdict of\n   not guilty on the charge of felony murder, since there was no probable cause to charge the petitioner with felony murder based on a predicate crime of burglary with the intent to commit an assault in the burgled premises.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Because of this belief, Isko did not request that the court poll the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After Isko's testimony, the petitioner rested, and the respondent offered no additional witnesses. In closing argument, the petitioner rested on his pretrial brief. The respondent argued in regard to this claim that the petitioner was not prejudiced by Isko's failure to object to the jury charge and the state's closing argument concerning felony murder because \"it's ... obvious that according to [Isko] and ... the transcript, that the felony murder was based on the items taken from the home after the murder [i.e., intent to commit a larceny].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the habeas court deemed this claim abandoned: \"At the habeas trial, the petitioner did not present any evidence in support of these allegations. [Although Isko testified that he did not object to the jury instruction on this issue, Isko was never questioned regarding his reason for not objecting, and, thus, no evidence was offered from which the court could infer whether Isko's failure to object was\n   a reasonable, strategic decision.] The court, therefore, deems them to have been abandoned.... However, even [if] this court were to not consider these claims to have been abandoned and that trial counsel were presumed to have rendered deficient performance as alleged, the petitioner's claims would fail on the prejudice prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"Judge Sheldon found probable cause [to believe] that the petitioner committed murder on the theory of felony murder, in that he committed a burglary by entering with the intent to commit a crime of larceny by theft of items [i.e., the keys to the victim's car and the car itself] belonging to [the victim].... The jury was informed of the charges at the onset of trial. The third count charged the petitioner with burglary in the first degree for [being] armed with a dangerous instrument, to wit, a knife, remained unlawfully in [the victim's] building with the intent to commit a crime therein.... The fourth count charged the petitioner with larceny in the third degree for having the intent to deprive\n   [the victim] of property, a 1993 Mitsubishi automobile ...

With respect to Isko's failure to object to the jury\n   instruction on felony murder, the petitioner argued both deficient performance and prejudice in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus and in his pretrial memorandum of law, which he relied on in lieu of making a closing argument. Additionally, the petitioner questioned Isko regarding whether he objected to the jury instruction on felony murder, and why he did not seek to poll the jury. The petitioner, however, did not question Isko as to why he did not object to the jury instruction on felony murder. For the purposes of this appeal, we assume that the petitioner did not abandon this claim, without deciding whether, as the habeas court concluded, a party abandons a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a case if trial counsel is not questioned at the habeas trial concerning\n   the reasons behind his or her strategic decisions. Rather than treating this claim as abandoned, we conclude that it is appropriate to address it because the habeas court reached the merits of the claim, and both parties fully have briefed it on appeal. Accordingly, there is no prejudice or surprise to either the habeas court or the parties by this court in addressing the merits of the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Next, we turn to the habeas court's alternative ground for concluding that the petitioner had not established ineffective assistance of counsel concerning Isko's failure to object to the jury instruction on felony murder. The habeas court found, in the alternative, that the petitioner failed to establish that he was prejudiced by Isko's failure (1) to object to the jury instruction and the state's closing argument regarding felony murder predicated on an intent to commit an assault, or (2) to request that the jury be polled. According to the habeas court, the petitioner was not prejudiced by Isko's actions because it concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the petitioner's felony murder conviction because he had committed a burglary with the underlying intent to commit a larceny. On appeal, the\n   petitioner argues that the habeas court abused its discretion by denying his petition for certification to appeal because it is debatable amongst jurists of reason that he was prejudiced by Isko's actions. Specifically, he contends that he was prejudiced because if the jury had been instructed that the felony murder charge could be predicated only upon the intent to commit larceny, it would have acquitted him of the felony murder charge. He would have been acquitted of this charge, according to the petitioner, because there was insufficient evidence to establish that he had the intent to commit a larceny at the time he stabbed the victim. The petitioner, however, argued in the habeas court only that if the jury had found him guilty of felony murder on the ground that he killed the victim in the course of committing a burglary with the intent to commit an assault, he was entitled to an acquittal of the charge of felony murder. Because the argument that the petitioner asserts on appeal was never made to the habeas court, it is unpreserved, and we decline to review it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"Our law is well settled that a party may not try its case on one theory and appeal on another.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Janusauskas v.

The petitioner made no argument regarding whether he would be entitled to an acquittal on the charge of felony murder if the jury had found him guilty of felony murder on the ground that he killed the victim in the course of committing a burglary with the underlying intent to commit a larceny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Because the petitioner did not make this argument to the habeas court, the habeas court made no determination as to whether there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that he killed the victim in the course of committing a burglary with the intent to commit a larceny. The habeas court never was placed on notice that a sufficiency of the evidence argument existed. Accordingly, because this argument was never raised in the habeas court, we conclude that it is unpreserved and decline to review it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The habeas court noted that \"the amended petition [for a writ of habeas corpus] allege[d] ineffective assistance only by ...

Lorenzen nevertheless was cocounsel and conducted cross-examination of some witnesses. Because no allegations are directed at Lorenzen, who did not testify at the habeas trial, the court limits its discussion of any purported deficiencies to ... Isko. Nevertheless, because the petitioner's legal claim is ineffective assistance by trial counsel, the court explicitly finds that the petitioner has waived any claims against ... Lorenzen by not raising them in the present matter.\" The petitioner does not challenge this aspect of the habeas court's decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 provides in relevant part: \"(a) In any prosecution for an offense, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant, at the time he committed the proscribed act or acts, lacked substantial capacity, as a result of mental disease or defect, either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to control his conduct within the requirements of the law.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    \"(b) It shall not be a defense under this section if such mental disease or defect was proximately caused by the voluntary ingestion, inhalation or injection of intoxicating liquor or any drug or substance, or any combination thereof, unless such drug was prescribed for the defendant by a prescribing practitioner, as defined in subdivision (22) of section 20-571, and was used in accordance with the directions of such prescription....\"\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in relevant part: \"(a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Prior to oral argument before this court, we requested the parties to be prepared to address the issue of mootness regarding this claim. Specifically, we inquired as to whether the petitioner's attack on his conviction of felony murder would be moot if he is unsuccessful in this appeal in obtaining relief regarding his conviction of murder because, even if he is successful in his attack on his conviction of felony murder, he still would be obligated to serve a fifty-five year sentence on the basis of his murder conviction alone.

Subsequent to the petitioner's sentencing in the underlying criminal trial, our Supreme Court held that \"when a defendant has been convicted of greater and lesser included offenses, the trial court must vacate the conviction for the lesser offense rather than merging the convictions....\"\n    <em>\n     State v. Polanco,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20242\">\n     308 Conn. 242\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 245,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20A.3d%201084\">\n     61 A.3d 1084\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2013). Prior to\n    <em>\n     Polanco,\n    </em>\n    our Supreme Court had adopted the merger of convictions approach, in which the sentences for the greater and lesser included offenses were merged but both convictions remained on a defendant's criminal record. Id., at 252,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20A.3d%201084\">\n     61 A.3d 1084\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In\n    <em>\n     Polanco,\n    </em>\n    our Supreme Court held that the lesser included offense should be vacated, not merged, and, thus, the lesser included offense would not remain on a defendant's criminal record.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20A.3d%201084\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    Accordingly, if the petitioner had been sentenced after our Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Polanco,\n    </em>\n    his felony murder conviction would have been vacated, not merged.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Here, the petitioner's sentences for his murder and felony murder convictions were merged. Thus, the petitioner's criminal record reflects both convictions, and there is practical relief that this court can afford the petitioner should he prevail on his second claim-namely, he would be entitled to have the felony murder conviction expunged from his criminal record. Accordingly, this claim is not moot. See\n    <em>\n     State v.
