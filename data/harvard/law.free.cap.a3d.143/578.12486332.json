On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court improperly failed to consider aspects of the doctrine of finality of judgments on the basis of its conclusion that it was \"entirely obvious\" that, under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (a) and General Statutes (Supp.2016) \u00a7 46b-86 (a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Resha\n   lacked subject matter jurisdiction to modify the pension division in the prior judgment of dissolution. We conclude that: (1) given a conflict in the case law on point and the Superior Court's plenary jurisdiction over family relations matters, the Appellate Court improperly determined that it was \"entirely obvious\" that Judge Resha lacked subject matter jurisdiction to modify the property distribution in the judgment of dissolution; and (2) considerations of finality of judgments, as set forth in \u00a7 12 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments, do not support permitting the defendant to mount a collateral attack on the modified judgment. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Appellate Court's opinion aptly sets forth the following relevant facts, as found by the trial court, and procedural history. \"After a fourteen year marriage, the parties were divorced in an uncontested proceeding on December 19, 2001. Both parties were represented by counsel....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"A separation agreement was prepared and executed which, among other things, provided that the plaintiff's [B]orough of Naugatuck police pension be divided\n   equally via a Qualified Domestic Relations Order....\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   [That order] was prepared by the defendant's counsel, who received information about the pension from the plaintiff's counsel.... A further provision in the agreement called for the plaintiff to pay periodic alimony of $130 per week, subject to termination at the end of five years, or earlier upon the [defendant's]\n   cohabitation or the death of either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Approximately two years after the divorce, the defendant began cohabit[ing] with Tom Spivak, now her husband. Upon becoming aware of the situation, the plaintiff informed the defendant that she was in violation of their divorce agreement and that he would be seeking to terminate the alimony. After some discussion, the defendant informed the plaintiff that she desired to finish her education leading to a teaching degree, higher income and [her own] pension but would need the alimony payments in order to do so. The defendant proposed to waive her right to her share of the plaintiff's pension in exchange for a continuation of the alimony for three years despite her admitted cohabitation. The plaintiff agreed to the proposal and continued to pay the alimony....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"After the conclusion of the five year alimony period established by the terms of the separation agreement, the plaintiff filed a motion to modify judgment in accordance with [the] stipulation ... to have the full pension returned to him. By agreement, his counsel prepared the motion and the accompanying stipulation, which was signed by both parties and submitted to the court for approval. Both parties appeared in court before Judge ... Resha on January 2, 2007, the plaintiff with counsel and the defendant appear[ing] as a self-represented litigant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"During the hearing, Judge Resha canvassed the defendant, asking if she had reviewed the terms and conditions of the stipulation with a family relations officer, to which she replied in the affirmative. The terms of the stipulation were then read into the record. The judge then asked her why she was entering into this agreement, which waived her right to receive any portion of the plaintiff's pension. To her credit, the defendant truthfully replied that it was her idea, pursuant to an agreement entered into three years earlier that provided that the plaintiff would not cease alimony payments and she would relinquish her portion of his pension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Judge Resha further asked the defendant if she understood that once she relinquishe[d] any right to the pension it [would] not be able to be addressed by the court in the future-that [the pension] would be [the plaintiff's] from that point on. She once again answered in the affirmative. The judge then asked if [the defendant] was comfortable entering into the agreement without the benefit of an attorney. Again she answered in the affirmative. The court then made a finding that the stipulation was warranted, accepted it and made it a final order of the court. No appeal was ever taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Four years after the entry of the order, [on] March 31, 2011, the defendant filed her [first] motion to open and vacate [the] judgment.... In that motion, the defendant allege[d] that the modification [in 2007] was secured by fraud on the part of the plaintiff. On November 2, 2011, the defendant filed a [second] motion to vacate the January 2, 2007 order ... this time claiming that [Judge Resha] lacked jurisdiction to enter such an order. On November 9, 2011, the defendant filed a motion for counsel fees postjudgment.... The matter was heard by the [trial court] on January 14, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Both parties were represented by competent counsel....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"On February 25, 2014, the [trial] court issued a memorandum of decision denying all three of the defendant's motions.\" (Footnote in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Sousa v.

With respect to the second motion to vacate, which is at issue in this certified appeal, the trial court \"rejected [the defendant's] argument that, in 2007, [Judge Resha]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   lacked subject matter jurisdiction to modify the order in the judgment of dissolution dividing the plaintiff's pension benefits equally between the parties. The court quoted General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a, which provides in relevant part that 'a civil judgment or decree rendered in the Superior Court may not be opened or set aside unless a motion to open or set aside is filed within four months following the date on which it was rendered or passed.' Section 52-212a further provides in relevant part that '[t]he parties may waive the provisions of this section or otherwise submit to the jurisdiction of the court....' Guided by that language, the court determined that, although [Judge Resha's] order modifying the judgment of dissolution was entered well over four months after the court rendered the judgment of dissolution, the parties had acquiesced to the court's jurisdiction by submitting a stipulation requesting a modification. Furthermore, the court noted that Judge Resha had canvassed the defendant as to the stipulation, that the defendant had stated her intention to relinquish her claim to the plaintiff's pension benefits, that the defendant had broached the idea of modifying the judgment of dissolution in this way, and that the defendant was comfortable entering into the postdissolution agreement without legal representation. For the foregoing reasons, the court concluded that both parties had waived the four month requirement set forth in \u00a7 52-212a and submitted to the jurisdiction of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a result, the court denied the defendant's second motion to vacate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Footnote omitted.)

Here, [the] pension benefits are considered to be property distributable under \u00a7 46b-81 (a) ...

To the contrary, the trial court found that, when Judge Resha canvassed the defendant before modifying the judgment, the defendant acknowledged in open court that she had consulted with the family relations office and that it was her idea to modify the judgment of dissolution in exchange for the plaintiff's forbearance on moving to terminate the alimony payments in light of her cohabitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Further, the defendant's personal lack of legal knowledge does not equate to a lack of opportunity to litigate jurisdiction that would sustain the extraordinary measure of a collateral attack, despite the fact that she was a self-represented party.

Approximately six years later, in 2007, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Resha, J.,\n   </em>\n   adopted as a final order of the court a stipulated agreement between the parties, pursuant to which the plaintiff would be entitled to his full pension.

The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Lloyd Cutsumpas,\n   </em>\n   judge trial referee, denied the defendant's motion. On appeal, the Appellate Court held that \"it is entirely obvious that \u00a7 46b-86 (a) unequivocally deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction to enter postdissolution orders modifying property distribution provisions in a judgment of dissolution.\"\n   <em>\n    Sousa v.

In the present case, however, the plaintiff has not cited either of the Appellate Court decisions holding that \u00a7 46b-86 (a) does not implicate the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction. Although the plaintiff does state in a conclusory manner that \"[e]xpanding the concept of subject matter jurisdiction to include every statutory limitation on a court's authority to act would be to undermine significantly the doctrine of res judicata, and to eliminate the certainty and finality in the law and in litigation which the doctrine is designed to protect\";\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   internal quotation marks omitted) quoting\n   <em>\n    Vogel v. Vogel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"706575\" index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/178/358/#p362\">\n    178 Conn. 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 363,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=422%20A.2d%20271\">\n    422 A.2d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979) ; it is clear that the plaintiff's arguments are premised on the belief that \u00a7 46b-86 (a) deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction. If the plaintiff believed that \u00a7 46b-86 (a) merely limited the trial court's statutory authority, there would have been no need for him to rely on the\n   <em>\n    Katsetos\n   </em>\n   factors for determining whether a judgment is subject to collateral attack, because, in the absence of fraud in obtaining the judgment, a claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction is the minimal prerequisite for such an attack. Indeed, the plaintiff expressly stated in his reply brief to this court that \"[t]he proper question before the Appellate Court [and, by extension, this court] was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   whether every statutory limitation on a court's authority to act denies that court subject matter jurisdiction.\" (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, I believe that this court should limit itself to answering the question that the plaintiff raised instead of basing its decision on an issue that the plaintiff did not raise, namely, whether \u00a7 46b-86 (a) limits the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction or, instead, its statutory authority. At the very least, the majority should have afforded the parties an opportunity to brief that issue.\n   <em>\n    Blumberg Associates Worldwide, Inc. v.

I do not see how the legislature could have made it any clearer that its intent was to deprive the trial courts of jurisdiction to modify property assignments after a judgment of marital dissolution is final. Where the trial court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction is entirely obvious, the court's judgment is subject to collateral attack on that ground alone, notwithstanding the doctrine disfavoring collateral attacks on final judgments as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Katsetos.\n   </em>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Broaca v.

Accordingly, I would conclude that Judge Cutsumpas improperly denied the defendant's motion to vacate Judge Resha's order modifying the original property distribution, and I would affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court reversing the judgment of Judge Cutsumpas and remanding the case to the trial court with direction to grant the motion to vacate.
