He claims that the court improperly concluded that he had not demonstrated that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance with respect to (1) his\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   plea and (2) his counsel's alleged conflict of interest. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The relevant facts are as follows. \"In 2005, the [petitioner] was convicted of sale of narcotics in violation of\n   General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a), and sentenced to twelve years incarceration, execution suspended, with five years probation. As a condition of the [petitioner's] probation, he was not to violate the criminal laws of the state. In 2007, the [petitioner] was convicted of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21(a)(1) and burglary in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103. He was sentenced to a total effective term of ten years incarceration, execution suspended, and five years probation. The [petitioner] also was found in violation of his probation imposed in 2005, as a result of those offenses.\n   His probation was not revoked, but, rather, it was to run concurrently with the probationary term imposed for the conviction. The conditions of his probation included, inter alia, no contact with the victim, Damaris Sanchez, and a 'zero tolerance' provision for any violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"In the early morning hours on November 14, 2008, Sanchez, the [petitioner's] former wife with whom he had an 'on and off' relationship, was asleep in her home when she awoke to the smell of gasoline fumes. When she looked outside the house, she saw a shadowy human figure walk near the front of her house. When she saw the person's face, she recognized the person as the [petitioner]. She saw the [petitioner] light a lighter near the hood of her car, and she yelled to him, 'what are you doing to my car.' The [petitioner] ran away. Once outside, Sanchez noticed that the [petitioner] had vandalized her house and car with obscene words and phrases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"On April 13, 2009, the court found that the [petitioner] violated his probation by committing criminal mischief and violating the no contact order.

In the first count of his amended petition, the petitioner alleged that Gerace had simultaneously represented him and Sanchez in 2005, thereby giving rise to a conflict of interest.

The petitioner is a convicted felon with a history of domestic violence. At the time that he entered his\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea, the petitioner had known Gerace for almost twenty years. The petitioner was approximately sixteen years old when he first retained Gerace as his criminal defense counsel; he was thirty-four years old at the time of his\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea to attempt to commit arson in the second degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 2005, Sanchez was arrested following a domestic altercation involving \"one of [the petitioner's] mistresses.\" At that time, Sanchez was married to the petitioner, who was represented by Gerace in a pending criminal matter. Sanchez testified that she had \"found out about\" Gerace from the petitioner and that she never paid Gerace any money. She never met with Gerace alone and never provided him any personal information, such as medical records. Sanchez explained that she never met with Gerace outside of a courthouse, but rather had met with him \"inside court when he was dealing with my case only.\" She also \"never spoke\" with Gerace about the petitioner's cases. Sanchez testified that her domestic case ultimately was nolled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In 2006, the petitioner was arrested following a domestic altercation involving Sanchez and her son. Gerace, who represented the petitioner in that criminal matter, did not ask Sanchez to waive any attorney-client privilege. At his habeas trial, the petitioner conceded that he did not raise any conflict of interest claim at that time. The petitioner further acknowledged that Gerace \"got [him] a pretty good deal on that case, all suspended time....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In 2008, the petitioner was arrested in the arson case involving Sanchez that gave rise to his\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea. Gerace once again represented the petitioner and did not ask Sanchez to waive any attorney-client privilege at\n   that time. Sanchez subsequently testified at the petitioner's violation of probation hearing. As the habeas court found in its memorandum of decision, \"Sanchez testified reluctantly for the state. She acknowledged on direct examination a desire to help the petitioner in that legal predicament. She undercut her own earlier identification of the petitioner as the arsonist to the police by attributing that identification to 'bad nerves,' poor eyesight, and a weak memory. Her uncertainty on the stand at the [violation of probation] hearing reached such a level that the prosecution was able to admit her previous statement to the police under\n   <em>\n    State v.

Gerace capably elicited that Sanchez only 'imagined' the odor of gasoline inside her home on the night of the incident, that she was 'delusional' that night, that her vision was bad, and that her powers of observation were clouded by the ingestion of Vicodin for back pain.... Gerace also proffered evidence through [Sanchez] that her brother and her boyfriend also were present during the activities in question, and available to testify, even though the prosecutor failed to call them as witnesses for the state. This latter testimony by Sanchez was inconsistent with her police statement.\" As a result, the trial court in that proceeding \"characterized ... Sanchez' testimony as evasive, noncommittal, and contradictory to her previous statement to the police. In arriving at a decision that the petitioner committed the crimes in violation of his probation, [the trial court] relied on the\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   statement rather than ... Sanchez' testimony.\" Those findings all are supported by the record before us.\n   On appeal, the petitioner maintains that Gerace was burdened by an actual conflict of interest stemming from his representation of Sanchez in 2005. He claims that said representation adversely affected Gerace's performance at the violation of probation hearing. Specifically, he alleges that Gerace refrained from cross-examining Sanchez about certain mental health issues due to the existence of an attorney-client privilege between them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The fallacy in that claim is the presumption that Sanchez communicated privileged information to Gerace. The petitioner did not call Gerace as a witness at his habeas trial. Moreover, Sanchez testified at the habeas trial that she had never met with Gerace alone and had never disclosed any personal information to him, including mental health matters. Indeed, during closing arguments before the habeas court, the petitioner's counsel acknowledged that \"we don't know what communications ... Gerace had with ... Sanchez....\" The petitioner further did not introduce into evidence as exhibits any documentary materials at his habeas trial. Put simply, the record of that trial contains no evidence to support a finding that Sanchez communicated privileged information to Gerace regarding her mental health. The court found-and we agree-that the petitioner asked it to \"\n   <em>\n    assume\n   </em>\n   that ... Sanchez revealed to ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Gerace confidential details or documents concerning her mental state which would have been useful to his defense....\" (Emphasis in original.) Yet the court specifically found that \"[n]o credible evidence was adduced at the habeas hearing to persuade the court that [information about Sanchez' mental health] was conveyed to Gerace by ... Sanchez or withheld from use by him in the petitioner's defense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As this court has observed, \"[a]n actual conflict of interest is more than a theoretical conflict. The United States Supreme Court has cautioned that the possibility\n   of conflict is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction.... A conflict is merely a potential conflict of interest if the interests of the defendant may place the attorney under inconsistent duties at some time in the future.... To demonstrate an actual conflict of interest, the petitioner must be able to point to specific instances in the record which suggest impairment or compromise of his interests for the benefit of another party.... A mere theoretical division of loyalties is not enough.... If a petitioner fails to meet that standard, for example, where only a potential conflict of interest has been established, prejudice will not be presumed, and the familiar\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prongs will apply.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Because the record before us substantiates nothing more than a theoretical conflict, the petitioner cannot establish an actual conflict on the part of Gerace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We therefore must consider the adequacy of the assistance rendered by Gerace under the familiar parameters of\n   <em>\n    Strickland.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20A.3d%20325\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   We conclude that the petitioner's conflict of interest claim cannot satisfy either of its prongs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With respect to Gerace's performance as the petitioner's counsel, we note that the petitioner did not call Gerace as a witness at his habeas trial. He further did not offer any expert testimony to opine on the nature and quality of Gerace's performance. In addition, the April 7, 2009 transcript of the petitioner's violation of probation proceeding substantiates the habeas court's findings that Gerace (1) thoroughly and effectively cross-examined Sanchez and (2) produced the testimony of an alibi witness who refuted the contents of Sanchez' statement to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Judicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential. It is all too tempting for a defendant\n   to second-guess counsel's assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel's defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.... A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Bryant v.

In that testimony, Sanchez recanted her identification of the petitioner as the perpetrator of the offenses committed outside her home in the early morning hours of November 14, 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On cross-examination,\n   Gerace also elicited testimony from Sanchez indicating that, at the time of that incident, she was under the influence of Vicodin, which causes confusion for her. Given that favorable testimony and mindful of the presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance, we cannot say that Gerace's decision not to impeach Sanchez' testimony by raising the issue of her mental health was anything but sound trial strategy. The petitioner, therefore, cannot demonstrate deficient performance on the part of Gerace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The record further undermines any claim of prejudice resulting from Gerace's alleged failure to impeach Sanchez' testimony by raising the issue of her mental health. In revoking the petitioner's probation, the trial court did not credit Sanchez' testimony, but rather relied on her\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   statement to the police made on the date of the incident. Moreover, the record before us lacks any credible testimonial or documentary evidence on which the trier of fact could conclude that, had Gerace conducted additional investigation or cross-examination into Sanchez' alleged mental health issues, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different. We therefore conclude that the habeas court properly denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    \"Under\n    <em>\n     North Carolina v.
