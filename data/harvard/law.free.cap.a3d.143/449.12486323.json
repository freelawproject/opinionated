There is a specific statutory provision which deals with this issue, Section 306(f.1)(10) of the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act\n   (Act).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The question here is to what extent an outside database can be used to reprice (reduce) reimbursement for trauma care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In particular, Allegheny General Hospital (Provider) petitions for review of an order of Medical Fee Hearing Officer Colleen Pickens (Hearing Officer) that determined the State Workers' Insurance Fund (Insurer) appropriately reimbursed Provider at a repriced level for trauma care rendered to William Galena (Claimant) from October 8 through October 16, 2014. Provider asserts Hearing Officer erred in overruling a relevance objection to testimony from Insurer's repricing manager, Linda A. Lengle (Repricing Manager) regarding use of a database to determine the \"usual and customary charge\" for trauma care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Based on our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Geisinger Health System and Geisinger Clinic v.

I find that her acknowledgment of these issues is correct and that her testimony related to these matters is credible. However,\n   <em>\n    I find that the dispute in the instant matter is not over the Section of the [MCC] Regulations to which this Statement of Purpose applies, but rather whether Provider is due reimbursement for acute care rendered to Claimant at 100% of Provider's actual charge or at 100% of the usual and customary charge.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   F.F. No. 10c. In explaining her position, Hearing Officer continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   d. Section 127.3 of the [MCC] Regulations sets forth the definition of 'actual charge' and the definition of 'usual customary charge.' The 'actual charge' is defined as 'the provider's usual and customary charge for a specific treatment, accommodation, product or service.'\n   <em>\n    In contrast, the 'usual and customary charge' is defined as the 'the charge most often made by providers of similar training, experience and licensure for a specific treatment, accommodation, product or service in the geographic area where the treatment, accommodation, product or service is provided.' I therefore find as fact that payment to Provider shall be based upon 100% of the usual and customary charge rather than 100% of Provider's actual charge.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   e. Because Provider is due reimbursement at 100% of the usual and customary charge, it stands to reason that a reliable source is needed to determine what the usual and customary charge shall be.\n   <em>\n    Through the [Statement of Purpose], the [Bureau's] Medical Fee Review Section has established that 'the department will utilize the 85th percentile of the MDR [medical data retrieval] database published by FAIR Health to determine the 'usual and customary charge' as defined in 34 Pa.Code \u00a7 127.3. Based upon the Medical Fee Review Section's utilization of the 85th percentile of the MDR database published by FAIR Health, I find as a fact that this database is a reliable and accurate source that shall be used to determine reimbursement rates at the usual and customary charge.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   f.\n   <em>\n    Based upon [Repricing Manager's] credible testimony that the MDR database published by FAIR Health was indeed used in the instant matter to determine the amount of payment due to Provider, I specifically find as a fact that Insurer properly reimbursed Provider in the amount of $88,106.32 for the treatment rendered to Claimant from October 8, 2014 through October 16, 2014.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   F.F. Nos. 10d, e, f.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In her Conclusions of Law, Hearing Officer noted Provider's position that the Act and MCC regulations \"warrant payment of 100% of the provider's usual and customary charge, and not payment of a usual and customary charge 'determined through the application of any formula that takes into account what other providers may charge.' \" Conclusion of Law (C.L.) No. 7. In dismissing Provider's argument, and allowing use of a database to reprice costs for trauma care, Hearing Officer reasoned (with emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Although Provider is correct that Section 127.128(c) of the [MCC] Regulations references 'the provider's usual and customary charge\",\n   <em>\n    Section 127.128(a) and (b) of the [MCC] Regulations and Section 306(f.1)(10) of the Act clearly indicate that services rendered in a trauma center shall be paid at the usual and customary rate, not at the provider's usual and customary charge or at the provider's actual charge.\n   </em>\n   The fact that the 'usual and customary charge' is cited three times as opposed to the single citation of 'the provider's usual and customary charge', as well as the fact that the [MCC] Regulations include a specific definition for 'actual charge' and a separate definition for 'usual and customary charge,' leads the undersigned to conclude that the aim of both the [MCC] Regulations and the Act was to ensure that providers would properly be reimbursed at 100% of the usual and customary charge for the specific treatment rendered in the geographic location where that specific treatment was provided. Indeed, the purpose of the [MCC Regulations] is to prevent providers from charging excessive fees for treatment and services rendered to workers' compensation claimants.\n   <em>\n    Furthermore,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    [Repricing Manager] testified on behalf of Insurer that the ... Medical Fee Review Section specified in its [Statement of Purpose] that the Department would utilize the 85th percentile of the MDR database to determine the usual and customary charge as defined in Section 127.3 of the [MCC] Regulations. It is therefore consistent and logical to reason that payment for treatment and services rendered in a trauma center would be paid at the theoretically lesser amount of 100% of the usual and customary charges as opposed to 100% of the actual charges.\n   </em>\n   The precedents of\n   <em>\n    [\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roman Catholic Diocese of Allentown v.

No. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, Hearing Officer granted Insurer's fee review request and held Insurer properly reimbursed Provider at a reduced rate for the acute care treatment and services it rendered Claimant. Provider petitions for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Bureau's Statement of Purpose\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Provider first contends Hearing Officer erred in overruling its objection to Repricing Manager's testimony regarding the Bureau's Statement of Purpose because such testimony was irrelevant. Provider asserts Insurer's sole purpose in presenting Repricing Manager's testimony was to establish Insurer properly repriced and paid Provider's charges. However, Repricing Manager justified Insurer's repricing by reference to the Bureau's Statement of Purpose, which Insurer never submitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Statement of Purpose, Provider maintains, addresses a determination of the proper payment amount under Section 306(f.1)(3)(i) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 531(3)(i), and 34 Pa.Code \u00a7 127.102, which relate to the usual and customary charge for the medical fee caps. Section 306(f.1)(3)(i) provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   For purposes of this clause, a provider shall not require, request or accept payment for the treatment, accommodations, products or services in excess of one hundred thirteen percentum of the prevailing charge at the seventy-fifth percentile ... or one hundred thirteen percentum of any other Medicare reimbursement mechanism, as determined by the Medicare carrier or intermediary, whichever pertains to the specialty service involved, determined to be applicable in this Commonwealth under the Medicare program for comparable services rendered. If the commissioner determines that an allowance for a particular provider group or service under the Medicare program is not reasonable, it may adopt, by regulation, a new allowance. If the prevailing charge, fee schedule, recommended fee, inflation index\n   charge, DRG payment or any other reimbursement has not been calculated under the Medicare program for a particular treatment, accommodation, product or service,\n   <em>\n    the amount of the payment may not exceed eighty percentum of the charge most often made by providers of similar training, experience and licensure for a specific treatment, accommodation, product or service in the geographic area where the treatment, accommodation, product or service is provided.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   77 P.S. \u00a7 531(3)(i) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Similarly, Section 127.102 of the MCC Regulations provides (with emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   If a Medicare payment mechanism does not exist for a particular treatment, accommodation, product or services,\n   <em>\n    the amount of payment made to a health care provider shall be either 80% of the usual and customary charge for that treatment, accommodation, product or service in the geographic area where rendered, or the actual charge, whichever is lower.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   34 Pa.Code \u00a7 127.102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Provider asserts the actual payment amount under this formula is 113% of the Medicare rate in effect in 1995, adjusted yearly by the percentage to which the average weekly wage increased. As such, Provider argues, Section 127.102 of the MCC Regulations imposes a fee cap. The Statement of Purpose explains how to calculate a payment amount under Section 127.102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To the contrary, the trauma exception in Section 306(f.1)(10) of the Act, and its regulatory provision, 34 Pa.Code \u00a7 127.128,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   make no mention of determining the usual and customary charge by reference to what other providers charge. Rather, Section 306(f.1)(10) of the Act provides (with emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    If acute care is provided in an acute care facility to a patient with an immediately life threatening or urgent injury by a Level I or Level II trauma center accredited by the Pennsylvania Trauma\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Systems Foundation under the act of July 3, 1985 (P.L. 164, No. 45), known as the 'Emergency Medical Services Act,\n   </em>\n   ' or to a burn injury patient by a burn facility which meets all the service standards of the American Burn Association, or if basic or advance life support services, as defined and licensed under the 'Emergency Medical Services Act,' are provided,\n   <em>\n    the amount of payment shall be the usual and customary charge.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   77 P.S. \u00a7 531(10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Citing the Latin legal maxim and well-recognized statutory construction principle\n   <em>\n    expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n   </em>\n   (the express mention of one thing in a statute implies the exclusion of other things), Provider argues if the General Assembly intended that payment for services under the trauma care exception be based on 80% of the charges made by similar trauma care providers in the same geographic area, it would have included such language in Section 306(f.1)(10) of the Act and 34 Pa.Code \u00a7 127.128. However, because the legislature excluded any reference to other trauma care providers or their charges, the Bureau properly interpreted these provisions as exempting trauma care providers from the Act's fee cap provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Consequently, Provider argues, the Statement of Purpose relied on by Repricing Manager is wholly irrelevant to a determination of the proper payment amount under Section 127.128 of the MCC Regulations, relating to the exemption from fee caps for trauma centers and burn facilities. As such, Provider asserts Hearing Officer erred in concluding otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Summarizing, Provider argues evidence is relevant if \"(a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.\" Pa. R.E. 401. Here, the amount Insurer must pay Provider for the acute trauma care it provided to Claimant was the fact Hearing Officer needed to determine. Because the Statement of Purpose, and Repricing Manager's testimony regarding it, have no application to payment for charges exempt from the fee caps, Hearing Officer erred in admitting such evidence. In short, Repricing Manager's testimony regarding the proper construction of a regulation imposing a fee cap was irrelevant to the proper construction of a different regulation exempting acute trauma care from the fee cap provisions. Therefore, Provider urges, because this evidence constituted the entirety of Insurer's evidence, Hearing Officer's decision based on that evidence must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Reimbursement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Consequently, Provider contends Hearing Officer erred in determining Insurer met its burden of proving it properly reimbursed Provider for its trauma care services rendered. As discussed above, Provider asserts Hearing Officer misconstrued 34 Pa.Code \u00a7 127.128 as essentially permitting a payment limitation or fee cap. To that end, Hearing Officer imposed a fee cap determined by Repricing Manager's use of the 85th percentile of the market data retrieval database (MDR) published by Fair Health. F.F. No. 10e, f; C.L. No. 8; Lengle Dep. at 13; R.R. at 13a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In making her payment determination, Provider argues Hearing Officer completely disregarded the Bureau's interpretation of the trauma care exception and regulations-that a trauma care provider is entitled to be paid\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   usual and customary charge. In so doing, Provider asserts Hearing Officer substituted her interpretation of the regulations for the construction the Bureau applied for nearly two decades in adjudicating trauma care fee review cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Provider further asserts this Court acknowledged the Bureau's position that trauma care charges were exempt from the usual medical fee caps in\n   <em>\n    Roman Catholic Diocese\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Laundry Owners.\n   </em>\n   In both those cases, this Court affirmed the hearing officer's determinations that the provider's trauma care charges were exempt from the fee caps and the providers were entitled to 100% of their actual charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Provider argues the same deference to the Bureau's interpretation of the MCC Regulations should be afforded here with regard to the application of 34 Pa.Code \u00a7 127.128. Provider asserts the Bureau's construction is consistent with the clear purpose of the Act to exempt acute trauma care from the fee caps in the Act's MCC provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Further, Repricing Manager acknowledged that the Bureau's Medical Fee Review Section construes 34 Pa.Code \u00a7 127.128 to require payment of 100% of the trauma care provider's billed charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lengle Dep. at 16-17; R.R. at 16a-17a. Provider also maintains the Fee Review Section's position is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Laundry Owners,\n   </em>\n   where this Court noted the General Assembly intended the acute trauma or burn care provision in Section 306(f.1)(10) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 531(10), to be a specific exception to the Act's general fee cap provisions.
