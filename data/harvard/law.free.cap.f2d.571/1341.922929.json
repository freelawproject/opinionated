We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-14\">Royals purchased by a conditional sales contract a 1974 Buick Regal from defendant, Ralph Lipsey Motors. The contract was assigned to defendant Cay Economy Plan, Inc., and the financing was handled by it. The contract\u2019s Truth-in-Lending disclosure statement provided in part that Royals was to make 35 monthly installments of $135 and 1 balloon payment of $1,511.30. Royals went into default and concealed the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-15\">Cay Economy Plan, Inc. exercised its contractual remedy of accelerating the entire amount of the debt owed to it under the contract and seized the automobile in a Georgia State attachment action. At the time of seizure, Royals owed $5,426.30 under the contract\u2019s terms, having paid approximately $1,700 toward the purchase price. As Royals was unable to make the demanded lump sum payment of $5,426.30, she forfeited the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-16\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(b)(3) of the truth-in-lending regulations (Regulation Z) provides in part that creditors must set forth on the front of their Truth-in-Lending disclosure statements</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1414-17\">[t]he number, amount, and due dates on periods of payments scheduled to repay the indebtedness and . . the sum of such payments using the term, \u201ctotal of payments.\u201d If any payment is more than twice the amount of an otherwise regularly scheduled equal payment, the creditor shall identify the amount of such payment by the term \u201cballoon payment\u201d and shall state the conditions, if any, under which that payment may be refinanced if not paid when due. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1414-19\">Royals argues that defendants\u2019 failure to disclose their rights of acceleration in the disclosure statement as a part of \u201cthe number, amount, and due dates or periods of payments scheduled to repay the indebtedness\u201d violates 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638(a)(8) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(b)(3) (1975). Royals characterizes defendants\u2019 right to accelerate as an entirely different \u201coptional payment schedule\u201d which shortened the time of payment from 35 months to an immediate one-time payment of the entire balance on the contract, and must be disclosed in compliance with section 226.8(b)(3)\u2019s provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-20\">In <em>Martin v. Commercial Securities Co., </em>539 F.2d 521 (1976), this Court was confronted with the contention that acceleration of principal and earned finance charges was a \u201cdefault charge\u201d that must be disclosed as required by 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(b)(4). We rejected this argument and adopted a <em>per se </em>rule that \u201cin the absence of a regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>tion requiring it, failure to disclose an acceleration clause and the lender\u2019s rebate policy with respect thereto in an installment credit transaction does not give rise to a claim for statutory damages.\u201d 539 F.2d at 529. As no new regulation requiring disclosure of the creditors\u2019 remedy of acceleration has since been enacted, we reject Royals\u2019s contention that disclosure of the creditor\u2019s contractual right to accelerate is required under section 226.8(b)(3). <em>See McDaniel v. Fulton Nat\u2019l Bank of Atlanta, </em>543 F.2d 568 (5th Cir. 1976);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Whittlesey </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>542 F.2d 245 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Smith v. Avco Financial Services of Louisiana, Inc., </em>542 F.2d 242 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1415-14\">. <em>McDaniel </em>has been reheard en banc, 571 F.2d 948 (1978). In that opinion, disclosure of acceleration clauses was required under specified circumstances. However, the court expressly provided that the new ruling was prospective only and did not affect obligations incurred or renewed prior to 90 days after its date. This en banc opinion has no impact in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
