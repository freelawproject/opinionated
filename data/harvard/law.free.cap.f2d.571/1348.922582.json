He pleaded guilty, was convicted, and was sentenced to serve six months. The execution of the prison sentence was suspended, and Washington was placed on probation for 18 months. He was also fined $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">Several months later Washington was adjudged in violation of the terms of his probation, and probation was revoked. He was ordered to serve 60 days in prison, make restitution to the government for transporting him from Los Angeles, California, to the district court in Atlanta, Georgia. The magistrate also ordered that the period of probation be extended for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">Washington again violated the terms of probation, and he was again ordered to serve part of his prison term.

Shortly after the second probation revocation Washington filed two motions to vacate sentence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, attacking both probation revocations. The magistrate acted on the motions and issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in which the motions were denied. The district court clerk entered judgment on the magistrate\u2019s order, and Washington filed a notice of appeal. The record does not indicate that a district judge at any time referred the \u00a7 2255 motions to the magistrate or reviewed the findings and conclusions. According to the record, no district judge has acted in the premises at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-8\">The order rendered in this ease by the magistrate is not a final judgment of the district court which would invoke jurisdiction of this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Nor is the order appealable under any other statute. This Court has no jurisdiction. The appeal is dismissed. <em>United States v.
