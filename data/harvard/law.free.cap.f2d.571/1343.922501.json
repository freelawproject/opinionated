Appellant\u2019s collateral attack of his expired twenty year sentence on a 1948 guilty plea is premised upon three assertions; that appellant did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to counsel; that the convicting court failed to advise appellant of the nature and elements of the charged crimes; and that this allegedly unlawful prior conviction adversely affected appellant when sentenced on his present Pennsylvania state conviction. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-7\">Appellant, using the name Joseph Carey, signed a waiver of counsel form in regard to the conviction in question. The proceedings in the district court, while not recorded in their entirety, state: \u201cConstitutional rights explained; waivers of assistance of counsel signed; indictment read and explained; pleas of \u2018Guilty\u2019 entered. Testimony of Agent.\u201d Additionally, the judgment indicates that appellant was advised of his constitutional right to have counsel appointed. Appellant incorrectly asserts that there is proof \u201con the record\u201d that he was not properly advised of the nature and elements of the charged crimes. There is no such proof on the record. Moreover, the proceedings as recorded state that the indictment was read and explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-9\">Appellant\u2019s claim that his waiver of counsel was involuntary is contradicted by the record, as noted above. Additionally, as we have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-10\">When a petitioner simply contends that his <em>pre-Boykin </em>plea was not understanding^ entered, and offers no allegations to support that conclusion, as in the case sub judice, the claim is insufficient to necessitate federal habeas consideration. <em>Weaver v. Texas, </em>5 Cir. 1971, 441 F.2d 388.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1416-12\"><em>Bryant v. Elliot, </em>5 Cir. 1973, 472 F.2d 572; see also <em>Cunningham v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 536 F.2d 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-13\">Accordingly, this collateral attack on appellant\u2019s expired conviction must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"A4d3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
