We have repeatedly held that this is a permanent checkpoint, so it was appropriate to stop the truck and check on the driver\u2019s citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">The officer observed that defendant\u2019s refrigerator truck was riding high off the wheels and the rear tires were bouncing, giving the appearance that the truck was empty. Nevertheless, the truck\u2019s refrigerator unit was running. The officer asked what they were carrying, and the appellant stated that the truck was empty. The officer testified from his past experience that a refrigerated truck which appeared empty but had the refrigeration unit running was likely to contain contraband. The officer asked appellant to open the truck. While waiting for appellant at the rear of the truck, before the doors were opened, the officer detected the odor of marijuana coming from around the doors and through the drain holes in the floor of the truck. Appellant opened the doors and the officer found 1,078 pounds of marijuana inside. The officer had probable cause to search the truck without a warrant. <em>U. S. v. Rodriguez, </em>556 F.2d 277 (C.A.5, 1977); see <em>also U. S. v. Andrade, </em>545 F.2d 1032 (C.A.5, 1977); <em>U. S. v. Kidd, </em>540 F.2d 210 (CA5, 1976). There was no error in admitting the evidence. The conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
