Dubois the other member of the late firm of Dubois &amp; Graves, had left the State and had not been served with process in the suit, which had issued against both of the members. The usual pleas were entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b15-6\">Patterson, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY\">proved the making and delivery of the promissory note and rested his case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b15-7\"><em>Gordon, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay\">said the defence would be that Dubois drew the note in the name of the firm of Dubois &amp; Graves without the knowledge of Graves, five months after the firm had been dissolved; and was proceeding to prove this by a witness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-8\"><em>Patterson </em>objected to the testimony as inadmissible. It was too late to deny the partnership, or to attempt to disprove its existence at the trial, as it purported to have been made by the firm of Dubois &amp; Graves, and if it was the purpose of the defendant to deny this fact, he was bound at or before entering his pleas, to file an affidavit denying the existence of the partnership at the time the note was made, as required by the statute, <em>Pev. Code, </em>378, <em>Sec. </em>6, which he had not done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-9\"><em>Gordon: </em>The objection was not well founded; for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>provision of the statute referred to did not apply to the case, as the suit was now against Graves alone, since the other partner of the late firm was residing out of the State and had not been served with process. The action was, therefore, as it stood, substantially against Graves his client, as a sole defendant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b16-4\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ab\">The action was against the partners as such and was so instituted and stated on the record of the suit, and of course, it is alleged in the <em>narr. </em>that the note was made by the firm of Dubois and Graves, by which it purports to have been drawn; and by force of the statute, this must be taken to be admitted as alleged in the record, unless it is denied by the affidavit of the defendant at, or before the time of pleading to the action. The Court therefore ruled out the evidence, and the plaintiff had a verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
