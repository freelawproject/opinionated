Horsey, the defendant, to the order of blank and payable five months after the date of it. It was delivered by him to the firm of Cropper &amp; Brother in Baltimore, who endorsed it and negotiated it with the Farmers and Merchants\u2019 Bank of that city for value received, before it became due and without filling the blank with their own, or any other name as the payee in the body of it, but after maturity the name of the bank, then the holder, was inserted as the payees of it, and this action was brought to recover the amount of it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-6\"><em>C.

The authorities cited on the other side did not go <em>to </em>that extent, as he understood them, and he should therefore contend that after maturity it could not be done by any one, nor particularly by an endorsee who had received and held it in blank up to that time, notwithstanding he might have discounted it for a valuable consideration before its maturity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-5\"><em>C.

A negotiable promissory note drawn in blank as to the payee of it, as this was, may be filled with the name of the <em>bona fide </em>holder of it for a valuable consideration, either before or after its maturity. | He cannot fill it with the name of any other person, but \u2018 in a case like the present, he may at any time fill it with his own name, either before, or after its maturity, and there is no principle of law we think better settled in re-I gord to such negotiable paper.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
