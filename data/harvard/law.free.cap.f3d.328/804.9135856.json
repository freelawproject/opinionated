Both the state hearing officer and district court concluded that Defendant-Appellee Keller Indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>dent School District (\u201cDistrict\u201d) complied with the procedural requirements of the IDEA and that the individual education programs (\u201cIEPs\u201d) developed for Adam were appropriate, i.e., were reasonably calculated to enable him to receive educational benefits. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">\n<em>I. Facts and Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AFF\">Adam J. was born in 1984 and moved to the Keller School District in the spring of 1998, while in seventh grade. By all accounts, Adam is a very bright young man who suffers from serious behavioral problems and Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a form of autism. He was originally diagnosed, in second grade, with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and by fifth grade was also diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder. In the fall of 1998, after a comprehensive evaluation, the District determined that Adam was eligible for special education as a child with an emotional disturbance. The school district convened an \u201cAdmission, Review, and Dismissal\u201d (\u201cARD\u201d) committee meeting, developed an Individual Education Program (\u201cIEP\u201d), and placed Adam in a highly-structured behavior modification class at Fossil Ridge High School. At that time, Adam\u2019s parents agreed to both the IEP and the behavior modification placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">In October 1998, Adam\u2019s parents privately arranged for another psychological evaluation of Adam. This evaluation revealed that Adam suffers from Asperger\u2019s Syndrome and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Adam\u2019s parents did not notify the District of this new diagnosis until May 1999.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later that month, the ARD committee reconvened and Adam\u2019s \u201cprimary\u201d disability was reclassified as Asperger\u2019s Syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">In September 1999, in response to severe behavioral problems at home, Adam\u2019s parents unilaterally removed him from Fossil Ridge and placed him in a private residential treatment facility. Adam earned no academic credits while in the private facility and returned to Fossil Ridge in January 2000, where he successfully completed the spring semester.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">By August 2000, Adam\u2019s behavior had improved, and he was able to maintain employment at a local fast-food restaurant. In November 2000, the District removed Adam\u2019s \u201cemotional disturbance\u201d eligibility, and he was administratively \u201ccoded\u201d for autism only. Adam\u2019s behavior dramatically declined, however, and he was involved in several \u201cmajor disciplinary incidents\u201d in the fall 2000 semester. These occurrences included throwing a chair at a staff member and throwing lighted matches at other students. The ARD committee convened following each significant incident; and after the fire incident, the committee determined that Adam\u2019s behavior was not a manifestation of his disability. The committee then placed Adam in an \u201calternative educational setting\u201d for fifteen days. When Adam returned to Fossil Ridge, the District provided a personal aide, and his behavior improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">In May 2001, the ARD committee met to discuss Adam\u2019s progress and to develop an IEP for the 2001-02 school year. The committee determined that Adam should remain in special education classes, with the option of enrolling in general education electives. The proposed IEP also provided for both parent and teacher training; however, the District did not commit to assigning a full-time aide to Adam in 2001. The ARD noted Adam\u2019s academic progress and an overall decrease in behavioral problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Adam\u2019s parents disagreed with the proposed IEP and contended that private placement, at the District\u2019s expense, is appropriate for Adam. In April 2001, Adam\u2019s parents filed a request for a state \u201cdue process\u201d administrative hearing in accordance with the IDEA. The state hearing officer denied all relief, and Adam appealed to the 342d Judicial District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. The District removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas in September 2001, and summary judgment was granted in favor of the District in August of the following year. Adam timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AB1\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-m\">Under the IDEA, a federal district court\u2019s review of a state hearing officer\u2019s decision is \u201cvirtually <em>de novo.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>The district court must receive the state administrative record and must receive additional evidence at the request of either party.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The hearing officer\u2019s findings should be accorded \u201cdue weight,\u201d but the district court must arrive at an independent conclusion based on a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">We review <em>de novo, </em>as a mixed question of law and fact, a district court\u2019s decision that an IEP was or was not appropriate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s underlying findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The party contesting the propriety of the IEP bears the burden of establishing why the IEP and the resulting placement are inappropriate under the IDEA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">\n<em>B. The Propriety of Adam\u2019s IEP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A0D\">The IDEA conditions federal funding on, <em>inter alia, </em>the state\u2019s providing a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d (\u201cFAPE\u201d) to disabled children.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under this act, the FAPE must be tailored to the child\u2019s particular needs by means of an individual education program (\u201cIEP\u201d), which is a written statement prepared at a meeting attended by a qualified representative of the school district, a teacher, the child\u2019s parents or guardians, and, when appropriate, the child himself.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In Texas, the ARD committee is charged with preparing IEPs for disabled children.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">The free appropriate public education proffered in an IEP \u201cneed not be the best possible one, nor one that will maximize the child\u2019s educational potential; rather, it need only be an education that is specifically designed to meet the child\u2019s unique needs, supported by services that will permit him \u2018to benefit\u2019 from the instruction.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The IDEA \u201cguarantees only, a \u2018basic floor of opportunity,\u2019 consisting of \u2018specialized instruction and related services which are individually designed to provide educational benefit.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This educational benefit \u201ccannot be a mere modicum or <em>de minimis,\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but \u201cmust be meaningful\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>\u201clikely to produce progress.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">When a parent challenges the appropriateness of an IEP, the district court\u2019s inquiry, and ours on appeal, is limited to two questions. First, we must decide whether the school district complied with the procedures prescribed in the IDEA.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Second, we \u201cmust determine whether the IEP developed for the disabled child is \u2018reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\u2019\u201d \u201cIf these requirements are met, the State has complied with the obligations imposed by Congress and the courts can require no more.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In this case, Adam alleges both procedural and substantive violations of the IDEA. Most of the seven points of error Adam raises on appeal are without merit. He asserts first that the hearing officer\u2019s decision should not be afforded \u201cdue weight\u201d because the officer was biased in favor of the school district. In support of this allegation, Adam offers four examples of bias (1) in a \u201csynopsis\u201d of the case, the officer erroneously \u201creframed\u201d the issues presented for his consideration; (2) the officer did not provide adequate reasons for his decision; (3) the officer incorrectly described private placement as \u201cextraordinary relief\u2019; and (4) the officer \u201cmis-cited\u201d a case \u201cin exactly the same way it was mis-cited\u201d in the District\u2019s brief, allegedly reflecting that he \u201cnever actually had the case before him when he wrote his decision, but merely adopted the statements made in the District\u2019s Final Argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Adam\u2019s assertion of bias is unavailing. As a threshold matter, he cites no authority, other than statutory provisions calling for a \u201cqualified and impartial mediator,\u201d in support of his sweeping assertion that \u201c[w]here the decision of the Hearing Officer plainly shows that he is biased, his decision deserves no deference by the Trial Court.\u201d Moreover, the district court acknowledged that its review is \u201cvirtually <em>de novo,\u201d </em>and Adam offers no evidence that the court deviated from this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">We note also that the \u201cevidence\u201d in support of Adam\u2019s charge of bias is unconvincing. First, even if the hearing officer mischaracterized Adam\u2019s complaints in a synopsis, the officer\u2019s conclusions of law adequately address all of Adam\u2019s claims; whatever was \u201creframed\u201d or \u201crestated\u201d in the synopsis is likely irrelevant. Second, Adam fails to explain how the hearing officer\u2019s analysis, even if conclusional or scant, demonstrates bias. Third, the officer\u2019s reference to private placement as \u201cextraordinary relief\u2019 does not reflect bias and there is no evidence that the officer applied a \u201chigher burden of proof\u2019 to Adam\u2019s case. Adam\u2019s fourth point, that the hearing officer abdicated his responsibility and \u201cmerely adopted the statements made in the District\u2019s Final Argument\u201d is specious at best, and warrants no further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">Several of Adam\u2019s remaining arguments are similarly meritless. For example, he strenuously argues that the district court erred in concluding that he \u201ctook the same courses as other students, but tailored to his special needs,\u201d asserting instead that his classes were almost exclusively in the special education program. He fails, however, to demonstrate how this factual determination is relevant to his legal claims. Stating only that \u201cAdam did not have an individualized program that considered his unique needs,\u201d Adam appears to be argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>ing that these \u201cspecial ed.\u201d classes were not sufficiently challenging, given the ARD committee\u2019s determination that he was academically gifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">This argument also fails. As noted above, courts have repeatedly held that a FAPE need not be the best one possible, or the one calculated to maximize the child\u2019s educational potential; it only has to provide an educational opportunity designed to meet the student\u2019s specialized needs, with sufficient support services to allow him to benefit from the instruction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We recognize that the educational benefit that an IEP is designed to achieve must be \u201cmeaningful,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but Adam has failed to establish that his IEPs did not satisfy this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Adam\u2019s argument that the district court erred \u201cin stating that Adam\u2019s teachers testified as to the progress he made\u201d is similarly without merit. First, this issue is not adequately briefed, as Adam\u2019s brief merely asserts summarily that \u201cbecause of the lack of specificity by the Trial Court as to which testimony it was referring to, it is impossible to discuss that testimony here.\u201d To the limited extent that he does brief the issue, Adam again urges that his progress was hampered by the low level of instruction that he received and cites his severe behavioral problems in late 2000 and early 2001 as evidence that he actually <em>regressed </em>while enrolled in the school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Presumably, Adam\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s <em>factual </em>findings in this regard are an attempt to refute the court\u2019s <em>legal </em>conclusion that his IEP(s) at Keller were appropriate. We have previously considered four factors as \u201cindicators of whether an IEP is reasonably calculated to provide a meaningful educational benefit under the IDEA.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These factors are: (1) The program is individualized on the basis of the student\u2019s assessment and performance; (2) the program is administered in the least restrictive environment; (3) the services are provided in a coordinated and collaborative manner by the key \u201cstakeholders\u201d; and (4) positive academic and non-academic benefits are demonstrated.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Clearly, evidence of an academic benefit militates in favor of a finding that Adam\u2019s IEPs were appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">Adam has not established that the district court erred in concluding that he made progress while in the District. Aside from challenging a curriculum that he contends was \u201cbeneath his abilities,\u201d the only support Adam proffers for his no-progress contention is his behavioral problems. Athough they are severe, these problems appear to have been improving in 2001, when Adam returned from alternative placement and began working with a personal aide. The district court\u2019s conclusion that Adam made incremental progress is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">Adam\u2019s fifth and sixth points are likewise unavailing. Adam argues that the district court erred in \u201cimplying\u201d that \u201cbecause Adam\u2019s mother \u2018had no idea what was going on at school,\u2019 \u201d the District is \u201cexcused\u201d from providing a FAPE. A reading of the district court\u2019s order dispels any such \u201cimplication.\u201d Similarly, Adam\u2019s argument that the district court erred in stating that the IDEA \u201cguarantees only a basic floor of opportunity\u201d is without merit. The IDEA <em>does </em>guarantee \u201conly a basic floor of opportunity,\u201d and although Adam correctly asserts that the IEP must be designed to provide a \u201cmeaningful\u201d educational benefit, the district court expressly considered, and rejected, Adam\u2019s claim that he received \u201clittle or no educational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>benefit from his IEPs.\u201d Characterizing this argument as \u201cspeculative at best,\u201d the district court cited Adam\u2019s academic progress and anticipated graduation, ultimately-concluding that his IEPs were reasonably calculated to enable him to receive educational benefits. This is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Adam asserts further that the district court erred in concluding that he did not demonstrate that private placement at the Vanguard School would be appropriate. According to Adam, the district court\u2019s decision in this regard was based on the fact that Adam would not be able to interact with non-disabled peers at Vanguard; and thus, that the private school would not provide the \u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d for Adam. He points out that the presumption in favor of \u201cmainstreaming\u201d is overcome when a regular classroom cannot fit the needs of a disabled child.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">This argument is unpersuasive. First, because the district court concluded that the District had provided Adam with a FAPE, any ruling on private placement was merely <em>dicta. </em>Second, even if the district court erroneously cited interaction with non-disabled peers as a factor weighing against private placement, Adam has not carried his burden of establishing that placement at Vanguard was appropriate. From his brief and.record excerpts, it is simply impossible to assess the advantages and disadvantages of private placement; Adam has not described the facilities, curriculum, or other educational benefits Vanguard offers and has not explained how the school will better suit his academic and behavioral needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">Adam has, however, raised one issue which demands closer scrutiny. Adam alleges that the District did not comply with the procedural requirements of the IDEA and cites a litany of alleged violations. These include (1) failure to include \u201cmeasurable long-term goals and short-term objectives\u201d in an IEP,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (2) failure to update Adam\u2019s parents through regular report cards, and (3) failure to indicate Adam\u2019s baseline \u201clevel of competency\u201d on at least one IEP.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> According to Adam\u2019s brief, as a result of these procedural violations, his parents were \u201cdenied full participation in what were supposed to be collaborative efforts by the ARD members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">We have previously stated that \u201ca school\u2019s failure to meet the IDEA\u2019S procedural requirements <em>may </em>alone warrant a finding that, as a matter of law, the school has failed to provide a free appropriate public education.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The other circuits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>that have addressed this question head on have consistently held that \u201cprocedural defects alone do not constitute a violation of the right to a FAPE unless they result in the loss of an educational opportunity,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> but to date we have never formally adopted or rejected this approach.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We do so today.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">After careful consideration of the procedural violations alleged in this case, we, like the state hearing officer, conclude that even if the determination of Adam\u2019s January 25, 2000 IEP was procedurally deficient in some respects, he has not established that any procedural deficiency resulted in a loss of educational opportunity or infringed his parents\u2019 opportunity to participate in the IEP process.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> On the contrary, as Adam himself asserts, \u201c[t]he documentary evidence shows that Adam\u2019s mother (if not both parents) were [sic] present at every one of his ARD meetings\u201d and his parents frequently submitted supplemental \u201cparent statements\u201d to express their concerns and frustrations. Given Adam\u2019s parents\u2019 active participation in the crafting of his IEPs, and the absence of any demonstrable \u201clost educational opportunity,\u201d we conclude that the procedural requirements of the IDEA were substantially satisfied, even if some information was omitted from Adam\u2019s IEP.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">We recognize that Adam\u2019s parents are frustrated by their son\u2019s academic progress and that they obviously believe that his courses at Fossil Ridge have not been sufficiently challenging, given his ability and aptitude. Although we understand and sympathize with their plight, our focus is necessarily narrow. Adam\u2019s parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>simply have not demonstrated that (1) a procedural violation of the IDEA produced substantive harm, or (2) Adam\u2019s IEPs were not reasonably calculated to provide an educational benefit.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We are constrained, therefore, to agree with the district court that the District has complied with the requirements of the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">\n<em>III.
