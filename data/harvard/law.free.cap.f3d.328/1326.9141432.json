Anderson contends that the district court should not have imposed the 12-level enhancement provided by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) because he had not previously been deported after a \u201cconviction\u201d within the meaning of that section. Anderson had been deported in 1991 after he pleaded <em>nob contendere </em>to a Florida felony drug offense. The state court had withheld adjudication of guilt and imposed a sentence of time served. Anderson argues that a <em>nob contendere </em>plea with adjudication withheld does not qualify as a conviction within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-21\">Anderson relies on <em>United States v. Willis, </em>106 F.3d 966, 969 (11th Cir.1997), which held that a plea of <em>nob contendere </em>with adjudication withheld is not a conviction for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) because a <em>nob contendere </em>plea is not a conviction under Florida law. <em>Willis </em>is not controlling here, though, because the statutory scheme at issue in that case mandated that the term \u201cconviction\u201d be defined according to state law, <em>id. </em>at 967-68, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>there is no similar requirement under the Guidelines provision at issue in this case. We thus look to federal law for the applicable definition of \u201cconviction.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mejias, </em>47 F.3d 401, 403-04 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">Section 2L1.2(b)(l) provides: \u201cIf the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after ... (B) a conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less, increase by 12 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). The Sentencing Commission did not define \u201cconviction\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 2L1.2. But Congress has defined \u201cconviction\u201d as used in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 \u2014 one of the two statutory sections to which \u00a7 2L1.2 applies \u2014 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-5\">The term \u201cconviction\u201d [as used in the chapter Immigration and Nationality] means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has been withheld, where-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-6\">(i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or <em>the alien has entered a plea of </em>guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-7\">(ii) the judge has ordered <em>some form of punishment, </em>penalty, or restraint on the alien\u2019s liberty to be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1328-8\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A) (emphasis added). Although \u00a7 2L1.2 does not explicitly refer to \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A), we agree with the Tenth Circuit that the term \u201cconviction\u201d as used in \u00a7 2L1.2(b) is governed by the definition set forth in \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A). <em>See United States v. Zamudio, </em>314 F.3d 517, 521-22 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-9\">A conviction for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) therefore includes a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea with adjudication withheld as long as some punishment, penalty, or restraint on liberty is imposed. Anderson entered a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>and was punished with 22 days imprisonment, the time he had served until he pleaded. Anderson\u2019s prior drug offense thus meets the definition of a \u201cconviction\u201d in \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A) and is a \u201cconviction\u201d for \u00a7 2L1.2 purposes. Moreover, we have similarly concluded that the term \u201cconviction\u201d as used in other statutory and Guidelines provisions includes a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea with adjudication withheld. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>234 F.3d 1345, 1346 (11th Cir.2000) (interpreting \u201cconviction\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2)); <em>Meji-as, </em>47 F.3d at 404 (interpreting \u201cconviction\u201d under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>910 F.2d 760, 761 (11th Cir.1990) (interpreting \u201cconviction\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-11\">We also reject Anderson\u2019s contention that the sentence imposed for his drug offense, 22 days time served, was de minimis and therefore transformed his felony drug conviction into a misdemeanor. Anderson was convicted of a felony drug offense and deported as a result. As such, the district court correctly determined that the 12-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) applies to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
