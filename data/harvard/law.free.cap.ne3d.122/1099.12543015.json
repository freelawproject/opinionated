There are no material facts in dispute and this case presents a purely legal inquiry that we review de novo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899269\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/81/200/#p204\">\n    81 Mass. App. Ct. 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204-205 (2012). The condominium master deed, recorded on December 14, 2008, in the Suffolk County registry of deeds, defines the boundaries of the individual units in the condominium as including \"the side of the glass facing the interior of the Unit; such windows and balcony doors (including trim and framing thereof) being part of the Common Elements.\" The master deed goes on to state that \"all exterior windows and doors\" are included in the condominium's \"Common Elements,\" and that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-8\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Master Deed\n   </em>\n   , Declaration of Trust, or Park Board Declaration of Trust, the Common Elements shall be maintained, operated, repaired and replaced as necessary by the Trustees and all costs and expenses thereof shall be assessed among the Unit Owners under the terms of the Declaration of Trust in accordance with each Unit Owner's Percentage Interest\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The condominium's declaration of trust states that the condominium's bylaws are \"incorporated herein by this reference and made a part hereof, with the same force and effect as though fully set forth in the body hereof.\" Section 17.A. of the bylaws contains the following provision, which is at the crux of the parties' dispute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   \"All maintenance and replacement of and repairs to any Unit, ordinary or extraordinary other than to the Common Elements contained therein not necessitated by the negligence, misuse or neglect of such Unit Owner, and to the doors, windows (including, without limitation, replacement of glass) and balcony doors (including, without limitation, replacement of glass), and to electrical, plumbing, and heating fixtures within the Unit or belonging to the Unit Owner that are not a part of the Common Elements, shall be done by the Unit Owner at the Unit Owner's expense, excepting as otherwise specifically provided herein. Each Unit Owner shall be responsible for all damage to any and all other Units and to the Common Elements that such Unit Owner's failure so to do may engender.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The motion judge found the above-quoted language to be susceptible to only one meaning, which is that maintenance, replacement, and repair (collectively, repair) of all \"balcony doors ... shall be done by the Unit Owner at the Unit Owner's expense.\" We agree, finding Fudge's alternative constructions to be inconsistent with the plain language of the bylaws and the master deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, Fudge contends \u00a7 17.A. means that repairs to \"any Unit ... other than ... to the ... balcony doors ... shall be done by the Unit Owner at the Unit Owner's expense.\" This interpretation ignores that there is a comma after the word \"Unit\" when that word is first used in \u00a7 17.A., that there is no comma between the words \"extraordinary\" and \"other than\" which directly follow, and that there is a comma between the words \"Unit Owner\" (following the words negligence, misuse or neglect\") and the word \"and.\" The presence or absence of commas at these junctures indicates that the entire clause \"ordinary or extraordinary other than to the Common Elements contained therein not necessitated by the negligence, misuse or neglect of such Unit Owner\" modifies the immediately preceding words \"any Unit.\" Accordingly, \u00a7 17.A. is readily understood as enumerating three categories of repairs that fall to the unit owners: (1) repairs to any unit, except repairs to common elements contained in the unit unless caused by the unit owner, (2) repairs to the doors, windows, and balcony doors, and (3) repairs to electrical, plumbing, and heating fixtures within a unit or belonging to the unit owner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Next, Fudge contends that \u00a7 17.A. could be read as excluding repair of only \"balcony doors ... that are not a part of the Common Elements\" from the costs allocated to unit owners. This makes little sense, however, because the master deed defines the balcony doors as part of the common elements, and so the condominium does not contain any balcony doors that are not also part of the common elements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Sherman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Employers' Liab.
