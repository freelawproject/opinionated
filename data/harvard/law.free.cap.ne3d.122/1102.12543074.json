The husband also claims error in the finding that he committed fraud by claiming on his income tax returns the payment of alimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree that the evidence was insufficient to show that the husband received certain cash distributions, and therefore vacate the portion of the corrected judgment that awards the wife a twenty-five per cent share of most of the claimed distributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The parties were married in October, 1989. During most of the marriage, the husband was employed in the father's \"businesses,\" A. Franchi Contractors, Inc. In addition to compensation from his father's businesses, the husband held interests in the partnership entities, of which he, his parents, and his siblings were partners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The husband's father held the controlling partnership interest, and had the exclusive authority over distributions made from the net income of the partnership entities. The husband was terminated from his employment by his father in May, 2008, but maintained his class B partnership interests in the partnership entities. Throughout the marriage (until his termination) the husband regularly received annual cash distributions from each of the partnership entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The parties' judgment of divorce nisi (divorce judgment) entered on January 7, 2011. As part of the final marital property division, paragraph nine of the divorce judgment awarded the wife a twenty-five per cent share of the husband's interests in the partnership entities, up to a maximum of $ 365,000, \"if and when\" paid to the husband.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, paragraph ten entitled the wife to twenty-five per cent of cash disbursements made to the husband by the partnership entities until such time as she received her maximum share of the property division. Paragraph ten also required the husband to \"report to [the w]ife two times annually all cash distributions made to him.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paragraph twenty required the husband to pay to the wife $ 400 in weekly alimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In February, 2016, the wife filed a contempt complaint (amended in September of 2016) alleging, among other things, that the husband had failed to pay her alimony, as well as her twenty-five per cent share of cash distributions received by him from the partnership entities between January, 2011, and September, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   During the trial on the contempt complaint, the judge admitted the husband's individual Federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2015. Each tax return and corresponding schedule K-1 reflected taxable income earned by the partnership entities and allocated to the husband by virtue of his class B partnership interest for Federal income tax purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the judge found, the income reported by the husband from the partnership entities for the tax years 2011 through 2015 totaled $ 728,353.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The husband confirmed during his testimony that the earned income of the partnership entities, and the resulting tax liability derived therefrom, were as reported on the admitted income tax returns; however, he insisted that he received no distributions from the partnership entities other than the amounts given to him to pay his income tax liability based on his share of income earned by the partnership entities in a given tax year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge noted that the husband consistently testified that between 2011 and 2015 he received \"no monetary payment, income or distribution from any entity pursuant to the income reported per the Schedule K-1 forms.\" However, the husband conceded that the 2011 schedule K-1 issued by Glenside Realty Associates, LLP (Glenside), reflected, in box nineteen, a cash distribution to him in the amount of $ 13,714.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Personal checks issued to the husband by his parents also were admitted; the checks are dated between June, 2015, and December, 2016, totaling $ 149,891. Notations on the checks indicated that the funds were given to the husband for the parties' children's college expenses, for tax related expenses, or as \"Gifts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ultimately, the husband was found guilty of contempt. He was ordered to pay to the wife, among other things, $ 90,400 in alimony arrears, and $ 182,088.25 as her twenty-five per cent share of what the judge deemed were cash distributions received by the husband from the partnership entities (totaling $ 728,353). The husband appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the husband argues that the judge erred in finding that he received cash distributions from the partnership entities in excess of $ 13,714. He also claims error in the determination that he had the ability to pay to the wife $ 182,088.25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"To find a civil contempt, 'there must be a clear and undoubted disobedience of a clear and unequivocal command....
