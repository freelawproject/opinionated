L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (1). On appeal, the defendant contends both that the Commonwealth's evidence failed to satisfy the element of impairment and that the judge committed prejudicial error in admitting opinion testimony from two police officers regarding the defendant's intoxication from marijuana ingestion. Concluding that the evidence of intoxication was sufficient to sustain a conviction but not strong enough to overcome the prejudice stemming from the inadmissible opinion testimony, we reverse the judgment and set aside the finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of impairment evidence\n   </em>\n   .

App. Ct. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Here, the Commonwealth elicited testimony that the defendant drove past two police officers without stopping, as the officers, who were conducting traffic control in a construction site, gestured and yelled for the defendant to stop. The defendant ultimately stopped for a traffic light, and the police approached the defendant's car. In speaking to the defendant, one officer smelled the odor of burnt marijuana emanating from the defendant's vehicle, and the defendant admitted to smoking marijuana one hour earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendant was then asked to get out of the car, and police observed the defendant forget to unbuckle his seatbelt and struggle to open the car door. Once outside the car, police observed that the defendant moved lethargically and had difficulty answering basic questions regarding his date of birth or where he was coming from. Furthermore, the police administered four field sobriety tests (FSTs), and testified to the defendant's poor performance on these.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant's failure to stop, the officers' observations of the defendant's demeanor, the defendant's responses to questions posed by the officers, and the defendant's performance on the roadside assessments was sufficient evidence of impairment to sustain the conviction. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connolly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385086\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/394/169/#p173\">\n    394 Mass. 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173 (1985) (erratic driving unnecessary to prove impairment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Opinion testimony\n   </em>\n   . The defendant challenges the admission of six statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over counsel's objection to all but one statement, the police witnesses were permitted to testify that (1) \"I considered him a danger to the public. I needed to stop this vehicle and get him out of it\"; (2) \"he appeared high to me\"; (3) \"he was obviously under the influence of some substance of an alcohol [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] and we believed he was using some type of drug, marijuana maybe mixed with other things\"; (4) \"we didn't feel that he was capable of driving the vehicle\"; and (5) in response to a follow-up question by the prosecutor, the defendant was under the influence of \"marijuana, narcotics.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As is true for any lay witness, police may opine on a defendant's level of intoxication from alcohol consumption.

Accordingly, because the officers' testimony exceeded the bounds of permissible lay opinion testimony, we conclude that it was error for the judge to allow it, and turn next to its prejudicial effect.\n   <footnotemark xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2824091\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/589/#p591\">\n    445 Mass. 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591 (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While we often assume, absent evidence to the contrary, that a judge properly instructs himself as to \"the manner in which evidence is to be considered in his role as a factfinder,\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saulnier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4163084\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/84/603/#p607\">\n    84 Mass. App. Ct. 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 607 (2013), we cannot do so here. At the time of trial,\n   <em>\n    Gerhardt\n   </em>\n   was pending but had not been decided; therefore, our jurisprudence may have signaled that a lay witness could not render an opinion as to marijuana intoxication as there had been no definitive ruling on that issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In such circumstances, we are hard pressed to say the judge clairvoyantly instructed himself to ignore it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In any event, here, the challenged testimony was repeated several times and referenced by the Commonwealth in its closing. Furthermore, the evidence in this case, while sufficient, was far from overwhelming. Much of the defendant's incriminating behavior had reasonable explanations. For example, the defendant explained that he failed to see police waving to him because he was focused on the stop light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant also posited plausible explanations for his demeanor and poor performance on the roadside assessments. The defendant argued that he appeared confused and experienced difficulty getting out of the car because he was perplexed as to why police were stopping him. The defendant further explained that he is Haitian, speaks four languages, and is least proficient in English. He attributed, therefore, his failure to answer some of the questions put to him and his missteps on the roadside assessments to this language barrier. To this end, the defendant emphasized, for example, that on the nine-step walk and turn assessment, the defendant walked without swaying, stumbling, or falling off the curve, but failed only to touch heel to toe. In the counting assessment, the defendant counted backwards by tens rather than ones and mixed up only one number, and in the finger to nose assessment, the defendant made contact with his nose but touched the middle to upper part of his nose rather than the bottom tip. There also was no evidence that the defendant drove erratically, and the evidence suggested that he negotiated his way through the construction site without incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Given these plausible explanations and the absence of stronger indicia of impairment, we cannot say that the impermissible opinion testimony of two veteran police officers \"had but a very slight effect\" on the judge.\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2824091\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/589/#p591\">\n    445 Mass. at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Flebotte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"482592\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/417/348/#p353\">\n    417 Mass. 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 353 (1994).
