(\"Parkview\"), appeals the trial court's order denying its motion to stay litigation and compel arbitration. It raises one assignment of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court erred in finding that the arbitration clause is unenforceable under the doctrine of impossibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Finding merit to Parkview's assignment of error, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In August 2012, plaintiffs-appellees, Bryan and Kristi Paulozzi, entered into a construction agreement (\"the Agreement\") with Parkview. Under the Agreement, the Paulozzis would pay Parkview $552,469 to build them a home in Strongsville, Ohio. The Agreement set forth the following remedies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     REMEDIES:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   If Owner fails to satisfy Owner's obligations, defaults, or breaches with respect to this Agreement, at Contractor's option, Contractor may (a) terminate this Agreement and all deposits and payments by Owner shall be the property of Contractor (as liquidated damages) and Contractor and Owner shall be relieved from all obligations hereunder, or (b) sue for damages or specific performance in the Court of Common Pleas with jurisdiction or (c) arbitrate any claim or dispute as provided below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   If Contractor fails to satisfy its obligations, defaults, or breaches with respect to this Agreement, as Owner's sole remedies, Owner may either (d) terminate this Agreement and shall receive all payments and deposits made by Owner in excess of actual costs incurred by Contractor (with any dispute as to said costs or any related matter to be determined solely by arbitration, as provided below) and Contractor and Owner shall be relieved from all obligations hereunder, or (e) proceed through arbitration[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   In the event any remedy or limitation of remedy is invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not adversely effect any other limitation or remedy of either Owner or Contractor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The Agreement also set forth the following arbitration clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ARBITRATION:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (a) With respect to all claims, breaches, defaults, disputes and damages arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Property or the Residence (whether grounded in contract or tort), to which arbitration applies, as provided above, the arbitration shall be conducted under the auspices of the Ohio Arbitration and Mediation Center in accordance with its rules, at Cleveland, Ohio. The cost of the arbitration shall be paid one-half (1/2) by each party, and each party shall be responsible for all fees and costs which they incur in engaging counsel or other experts in representing them in the arbitration proceeding. The decision of the arbitrator shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any court with jurisdiction over the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (b) Ohio law contains important requirements the Owner must follow before the Owner may file lawsuit or commence arbitration proceedings for defective construction against the residential contractor (Seller) which constructed the Owner's home. At least sixty (60) days before the Owner files lawsuit or commences arbitration proceedings, the Owner must provide the contractor with written notice of the conditions the Owner alleges are defective. Under Chapter 1312, of the Ohio Revised Code, the contractor has an opportunity to offer to repair or pay for the defects. The Owner is not obligated to accept any offer the contractor makes. There are strict guidelines and procedures under State law, and failure to follow them may affect the Owner's ability to file lawsuit or commence arbitration proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 5} According to the Paulozzis, Parkview finished building the home in 2013; however, within the first year of moving into the home, the Paulozzis allege that they experienced issues with the driveway and kitchen floor. The Paulozzis allege that they informed Parkview of the problems, but that Parkview never fixed the problems and did not respond to their 60-day notice of construction defect letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In September 2017, the Paulozzis filed a complaint against Parkview, National Carpet Outlet, Inc., and an \"unknown concrete-pouring company.\" The Paulozzis set forth claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, conversion, promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, violations of Ohio's Home Construction Service Suppliers Act, and violations of Ohio's Consumer Sales Practices Act against Parkview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Parkview moved to stay the litigation and compel arbitration under the Agreement's arbitration provision. The Paulozzis opposed Parkview's motion, arguing that the arbitration clause was unenforceable because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   the parties['] chosen arbitration forum, Ohio Arbitration and Mediation Center (\"OAMC\"): (1) is non-responsive and appears to be defunct; (2) likely was defunct when the parties entered into their Construction Agreement (\"the Agreement\"); and (3) has a fatal conflict of interest due to undisclosed relationships between OAMC's representatives and Parkview's principals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Paulozzis argued that ordering arbitration would therefore be pointless. The Paulozzis also argued that the arbitration\n   clause was void due to fraud; specifically, the Paulozzis argued that Parkview failed to disclose the professional relationship that it had with the OAMC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Parkview filed a reply brief, arguing that the \"essential purpose of the arbitration provision\" was \"still capable of substantial accomplishment.\" It stated that even if or though the OAMC was no longer operational, the court only had to appoint or the parties only had to agree to a different arbitrator. Parkview also argued that \"the limited relationship between * * * Parkview * * * and the OAMC\" is irrelevant and does not establish bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court denied Parkview's motion in a judgment entry, stating\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The arbitration clause at issue in this case states that the arbitration \"shall be conducted under the auspices of the [OAMC.]\" However, the OAMC is now defunct. The arbitration agreement did not provide for an alternative arbitration forum. Therefore, the arbitration clause is unenforceable under the doctrine of impossibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 10} It is from this order that Parkview now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In its sole assignment of error, Parkview argues that the trial court erred in finding that the Agreement's arbitration provision was unenforceable under the doctrine of impossibility. Parkview's arguments in support of its assignment of error are nearly identical to that argued in its reply brief filed below and discussed above, with the exception of a newly-added argument that the trial court \"failed to give full effect and meaning to the severability clause of the agreement.\" The Paulozzis' arguments in response are the same as those they raised in their opposition below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"The appropriate standard of review on judgments pertaining to the enforceability of an arbitration agreement depends on the questions raised in challenging the applicability of the arbitration provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Javorsky v.

While the parties in\n   <em>\n    Citraro\n   </em>\n   did not raise and we did not analyze whether the agreement was unenforceable due to impossibility, we believe that analyzing\n   <em>\n    Citraro\n   </em>\n   is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In\n   <em>\n    Citraro,\n   </em>\n   the agreement between the parties stated that any arbitration between the parties would be resolved by \"the applicable rules of [either the American Arbitration Association or the National Arbitration Forum] then in effect\" and that the agreement was governed by the FAA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. The agreement also contained a severability clause that stated, \"If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement cannot be enforced, the rest of the Arbitration Agreement will continue to apply[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 24} We concluded that the arbitration agreement was enforceable \"notwithstanding NAF's unavailability [because the] parties to the Note have manifested a clear intent to arbitrate their claims, and this intention is not contingent on the availability of a particular arbitrator.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. We based our conclusion on the fact that (1) Section 5 of the FAA \"plainly requires that the court appoint an arbitrator where the specified arbitration forum is no longer available,\" and (2) \"the severability clause in the Arbitration Agreement evidences the parties' intent to arbitrate regardless of the NAF's availability.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12-14. Specifically, as to the severability clause, we found that while the portion of the arbitration clause concerning NAF was unenforceable, \"the rest of the [agreement] continues to apply, and what remains manifests the parties' clear intention to arbitrate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.

Cuyahoga No. 99278,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-3249\">\n    2013-Ohio-3249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 18. We based our finding on the fact that \"rather than reference the rules of any particular arbitrator, the [agreement] here generally specifies that any claim 'shall be resolved by arbitration under this [agreement] and the applicable\n   rules of the [arbitration forum] then in effect.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-3249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 26} There are a number of distinctions between this case and\n   <em>\n    Citraro.\n   </em>\n   First, the contract in\n   <em>\n    Citraro\n   </em>\n   was governed by the FAA, whereas the Agreement between Parkview and the Paulozzis is not. Therefore, to the extent that our holding in\n   <em>\n    Citraro\n   </em>\n   relied on the fact that the FAA requires a court to appoint a new arbitrator when the original arbitrator identified by an agreement between the parties is no longer available,\n   <em>\n    Citraro\n   </em>\n   is not helpful. Second, while the agreement in\n   <em>\n    Citraro\n   </em>\n   and the Agreement in this case both contained a severability clause, the agreement in\n   <em>\n    Citraro\n   </em>\n   identified two arbitration forums, whereas the Agreement in this case only identified one, and the Agreement in this case does reference particular rules, stating that the arbitration would be conducted \"under the auspices of the [OAMC] in accordance with its rules[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Despite the above distinctions, we nevertheless reach a similar conclusion to that in\n   <em>\n    Citraro\n   </em>\n   . Like the agreement in that case, the Agreement between the Paulozzis and Parkview does not identify the OAMC as the \"exclusive\" arbitrator. The parties' positions in this appeal support that conclusion. As we noted above, the Paulozzis believe that having the OAMC serve as an arbitrator would have been unfair, and Parkview still desires arbitration even though its preferred arbitration forum is no longer viable. Therefore, it does not appear that either party is opposed to having another arbitrator handle the dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Furthermore, like\n   <em>\n    Citraro\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99278,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-3249\">\n    2013-Ohio-3249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we find that mention of the OAMC can be severed from the Agreement. \"Whether a part of a contract may be severed from the remainder 'depends generally upon the intention of the parties, and this must be ascertained by the ordinary rules of construction.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ignazio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5808287\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/113/276/\">\n    113 Ohio St.3d 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-1947\">\n    2007-Ohio-1947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=865%20N.E.2d%2018\">\n    865 N.E.2d 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 11, quoting\n   <em>\n    Huntington &amp; Finke Co. v.

Because the OAMC is no longer available, that portion must be severed from the Agreement. Severing the identification of the OAMC from the arbitration provision leaves the provision without an identified arbitrator. However, upon application by either party to the court of common pleas, that court may appoint an arbitrator to handle the dispute between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2711.04. As a result, the identification of the OAMC as the arbitrator may be severed from the arbitration provision, which is still enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The Paulozzis also argue that the arbitration provision is unenforceable because it was induced by fraud.
