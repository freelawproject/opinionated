On or about July 20, 2015, the defendant became angry at the victim, his wife, after he asked for a blanket and she gave him one that was \"thicker\" than he preferred. The defendant slapped and punched the victim with a closed fist \"all over [her] body.\" The victim testified that \"in order to protect [her] face [she] just put [her] hands up, and that's when [her] right hand got punched.\" She described the pain as \"unbearable\" and radiating into her arm, causing her to seek medical treatment the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We also assess \"whether the defendant's evidence caused the Commonwealth's case to deteriorate.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Elliffe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"480256\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/47/580/#p584\">\n    47 Mass.

The witnesses called by the defense\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   contradicted the testimony of the victim; however, the jury evidently resolved these contradictions in favor of the Commonwealth, as they were permitted to do. See\n   <em>\n    St. Louis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801901\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/350/#p364\">\n    473 Mass. at 364-365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the defendant's evidence did not cause the Commonwealth's case to deteriorate, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Platt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1346437\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/440/396/#p404\">\n    440 Mass. 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404 (2003), we are satisfied that the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence. The motions for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth's case and at the close of evidence were properly denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Medical records\n   </em>\n   . The defendant argues that the victim's medical records were improperly admitted into evidence. As the defendant did not object to admission of these records below, we review to determine whether, if error, it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ortiz-Soto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"95032\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/49/645/#p647\">\n    49 Mass. App. Ct. 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 647 (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant claims that the records were not properly authenticated, but fails to cite adequate authority in support of his contention. The medical records were admissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, which states that \"[r]ecords kept by hospitals, dispensaries or clinics ... may be admitted by the court, in its discretion, as evidence ... so far as such records relate to the treatment and medical history of such cases.\" Records used at trial \"shall be certified by the affidavit of the person in custody thereof to be a true and complete record, and shall be delivered by such hospital, dispensary or clinic ... to the clerk of such court, who shall keep the same in his custody until its production is called for at the trial or hearing by the party requiring the said record. Such record, so certified and delivered shall be deemed to be sufficiently identified to be admissible in evidence if admissible in all other respects.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"95032\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/49/645/#p647\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus no witness was required to authenticate the records. Indeed, the records were accompanied by an affidavit signed by the keeper of the records. Nothing more was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant also claims, for the first time on appeal, that the records were more prejudicial than probative and were \"needlessly\" cumulative. \"Whether evidence is relevant and whether its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect are matters entrusted to the trial judge's broad discretion and are not disturbed absent palpable error.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sylvia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668530\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/456/182/#p192\">\n    456 Mass. 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192 (2010), quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1079977\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/434/570/#p578\">\n    434 Mass. 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 578-579 (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The judge admitted the records with redactions pertaining to liability, e.g., that the patient was a victim of domestic violence. In fact, the defendant did not contest that the victim was injured. Rather, he claimed she injured herself in a fall. As the unredacted portions of the records related to, inter alia, diagnosis and treatment, there was no error. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The records were also corroborative of the victim's testimony and not merely cumulative. See\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2069260\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/41/246/#p248\">\n    24 Pick. 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (1833) (\"Cumulative evidence is additional evidence of the same kind to the same point\"). The records were probative of the victim's injury and redacted to avoid any mention of liability. There was no error, let alone a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    The defendant was acquitted of an additional charge of assault and battery on a family or household member for an alleged incident on a different date.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The defendant called Winchester police Officer Matthew Alford and Rajbir Kaur, the defendant's mother, as witnesses.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    That the jury may not have credited the victim as to the other alleged incident, see note 1,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , does not affect our analysis.
