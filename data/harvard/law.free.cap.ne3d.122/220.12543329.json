The amended entry classified Megarry as a sexual predator, whereas the original entry, which was entered on the same date, had classified him only as a sexually oriented offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Megarry contends the amended classification entry was void; therefore res judicata does not bar his argument that the trial court erred in issuing it. He claims that because the initial sex-offender classification was part of his criminal sentence and thus constituted a final order,\n   the trial court lacked authority to alter it in the absence of a proper nunc pro tunc order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Megarry's contention is based on the faulty premise that his sex-offender classification was part of his criminal sentence. That would have been true if he had committed his underlying offenses after the January 2008 effective date of Ohio's enactment of the Adam Walsh Act because that classification is punitive and part of the criminal sentence. However, he committed the crimes before the effective date of that act, when Ohio's version of Megan's Law was effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Although sex-offender classifications under Megan's Law are civil, remedial, and separate from the criminal conviction and sentence, they are final orders under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2) that cannot be revisited once they are journalized. Therefore, the trial court's amended entry reclassifying him was void and subject to collateral attack. We sustain his assignment of error and reverse the judgment of the trial court with instructions to vacate the Amended Judgment Entry of March 19, 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The Adams County Grand Jury returned an indictment charging Joseph Megarry with one count of kidnapping and one count of rape. Megarry entered a guilty plea to the lesser offenses of abduction and sexual battery under an agreement that stipulated he would be designated a sexual predator and serve four years in prison. On March 19, 2003, the trial court held both a sentencing hearing and a sexual-predator hearing. The trial court sentenced Megarry to an aggregate four-year prison term. At the hearing the trial court concluded that it would not follow the parties' agreement to classify Megarry as a sexual predator because the state did not introduce any evidence to that effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The initial March 19, 2003 entry entitled \"Judgment Entry Following Sexual Predator Hearing,\" which was filed separately from the sentencing entry, did not classify him as either a sexual predator or a habitual sexual offender; thus by default Megarry became a sexually oriented offender. But a subsequent entry entitled \"Amended Judgment Entry Following Sexual Predator Hearing,\" filed 88 minutes later on that same date, classified Megarry as a sexual predator consistent with the parties' plea agreement. Megarry did not appeal from the \"amended\" entry reclassifying him. And neither he nor the state appealed from the initial March 2003 entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Over 13 years later, in October 2016, Megarry's counsel filed a motion to vacate the amended entry classifying him as a sexual predator. Megarry argued that once the trial court initially classified him as a sexually oriented offender as part of his criminal sentence in March 2003, it lacked authority to modify his sentence by reclassifying him as a sexual predator less than two hours later. Megarry claimed this second sexual-predator classification is void and subject to vacation at any time. The trial court denied the motion, finding that res judicata barred Megarry's claim because he could have, but did not contest it in a direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Megarry assigns the following error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED MR.

LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Megarry asserts that the trial court erred by denying his motion to vacate the court's amended March 2003 entry, which reclassified him as a sexual predator instead of a sexually oriented offender, as indicated by default in the initial entry. He argues the initial classification entry was part of his criminal sentence that became final after the trial court's classification entry was journalized; therefore the court lacked jurisdiction to amend the initial entry absent authority to do so, e.g., a Civ.R. 60(B) motion or a nunc pro tunc entry to correct a clerical error. Because the court lacked jurisdiction, he argues its amended entry was void and not subject to the bar of res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Under Crim.R. 32(C) an entry becomes a valid final judgment in a criminal case, when it sets forth the fact of conviction, the sentence, the judge's signature, and the time stamp indicating that the clerk entered the judgment in the journal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Several months later upon the state's motion, the trial court amended its sentencing entry to include an order of restitution. The Supreme Court of Oho ruled that the trial court lacked authority to reconsider its valid, final sentencing entry and that the nunc-pro-tunc exception did not apply because the amended sentencing entry did not reflect the events that occurred at the sentencing hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.

That is, \"[b]ecause '[n]o court has the authority to impose a sentence that is contrary to law,' [thus] * * * '[p]rinciples of res judicata * * * do not preclude appellate review.

But nunc pro tunc entries \"are limited in proper use to reflecting what the court actually decided, not what the court might or should have decided or what the court intended to decide.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The subsequent \"Amended Judgment Entry,\" issued by the trial court less than two hours later on the same day, reclassified Megarry as a sexual predator. The trial court did not suggest that it was correcting any clerical mistake or issuing a nunc\n   pro tunc entry; it instead without any explanation\n   <em>\n    amended\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    modified\n   </em>\n   its prior classification entry, which was a final appealable order. It lacked jurisdiction to do so.\n   <em>\n    Baldwin's Ohio Appellate Practice\n   </em>\n   at Section 1:18;\n   <em>\n    Maxwell\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Because the court's initial sexual offender classification entry constituted a final appealable order that neither party appealed, and in the absence of an appropriate motion under the civil rules, the trial court lost jurisdiction to modify its classification entry. Consequently, the court's amended classification entry was void, subjecting it to collateral attack at any time.\n   <em>\n    Lingo v.
