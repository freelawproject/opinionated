We disagree and discuss each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The evidence of joint venture\n   </em>\n   . The defendant claims that the evidence was weak that he shared with the principal the necessary intent to commit the murder. As a starting point, on direct appeal we observed that \"the evidence against the defendant was considerably stronger and more persuasive than it was with regard to [Mattox]\" (citation omitted).\n   <em>\n    Clements\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"132381\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/51/508/\">\n    51 Mass. App. Ct. at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, there was ample evidence that the defendant had cooperated with an accomplice, whether it was Mattox or another, to kill the victim. The ammunition found at the scene disclosed that two different guns -- a .380 caliber and a nine millimeter -- were employed in the shootings. Two live .380 shells were cycled through a gun but not fired, which supported the eyewitness's claim that the defendant's gun jammed. However, the evident murder weapon was the nine millimeter gun, which was consistent with the five discharged nine millimeter shell casings that corresponded to the victim's five entry and exit wounds. In addition, the defendant was seen running from the scene of the murder with another person. Thus, the evidence that the defendant cooperated with the principal and shared the necessary intent for the murder was far from weak. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Akara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275511\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/465/245/#p255\">\n    465 Mass. 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 255 (2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Blake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651217\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/428/57/#p63\">\n    428 Mass. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63-64 (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Inconsistent verdicts\n   </em>\n   . The defendant further claims there is a \"serious question\" about the murder verdict where he was convicted as a joint venturer and his codefendant, Mattox, was acquitted of the same charges in the same trial. Again, this is not uncharted territory. As we said on direct appeal, \"We also reject the defendant's claim that the verdict of acquittal of Mattox and the verdict of guilty as to the defendant on the theory of joint venture are inconsistent verdicts which require reversal of the defendant's conviction of second degree murder. Each defendant was tried both on the theory of individual liability and joint venture.\"\n   <em>\n    Clements\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"132381\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/51/508/\">\n    51 Mass. App. Ct. at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Contrary to the defendant's claim, Mattox's acquittal does not call into question the justice of the defendant's conviction because while Willis's testimony, admitted substantively, identified the defendant as one of the shooters, it did not do the same as to Mattox. Mattox's acquittal does not illustrate a weakness in the critical evidence against the defendant as a joint venturer. At best, and ignoring the lack of direct evidence that Mattox was one of the shooters, the verdicts are factually inconsistent, which neither provides grounds for relief nor illustrates any weakness in the verdict. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Medeiros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668008\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/456/52/#p57\">\n    456 Mass. 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57-58 (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Lack of a manslaughter instruction\n   </em>\n   . The defendant further claims that his murder verdict should be reduced to manslaughter because the judge erroneously declined to instruct on voluntary manslaughter where the evidence justified such an instruction based on reasonable provocation in the form of sudden combat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As the trial judge noted when she declined to instruct on manslaughter, the evidence adduced at trial, even when viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, did not support a voluntary manslaughter instruction. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nichypor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"823694\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/419/209/#p216\">\n    419 Mass. 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 216 (1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant attempts to construct the foundation for a manslaughter instruction from Anthony Owens, who testified on behalf of the defense at trial. According to Owens, at approximately 6\n   <em>\n    P\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    M\n   </em>\n   ., i.e., the time of the shooting, from his vantage point on Harvard Street, he saw a crowd of ten to twenty people within which two individuals were arguing, yelling, and swearing. He saw punches thrown and heard someone get hit. Less than a minute later, he heard a \"couple of pops,\" someone yelled \"fire,\" an indication that a shooting was occurring, and he ran away. Owens never saw the faces of the two involved in the fight. He could not say whether they were tall or short, fat or thin, black or white, or describe their clothing. Nor did he see a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As the trial judge noted at the time, because Owens could not identify who was in the fight, his testimony failed to provide a basis for a manslaughter instruction. Despite this, the defendant claims that it can be inferred from the circumstances that the fighters were Mattox and the victim, justifying the instruction. We disagree. The defendant's claim amounts to mere speculation or a hypothesis, neither of which is sufficient grounds for the instruction. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Groome\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993867\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/435/201/#p220\">\n    435 Mass. 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220 (2001) ;\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeArmas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"874740\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/397/167/#p171\">\n    397 Mass. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171 (1986). The judge did not err in declining to give an instruction on manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    The defendant's age\n   </em>\n   . Finally, the defendant claims that based on now-known advances in science regarding juvenile brain development and because he was seventeen at the time of the murder, reducing his verdict to manslaughter is more consonant with justice. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant claims that scientific developments regarding differences in juvenile brains as compared to adult brains provides a ground to reduce his murder conviction to manslaughter.
