On appeal, he claims the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction. We agree and therefore reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   After observing a car committing two civil motor vehicle infractions, a State police trooper stopped the car. The defendant was the operator and Duran Randall was the passenger. The car was not registered, and it did not belong, to either man. Both occupants were extremely nervous, with their hands shaking and their chests heaving. The car also had \"quite a few\" air fresheners in the passenger compartment. Upon confirming that neither the defendant nor Randall possessed a valid driver's license, the trooper decided to have the car towed. Before the tow truck arrived, the trooper conducted an inventory search of the car. In the trunk, he discovered a bag containing four individually packaged bags of marijuana weighing approximately four pounds in the aggregate. There was nothing else found in the trunk, i.e., no personal effects belonging to the defendant or Randall. No contraband, drug paraphernalia, weapons, or any indicia of drug sales, were found in the passenger compartment or in possession of either occupant. Neither of the two men made an incriminating statement at that time, and both denied ownership of the marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This case is controlled in all material respects by\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892499\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/409/675/\">\n    409 Mass. 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991), where cocaine was discovered in the locked trunk of a vehicle that did not belong to either the defendant or the passenger.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892499\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/409/675/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892499\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/409/675/\">\n    at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
