Finding that Kelly opened the door to this evidence and also finding no fundamental error, we affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Detective Maples of the Hendricks County Drug Taskforce recovered a cell phone from a suspected drug dealer. He then used the phone to pose as a drug dealer himself and set up a meeting with Defendant, Delmar Kelly, to purchase drugs. When Kelly arrived at the agreed upon location, officers attempted to block his vehicle and make an arrest, but Kelly maneuvered around them and led police on an almost five-mile chase before stopping in a residential neighborhood. During the chase, several items were thrown from the car, including a digital scale, heroin, and cocaine. When the officers finally forced Kelly to a stop, three men were removed from the car at gunpoint, handcuffed, and separated. The two other men besides Kelly were Roosevelt Garrett and Cameron Johnson. There is no evidence regarding when any of the three men received\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During Kelly's jury trial, defense counsel began her opening statement by playing a jail call wherein Kelly stated that he was driving to make some money and \"got caught up in\" a \"narcotics bust\" but that he \"ain't had nothing on [him].\" (Tr. Vol 2. at 86; State's Ex. 10.) Defense counsel then went on to ask the jury to decide whether Kelly was part of the whole drug deal or just got caught up in the bust. She suggested he was an \"unknowing means to an end\" for his co-defendants. (Tr. Vol. 2 at 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For its part, the State elicited testimony from two officers about Kelly's actions following his arrest:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   State: Uh, any admission by the three about what - what was going on or what they were doing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Detective Maples: No, there was not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   State: Did any of them give you information about what they were doing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Detective Maples: They did not, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   State: Did ... Mr. Kelly appear to be befuddled or confused about why he was being stopped?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Detective Petree: No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   State: Did he say anything to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Detective Petree: Uh, none of the three really wanted to talk to us.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Tr. Vol. 2, pp. 107-08, 137.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The prosecutor then argued in closing, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Kelly's] guilty mind is also proven by things he didn't say. After the pursuit when he was given a chance to talk, to say what happened, to say, I don't know, [Roosevelt] just asked me to drive him to see a friend for money, we didn't hear that. He didn't say that. He didn't say I was just driving out here to meet a friend. I've [g]ot no idea why you're-why you're stopping me. He wasn't surprised at all he was being stopped because he knew exactly what was happening. You heard from the jail call-ca-phone call, he [was] caught up in a narcotics bust. He didn't know police would be waiting for him when he arrived at that [drug dealer's] address.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   So there's no reason for him to be surprised [be]cause he knew exactly what he was doing. Wasn't surprised and at no time during that five-mile pursuit did he stop voluntarily. At no time did he stop and say, please I - I was scared; I ran after driving through those yards, I just had to stop. I realize my mistake. No, he drove through those yards; drove through on 150, Dan Jones, weaving in and out of traffic; approaching speeds of nearly seventy miles per hour on Dan Jones. Speeds of nearly sixty miles per hour in the Settlement neighborhood. Only stopped when that neighborhood got so winding, so difficult to navigate that he had nowhere else to go. His affirmative conduct proves his intent to deal that day. The things he didn't say, no expression of confusion to prove his intent that day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (Tr. Vol. 3, pp. 42-43.) Kelly's counsel did not object to any of the above statements on the grounds that they violated his right to remain silent. (He did object on other grounds.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The jury found Kelly guilty of dealing in a narcotic drug and resisting law enforcement. Kelly appealed, only challenging the dealing in narcotics conviction, and argued that the trial court committed fundamental error by allowing the State to present evidence of his post-arrest, pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence during trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In a 3-0 memorandum decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Kelly v.

Further, even if there was an error, the Court of Appeals concluded that it was not fundamental error because: (1) the references to Kelly's silence were used to rebut his defense that he was oblivious to a drug transaction taking place; and (2) there was substantial evidence that Kelly knew about the drugs in the car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Kelly petitioned for transfer which we granted, thereby vacating the Court of Appeals opinion.

However, we find that\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   does not apply here. Applying other more analogous cases, we find that: 1) Kelly opened the door to the prosecutor's comments regarding his silence; and 2) because the mentions of his silence were minimal and there is ample evidence of his guilt, there is no fundamental error here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.

There our Court of Appeals declined to decide whether defendant's post-arrest, pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence is protected because it found that even if the prosecutor's questions and comments were a violation, Cameron opened the door to them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890689\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/22/588/#p592\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890689\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/22/588/#p592\">\n    at 592-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Essentially, Cameron argued that the victim stabbed him as part of his defense theory, and the State offered testimony and an argument in effort to show that Cameron had not actually suffered any injuries.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890689\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/22/588/#p592\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890689\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/22/588/#p592\">\n    at 590-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Part of that testimony and argument went to the fact that Cameron did not say anything to reflect that he was injured or hurt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890689\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/22/588/#p592\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, in this case, Kelly offered his defense theory that he was unaware of the drug deal but rather was an unwitting participant, and in response, the State offered testimony and argument that he was aware of the drug deal, both because he did not say anything indicating that he was unaware of why the police were arresting him and because of his demeanor and behavior. Accordingly, we find that Kelly opened the door to the State's response that included comments about his silence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Further, even if the trial court erred in admitting the State's evidence and argument about Kelly's post-arrest, pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence, this error is not a fundamental one for the reasons articulated in\n   <em>\n    Owens v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7187043\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/937/880/#p894\">\n    937 N.E.2d 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 894 (Ind. Ct. App. 2010). That is, the reference to Kelly's silence in the officer's testimony was minimal in the context of the entire\n   trial. Also, while the statements made by the prosecution in closing did reference Kelly's silence, they went more towards Kelly's unsurprised demeanor and behavior than his silence. Additionally, the evidence of Kelly's guilt was substantial. Kelly was driving a car containing drugs and a scale. He fled the dealer's house and led police on an almost five-mile chase during which the drugs and scale were thrown from the car. The references to his post-arrest, pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence did not make his trial fundamentally unfair in light of this other evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We hold that Kelly opened the door to the State's presentation of evidence and argument related to his post-arrest, pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence and that the trial court did not commit fundamental error in admitting this evidence. We affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Chief Justice Rush and Justices Massa, Slaughter, and Goff concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Rush, C.J., and Massa, Slaughter and Goff, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
