He challenges the further amended judgment's attribution of income to him in connection with child support, property division, award of sole legal and physical custody of the parties' three children to the former wife (wife), and award of $ 100,000 in attorney's fees to the wife. We vacate the further amended judgment in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum and order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Attribution of income\n   </em>\n   . The judge made the following findings pertaining to the husband's work history. From May of 2006 to March of 2009, the husband worked as a portfolio manager and equity analyst for Fidelity Investments (Fidelity), earning approximately $ 600,000 per year (comprised of a $ 220,000 base salary and bonuses). In December of 2010, after being unemployed since March of 2009, the husband accepted a director of equity research position with Knight Capital (Knight), earning approximately $ 500,000 per year (comprised of a $ 200,000 base salary and bonuses). In August of 2013, after being laid off by Knight two months earlier, the husband accepted a senior equity analyst position with Baird Kailash (Baird), earning a $ 125,000 base salary with potential bonuses up to 125 percent. His total income in 2014 was $ 179,560. In June of 2016, shortly before the end of trial, the husband was laid off from Baird.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In concluding that attribution of income was warranted, the judge found that the husband had \"not made reasonable efforts to earn an income commensurate with his education, skills, employment history and prior earning level\" since serving the complaint for divorce on the wife in May of 2013. Specifically, the judge found the husband capable of earning $ 400,000 per year based on his \"compensation history,\" \"outstanding credentials,\" and \"promising employability.\" Given the husband's recent layoff from Baird, however, and his \"period of prolonged unemployment during the marriage,\" the judge attributed to him an annual income of $ 250,000 \"while [he] is unemployed\" and ordered him to pay weekly child support of $ 1,029.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The husband claims that it was an abuse of discretion to attribute income to him because he had recently been laid off and there was insufficient evidence of readily available positions at the attributed income level.

The judge also credited the expert's opinion that the husband's Baird compensation was too low in light of his qualifications and was more in line with a salary offered to a recent Harvard graduate. Conspicuously absent from the expert's testimony, however, is any indication that the husband was overqualified for his position at Baird.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Emery\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sturtevant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20502\">\n    91 Mass. App. Ct. 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 512 (2017) (reversing income attribution to husband who accepted substantially lower-paying position \"commensurate with his training and experience\" after extensive job search). Moreover, the expert testified that the type of upper-level equity analyst position appropriate for the husband is somewhat rare, admitting that there were no open positions at the time of trial and that in such a \"competitive field\" he \"can't predict when\" one might \"come up.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The relative scarcity of these positions is underscored by what the judge characterized as the husband's \"period of prolonged unemployment during the marriage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thus, though we see no error in the judge's determination that the husband is \"eminently\" qualified for a director-level equity analyst position earning upwards of $ 400,000 per year, it is unclear from this record if and when such a position will become available. The timing of the husband's layoff by Baird, shortly before trial ended, further muddies the waters. See\n   <em>\n    Flaherty\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Flaherty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1035627\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/40/289/#p290\">\n    40 Mass. App. Ct. 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290 (1996) (reversing attribution of income to husband who was recently laid off and \"was readying himself to seek new employment\"). Though the judge reduced the husband's attributed income to $ 250,000 in light of his sudden unemployment, the attribution was ultimately based on the judge's subsidiary findings regarding the husband's ability to secure a salary of at least $ 400,000. Furthermore, there was no evidence that there were available positions even at the $ 250,000 level when the husband was laid off from Baird, or that he had a meaningful opportunity to conduct a job search prior to the close of evidence. In these circumstances, while the judge \"was not required to point to a specific position or job opening\" when attributing income,\n   <em>\n    C.D.L\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276820\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/72/146/#p152\">\n    72 Mass.

We therefore must remand for further findings as to whether the husband exercised reasonable efforts, since his layoff from Baird, to secure employment commensurate with his education, training, and work history.

The husband argues that the judge improperly excluded from the asset division the wife's interests in her parents' estate and a life insurance policy insuring her father, and failed to properly account for a portion of the marital funds advances to the wife during the pendency of the divorce proceedings. \"In making an equitable division of the parties' property, the judge had available for distribution 'all or any part of the estate of the other.' \"\n   <em>\n    Heins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890257\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/422/477/#p485\">\n    422 Mass. at 483-484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting G.

L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. This was proper.

We disagree. The weight to be given to a particular \u00a7 34 factor is committed to the judge's sound discretion.

App. Ct. 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 430 (1993). The judge properly weighed the wife's expected inheritance against the husband's superior earning potential.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the judge declined to award alimony to the wife, despite the husband's superior earning potential, and noted that the expected inheritance would likely reduce any future alimony award.

App. Ct. 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761 (1989) (\"Alimony and equitable division are interrelated remedies\"). We see no abuse of discretion in the judge's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In contrast, the judge's stated basis for excluding the wife's interest in her father's life insurance policy was erroneous in part. The judge found it appropriate to exclude the policy \"particularly\" given the \"[w]ife's lack of title.\" The wife concedes that this was clear error, as the evidence showed that she coowns the policy with her sister. It also appears that the wife used marital funds to pay the policy premiums. The judge thus erred to the extent that she excluded the wife's interest in the policy based on her purported lack of title. See\n   <em>\n    Heins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890257\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/422/477/#p485\">\n    422 Mass. at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A party's 'estate' includes all property to which a party holds title, however acquired\"). As we are unable to discern whether the judge would have reached the same result if not for the error, remand is required on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Turning to whether the judge incorrectly accounted for the advances received by the wife during the pendency of the divorce proceedings, we conclude that remand is also required on this issue. In the further amended judgment, the judge accounted for one $ 75,000 advance received by the wife. The husband asserts that the wife received two $ 75,000 advances, as reflected by two separate orders (issued in June and August of 2014), each authorizing the wife to withdraw $ 75,000 from the parties' joint accounts for counsel fees. The wife asserts on the other hand that the second order merely released the funds previously authorized by the first order and did not actually result in a second advance. The record before us is unclear, and the judge's findings do not resolve the ambiguity. We therefore remand for clarification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Custody\n   </em>\n   .

The judge's decision to award the wife $ 100,000 in fees was \"due primarily to [the h]usband's overzealous posture during the discovery phase and his tendency to perseverate over minor issues throughout these proceedings and at trial, which combined to unnecessarily prolong this litigation.\" The judge found that the nine-day trial (originally scheduled as a two-day trial) was \"excessive ... [given] the issues in dispute\" and that \"the length of the time for the case to be tried was exacerbated by [the h]usband's actions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Furthermore, the judge found the fee award to be warranted given the contempt adjudication (on \"[c]omplaint for [c]ontempt filed April 7, 2014\") against the husband. In particular, the judge found the husband in contempt for utilizing $ 900,000 in marital funds to purchase a home, without obtaining the wife's permission or leave of court. Though the husband contends that the judge's findings relative to the contempt and his protraction of the litigation were clearly erroneous, we see nothing in the record that would compel us to disturb those findings, especially since they were rooted largely in the judge's own observation of the husband's conduct during the litigation.

The judge considered, among other things, the $ 250,000 in fees paid by the husband to his various attorneys, the \"scope and quality\" of the representation provided by the wife's counsel, the $ 300 hourly rate charged by the wife's counsel (which the judge found to be \"consistent with the market rate for family law practitioners of comparable skill and experience in eastern Massachusetts\"), and the husband's clear ability to pay the fee award \"given his current cash assets.\" Moreover, the judge declined to award the entire $ 160,000 in fees sought by the wife, concluding that \"$ 100,000 represents a fair assessment ... considering the expense necessary to litigate this matter in a reasonable manner.\" These findings were well within the judge's discretion.
