The trial judge granted a new trial, and a second jury returned a verdict for the defendant.

First, counsel argued that the jury should find for the plaintiffs because the defendant \"is a large corporation ... and they're going to go on. Tomorrow they're going to continue doing their business, their work, and they're looking at their bottom line.\" Though the judge sustained an objection from the defendant's counsel, the plaintiffs' counsel continued in a similar vein:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   \"But [Stiles] is going to go home and suffer and suffer and suffer for the rest of her life. She ... not only bought her groceries that day, but she bought pain and suffering for the rest of her life and misery for the rest of her life. And it's up to you to straighten this situation. She's one of your peers. You're her peers and she is your peer, and it is us against them.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As the judge found, these arguments were plainly \"intended [for] the jury to infer that Stiles was pitted against a large, wealthy corporation, and that the jury must rise to the occasion, right a corporate wrong, and ensure that [the defendant] pay Stiles.\" See\n   <em>\n    London\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bay State St. Ry. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"67565\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/231/480/#p485\">\n    231 Mass. 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 485-486 (1919) (summation warranted new trial because it \"was a covert appeal to the jury to make this great and powerful corporation ... feel the jury's power\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Second, the plaintiffs' counsel suggested that the defendant's counsel concealed evidence with the \"goal to confuse, deceive ... and mislead\" the jury. The defendant's counsel objected to this remark,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which the judge found was \"unsupported by the evidence\" and \"impermissibly invited the jury to speculate on whether [the defendant] had some collateral deceptive practices.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Third, on several occasions, the plaintiffs' counsel argued matters not in evidence. Most egregiously, counsel suggested that a judge in a different case had found the defendant liable for \"negligent inspection.\" The judge found that this comment was \"completely unsupported by any evidence at trial\" and \"improperly suggested that [the defendant's] conduct in the instant case was part of a pattern.\" Though there was no objection, the plaintiffs concede on appeal that the comment was a \"misstep.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs' counsel made several improper arguments concerning damages. For example, he argued that the jury should consider Stiles's future medical expenses and inflation even though, as the judge found, there was \"no evidence concerning future medical expenses\" and \"no expert testimony adducing evidence of future costs and inflation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Harlow\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882189\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/405/697/#p704\">\n    405 Mass. 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 704 (1989) (\"An argument concerning money damages indulging in significant references to numerical amounts that have no basis in the record is improper\");\n   <em>\n    Fyffe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239374\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/86/457/#p472\">\n    86 Mass.

Counsel also argued, with no supporting evidence, that Stiles would not receive any damages awarded by the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Now, this isn't money that she's going to get. It's the medical care providers. They have liens on this case, this case that you're going to decide. Liens, they're going to have to be repaid. Medicare or Medicaid, the healthcare providers, Mass Health, all of these people have liens ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Counsel returned to this theme shortly thereafter:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[I]f you award her 750,000, she's not going to wind up with 750,000 because the preparation of this trial, payment of the experts, payments of the lawyers, payment of the court fees --.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At this point the defendant's counsel interrupted with an objection, which the judge sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   These improper comments, taken together, support the judge's decision to grant a new trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the judge concluded, the comments were \"central to the issues before the jury,\" and the defendant's counsel lodged several objections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge further observed that she \"gave no curative or limiting instructions aimed at reducing the taint from the improper argument, and the jury charge did not adequately mitigate the errors.\" See\n   <em>\n    Torre\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Harris-Seybold Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3963272\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/9/660/#p665\">\n    9 Mass.

In addition, given the size of the damages award, the judge found that the improper argument likely affected the jury's deliberations.

Based on the evidence presented, a reasonable jury could have rejected this theory. First, the evidence permitted the jury to find that the puddle was not the cause of Stiles's fall. Stiles testified that she was around two feet away from the freezer case when she passed by it and that, after she fell, she did not see any wheel or slip marks in the puddle and did not have water on her clothes. Second, even assuming the jury found causation, the evidence permitted them to conclude that the defendant did not have sufficient notice of the water on the floor.

The store manager investigated the puddle and concluded that it did not come from the freezer case. The case had not leaked before, and everything in it was frozen on the day of the incident. Furthermore, during his walk through that morning, the manager did not see water leaking from the case. Stiles likewise testified that she did not see anything leaking from the case, and she admitted that she had no knowledge of how long the water was on the floor or whether the store was aware of it. This evidence supported the jury's verdict for the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    All references to \"Stiles\" are to Kathleen Stiles.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    While the transcript records the objection as \"[o]verruled,\" the judge wrote in her decision granting a new trial that she \"sustained\" the objection.
