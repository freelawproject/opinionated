When he was arrested a short time later, he was in possession of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana. He was subsequently convicted of Level 4 felony dealing in a narcotic drug and sentenced to a ten-year term of incarceration. On appeal, he contends (1) that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the State to strike the only African-American member of the venire (the \"potential juror\") from the jury, (2) the trial court abused its discretion in admitting certain evidence, (3) his rights protecting the prohibition against double jeopardy were violated, and (4) the evidence is insufficient to sustain his convictions. Concluding that trial court properly found that the State proffered a race-neutral reason for striking the potential juror from the jury; the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged evidence; Richardson was only convicted of one crime and, thus, was not subjected to double jeopardy; and the evidence is sufficient to sustain his conviction for Level 4 felony dealing in a narcotic drug, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   [2] On December 2, 2015, Burroughs was associating with Ciera Golay and Robert Thomas when she arranged to purchase heroin from Richardson. Burroughs arranged to purchase seven \"caps\" from Richardson for $ 10 per cap. A cap is about a tenth of a gram of heroin packaged in a clear capsule. Burroughs agreed to meet Richardson at a Village Pantry in Wayne County to complete the purchase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [3] Richardson arrived at the Village Pantry with his girlfriend Comfort Bair and one of Bair's friends. Bair was driving and Richardson was sitting in the backseat. When she arrived, Burroughs sat in the front passenger seat of the vehicle and gave Bair the money. Richardson gave Burroughs a \"hand full\" of caps, more than the seven they had discussed. Tr. Vol. I p. 124. Burroughs took the caps and returned to Golay's vehicle. Once in the vehicle, Burroughs told Golay to \"go\" because she \"knew the $ 50.00 bill\" that she had given to Bair \"was fake.\" Tr. Vol. I p. 127.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [4] Bair followed when Golay left the Village Pantry. The vehicles traveled \"erratically\" and at a high rate of speed. While Bair was following Golay, Department of Natural Resources Conservation Officer Grahm Selm received a dispatch\n   from the Union County Sheriff's Department that two white vehicles traveling southbound on State Road 27 were traveling at a high rate of speed, passing multiple vehicles at once, blocking oncoming traffic, and making the oncoming traffic go onto the shoulder. Officer Selm observed the two vehicles near Liberty and started following them. Both vehicles turned westbound onto State Road 44 towards Connersville. Officer Selm continued to follow the vehicles, at one point reaching 100 miles per hour. The vehicles were eventually stopped on 5th Street in Connersville by Connersville Police Officers, including Officer Brad Rosser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [5] Recognizing that his vehicle was about to be stopped by police, Richardson threw a baggie containing capsules of heroin and cocaine to Bair and instructed her to hide the drugs. Bair complied by putting the baggie containing the drugs \"inside\" her. Tr. Vol. I p. 151. Also at Richardson's instruction, Bair's friend put a baggie containing marijuana \"inside\" her. Tr. Vol. I p. 152.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [6] Once the vehicles had been stopped, Officer Rosser searched the vehicle in which Burroughs had been a passenger. During the search, he found a coat that had twenty-three capsules in the pocket. Subsequent testing revealed that the capsules contain heroin. After Bair was arrested and transported to the Fayette County Jail, she removed the baggie containing the capsules of heroin and cocaine from her vagina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [7] On December 4, 2015, the State charged Richardson with Level 2 felony dealing in a narcotic drug, Class A misdemeanor dealing in marijuana, and Class B misdemeanor visiting a common nuisance. Prior to trial, the State dismissed the dealing-in-marijuana and visiting-a-common-nuisance charges and amended the remaining dealing charge to a Level 3 felony. At the conclusion of trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts for the lesser-included offenses of Level 4 and Level 5 felony dealing in a narcotic. The trial court entered judgment on the Level 4 dealing charge and sentenced Richardson to a ten-year term of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Discussion and Decision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.

The first stage was therefore satisfied, and the burden then shifted to the State to present a race-neutral reason for striking the potential juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [13] As for the second stage, the record reveals that during voir dire, the potential juror indicated that she liked to read and watch television. When asked what she liked to read and watch, the potential juror indicated \"stories about the law.\" Tr. Vol. I p. 62. She indicated that she \"really like[d] Law &amp; Order\" and had \"seen every episode of Perry Mason.\" Tr. Vol. I p. 62. The potential juror then told the deputy prosecutor that she thought \"beyond [a] reasonable doubt\" meant \"[t]hat you have sufficient evidence to convince us that your case is bigger than the other persons in that this person is guilty.\" Tr. Vol. I p. 62. The deputy prosecutor responded by clarifying that the jurors \"will not be comparing cases ... [t]hats not how a criminal case works\" and informed the venire that she, as the State's representative, had the \"burden to prove each of the elements of the crime charged.\" Tr. Vol. I pp. 62, 63. In explaining her desire to strike the potential juror, the deputy prosecutor indicated that she observed the potential juror (1) enjoys reading and watching books and programs that are law-related, (2) to be aggressive and dominant, and (3) to have dominant body language. Defense counsel responded, stating \"Judge, (inaudible) her ethnicity (inaudible) uh, State proper reason uh, I think um, I don't have any other (inaudible).\" Tr. Vol. I p. 77. The State's reasons for striking the potential juror were facially valid and race neutral. Thus, the second stage was satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [14] Once the first and second stages had been satisfied, the issue proceeded to the third stage. Again, at this stage, the trial court evaluated the persuasiveness of the State's justification and considered whether the justification was valid or mere\n   pretext.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cartwright\n   </em>\n   , 962 N.E.2d at 1221. After considering the State's proffered justification, the trial court granted the State's request to strike the potential juror, stating, \"We'll note [defense counsel's] objection for the record and we'll find that the reasons articulated by the State are appropriate reasons for striking [potential juror] at this time.\" Tr. Vol. I p. 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [15] Upon review, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the State articulated a race-neutral reason for using a peremptory challenge to strike the potential juror from the jury. The potential juror indicated during voir dire that she had an interest in law-related books and television shows, and her enjoyment of these mediums may have left her with an inaccurate understanding of criminal proceedings. The potential juror's interest in law-related books and television shows has been found to be a permissible ground for the State's peremptory challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Farhane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4093861\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/127/#p157\">\n    634 F.3d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157-58 (2d Cir. 2011) (providing that it was plausible for the prosecutor to think that a juror who regularly watched television shows such as CSI might be more inclined to think that forensic evidence is necessary to prove guilty);\n   <em>\n    United States v. Murillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9440719\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/288/1126/#p1136\">\n    288 F.3d 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1136 (9th Cir. 2002) (finding that the juror's statement that Judge Judy was her favorite television show was a permissible ground for the prosecutor's peremptory challenge).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [16] Further, despite Richardson's claim to the contrary, when making its determination as to whether the State provided a race-neutral reason for striking the potential juror, the trial court was not required to make factual findings to support its reasoning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cartwright\n   </em>\n   , 962 N.E.2d at 1222 (providing that neither state nor federal law require a trial court to make explicit findings when deciding whether the State offered a race-neutral reason for striking a potential juror);\n   <em>\n    Blackmon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822992\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/47/1225/#p1234\">\n    47 N.E.3d at 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (indicating that the trial court is not required to make explicit findings every time the prosecution justifies a peremptory strike based on a juror's demeanor). The trial court made its ruling immediately following the parties' questioning of the potential juror during voir dire and its observations and memories of the potential juror's demeanor would have been fresh in the trial court's mind. Nothing in the record calls into question the deference owed to the trial court's evaluation of the demeanor of the individuals and parties appearing before it. Richardson has failed to establish error in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II. Admission of Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [17] \"We review the trial court's ruling on the admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Espinoza v.

Under the chain of custody doctrine, an adequate foundation is laid when the continuous whereabouts of an exhibit is shown from the time it came into the possession of the police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   To establish a proper chain of custody, the State must give reasonable assurances that the evidence remained in an undisturbed condition. However, the State need not establish a perfect chain of custody, and once the State strongly suggests the exact whereabouts of the evidence, any gaps go to the weight of the evidence and not to admissibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Moreover, there is a presumption of regularity in the handling of evidence by officers, and there is a presumption that officers exercise due care in handling their duties. To mount a successful challenge to the chain of custody, one must present evidence that does more than raise a mere possibility that the evidence may have been tampered with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8440881\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/859/375/#p381\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8440881\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/859/375/#p381\">\n    at 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [19] Richardson claims that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the challenged Exhibits because of a gap in the chain of custody of the evidence, thereby suggesting that the evidence may have been tampered with. Exhibit 3 was an evidence bag containing capsules of heroin that were found in the pocket of a coat recovered from Burroughs's vehicle. Officer Rosser collected the capsules at the scene, placed them in a tamper-proof evidence bag,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   sealed the bag, and filled out the necessary identifying information. Exhibit 6 was a white rock-like substance, which was subsequently determined to be 3.66 grams of cocaine, and Exhibit 7 was a number of capsules containing heroin. Exhibits 6 and 7 were recovered from Bair's person. Nancy Bohlander, a jail officer at the Fayette County Jail who observed Bair remove a bag containing the cocaine and the capsules from her person upon being booked into custody, placed the contraband in an evidence bag and gave it to Officer Rosser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [20] In challenging the chain of custody of Exhibits 3, 6, and 7, Richardson argues that the Exhibits were unaccounted for from April 10, 2017 to August 8, 2018. We disagree. The following dates detail the custody chain of the challenged Exhibits:\n  </p>\n  <opinion class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-33\">\n   December 2, 2015 Officer Rosser deposited Exhibits 3, 6, and 7 into a secure storage in the evidence room of the Connersville Police Department (\"the Department\"). The Exhibits were subsequently logged into the evidence room by the Department's evidence custodian and continued to be stored in the secure evidence room. April 10, 2017 Exhibits 3 and 6 were transported and relinquished to the Indiana State Police (\"ISP\") Lab for testing. June 2, 2017 Exhibits 3 and 6 were returned to the Department and placed in the evidence room. June 2, 2017 Exhibit 7 was transported and relinquished to the ISP Lab for testing. July 7, 2017 Exhibit 7 was returned to the Department and placed in the evidence room. August 8, 2018 Exhibits 3, 6, and 7 were removed from evidence room for court and returned the same day. August 13, 2018 Exhibits 3, 6, and 7 were removed from the evidence room for court.\n  </opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [21] The record demonstrates that the Exhibits were placed in the Department's evidence room on December 2, 2015. The Exhibits remained in the evidence room until being sent to the ISP Lab for testing. Once testing was complete, the Exhibits were returned to the evidence room. The Exhibits then remained in the Department's evidence room until being removed for trial. The technician who tested the Exhibits at the ISP Lab testified that the Exhibits appeared in the same condition as on the day when she concluded her testing. The record does not include any gaps in the chain of custody for Exhibits 3, 6, or 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [22] Moreover, even if Richardson had been able to establish some gap in the chain of custody, his challenge to the admission of the Exhibits fails. Again, to mount a successful challenge to the chain of custody, Richardson was required to present evidence that does more than raise a mere possibility that the evidence may have been tampered with.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8440881\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/859/375/#p381\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He did not do so.

Double Jeopardy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [23] Both the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 14 of the Indiana Constitution provide that no one shall be put in jeopardy\n   <em>\n    twice\n   </em>\n   for the same offense. (Emphasis added). Richardson claims that he was convicted of both Level 4 felony and Level 5 felony dealing and that because these convictions punished him for the same offense, punishment for both \"inherently violates [his] rights to be free from double jeopardy.\" Appellant's Br. p. 25. While the original sentencing order did reference convictions for both Level 4 felony dealing and Level 5 felony dealing, both the trial court's amended sentencing order and the abstract of judgment indicate that Richardson was convicted of only the Level 4 felony dealing charge. Given that Richardson was convicted of only one count of Level 4 felony dealing, his double jeopardy claim fails, as he was not punished twice for his actions in violation of Article I, Section 14 or the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    While markings on the evidence bag indicated that it contained twenty-one capsules, Exhibit 4, which depicted the contents of Exhibit 3 together with the other items recovered from the coat shows twenty-three capsules. Considering Exhibits 3 and 4 together with the evidence that the bag was sealed and did not appear to have been tampered with and Officer Rosser's acknowledgment that it was possible that he miscounted the capsules when he logged the evidence, one may reasonably assume that the indication that the bag contained only twenty-one capsules was a scrivener's error and that the bag actually contained twenty-three capsules.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    IV. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    [24] When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, appellate courts must consider only the probative evidence and reasonable inferences supporting the verdict. It is the fact-finder's role, not that of appellate courts, to assess witness credibility and weigh the evidence to determine whether it is sufficient to support a conviction. To preserve this structure, when appellate courts are confronted with conflicting evidence, they must consider it most favorably to the trial court's ruling. Appellate courts affirm the conviction unless no reasonable fact-finder could find the elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. It is therefore not necessary that the evidence overcome every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. The evidence is sufficient if an inference may reasonably be drawn from it to support the verdict.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <em>\n     Drane v.
