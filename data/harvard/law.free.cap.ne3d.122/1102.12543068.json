He appeals, claiming that the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty, and in admitting evidence at trial. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . At approximately 5:30 A . M . on April 21, 2014, Debra Sarno was driving northbound on the Zakim Bridge in Boston when she experienced a flat tire on her vehicle. With no breakdown lane available to pull over into, she stopped her vehicle in the right lane and activated her hazard lights. Sarno was the sole occupant of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Over the next several minutes, more than twenty vehicles in the right lane merged into the left lane as they approached Sarno's vehicle to avoid a collision. This included small cars, as well as school buses, tractor trailers, and other trucks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   That morning, Maldonado was driving a sixty-foot tractor trailer carrying approximately 26,000 pounds of cargo. He drove through the O'Neill Tunnel and emerged northbound onto the Zakim Bridge, where he collided with Sarno's vehicle. Both vehicles caught fire, ultimately resulting in Sarno's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Negligence\n   </em>\n   .

The evidence demonstrates that Maldonado was able to see at least a few hundred feet in front of him, albeit in relative darkness. Although he had several seconds in which he could have employed his brakes, he failed to do so until the split second prior to hitting Sarno's vehicle. The jury could thus have found that, rather than attempting to slow down or move over, he was inattentive in the critical seconds leading up to the collision, which left him with an inadequate amount of time to switch lanes and avoid hitting Sarno's vehicle as other vehicles had done.

Although there was testimony that Maldonado looked in his driver's side mirror to see if it was clear to change lanes, the jury could have chosen not to believe this, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"385095\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/394/77/#p83\">\n    394 Mass. 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83 (1985), or that he checked too late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The evidence presented at trial was enough to warrant the jury's finding \"that the defendant, without justification or excuse, had not been attentive to the road in front of him during the crucial period when his truck was approaching the victim .... In these circumstances, the jury could properly conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, ... that the defendant was negligent.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"859153\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/60/685/#p691\">\n    60 Mass.

App. Ct. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173 (1983). Maldonado claims that the reconstruction videotape was unfairly dissimilar to the actual events at the time the incident took place, and that the dissimilarities favored the Commonwealth. \"Whether the conditions were sufficiently similar to make the observation [offered by the demonstration] of any value in aiding the jury to pass upon the issue submitted to them [is] primarily for the trial judge to determine as a matter of discretion. [The judge's] decision in this respect will not be interfered with unless plainly wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Chipman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"480505\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/418/262/#p270\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"480505\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/418/262/#p270\">\n    at 270-271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Field\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gowdy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3498327\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/199/568/#p574\">\n    199 Mass. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574 (1908).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Here, the reconstruction videotape consisted of State Trooper Joel Balducci driving the route Maldonado took in the seconds leading up to the collision. The videotape depicted the view Maldonado had of the road in front of him when he came out of the O'Neill Tunnel onto the Zakim Bridge. The videotape was taken in clear weather, and Trooper Balducci drove approximately the same speed as Maldonado had driven. Although the videotape was taken more than two years after the accident, the bridge remained unchanged during that time. The videotape was taken midday, while the accident occurred at dawn and, therefore, in different lighting conditions. However, we agree with the Commonwealth that the lighting in the reconstruction videotape favored the defendant rather than causing him any prejudice because it essentially blinded the viewer of the line of sight coming out of the tunnel for the entire portion of the videotape until the viewer emerged onto the bridge. Finally, there were no vehicles in front of Trooper Balducci's cruiser, giving him a clear view of the road, which Maldonado claims was not representative of his view because there were vehicles in front of him. Even so, the judge was within his discretion in finding that the videotape portrayed useful additional information to the fact finder as to the line of sight coming out of the tunnel onto the Zakim Bridge, and that the differences in the videotape did not prejudice Maldonado. There was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
