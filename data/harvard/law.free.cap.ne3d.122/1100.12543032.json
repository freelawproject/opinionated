He argues that the motion judge erred in denying his motion to suppress those items, which he argued were the fruits of (1) a search of an apartment pursuant to an invalid warrant, (2) a seizure of his person without reasonable suspicion, and (3) an unlawful warrantless search of a plastic bag he dropped during his encounter with police. We reject these arguments and therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We recite certain background facts found by the motion judge after an evidentiary hearing, reserving other findings for later discussion. The defendant does not argue that any of the judge's findings were clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Boston police officers in plain clothes were executing a search warrant for firearms in the second floor apartment of a three-family residence in Dorchester. After they found a firearm, they heard a knock at the apartment door. They opened the door and saw the defendant standing on the second floor landing with a plastic bag under his left arm. After a brief conversation, the defendant ran down the stairs, and the officers pursued him. At the bottom of the stairs, the defendant dropped the bag and continued down the hall toward the front door. The officers caught up with him and grabbed him at the door; they restrained him on the front porch. A detective then returned to where the bag had been dropped, looked inside it, and found a firearm and ammunition. The defendant was arrested, tried, and convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Fruit of invalid apartment search\n   </em>\n   . The defendant argues that the seized items must be suppressed because they are the fruits of a search of the apartment pursuant to a warrant that was issued without probable cause. We disagree. A panel of this court, in an unpublished decision, has already rejected the same attack on the same warrant.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Solomon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12550592,12550593,12550594,12550595,12550598,12550599,12550600,12550601,12550602,12550603,12550604,12550605,12550606,12550607,12550608,12550609,12550610,12550623,12550626,12550627\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/92/1107/\">\n    92 Mass. App. Ct. 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). The panel, concluding that there was probable cause to issue the warrant, reversed the allowance of motions to suppress items found in the apartment itself, filed by the apartment's resident (Carnell Solomon) and his brother (Cartrell Solomon). Assuming without deciding that the defendant remains free to challenge the warrant on the same grounds already rejected by the\n   <em>\n    Solomon\n   </em>\n   panel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   we agree with the reasoning of that panel's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   There is an additional, independent reason for upholding the search as to this defendant. Under the attenuation doctrine, the firearm and ammunition seized in the front common hallway were not fruits of the apartment search and therefore would not have to be suppressed even if the warrant were called into question. \"The attenuation doctrine provides an exception to the exclusionary rule under which evidence obtained by police as a result of an unlawful search need not be excluded if the connection between the illegal search and the evidence is so attenuated as to dissipate any taint of illegality.\"\n   <em>\n    Commmonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Long\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462693\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/526/#p536\">\n    476 Mass. 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 536 (2017), citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fredette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"898115\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/396/455/#p458\">\n    396 Mass. 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 458-463 (1985). \"The theory of dissipation of the taint attempts to determine the point of diminishing returns at which the detrimental consequences of illegal police action become so attenuated that the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule no longer justifies its costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Long\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462693\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/526/#p536\">\n    476 Mass. at 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

By pure happenstance, while the police were executing the search warrant, the defendant knocked on the apartment door, holding the bag under his left arm. After the officers opened the door and saw the defendant standing on the landing, they engaged in what the judge found was \"a casual conversation in the nature of asking each other, 'What's up?' \" When a detective identified himself and his colleague as police officers searching the apartment, the defendant stopped making eye contact, \"stuttered\" that he was at the apartment to visit his brother, and \"bladed\" the left side of his body away from the officers as if to conceal the bag.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The detective asked the defendant his name, at which point the defendant ran down the stairs \"at a full sprint.\" The officers pursued him. At the bottom of the stairs, the defendant dropped the bag and continued down the hall toward the front door. After the officers restrained him on the front porch, the detective returned to the bag and found the firearm and ammunition inside it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On these facts, the defendant's \"fortuitous appearance\" outside the apartment \"was an independent intervening circumstance neither sought nor procured by the police.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"65597\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/58/12/#p14\">\n    58 Mass.

Here, as a matter of logic, the police did not search the apartment for the purpose of obtaining the evidence that the defendant later chose to drop in the downstairs hall. Nor did the police have any reason to think that the warrant to search the apartment might be invalid. Moreover, they \"did not confront the [defendant] with [any] illegally obtained evidence in order to coerce\" him to flee and drop the bag,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462693\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/526/#p536\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462693\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/526/#p536\">\n    at 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or otherwise \"exploit[ ]\" the search of the apartment in order to discover the firearm and ammunition in the dropped bag.\n   <em>\n    Fredette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"898115\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/396/455/#p458\">\n    396 Mass. at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Wong Sun\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450611\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/471/#p488\">\n    371 U.S. 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488 (1963).

The defendant next argues for suppression on the ground that he was seized at the moment he began to run down the stairs with the police in pursuit and that, at that moment, they lacked reasonable suspicion for the seizure. We disagree. As the judge concluded, \"[T]he defendant was not seized for constitutional purposes until after he dropped the bag and was attempting to leave the building,\" at which time the police had a reasonable suspicion that he had possessed an illegal firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In determining the precise moment at which a seizure in the constitutional sense occurred, we ask whether, in view of all of the circumstances, a reasonable person would have believed that he was free to leave.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817062\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/308/#p310\">\n    449 Mass. 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 310-311 (2007).

The police pursuit did not objectively indicate to the defendant that he was not free to leave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude, as did the judge, that the seizure did not occur when the defendant fled down the stairs, or when the police responded by pursuing him, but instead when they physically restrained him after he dropped the bag and was attempting to leave the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By that time, if not before, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the defendant had illegally possessed a firearm. This suspicion arose from a combination of the defendant's abrupt change in demeanor when the police identified themselves and their purpose for being in the apartment; his \"blading\" of his body, in a manner that made the trained officer suspect him of attempting to conceal a firearm in the bag under his arm;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and his sudden flight \"at a full sprint\" when the police asked his name.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the officers had just recovered a firearm in the apartment; they knew that, on past occasions, police had previously responded to the same address for \"shots fired\"; and they had made arrests for firearms and drugs in the area. See\n   <em>\n    Shane S.\n   </em>\n   , 92 Mass. App. Ct. at 323 (that area where seizure occurred had been scene of previous firearm incidents was factor supporting reasonable suspicion).
