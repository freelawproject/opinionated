He appeals, claiming that the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty on the charge of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   A conviction of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon pursuant to G.

After his girl friend was naked, the defendant began to accuse her of cheating on him and referred to her as a \"skank\" and a \"bitch.\" He stated he \"was going to sew up [her] pussy.\" He then took a hypodermic needle out of the bedside table drawer and pressed it against his girl friend's vaginal lip, terrifying her and causing her \"pain[ ].\" He held her down, while she tried to pull away from him. He locked the bedroom door and refused to let her leave until she performed oral sex on him, while continuing to threaten her.

The defendant argues that the Commonwealth failed to establish that the victim did sustain the requisite degree of harm.
