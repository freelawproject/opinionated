The majority grants attorney fees in the amount of $32,624.98. I would award $31,167.43. Because the respondent, Kent State University, disputes the amount of Kesterson's request, and because this court is denying some of the attorney fees Kesterson seeks, the majority should address Kent State's arguments and explain its decision. As it does in any other case, a written opinion promotes confidence in the parties and the public that this court's result is the product of reasoned analysis; also, a written opinion provides precedential guidance to future parties facing similar issues. Our jurisprudence in the area of attorney-fee calculation is fairly murky and would benefit from further illumination. Therefore, below is an explanation regarding the amount of attorney fees I would award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Subodh Chandra was counsel of record, but Ashlie Case Sletvold did the majority of work in litigating the cases, and partner Donald Screen prepared the combined reply brief. On January 9, 2019, Kesterson submitted a combined petition for attorney fees in the amount of $35,578.66 for the work of Chandra, Sletvold, and Screen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 5}\n   </strong>\n   Kesterson attached 12 exhibits to her petition, including affidavits from each attorney who billed time on the case, as well as two itemized billing logs of the hours expended by her attorneys.2 Each time entry contains an itemized description of the work performed, reported in tenths of an hour.

Lastly, the petition indicates that counsel has reduced by 50 percent the time entries for Screen to prepare the reply brief, which he was \"enlisted to complete due to Ms. Sletvold's workload during the limited time frame to complete that project over the holidays in December 2017.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

However, there is a discrepancy with Sletvold's rate. In her affidavit, Sletvold asserts that her hourly rate in 2018 was $400 but also asserts that her hourly rate in 2016 and 2017 was $375. In the fee application, Sletvold billed all of her time at an hourly rate of $400, but the bulk of the work in the underlying cases was done in 2016 and 2017. I would apply the $375 hourly rate to the work Sletvold did in 2016 and 2017 and the $400 hourly rate to the work she did in 2018 and 2019; those rates for Sletvold are reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Kent State argues that some of the hours expended on these cases were excessive or unnecessary. Despite the noted reductions in the total hours expended to litigate these cases, the itemized billing records do include a small number of entries that are unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Hours expended on the merits of the case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Kesterson has provided this court with detailed documentation of the hours her counsel expended, supported by the affidavits of the three attorneys who billed time. Her petition and the supporting evidence demonstrate that counsel have made a good-faith effort to exclude excessive, redundant, or unnecessary hours and that overall, counsel exercised sound billing judgment. For instance, Sletvold attests that she \"did not record all time spent conferring with my firm colleagues or with our client regarding the matter\" and has \"removed 31.9 hours of attorney time and law-clerk time, leaving 73.8 attorney hours for which we are seeking reimbursement.\" Included in the time Sletvold voluntarily removed were \"hours spent dealing with technical issues encountered with e-filing Ms. Kesterson's presentation of evidence * * * as well as time invested in conducting discovery that we were unable to submit due to those technical difficulties.\" Sletvold also applied a 50 percent reduction to the hours expended by Screen, who drafted the reply brief \"[g]iven the press of [Sletvold's] other work obligations\" at that time. Sletvold \"further discounted * * * the remaining time given the [c]ourt's conclusion that two of the 24 individual requests * * * were properly denied as overbroad.\" As those two requests accounted for 8.3 percent of the total requests, Kesterson's counsel subtracted 8.3 percent of the total hours worked prior to the announcement of our December 20, 2018 decisions from the bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Counsel's exercise of billing judgment has made this court's task less difficult. Comparing the itemized billing records to Sletvold's attestations demonstrates that, in general, she voluntarily reduced the attorney-fee award sought beyond what was arguably necessary.\n   <em>\n    See Hensley\n   </em>\n   at 440 (admonishing that hours spent on an unsuccessful claim should be disallowed only when it \"is distinct in all respects from [the] successful claims\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Nonetheless, Kent State argues that some of the hours expended on these cases were excessive or unnecessary. And despite the noted reductions in the total hours Kesterson's attorneys expended to litigate these cases, the itemized billing records do include entries that are unreasonable. Specifically, Sletvold recorded 2.8 hours for drafting the complaint in case No. 2016-0615 (\n   <em>\n    Kesterson I\n   </em>\n   ) and 2.3 hours for drafting the complaint in case No. 2016-1123 (\n   <em>\n    Kesterson II\n   </em>\n   ). However, most of the complaint in case No. 2016-1123 appears to have been lifted verbatim from the complaint filed in case No. 2016-0615. Moreover, in both cases, Sletvold billed time to draft the initial records request, which she then appears to have simply copied and pasted into the complaints. Billing for the duplication of effort is most egregious in case No. 2016-1123: Sletvold billed 2.7 hours to draft the public-records request in addition to the 2.3 hours expended on the complaint, which was in large part lifted verbatim from the complaint filed in case No. 2016-0615. Accordingly, the amount of time Sletvold claims to have spent drafting the complaints is unreasonable and excessive and should be reduced. A reduction is consistent with the Prof.Cond.R. 1.5(a)(1) factor of \"the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly\"-here, in these limited instances, the apparent copying and pasting of complaint material was a repetitive task that did not require a sophisticated skillset. It should not have taken the amount of time allocated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Kent State argues that the court should disallow or \"deeply discount[]\" the four hours that Sletvold billed for travel to Columbus for mediation. This objection is unconvincing-had Kent State properly responded to Kesterson's public-records requests in the first place, the litigation would not have been necessary. Kent State points to\n   <em>\n    Woods v. Willis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026291\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/981/700/\">\n    981 F.Supp.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.Ohio 2013) for the proposition that travel time is not reimbursable.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026291\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/981/700/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026291\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/981/700/\">\n    at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Time spent traveling is not, in my view, reimbursable\").

Sletvold.\" I would disallow that time for lack of relevant detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Still, generally I would, like the majority, grant Kesterson the bulk of her requested attorney fees. An important factor in establishing the reasonableness of the fees is Prof.Cond.R. 1.5(a)(4), in which we consider \"the amount involved and the results obtained.\" Kesterson's lawyers, in the end and through consistent effort, got Kesterson almost everything she sought in her records request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Hours expended on fee petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Under R.C. 149.43(C)(2)(c), \"[r]easonable attorney's fees shall include reasonable fees incurred to produce proof of the reasonableness and amount of the fees and to otherwise litigate entitlement to the fees.\" Accordingly, the petition requests attorney fees for the 14.2 hours that Chandra and Sletvold claim to have expended in preparing the fee petition and its exhibits.4\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The plain language of R.C. 149.43(C)(2)(c) requires only that the attorney fees claimed for producing and supporting a fee petition be reasonable. Here, the 14.2 hours billed for preparing the fee petition are equivalent to approximately 18 percent of the total time, 77.4 hours, billed for the merits case. Kesterson's counsel not only drafted a ten-page fee petition but also prepared four attorney affidavits, two highly detailed itemized billing charts, and several additional exhibits to support the fee application. Kent State asserts that \"while no particular entry [in Kesterson's billing chart] is necessarily out of line with any other, the totality of the billing is indicative of Relator's overcomplicated approach to this straightforward public records litigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The burden is squarely on Kesterson to demonstrate that the hours expended in preparing the fee petition were reasonable. This is another instance in which a limited application of the factors in Prof.Cond.R. 1.5(a)(1) is in order. Here, the whole of the fee-application preparation did not require expert legal knowledge or attention to difficult questions, and not every task required the time and labor spent by attorneys charging $400 or more per hour:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"It is appropriate to distinguish between legal work, in the strict sense, and investigation, clerical work, compilation of facts and statistics and other work which can often be accomplished by non-lawyers but which a lawyer may do because he has no other help available.

There is little detail about how much of that time was spent writing the argument versus the time spent preparing charts and exhibits. An unknown portion of those more administrative tasks could have been performed by a nonlawyer. Accordingly, without some explanation from Kesterson's attorneys as to the reasonableness of the time entries regarding the preparation of the fee application in Exhibit 1C, reductions are appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Calculation of the initial estimate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Based on the foregoing, with respect to the merits, I would disallow the 2.3 hours Sletvold recorded to draft the complaint for case No. 2016-1123 and the .3 hours entered for the ill-explained insurance discussion on October 31, 2016. For Sletvold's work in 2016 and 2017, I would allow a rate of $375 per hour, and for 2018, $400 per hour. With regard to the merits, this would result in awarding Kesterson the following fees: $20,823.33 for Sletvold (56.6 hours at $375/hour, but subject to the firm's self-imposed 8.3 percent discount [totaling $19,463.33] plus another 3.4 hours at $400/hour submitted with the fee-application-preparation bill but dealing with merit issues that arose after this court's opinions were released and which therefore were not subject to the 8.3 percent discount [totaling $1,360]); $650.20 for Chandra (1.2 hours at $500/hour subject to the 8.3 percent discount [$550.20] plus another .2 hours at $500/hour not subject to the 8.3 percent discount [$100]); and $6,143.90 for Screen (13.4 hours at $500/hour, less the 8.3 percent discount). The aggregate award therefore is $27,617.43 for the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 26} As for the hours expended in preparing the fee petition, I would disallow the following entries in Kesterson's billing chart: 1.3 hours to \"review billing records to isolate public-records/mandamus work for fee petition,\" an administrative task; 3.0 hours for two entries for \"continue[d] drafting of fee petition and supporting materials,\" for lack of detail regarding time spent on argument versus time spent on preparation of exhibits; and 1.1 hours for \"revisions to draft fee petition * * * and [to] transmit to D. McTigue for analysis and opinion,\" for lack of detail in distinguishing legal work from an administrative task. Therefore, I would subtract 5.4 hours from the 14.2 hours claimed for the fee petition and award the following fees: $3,400 for Sletvold (8.5 hours at $400/hour); and $150 for Chandra (.3 hours at $500/hour). The aggregate award would be $3,550 for work on the fee petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Therefore, the total attorney-fee calculation before considering any further deduction would be $31,167.43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

The fee application contained separate time entries for each task, with the time expended on each task denoted in tenths of an hour. The propriety of the application was supported by independent evidence in the form of an affidavit from another attorney familiar with the practice area. I have quibbles with only a few of the entries. The greater part of my divergence from the majority's award can be attributed to Sletvold's billing rate; I would apply her 2016 and 2017 hourly rate of $375 to work she performed in those years. Subtracting the relevant amounts from the figure Kesterson seeks in her fee application, I would award $31,167.43 in attorney fees.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
