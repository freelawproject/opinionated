L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) (1) (OUI). He was sentenced to one year of probation, with a forty-five day loss of license, and also was ordered to enroll in the program required by G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24D. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty and that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction.

On January 22, 2016, at approximately 2 A.M. , Officer Shawn Matthews of the Revere police department was working on Square Road in the vicinity of the Squire Exotic Night Club in Revere.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Matthews was checking license plates against information from the registry of motor vehicles, looking for individuals with arrest warrants or suspended drivers' licenses. In so doing, he learned that the owner of a particular car had a suspended driver's license. When the defendant left the club, entered that car, and drove out of the club parking lot, Matthews stopped him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Matthews approached the car and immediately smelled a \"strong odor of alcoholic beverage.\" The defendant was the driver and the only person in the car. He asked the officer, \"What the fuck did you pull me over for?\" Matthews also observed that the defendant was slurring his speech and having difficulty pronouncing \"even the most basic words.\" Matthews asked if he had been drinking and the defendant stated he had \"three to four drinks.\" Matthews asked the defendant to perform two field sobriety tests and the defendant failed both.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Matthews then arrested the defendant for OUI. The defendant responded, \"Fuck you, I've only had four drinks. I'm a little drunk. So fuckin' what?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"In evaluating whether the evidence at trial was sufficient to support [the defendant's conviction], we 'view the evidence presented in the Commonwealth's case-in-chief in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and ask whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.'\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145073\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/458/#p461\">\n    470 Mass. 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 461 (2015), citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Latimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p677\">\n    378 Mass. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677 (1979).
