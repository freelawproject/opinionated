We conclude that collateral estoppel bars Ogaldez's claims, as issues essential to her success on those claims were previously litigated and decided adversely against her by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) and the Department of Labor Relations (DLR).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ogaldez was employed as a correction officer from 1998 to 2013. On September 4, 2012, another correction officer, Rigabaut Aime, asked Ogaldez to be a witness to a dispute he was having with defendant Brian Foley. Later that day Foley reported Ogaldez for not following orders to return to her post. One week later the DOC placed Ogaldez on detachment leave with pay pending an investigation of the report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On or around September 28, 2012, Ogaldez filed a charge with the DLR, alleging that the DOC retaliated against her for acting on Aime's request that she witness his interaction with Foley. In March of 2013, while the DLR case was still pending, the DOC concluded its investigation of Foley's report, found the insubordination charges justified, and terminated Ogaldez's employment. Ogaldez then appealed that decision to the CSC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Both the CSC and the DLR conducted full adjudicatory hearings on Ogaldez's claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In July of 2014, the CSC issued a decision finding that Foley credibly testified that Ogaldez twice refused to follow his orders on September 4, 2012, that \"Ogaldez's conduct constitutes substantial misconduct,\" and that she \"was not treated in a disparate manner\" given her \"extensive\" disciplinary record, which included five reports of insubordination. In May of 2015, a DLR hearing officer issued a decision finding that the DOC did not retaliate against Ogaldez by placing her on detachment leave. Ogaldez filed an administrative appeal, and the Commonwealth Employment Relations Board affirmed the hearing officer's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The doctrine of issue preclusion bars relitigation of an issue where \"(1) there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior adjudication; (2) the party against whom preclusion is asserted was a party (or in privity with a party) to the prior adjudication; and (3) the issue in the prior adjudication was identical to the issue in the current adjudication\" and was \"essential to the earlier judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Tuper\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    North Adams Ambulance Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651266\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/428/132/#p134\">\n    428 Mass. 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 134-135 (1998). All of these elements are met here and operate to bar Ogaldez from relitigating issues that are essential to her current claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   First, the CSC and the DLR decisions constitute final judgments on the merits. \"[A] final order of an administrative agency in an adjudicatory proceeding ... precludes relitigation of the same issues between the same parties, just as would a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651266\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/428/132/#p134\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651266\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/428/132/#p134\">\n    at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Stowe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bologna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3905616\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/415/20/#p22\">\n    415 Mass. 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22 (1993).

See\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saint-Gobain Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5541953\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/507/23/#p31\">\n    507 F.3d 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"Actionable discrimination cannot exist in a vacuum. Rather, the discriminatory intent of which [an employee] complains must be traceable to the person or persons who made the decision to fire [her]\"). The complaint, however, raises no allegations supporting an inference that the commissioner's decision was motivated by discriminatory reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though Ogaldez alleges that Foley treated her in a disparate manner -- for example, by denying her vacation time \"but approv[ing] a white male officer for the same date,\" and by \"assign[ing her] to the same floor for every shift, while all the male officers were rotated\" -- both the complaint and the CSC's decision establish that the commissioner, not Foley, was the one who made the decision to terminate Ogaldez's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To be sure, \"[w]here 'the decision makers relied on the recommendations of supervisors [whose motives have been impugned], the motives of the supervisors should be treated as the motives for the decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Bulwer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mount Auburn Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802483\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/672/#p688\">\n    473 Mass. 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 688 (2016), quoting\n   <em>\n    Trustees of Forbes Library\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Labor Relations Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934251\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/384/559/#p569\">\n    384 Mass. 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 569-570 (1981). Ogaldez's allegation that Foley fabricated his report for retaliatory or discriminatory reasons is relevant in this respect. But both the CSC and the DLR have already decided this issue against Ogaldez. The CSC -- which has the duty to adjudicate whether an employer's action was based on \"any factor or conduct on the part of the employee not reasonably related to the fitness of the employee to perform in his position,\" G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 -- found \"Foley more credible than Ogaldez and that a preponderance of the evidence support[ed his] report that he issued two orders to [Ogaldez] on the night of her shift on September 4, 2012 and that she failed to obey his orders.\" See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1 (\"Basic merit principles\" include \"assuring fair treatment of all ... employees in all aspects of personnel administration without regard to ... race, color, ... [or] sex\"). The DLR -- which has the duty to adjudicate whether an employer retaliated against an employee for engaging in a protected activity, see G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7\u00a7 10 - 11 -- found that Ogaldez failed to meet her burden of proving that she was placed on detachment leave in retaliation for her participation in the incident concerning Aime. These findings preclude Ogaldez from relitigating whether Foley fabricated his report and, as a consequence, from establishing that the commissioner's decision rested on the recommendation of a supervisor with unlawful motives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ogaldez's third claim, that the DOC retaliated against her for filing complaints with the MCAD and the DLR, fails to rise above the level of speculation. Ogaldez alleges only that she filed the complaints on September 28, 2012, and that the DOC terminated her employment less than six months later. But as the CSC found, Ogaldez had a long disciplinary history dating back to 2002. Moreover, Foley issued his report before Ogaldez filed any of her complaints. In these circumstances, the mere fact that the DOC terminated Ogaldez's employment after the filing of the complaints is insufficient to establish a plausible claim of retaliation.
