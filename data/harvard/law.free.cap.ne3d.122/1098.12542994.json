Tumultuous behavior, for purposes of the offense of disorderly conduct, can include the refusal to obey a police order. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marcavage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836210\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/76/34/#p38\">\n    76 Mass. App. Ct. 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38 (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Latimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p677\">\n    378 Mass. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677 (1979), a rational trier of fact could have found the following facts. The defendant was part of an unruly crowd of loud, agitated, and intoxicated individuals who were on the street, obstructing traffic, at 2 A . M . Multiple police officers, including Boston police Officer Edwin Lopez, formed a police line and commanded the crowd to move out of the street. Although the defendant initially moved backwards, thereafter he rapidly approached the officers in an aggressive manner as Lopez assisted another officer who was arresting a different individual. As Lopez turned toward the direction from which a punch to his face had come, he saw the defendant nearby, being grabbed by the other officer. This evidence was sufficient to permit a trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's conduct was disorderly. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Marcavage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836210\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/76/34/#p38\">\n    76 Mass. App. Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   38 ;\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sinai\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"480141\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/47/544/#p548\">\n    47 Mass. App. Ct. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 548-549 (1999). Furthermore, this same evidence is sufficient to permit a trier of fact reasonably to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk of public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm. See\n   <em>\n    Feigenbaum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"484640\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/404/471/#p474\">\n    404 Mass. at 474-475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    In-court identification by officer who assisted in arresting defendant\n   </em>\n   . The defendant's objection to Lopez's in-court identification fares no better because the identification falls squarely within the \"good reason\" exception as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Crayton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144342\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/228/\">\n    470 Mass. at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lopez witnessed the defendant's conduct that gave rise to the charge and identified the defendant as the individual he had arrested and transported to the station in relation to that charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Of course, the Commonwealth should have filed a motion in limine seeking permission to admit Lopez's identification testimony,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144342\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/228/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 243 ; however, the defendant was not prejudiced.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144342\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/228/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144342\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/228/\">\n    at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The issue was fully aired before the in-court identification was permitted, and the judge properly held that there was good reason to allow it, as set forth\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    At the conclusion of the Commonwealth's case, the judge allowed the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty on the charge of assault and battery on a police officer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
