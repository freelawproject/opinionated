Plaintiffs-appellees are Collin and Catherine Burchard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The following facts are as alleged in appellees' amended complaint filed September 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Board operates Dale Roy School in Ashland, Ohio, a school for disabled individuals from age 3 to age 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Collin Burchard is 19 years old, developmentally disabled, and was a student at Dale Roy School. Collin has a history of seizures, strokes, and an inability to regulate body heat. Appellees contend Dale Roy School was aware of these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On or around August 25, 2016, the temperature was 90 degrees with high humidity. In gym class, Collin participated in \"activities which caused substantial injuries due to overexposure to heat and exertion.\" Although an aide \"noted something was wrong with Collin,\" the aide did not seek medical attention. Collin's participation in gym class and performance of the activities which led to over-exposure to heat were contrary to his Individualized Education Plan (\"IEP\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} At the end of the school day, Collin was transported home by Dale Roy in a vehicle with no air conditioning. The bus aide noted Collin's eyes appeared glassed over and Collin was unusually quiet. At home, Collin's mother's fianc\u00e9 observed Collin in distress and called 911. Collin was transported to Wooster Memorial Hospital and then to the Cleveland Clinic for treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The former Director of Education for Dale Roy directed that Collin's IEP be kept in the school file and it was not accessible to departments including the nursing and transportation departments. The former Director of Education resigned during an investigation into this matter by\n   the Ohio Department of Developmental Disabilities (\"DODD\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Collin's IEP included a \"transportation section\" which was used to address special needs a student may require while being transported on a bus. In Collin's case, no special needs were identified or forwarded to the transportation department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Under the direction of the former Director of Education, teachers at Dale Roy were to complete a \"Focus Form\" containing information about each student. The Focus Form contained detailed information about Collin's medical conditions and how to prevent him from becoming overheated during the school day. The Focus Form completed by Collin's teacher the previous year was not forwarded to his current teacher until this incident occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In January 2016 the school nurse was given Collin's medical information, including his history of seizures and stroke. The nurse was present for discussion about Collin's inability to regulate body heat. No Emergency Care Plan was developed for Collin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Before this incident occurred, Dale Roy teachers, including the gym teacher, reviewed Collin's IEP and discussed his need for restrictions with his mother, Catherine. Collin's doctor required his gym class to be restricted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Before the incident, during multiple meetings with Dale Roy personnel, Catherine and Collin stressed Collin's inability to regulate body temperature which had in the past resulted in a stroke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} DODD substantiated neglect based upon Dale Roy School's acts and omissions on August 25, 2016 regarding Collin's exposure to heat. As a result of DODD's investigation, Dale Roy School was given eleven recommendations to correct its \"multiple errors\" during this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The Burchards filed an amended complaint against the Board and Ashland County as defendants, asserting negligence/negligent retention and supervision; intentional infliction of serious emotional distress - Collin; intentional infliction of serious emotional distress - Catherine; and loss of consortium.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, asserting the Board is entitled to immunity pursuant to Chapter 2744 of the Ohio Revised Code and that Ashland County is not sui juris. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss Ashland County. The trial court further found, however, that the Board failed to address the Burchards' second and third claims for relief and therefore overruled the motion to dismiss the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The Board now appeals from the trial court's Judgment Entry of November 8, 2017. The Board raises one assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED DEFENDANT/APPELLANT ASHLAND COUNTY BOARD OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THE BENEFIT OF IMMUNITY UNDER REVISED CODE CHAPTER 2744.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The Board argues the trial court should have dismissed appellees' complaint\n   on all counts on the basis of sovereign immunity.
