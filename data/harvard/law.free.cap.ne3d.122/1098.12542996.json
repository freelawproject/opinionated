The only evidence before the motion judge, however, was the testimony given by State Police trooper Taylor and paramedic Matthew Ryan. The defendant did not testify, nor is she required to. Neither Taylor nor Ryan testified that they thought the defendant had suffered a head injury. Indeed, the defendant told Taylor that she was not injured, and Ryan testified that he observed no signs of injury or trauma. The defendant's affidavit, filed in support of the motion, suggests that she sustained concussive effects from the accident that prevented her from voluntarily making any statements to the police or consenting to field sobriety testing. The motion judge's reliance on these statements was error as the defendant's \"affidavit is not evidence and may not be considered by the judge for purposes of deciding the motion to suppress. The permissible findings of fact at the evidentiary hearing must find support in the evidence-the testimony and exhibits, which have been introduced in evidence at the suppression hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841664\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/79/322/\">\n    79 Mass.

Grasso, Jr. &amp; C.M. McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law \u00a7 2-3[d][3] (2010). As the record is devoid of any evidence that the defendant suffered \"head trauma,\" the motion judge's finding regarding such trauma is not supported by the evidence and is, therefore, clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Order allowing motion to suppress reversed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
