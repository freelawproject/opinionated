Here, the defendant avers in his affidavit that, as a former refugee, he feared that he would be \"stuck in between a tribal war or even be[ ] forced to take part in one\" if he returned to Somalia. Without any explicit consideration of the defendant's refugee status by the motion judge, we cannot conclude that the defendant failed to present a substantial issue regarding the existence of a special circumstance that may have prevented him from taking a plea that made him deportable.
