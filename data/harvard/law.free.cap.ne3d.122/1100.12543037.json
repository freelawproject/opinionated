Concluding that the defendant's statements made under oath during a postjudgment deposition supported the finding of contempt, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiffs, the two daughters of the defendant, filed an action against him in 2010 alleging that he sexually abused them over the course of many years. Prior to disposition on that action, the parties entered into a stipulation, and the court entered an order that prohibited the defendant from, inter alia, selling his thirteen-acre horse ranch located in Utah (property) without the plaintiffs' approval and leave of court. In October, 2014, the jury awarded the plaintiffs $5 million each plus interest and costs. A panel of this court affirmed the judgment in an unpublished decision issued pursuant to rule 1:28. See\n   <em>\n    B.K\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201127\">\n    89 Mass. App. Ct. 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   After the jury trial in the previous litigation, the plaintiffs served a notice of deposition on the defendant to obtain information regarding his assets available to satisfy the judgment against him. The defendant filed a motion to quash and for a protective order that was denied. Following an order to appear, the defendant attended the deposition on January 15, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   During the deposition, the plaintiffs' attorneys asked the defendant, in pertinent part, about whether or not he had asked anybody to sell the property, whether he had any discussions with anybody other than Don Weiss about selling the property, and whether he had any intention to sell the property. As discussed in more detail below, the defendant provided incomplete and false answers to these questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After the deposition, the plaintiffs learned from the defendant's Utah counsel, Attorney Patricia Geary Glenn, that the defendant had provided false testimony at the deposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to her legal representation, Glenn also had assisted the defendant in his efforts to sell the property, beginning in or around September, 2014. On December 29, 2014, approximately two weeks prior to the defendant's deposition, Glenn and the defendant had entered into a written agreement entitled \"AUTHORIZATION AND FEE AGREEMENT TO SHOW &amp; SELL UNLISTED PROPERTY\" (December, 2014, agreement). This agreement authorized Glenn \"to show and offer for sale\" the property, for a seven-month period, \"for the asking price of $19,000,000\" and to \"consider and convey all other reasonable offers on the [p]roperty to [the defendant].\" The defendant agreed to pay Glenn a commission of three percent of the sales price if she was successful. Because of her involvement, Glenn was aware of various efforts to market and to sell the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In May of 2015, after reviewing the defendant's deposition testimony and believing it to be false, Glenn filed a motion that informed the court that the defendant had provided false testimony at the deposition regarding his knowledge of the value of the property and his intent and efforts to sell the property. In particular, Glenn stated that she herself was involved with offering to sell the property in September, 2014, and had conveyed an informal offer of $7 million for the property to the defendant in September of 2014; that in January of 2015, the defendant met with a Park City, Utah commercial real estate broker \"for purposes of selling the [p]roperty\"; and that one day before and one day after his deposition in January, 2015, the defendant and Glenn had discussed, by written communication, selling the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the information provided by Glenn, the plaintiffs filed a complaint for contempt against the defendant claiming that he committed perjury and fraud on the court. Following an evidentiary hearing, a Superior Court judge concluded that the defendant provided false testimony at the deposition. In his decision and order, the judge stated that \"the defendant is hereby adjudged in contempt of the [o]rder to provide truthful testimony at his deposition on January 15, 2015,\" and ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiffs' attorney fees and costs, as well as Glenn's fees and expenses (contempt order).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the judge denied the defendant's motion pursuant to Mass.

The defendant's deposition was taken pursuant to an order of the court. The judge determined that implicit in that order was that the defendant must testify truthfully, and the judge found that \"there is no question\" that he did not do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge focused in particular on three statements the defendant made. The defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he wilfully testified falsely. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   First, the evidence was sufficient to prove that the defendant wilfully testified falsely as to whether or not he had asked anybody to sell the property. In response to the question, \"Did you ask somebody to sell the property?\" the defendant answered, \"To sell it? No.\" The defendant contends that the term \"sell\" is ambiguous, that as a matter of law Glenn could not serve as a real estate broker and therefore the December, 2014, agreement was not a sales contract, and that Weiss was the defendant's \"key person for evaluating any potential sale prospects.\" These arguments are unavailing. Approximately two weeks before the deposition, the defendant entered into the December, 2014, agreement with Glenn, which authorized her to \"to show and offer [the property] for sale\" for a seven-month period. Regardless of the ultimate validity of the agreement, the evidence demonstrated that the defendant had \"ask[ed] somebody to sell the property,\" and thus testified falsely. The materiality of his statement is also apparent. By answering \"no,\" the defendant prevented the plaintiffs from inquiring further about the identity of the parties involved in selling the property, thereby stalling their efforts to ascertain the value and status of the defendant's assets, which was the purpose of the deposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    D'Amour\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651274\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/428/725/#p744\">\n    428 Mass. 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 744 (1999). The defendant's statement was materially false and misleading. Accordingly, he disobeyed a clear and unequivocal order to tell the truth at his deposition, and the judge did not abuse his discretion in adjudging the defendant in contempt for this testimony. See\n   <em>\n    Birchall, petitioner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670342\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/454/837/#p853\">\n    454 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   853 ;\n   <em>\n    K.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239340\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/86/554/#p567\">\n    86 Mass. App. Ct. at 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The evidence also was sufficient to prove that the defendant wilfully testified falsely by answering, \"I don't know,\" when asked whether he had any discussions with anybody except Weiss about selling the property. The defendant asserts that he answered this way because he could not \"conclusively answer\" whether various discussions \"could be characterized as concerned with 'selling' the property.\" The evidence and testimony that the defendant had an agreement with Glenn to sell the property, had met with Glenn about selling the property, and had met with a commercial real estate broker in Utah about two weeks before the deposition, supported a finding of wilful false testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The December, 2014, agreement alone demonstrates the falsity of his statement. Combined with Glenn's testimony, the judge did not err in determining that the defendant had discussions with others about selling the property and that his statement was untruthful. See G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 1. This false statement was also material to the purpose of the deposition because it prevented the plaintiffs from learning about the true status of the property and the defendant's efforts to sell it. See\n   <em>\n    D'Amour\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651274\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/428/725/#p744\">\n    428 Mass. at 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Where the defendant testified untruthfully regarding discussions with people other than Weiss, the judge did not abuse his discretion in finding the defendant in contempt for disobeying a clear and unequivocal order to testify truthfully.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    K.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239340\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/86/554/#p567\">\n    86 Mass.

The defendant contends that the attorney-client privilege barred disclosure of his communications with Glenn regarding the property, including disclosure of the December, 2014, agreement. He argues that Glenn's disclosures violated her professional obligation to maintain confidentiality and that the disclosures were not subject to any exception. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[T]he attorney-client privilege shields from the view of third parties all confidential communications between a client and [his] attorney undertaken for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.\"\n   <em>\n    Suffolk Constr.

This argument is unavailing and was rejected as \"wholly incredible\" by the judge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the agreement contained the words \"fee agreement\" in the title, there is nothing in the agreement to indicate it was anything other than an authorization and compensation agreement for Glenn's efforts \"to show and offer [the property] for sale.\" See\n   <em>\n    Suffolk Constr. Co\n   </em>\n   ., 449 Mass. at 448.
