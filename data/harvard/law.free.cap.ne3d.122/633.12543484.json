What a Lovely Home (\"Woods\"), filed in the Garfield Heights Municipal Court against defendant-appellees Ciera Marcano (Appeal No. 106710), Annette Kellom (Appeal No. 106711) and Monique Willis (Appeal No. 106712). In each case, the trial court dismissed Woods' claims for damages on the ground that Woods \"was not the owner of the subject property\" and the property was \"titled in a fictitious name.\" For the reasons that follow, we reverse the trial court's judgment in each of these cases and remand the matters for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In July 2017, Woods, pro se, filed a forcible entry and detainer action (Garfield Heights M.C. No. CVG1702100) to evict Willis from a house on Brunswick Avenue in Maple Heights, Ohio (the \"Brunswick Avenue property\") and to recover damages for \"unauthorized persons living at property,\" \"unauthorized change of locks,\" \"destruction of property\" and \"non-payment of water bill\" (the\n   <em>\n    \"Willis\n   </em>\n   case\"). In August 2017, Woods, pro se, filed a forcible entry and detainer action (Garfield Heights M.C. No. CVG1702342) to evict Kellom from a house on Theodore Street in Maple, Heights, Ohio (the \"Theodore Street property\") and to recover damages for \"non-payment of utilities\" and \"destruction of property\" (the \"\n   <em>\n    Kellom\n   </em>\n   case\"). In each case, the parties reached an agreement regarding restitution of the premises and hearings were set on Woods' claims for damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} A hearing was scheduled in September 2017 in the\n   <em>\n    Willis\n   </em>\n   case. At the hearing, Willis raised the issue of whether What A Lovely Home was a legal entity that could hold title to real property and sue and be sued. Willis asserted that she had wanted to file a counterclaim but could not do so because What A Lovely Home was a fictitious name. The magistrate continued the hearing and ordered the parties to brief the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On September 22, 2017, Willis filed a motion to dismiss Woods' damages claim on the ground that What a Lovely Home was not a legal entity. Willis asserted that because What A Lovely Home was a fictitious entity, the deed granting title to the Brunswick Avenue property to What A Lovely Home was void.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She further asserted that because Woods was not the \"owner\" of the property and was \"only the registrant of the name\" What A Lovely\n   Home, he lacked standing to pursue a claim for damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Woods opposed the motion to dismiss. He argued that \"a fictitious name is a legal entity\" that can hold title to real property and has standing to sue or be sued \"as long as it is registered properly with the Ohio Secretary of State.\" He further asserted that he and What A Lovely Home were one and the same, that he had properly reported his use of the fictitious name What A Lovely Home to the Ohio Secretary of State, and that, both at the time the subject lease was executed and the complaint was filed, the property was properly titled in the name of What A Lovely Home as his \"d.b.a.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 25, 2017, hearings were held in the\n   <em>\n    Willis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kellom\n   </em>\n   cases regarding Woods' damages claims and Willis' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On October 13, 2017, Woods filed a forcible entry and detainer action (Garfield Heights M.C. No. CVG1703011) to evict Marcano from the Brunswick Avenue property and recover damages for \"unpaid rent plus any lease violations or damages\" (the \"\n   <em>\n    Marcano\n   </em>\n   case\"). As in the other cases, the parties reached an agreement regarding restitution of the premises and the case was set for a hearing on Woods' damages claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On October 31, 2017, the magistrate issued the following ruling in the\n   <em>\n    Kellom\n   </em>\n   case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Issue: Can a registered fictitious name hold title to real estate the same being a non entity? This magistrate rules that this is not an entity and as same has no corpus or body. The name alone is not an entity as set forth by any statute creating a corporation, LLC or partnership. Logically, if it does not exist it has no standing to file suit using a dba. There being no entity as recognized by the statute or the court it would require an attorney at law to bring an action on its behalf if one would legally exist. Following this reasoning until further order of this court \"What a lovely home\" is an improper party to bring an action and therefore the second cause of action is dismissed in this case and others pending at plaintiff's cost.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} That same day, the magistrate issued an order in the\n   <em>\n    Willis\n   </em>\n   case stating that \"[u]nder the reasoning as set forth in CVG 17023470 [sic][,] plaintiff has no standing to sue and therefore second cause of action is dismissed.\" In the\n   <em>\n    Willis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kellom\n   </em>\n   cases, Woods thereafter filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law, a motion for a determination as to whether the magistrate's October 31, 2017 rulings should be considered findings of fact and conclusions of law and objections to the magistrate's October 31, 2017 rulings. He also filed a request to supplement the record in each case with select documents from other case, \"transcripts\" from\n   hearings in the\n   <em>\n    Willis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kellom\n   </em>\n   cases and a third case that is not part of this appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and other \"evidence that may not have been available or allowed to be presented at the time of the subject hearings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On November 29, 2017, the magistrate issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in the\n   <em>\n    Willis\n   </em>\n   case. The magistrate found that What A Lovely Home is a fictitious name Doug Woods \"registered\" in the state of Ohio and that the Brunswick Avenue property was deeded to \"What A Lovely Home, a fictitious filing name registered in the state of Ohio by Doug Woods\" in February 2016. Based on these facts, the magistrate issued the following conclusions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1. Plaintiff lacks standing to bring the current cause of action as Doug Woods is not the owner of the premises in question. The premises are owned by \"What a Lovely Home.\" While Plaintiff Doug Woods registered the fictitious name with the state of Ohio, the deed is not made out to \"Doug Woods, doing business as What a Lovely Home,\" but rather to \"What a Lovely Home.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   2. What a Lovely Home lacks standing in this case as a fictitious entity cannot hold title to real property in the state of Ohio. \"A deed to a person not in being or to a fictitious person is void.\" Ohio Jur. 3d \u00a7 33, citing\n   <em>\n    Transcontinental Ins.

As Plaintiff - both as Doug Woods and as What a Lovely Home - lacks standing in this case, Plaintiff's second cause of action is dismissed. There is no just reason for delay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 11} At the December 5, 2017 hearing in the\n   <em>\n    Willis\n   </em>\n   case, the trial court agreed that Woods lacked standing to bring to the action because title to the Brunswick Avenue property was held in a fictitious name. The trial court then issued judgment entries overruling Woods' objections in the\n   <em>\n    Willis\n   </em>\n   case and dismissing Woods' damages claims in all three cases, concluding that \"Defendant [sic] is not the owner of the subject property\" and that \"[t]he property is titled in a fictitious name.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Woods appealed, raising the following four assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   First Assignment of Error: The trial court's ruling that appellant did not have standing because he was not the owner of the subject property since the property was titled to a fictitious name was erroneous, contrary to law, an abuse of discretion and against the sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Second Assignment of Error: The trial court erred and abused its discretion by failing to allow appellant to have standing upon both his registration with the state and transfer of property ownership to \"Doug Woods dba What a Lovely Home.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Third Assignment of Error: The trial court erred and abused its discretion by failing to allow appellant to have standing as the real party in interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Fourth Assignment of Error: The trial court erred by allowing appellees to use the issue of standing as an affirmative defense since it was not previously raised in any pleading.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In his first assignment of error, Woods challenges the trial court's dismissal of his damages claims for lack of standing based on its determination that he was not the owner of the properties and that the properties were improperly titled in a fictitious name.

The record reflects that \"What A Lovely Home\" is a fictitious name used by Doug Woods and that Doug Woods reported his use of that fictitious name to the Ohio Secretary of State in March 2014. The record further reflects that \"Doug Woods dba What A Lovely Home\" was the \"lessor\" under the leases executed by Willis and Kellom and that the Brunswick Avenue and Theodore Street properties were titled in the name of \"What A Lovely Home, a fictitious filing name registered in the state of Ohio by Doug Woods (single)\" at the time the eviction actions were filed by \"Doug Woods dba What A Lovely Home.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In this case, the trial court dismissed Woods' claims for money damages because it believed that title to real property could not be held in a fictitious name.
