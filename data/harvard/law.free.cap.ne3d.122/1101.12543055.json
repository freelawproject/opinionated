The first case arose out of events occurring in Pittsfield (the Pittsfield case), and the second arose out of events occurring in Great Barrington (the Great Barrington case). In the Pittsfield case, on May 17, 2016, a jury found the defendant guilty of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ), and vandalism, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 126A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge sentenced the defendant to one year in the house of correction on each count, to be served concurrently. The defendant did not file a notice of appeal from the convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   On April 11, 2016 -- while out on bail in the Pittsfield case before it was tried -- police arrested the defendant in Great Barrington for assault and battery on a family or household member, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13M (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ). A judge set bail on that case at $ 1,000, which the defendant did not post. The judge reduced the defendant's bail to personal recognizance on May 5, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and on June 23, 2016, at the defendant's request, dismissed the Great Barrington complaint without prejudice. Thereafter on August 11, 2016, the defendant moved in the Pittsfield case to have the time he served while awaiting trial in the Great Barrington case credited towards his sentence imposed roughly three months earlier. The trial judge in the Pittsfield case denied this motion on August 24, 2016. The defendant filed a notice of appeal from the denial of the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the judge in the Pittsfield case erred by (1) committing certain errors that prevented a fair trial, and (2) denying his motion for sentence credit. The defendant asks that we vacate his convictions or order that he receive credit for time served in the Great Barrington case. We affirm the order denying sentence credit, but we do not address the merits of the defendant's convictions because there is no direct appeal before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . a.\n   <em>\n    Pittsfield convictions\n   </em>\n   . The defendant contends that we should vacate his convictions in the Pittsfield case primarily because the trial judge erred in (1) failing to uphold the defendant's challenges to certain jurors, (2) refusing to give a requested self-defense instruction, and (3) allowing the prosecutor essentially to instruct the jury on the law during closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We need not address the merits of the defendant's contentions, however, because there is no appeal from those convictions before us.

The judge dismissed the Great Barrington case at the defendant's request, without prejudice. Thus, the defendant did not have an \"invalid\" sentence in the Great Barrington case because the prosecutor could have sought a new complaint on that charge, meaning that the time the defendant served awaiting trial in that case does not qualify as \"dead time.\" Moreover, at this point, given that the defendant has likely completed his sentence in the Pittsfield case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   crediting the defendant now for time served awaiting trial in the Great Barrington case would be akin to the defendant improperly \"bank[ing]\" time \"for future crimes\" (citation omitted).\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1011, 1012.
