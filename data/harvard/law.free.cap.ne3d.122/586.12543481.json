Woods of one count of rape and five counts of gross sexual imposition, the trial court sentenced him to prison. Initially Woods asserts that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress his statements to a children's services supervisor and a deputy sheriff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Woods claims the statements were obtained through an impermissible two-step interrogation technique in which the children's services supervisor, who was also a part-time police officer, interrogated Woods without any\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, and the deputy sheriff subsequently interrogated him after he administered\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. We reject Woods's assertion because he was not in custody when\n   he answered questions from the children's services supervisor, who was not acting in his capacity as a police officer or as an agent of the police. Because Woods was not subjected to custodial interrogation without\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, this case does not involve the impermissible, two-step, question-first interrogation technique.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Next Woods contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his statement to the deputy sheriff, who did Mirandize him, because the deputy failed to scrupulously honor Woods's assertion of his right to remain silent. Because the record does not establish that Woods unequivocally invoked his right to remain silent, the trial court did not err by denying his motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Finally, Woods argues that his convictions for rape and gross sexual imposition were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence because the jury rejected specific events but convicted him on more general allegations. But Woods's daughter testified that he had touched her breasts more than ten times before she reached age 13, and he touched the inside of her vagina every time he came into her room both before and after she was 13. Woods also admitted his inappropriate sexual contact with his daughter to two children's services employees and a deputy sheriff. This provided sufficient evidence to support his convictions. And the jury did not clearly lose its way or create a manifest miscarriage of justice by convicting him of the crimes, so the weight of the evidence supports his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} We reject Woods's argument and affirm his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In Case No. 15CR301, the state filed an information charging Franklin S. Woods with one count of gross sexual imposition. In Case No. 16CR33, the Lawrence County Grand Jury returned an indictment charging Woods with six counts of rape, eight counts of gross sexual imposition, and four counts of sexual battery. After the court consolidated the cases for purposes of trial, Woods filed a motion to suppress the statements he made to a children's services social worker, the social worker's supervisor, and a deputy sheriff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. Suppression Hearing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} At the suppression hearing the state introduced the testimony of social worker Amber Stamper, a social worker with the Lawrence County Department of Job &amp; Family Services, Adult Protective Service Division, and her supervisor, Randy Thomson. Stamper is not a police officer and does not wear a badge or gun; although she works primarily with adults, she is sometimes assigned to assist in the management of cases involving children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On November 16, 2015, Stamper began investigating a case of sexual abuse of M.W., Woods's minor daughter. Initially Stamper went to the middle school and interviewed M.W. about her allegations against Woods. Lawrence County Deputy Sheriff Scott Wilson, the school's resource officer, was present for the child's interview. Following that interview Stamper attempted to contact Woods and his fianc\u00e9e, Samantha Best, but was unsuccessful. She then arranged for the temporary placement of M.W. with Best's mother, Yvette.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The next day, November 17, 2015, Woods called Stamper, who said she needed to speak with him about his daughter's general allegations, and to complete a required safety plan. Woods told her that he was more than willing to meet her at her office and that he was going to be very cooperative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} That afternoon Woods appeared at the Lawrence County Department of\n   Job &amp; Family Services, a two-story office building with an entry containing a reception window and a waiting area. A door from the reception area leads to a hallway with three conference rooms. To enter the hallway, the door must be electronically unlocked, but there is no lock preventing persons from leaving the hallway, conference rooms, and building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Stamper met Woods in the reception area and took him to the first conference room, where they went over the terms of the safety plan, which addressed the sexual-abuse allegations. The conference room was eight by ten feet, with a desk and chairs behind, in front of, and on the side of the desk. The door, which had a small window in it, was closed but not locked. Woods sat behind the desk facing the door, and Stamper sat in front of the desk. Stamper testified that nothing prevented Woods from getting up and walking out the door and leaving the building; his demeanor was nervous, but very cooperative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Stamper did not notify Woods of specific allegations; she only told him that his daughter had indicated he touched her inappropriately. According to Stamper, after learning of his daughter's claims, Woods said he was \"not denying\" the allegations. Woods never indicated that he wanted to leave, and if he had, Stamper would have let him go because the agency \"cannot force them to stay.\" But Stamper admitted that she never told Woods that he did not have to answer her questions and that he was free to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} After Woods signed the safety plan, Stamper told him that her supervisor was coming down to sign it. Stamper left the conference room and called the supervisor, Randy Thompson, whose office is on the second floor of the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Thompson is a supervising social worker for the Lawrence County Department of Job &amp; Family Services. Upon learning that Woods did not deny his daughter's allegations, Thompson brought a device to record his interview, which lasted about 25 minutes. Thompson testified that during the interview Woods was free to leave at any time, was not under arrest, and had not been told that he could not leave. According to Thompson although the door to the conference room was closed, it was not locked, and Woods was positioned in a way that he could have gotten by Thompson to leave the room. Woods never asked to leave, never stated that he did not want to talk to Thompson, and never asked for an attorney. Because Woods was not in custody and Thompson was acting as a social worker, Thompson did not administer\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings before interviewing him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Although he is also a part-time village police officer, Thompson stated he did not enjoy county-wide police powers and was not working as a police officer during the interview. He was not wearing a uniform or badge, and did not have a gun or handcuffs during the interview. Near the beginning of his interview Thompson informed Woods that he and Stamper were \"not police officers here.\" Thompson testified that he had no prior arrangement or contact with law enforcement relating to his investigation or his conversation with Woods; instead, he and his agency were following its statutory duty to investigate M.W.'s claimed allegations of child sex-abuse. No law enforcement officer was present during the interview; only Thompson, Woods, and Stamper were there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Near the beginning of the interview, Woods asked Thompson whether \"[y]ou got to do this?\"; Thompson responded that \"[w]e don't have to do it, but I mean, we like to know what's going on.\" Woods then said that he was embarrassed and ashamed, that he was \"scared for this\n   process, scared to go to prison,\" but that he did not want to \"drag her through trial\" and that he wanted his family to be placed with his fianc\u00e9e's mother while they all undergo counseling. During the interview Woods was remorseful and admitted inappropriately touching his daughter on her breast about seven times, rubbing her vagina, and \"[m]aybe\" putting his fingers between the lips of her vagina. He also said that although he did not recall licking her daughter's vagina, he would \"admit to [and] say she's telling the truth.\" Woods eventually admitted that he got sexually aroused when he touched his daughter's breasts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Upon the conclusion of the 25-minute interview, Thompson contacted Lawrence County Deputy Sheriff Brian Chaffins, who came to the agency office. Deputy Sheriff Chaffins did not have any prior knowledge about the allegations or investigation. He met with Thompson for about \"five or ten seconds,\" after Thompson advised him he had an individual who had made statements about sexually abusing a child. Deputy Sheriff Chaffins got his digital recording device, started it, and went to the conference room with Thompson to interview Woods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} About 45 minutes had elapsed between Thompson's questioning and Deputy Sheriff Chaffins's interview of Woods, who was left alone in the room; no one prevented him from leaving the building during that time. Chaffins testified that although he did not place Woods under arrest at the start of his interview, he notified Woods of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. Woods stated that he understood those rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Chaffins first asked Woods to describe \"what's going on.\" Although it is difficult to hear, the taped recording appears to reveal Woods's response was: \"I said everything I needed to say already. I'm under arrest. I've already said everything. Am I under arrest?\" The deputy sheriff responded that he was just there to question Woods to get his side of the story and proceeded to ask questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} According to Deputy Sheriff Chaffins, Woods voluntarily spoke to him, never invoked his right to remain silent or asked for an attorney, never stated that he wanted to stop, appeared to be apologetic, and was very cooperative during the interview. Woods admitted to everything in his previous statement to Thompson, including that he fondled his daughter's breasts, put his hand down her panties, and licked her vagina. Most of the interview involved the deputy questioning Woods, but near the end, the deputy let Thompson ask some questions. After the interview concluded, Sgt. Chaffins arrested Woods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Woods did not present any witnesses or evidence at the suppression hearing, but both parties submitted posthearing briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B. Ruling on Motion to Suppress\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The trial court denied Woods's motion to suppress. The court found that Woods made three incriminating statements-the first to social worker Stamper, the second to social worker supervisor Thompson, and the third to Deputy Sheriff Chaffins. Based on the evidence before it, the trial court concluded that: (1) Woods's first two statements did not require\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings because they were not made to law enforcement officers engaged in custodial interrogation; (2) Thompson had no police powers outside Proctorville and there was no evidence that he acted as a police officer during his interview of Woods; (3) the final statement to Deputy Sheriff Chaffins was valid because Woods made it after receiving his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and making a knowing waiver of those rights; and (4) based on the validity of the first two statements, this case did not involve\n   the illegal two-step interrogation technique.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   C. Jury Trial and Sentencing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 23} At the jury trial the victim M.W., testified that beginning in the second grade the family lived in a trailer in Chesapeake, Ohio where her father, Woods, began touching her breasts. The family consisted of Woods, his daughter, M.W., Woods's fianc\u00e9e, Samantha Best, Best's young daughter, Natalie, and Woods's and Best's twin sons. When she was in seventh grade, the family moved to a house down the road from the trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 24} According to M.W., Woods would come into her room at night when she was asleep, and she would wake up when he was either rubbing or putting his mouth on her breasts. M.W. testified that before she reached 13, her father touched her breasts \"to[o] many times to count\" and \"more than ten times.\" She further testified that Woods touched inside her vagina with his hand or finger every time he came into her room, both before and after she was 13. And Woods also licked her vagina every time he came into her room after she reached 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 25} M.W. also testified about two specific incidents. In the first incident, before she was 13, she woke up one night in her bedroom and Woods was touching her breasts. M.W. kept telling him to get off, and he then grabbed her and took her to the kitchen and put her against a stone wall, where he stuck his hand in her panties and his finger in her vagina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In the second incident, when she was 13, M.W. woke up in her room when Woods was licking and kissing her vagina. She started kicking him, and the wheels on the bed made it slide until a mirror behind her bed fell, resulting in a noise that woke up Woods's fianc\u00e9e, Samantha. Woods told M.W. that he wanted to smash her face, but he returned to his room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The evidence indicated that in the fall of 2015 a counselor at M.W.'s middle school learned that M.W. was talking to one of the teachers and was upset. The counselor met with M.W., who was crying uncontrollably and told the counselor that her father was hurting her. The counselor notified Lawrence County Department of Job &amp; Family Services, which dispatched social worker Amber Stamper to speak with M.W. Stamper and the school resource officer, Lawrence County Deputy Sheriff Scott Wilson, talked with M.W. Stamper reported to her supervisor, Randy Thompson, who instructed her to begin working on a safety plan for the child. Stamper contacted Woods's fianc\u00e9e, Samantha Best, who M.W. considered her mother or stepmother. They agreed Best should take the child to Best's mother, Yvette's, residence until an investigation was finished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The next day Woods called Stamper, who explained that M.W. had made allegations of inappropriate touching against him, so she needed Woods to come to her office to sign a safety plan. Woods came to the office that afternoon. When Stamper reviewed the safety plan with him, Woods stated that \"he was not denying the allegations\" his daughter made against him. After they completed reviewing the safety plan, Stamper left the room and called Thompson, the supervisor of the Child Protective Unit at the Lawrence County Department of Job &amp; Family Services, which investigates allegations of child sexual abuse, as required by law. Thompson picked up his recording device, turned it on, and interviewed Woods, who admitted that he sexually abused his daughter. More particularly, Woods said that he had inappropriately touched his daughter on her breast about seven times, rubbed her vagina, \"[m]aybe\" put his fingers between the lips of her vagina, and\n   that M.W. was telling the truth about him licking her vagina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Thompson then contacted Lawrence County Deputy Sheriff Brian Chaffins, who recorded an interview with Woods. After Chaffins administered\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, Woods admitted sexually abusing M.W. According to Thompson, Woods did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol, medication, or substance of abuse. And Deputy Sheriff Chaffins testified that Woods did not appear confused or impaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 30} On direct examination Woods denied that he ever engaged in any inappropriate touching or sexual contact or conduct with his daughter. He testified that he suffers from bipolar depression and anxiety. After he was informed by his fianc\u00e9e of his daughter's allegations against him, he stayed up all night drinking beer, smoking marijuana, and taking a double dose of his prescription medication. Woods indicated he lied to Stamper, Thompson, and Deputy Sheriff Chaffins because he was not sober, and he thought that by admitting to his daughter's allegations he would protect her and end the questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Samantha Best, Woods's fianc\u00e9e, and her mother, Yvette, testified that M.W. admitted to them that part of her allegations against Woods were lies. Along with Woods's sister, Betty Layman, they testified that M.W.'s home was so full of people living there that her claims of inappropriate sexual behavior could not have occurred without being observed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The jury returned verdicts finding Woods guilty of five counts of gross sexual imposition of a child less than 13 years of age in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4), a third-degree felony, and one count of rape of a child less than 13 years of age in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), a first-degree felony. The jury found him not guilty of the remaining counts, including the counts relating to the specific incidents regarding the kitchen and the falling bedroom mirror. The trial court sentenced him to an aggregate prison term of 32.5 years to life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Woods assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS WHEN APPELLANT'S STATEMENT WAS OBTAINED THROUGH A TWO-STEP INTERROGATION TECHNIQUE PROHIBITED BY THE SUPREME COURT IN\n   <em>\n    MISSOURI V. SEIBERT\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS WHEN DEPUTY CHAFFINS FAILED TO \"SCRUPULOUSLY HONOR\" APPELLANT'S ASSERTION OF HIS RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   III. APPELLANT'S CONVICTION WAS BASED ON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   IV.

Motion to Suppress\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   1. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In his first and second assignments of error Woods asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements he made to social worker supervisor Thompson and Deputy Sheriff Chaffins. Appellate review of a trial court's decision on a motion to suppress raises a mixed question of law and fact.\n   <em>\n    State v. Hobbs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5761290\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/133/43/\">\n    133 Ohio St.3d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-3886\">\n    2012-Ohio-3886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=975%20N.E.2d%20965\">\n    975 N.E.2d 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6. Because\n   the trial court acts as the trier of fact in suppression hearings and is in the best position to resolve factual issues and evaluate the credibility of witnesses, we must accept the trial court's findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Burnside\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1190316\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/100/152/\">\n    100 Ohio St.3d 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003-Ohio-5372\">\n    2003-Ohio-5372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=797%20N.E.2d%2071\">\n    797 N.E.2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8. Accepting these facts as true, we must then \"independently determine, without deference to the conclusion of the trial court, whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Hobbs\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8, citing\n   <em>\n    Burnside\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   2. Two-Step Interrogation Technique\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 35} First Woods asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because his statements to Thompson and Deputy Sheriff Chaffins were inadmissible as part of the two-step interrogation technique prohibited by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Missouri v. Seibert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    542 U.S. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). The plurality in\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   held that a \"midstream recitation of [Miranda] warnings after interrogation and unwarned confession\" does not \"comply with\n   <em>\n    Miranda's\n   </em>\n   constitutional requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case a police officer intentionally questioned a defendant at a police station following her arrest without providing\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. During this questioning the defendant made incriminating statements. The officer then gave the defendant a 20-minute break. After the break the same officer gave the defendant\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, obtained a signed waiver, and resumed questioning. During this second round of questioning the officer confronted the defendant with the prewarning statements. The defendant repeated her incriminating statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The court referred to the police officer's \"midstream\" warning as a specifically designed police strategy of \"question-first.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    at 609-611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court determined that \"[t]he object of question-first is to render\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings ineffective by waiting for a particularly opportune time to give them, after the suspect has already confessed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The trial court relied upon the following facts: (1) Woods had returned a phone call to the social worker, Stamper; (2) he voluntarily came to the social worker's office building; (3) there were no locked doors preventing Woods from leaving at any time he wished to; and (4) he was never told he was not free to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Woods asserts that the trial court's factual finding that he came to the department of job and family services building voluntarily was not supported by the evidence because he only appeared after Stamper told him that he would need to sign a safety plan before M.W. could return to him. But he cites no testimony or other evidence from the suppression hearing establishing that Stamper threatened him with permanent removal of his daughter and other children if he failed to come in to sign the safety plan. In fact his daughter had already left his home through placement with his fianc\u00e9e's mother when Stamper talked to him. And Woods told Thompson that he wanted his children to be placed there at least temporarily. The trial court's findings were supported by the evidence at the suppression hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 43} The relevant circumstances include: (1) Thompson's interrogation occurred at a county department of job and family services office building rather than a police station; (2) Woods voluntarily came to the building at the social worker's request; (3) the interrogation was brief-lasting only about 25 minutes; (4) Woods indicated a willingness to talk freely about his daughter's allegations of sexual abuse because he did not want to drag his daughter through a trial and he was remorseful and ashamed about what he had done to\n   her; (5) he was not physically restrained during the interrogation and he was free to leave at any time during it or during the 45-minute break before Deputy Sheriff Chaffins arrived; and (6) Thompson expressly told him during the interview that they did not \"have to do\" the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Moreover, when he interrogated Woods, Thompson was not acting in his capacity as a police officer or an agent of the police. The trial court concluded that although Thompson was also a part-time village police officer, he had no police powers outside the village, and there was no evidence that Woods had any knowledge that Thompson was also a police officer. The trial court's findings were supported by Thompson's testimony at the suppression hearing, as well as his statement to Woods during the interview, that neither he nor Stamper were police officers. Although counsel speculates that Woods could have known Thompson to be a police officer because of where he lived, there is nothing in the suppression hearing that supports this speculation. Consequently, a reasonable person in Woods's position would not have believed that Thompson, who was acting as a social worker supervisor, and was not dressed in a police uniform with a badge or gun, was a police officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Although\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   's requirements clearly apply to persons acting as agents of law enforcement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ross No. 04CA2760,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-5089\">\n    2004-Ohio-5089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202260508\">\n    2004 WL 2260508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16 (\"the prosecution was not required to prove the exact date of the offense because the date is not an element of the offense. However, the prosecution is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the incident occurred within the time frame specified in the indictment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 71} This case involved Woods's repeated sexual abuse of his minor daughter over an extended period of time while they lived in the same household. The particulars of the crimes were supported by sufficient evidence. The child victim testified that Woods touched her breasts more than ten times and touched the inside of her vagina every time he came into her bedroom before she was 13. And Woods admitted inappropriate sexual behavior with his daughter to Stamper, Thompson, and Deputy Sheriff Chaffins. He also admitted to being sexually aroused when he touched his daughter's breasts. After viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes of rape and gross sexual imposition of a child less than 13 years of age proven beyond a reasonable doubt. We overrule Woods's third assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 72} In his fourth assignment of error Woods argues that his convictions for rape and gross sexual imposition were against the manifest weight of the evidence. He claims that the child victim's testimony about him committing these crimes was inconsistent and contradicted by the testimony of Betty Layman, Yvette Best, and Samantha Best. He also argues that his daughter's testimony is not credible because she testified that Woods did not sexually abuse her when he lived with her on two occasions in Columbus with no one else around, but sexually abused her in Lawrence County when there were as many as seven other people in the small house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 73} We reject Woods's argument given the deference we accord to the jury's resolution of these weight and credibility issues. The jury was in the best position to gauge the witnesses' demeanor, gestures, and voice inflections, and to use these observations to weigh their credibility.\n   <em>\n    Kirkland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4284412\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/140/73/\">\n    140 Ohio St.3d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-1966\">\n    2014-Ohio-1966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20N.E.3d%20818\">\n    15 N.E.3d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 132. Significantly, M.W.'s allegations against Woods were supported by Woods's own statements to Stamper, Thompson, and Deputy Sheriff Chaffins. Although Woods claimed at trial that he was impaired by lack of sleep and self-medication when he admitted to sexually abusing his daughter, the state presented evidence by Thompson and Chaffins that Woods did not appear impaired or confused when he conceded his criminal behavior. The jury did not clearly lose its way or create a manifest miscarriage of justice by finding him guilty of rape and gross sexual imposition. Consequently, his convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. We overrule Woods's fourth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 74} Woods has not established any reversible error by the trial court in overruling his motion to suppress. Nor has he established that his convictions for rape and gross sexual imposition were not supported by sufficient evidence or against the manifest weight of the evidence. Having\n   overruled Woods's assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Hoover, P.J. &amp; Abele, J.: Concur in Judgment &amp; Opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
