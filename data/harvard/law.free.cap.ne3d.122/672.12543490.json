This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On January 21, 2017, Ms. Brown's son discovered her at home, unresponsive, and called 9-1-1. Akron Police and paramedics responded, and the son informed them that Ms. Brown had overdosed on heroin. Upon their arrival, paramedics were able to administer a dose of NarCan to revive Ms. Brown. Responding officers found a syringe and plastic cap on the ground next to Ms. Brown. Ms. Brown admitted to mixing heroin in the plastic cap and using the syringe to inject heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Ms. Brown was charged with one count for possession of drug abuse instruments in violation of Akron City Code 138.11 and one count for drug paraphernalia in violation of Akron City Code 138.28. Ms. Brown entered an initial plea of not guilty to both charges. On March 2, 2017 Ms. Brown filed a motion to dismiss, which the trial court denied. Thereafter, on April 6, 2017, Ms. Brown changed her plea to no contest as to the charge of possession of drug abuse instruments in exchange for the City's agreement to dismiss the drug paraphernalia charge. The trial court accepted the plea, found Ms. Brown guilty of possession of drug abuse instruments, and sentenced her according to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Ms. Brown has filed a timely appeal of her conviction raising four assignments of error for our review.

Ms. Brown refers to the trial court's order of March 27, 2017, wherein the trial court denied Ms. Brown's pretrial motion to dismiss and ruled that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [t]he immunity set forth in R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) does not apply to any offense other than a minor drug possession offense; therefore, immunity does not apply to the charges of [p]ossession of [d]rug [a]buse [i]nstruments and [p]ossession of [d]rug [p]araphernalia in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In her merit brief, Ms. Brown contends that the statute should be interpreted to be \"more encompassing than just the minor drug possession charge\" and suggests that R.C. 2925.11 is worded such that it can be read either to \"provide immunity from all charges in R.C. Chapter 2925\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   it can be read to provide immunity from only minor drug possession charges.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Because a trial court's interpretation of a statute presents us with a question of law we review it on a de novo basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

If this Court \"were to brazenly ignore the unambiguous language of a statute, or [to find] a statute to be ambiguous only after delving deeply into the history and background of the law's enactment, we would invade the role of the legislature: to write the laws.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Jacobson v.

Ms. Brown's argument attempts to bypass the threshold consideration of ambiguity and instead resorts to discussing the statute's legislative history, policy consideration, and a comparative analysis to other statutory immunity. Thus, Ms. Brown prematurely relies on sources beyond the statute itself for interpretation, without having first established that the statute is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} We conclude that because R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) is plain and unambiguous, there is no cause to look beyond the plain language of the statute for interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Consequently, this Court rejects Ms. Brown's argument that the trial court should have interpreted the statute or expanded its application beyond that which is permitted by the plain language of the statute. This Court's application of the plain language of the statute confirms the trial court's conclusion that R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) applies only to minor drug possession offenses under R.C. 2925.11, that Ms. Brown was not charged with a minor drug possession offense in this case, and that the statute does not provide immunity for the possession of drug abuse instruments or drug paraphernalia offenses with which Ms. Brown was charged. The trial court did not err in its application of R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Ms. Brown's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    The trial court erred by concluding that the immunity set forth in R.C. 2925.11 does not apply to allied offenses of similar import.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In her second assignment of error, Ms. Brown argues that the immunity provision of R.C. 2925.11 should apply to her charges for possession of drug abuse instruments or drug paraphernalia because, she contends, they are allied offense of similar import to the minor drug possession offenses afforded immunity under R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b). Ms. Brown reasons that \"a defendant who is immune from prosecution for a specific offense should also be immune from prosecution for any allied offenses of similar import.\" The essence of Ms. Brown's argument is that she could have been charged with minor drug possession for her possession of heroin in this incident. Ms. Brown theorizes that if she had been charged with minor drug possession the doctrine of merger would have applied, her charge for minor drug possession would have been dismissed based on grounds of immunity, and then her charges for possession of drug abuse instruments or drug paraphernalia would also have been dismissed as allied offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Ms. Brown raised this below in her pretrial motion to dismiss. The trial court, in concluding that immunity did not apply to Ms. Brown's charges, overruled that motion.

Therefore, even if Ms. Brown had been charged with minor drug possession, that offense would not merge with any allied offenses of similar import other than for the purpose of sentencing. Accordingly, if Ms. Brown had qualified for immunity and, consequently, dismissal of a charge for minor drug possession, any allied offenses would not \"merge\" for that purpose and there would be no grounds to extend immunity or dismiss any charges not covered by the immunity provision of R.C. 2925.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In her reply brief, Ms. Brown acknowledges that \"there is no authority that specifically says when a defendant is immune from prosecution for one of a series of allied offenses they should be immune from prosecution for each of the allied offenses.\" Ms. Brown instead asserts an additional policy argument suggesting that \"there is nothing that prevents immunity from being extended.\" However, based upon our discussion in the previous assignment of error, we reject Ms. Brown's argument because the plain language of R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) limits its application. Further, R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(e)(i) precludes such an extension of immunity by prohibiting R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) from being applied to \"[l]imit the admissibility of any evidence in connection with the investigation or prosecution of a crime * * * with regards to any crime other than a minor drug possession offense committed by a person who qualifies for protection pursuant to division (B)(2)(b) of this section for a minor drug possession offense[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Accordingly, this Court concludes that immunity provision of R.C. 2925.11 cannot be construed to extend immunity beyond minor drug offenses to provide immunity from prosecution for any allied offenses of similar import not covered by R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b).
