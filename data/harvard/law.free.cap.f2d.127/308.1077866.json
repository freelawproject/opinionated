The first issue of appellee\u2019s publication was in July, 1936. The publication was not issued, again until May, 1937, and since that date it has appeared monthly in greatly enlarged form over the initial publication. The title of the publication on all the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>except the first is confined to the words \u201cPopular Photography\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Appellant in its claimed right <em>to </em>cancellation relies upon prior use of the notation \u201cPopular Photography\u201d and alleges damage through confusion in trade by reason of appellee\u2019s use of the registered mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The facts are undisputed. It appears that a magazine entitled \u201cPopular Photography\u201d was first published in October, 1912. It was sold to appellant on November 27, 1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Appellant prior to and ever since the said sale has been publishing a monthly magazine called \u201cAmerican Photography\u201d. That publication was intended to appeal to expert photographers. After the said sale, from November, 1914, until May, 1916, appellant published both the \u201cAmerican Photography\u201d and \u201cPopular Photography\u201d magazines separately, when, due to reasons of economy, appellant combined both publications into a single monthly magazine designed to appeal to both the readers and advertisers of the separate publications. From May, 1916, until November, 1916, the combined periodical carried on its cover, as well as on an inner page containing the masthead and table of contents the title \u201cAmerican Photography Incorporating Popular Photography\u201d. Subscribers to \u201cPopular Photography\u201d were notified in April, 1916, that its separate publication would be no longer continued and that it would thereafter be merged, starting with the May issue, in \u201cAmerican Photography\u201d. The pertinent portion of the notice reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201cIt has for some time seemed inevitable to us that efficiency and the possibility of greatest usefulness to the greatest number would eventually demand the consolidation of the two magazines, and considerations \u25a0quite other than those of editorial policy indicate that the time for consolidation has now arrived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">\u201cWe therefore are able to announce to \u25a0our readers that the April issue of Popular Photography will be the last published, and that with the May issue of American Photography Popular Photography will be merged in this magazine. The new Ameri\u25a0can Photography will be considerably enlarged in size, and will contain in addition to its usual number of articles, as nearly as \u25a0possible, the equivalent of an ordinary number of Popular Photography, edited on the plan which has made this magazine so justly popular. The same class of pictures will be reproduced and criticized in the \u2022same way, and the same sort of short, practical articles will be intermingled with the picture descriptions. The readers of each magazine will practically get two magazines combined in one, and the new American Photography will contain many more articles and pictures and a much more diversified range of contents than any other photographic magazine published in the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">After the publication of November, 1916, the notation \u201cPopular Photography\u201d was taken from the cover of the consolidated publications and thereafter the only title used on the cover has been \u201cAmerican Photography\u201d. On the masthead there now appears the title of the magazine American Photography\u201d in large letters, followed by the word \u201cincorporating\u201d and a list of the names of discontinued publications, including \u201cPopular Photography\u201d, all in smaller type. The list of discontinued publications rose from eight in 1916 to thirteen prior to appellee\u2019s first use of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">The masthead in the printing art, and as is shown by this record to be customary, appears to be the page in a publication showing the title of the publication, the discontinued titles of publications (if any) which have been merged or consolidated under the name of the publication, the names of the publishers, editors, the place where published, the subscription rates, the date of issue and frequency of publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">The Examiner of Interferences after setting forth the facts, among other things, stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-14\">\u201cIt accordingly appears that while the magazine title in dispute was used as such by petitioner and its predecessor Fraprie for about a five year period ending in 1916, its use in a magazine by the latter, like that of similarly discontinued titles, for the last twenty years and more has been confined to a masthead notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-15\">\u201cIt is deemed to be well understood that ownership of a trade-mark may not be \u25a0acquired nor maintained merely by the invention or prior selection of a symbol, but only through its use as a designation of personal origin of goods sold in trade. In so far as the various titles of discontinued magazines contained in petitioner\u2019s masthead notice are concerned, these do not purport to represent trade-marks for any publication now sold by the latter. The inclusion of \u2018Popular Photography\u2019 therein is accordingly believed not to afford a proper basis for a claim of ownership thereof, nor, in consequence of such claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>justify any contention that its use as a trade-mark by respondent would involve \u2018injury\u2019 to the petitioner by reason of a likelihood of confusion in trade.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\u201cThe examiner is persuaded that the lack of use by petitioner of the notation in issue as a trade-mark, under the circumstances here disclosed, amounts to an actual and intended abandonment thereof. Accordingly, it is held that the Petitioner cannot qualify as an owner of this mark. This conclusion is deemed to be in accord with the ruling in the following case recently decided by the Court of Appeals, D. C.: Lawyers Title Insurance Co. v. Lawyers Title Insurance Corp., 71 App.D.C. 120, 109 F.2d 35.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The Commissioner of Patents had the following to say with respect to trade-mark use and abandonment by appellant of the notation \u201cPopular Photography\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">\u201cThe title of appellant\u2019s magazine appears to be only the notation \u2018American Photography\u2019. I am not persuaded by the testimony and argument as to the technical significance of the masthead notations that the list of discontinued publications is anything more than a description of the history and makeup of American Photography. I cannot agree that it would be considered by either the purchasing public or those trained in the publishing trade to be an essential part of the title of that magazine. While the purpose of listing the titles of discontinued publications undoubtedly was to give continuing notice to the public of an intention not to relinquish all rights in those titles, it does not follow that the list formed a part of the name of appellant\u2019s magazine or was used as part of its trade mark therefor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s failure to use the notation \u2018Popular Photography\u2019 as the name of an existing publication for over twenty years is strong evidence of its abandonment of the notation for that purpose. Ownership of a trade-mark cannot exist indefinitely in the absence of a trade-mark use, and I am of the opinion that appellant\u2019s failure for that long period to make such use of the mark in question precludes a finding that it now owns the mark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">\u201cHaving abandoned the trade-mark use upon which it is relying, and having failed to prove that it is \u2018injured\u2019 within the meaning of the statute by the registration sought to be cancelled, it seems clear that appellant is not entitled to the relief requested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">The issues to be decided are whether or not the continuation of the printing of \u201cPopular Photography\u201d as aforesaid on the masthead of appellant\u2019s periodical constitutes a trade-mark use and the likelihood of confusion in trade arising from appellee\u2019s use of that notation.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">In our opinion the failure of appellant to use the title \u201cPopular Photography\u201d since the year 1916, except in the masthead of \u201cAmerican Photography\u201d, is strong evidence that it had abandoned the title as a trade-mark. The fact that the notation \u201cPopular Photography\u201d appears on the masthead together with twelve other titles of discontinued magazines indicates to us, as it did to the Commissioner of Patents, that it is nothing more than a description of the history and makeup of the magazine \u201cAmerican Photography\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">The mere statement that there had been no intention to abandon the notation as a trade-mark cannot in our opinion be of weight against the fact of non-user as such for twenty years. Until the first publication of the said magazine of appellee there had been no magazine known as \u201cPopular Photography\u201d for twenty years. During that period any good will attaching to that publication must have been merged, even as the title was merged, into the good will attaching to \u201cAmerican Photography\u201d. The subscribers to and other purchasers of the old \u201cPopular Photography\u201d, it is believed, would continue to buy the magazine \u201cAmerican Photography\u201d which purported to satisfy the interest which attracted them to the former publication. The original-magazine \u201cPopular Photography\u201d had but a small circulation as compared with the circulation now of \u201cAmerican Photography\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">Since we must hold that because of the failure of appellant for over twenty years, to make a trade-mark use of the notation-\u201cPopular Photography\u201d prior to its first use by appellee, it follows -that appellant was not the owner of the mark when it was-first used by appellee and therefore has no-standing in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">It is not necessary to discuss any of the cases cited in the briefs, for the reason that none of them apply directly to the facta here.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-17\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
