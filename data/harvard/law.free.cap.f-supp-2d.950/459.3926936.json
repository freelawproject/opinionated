Arab Bank (\u201cLitle </em>Opinion\u201d), 507 F.Supp.2d 267 (E.D.N.Y.2007), dismissing those plaintiffs on timeliness grounds, be vacated in light of recently enacted amendments to the statute of limitations in the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331 <em>et seq. </em>Defendant opposes the application in a letter dated May 2, 2013, and plaintiffs reply in a letter dated May 7, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Section 1251 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (\u201c2013 NDAA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 112-239, \u00a7 1251, 126 Stat. 1632, 2017 (Jan. 2, 2013), amends 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2335 by enlarging the statute of limitations. Following the amendments, and subject to exceptions not applicable here, \u201ca suit for recovery of damages under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333] shall not be maintained unless commenced within 10 years after the date the cause of action accrued.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2335. In a provision entitled \u201cEffective Date,\u201d the 2013 NDAA also provides that \u201c[t]he amendments made by this section shall apply to any civil action arising under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333] that is pending on, or commenced on or after, [January 2, 2013].\u201d 2013 NDAA \u00a7 1251(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">In providing that the amendments apply to any civil action under \u00a7 2333 \u201cthat is pending on, or commenced on or after\u201d the date of the 2013 NDAA\u2019s enactment, Congress has explicitly expressed its intent that the amended limitations period, previously four years, be applied retroactively to pending claims. <em>See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, </em>511 U.S. 244, 259-60, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994); <em>International Union of Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers, AFL-CIO, Local 790 v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 229, 241-43, 97 S.Ct. 441, 50 L.Ed.2d 427 (1976). Defendant neither contests that the claims of plaintiffs subject to the <em>Litle </em>Opinion are pending, in that no judgment dismissing them has been issued, nor that the language of the amendments would revive those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">The Bank\u2019s argument that <em>William Danzer &amp; Co. v. Gulf &amp; Ship Island R. Co., </em>268 U.S. 633, 45 S.Ct. 612, 69 L.Ed. 1126 (1925), prohibits retroactive application of the amendments, on the ground that such application would violate Due Process, is rejected. In contrast to the situation in <em>Danzer, </em>the amended limitations period of the ATA is expressly retroactive to the claims here. Also, as the Supreme Court recognized in <em>International Union, \u201cDanzer </em>was given a narrow reading in the later case of <em>Chase Securities Corp. v. Donaldson, </em>325 U.S. 304, 312 n. 8, 65 S.Ct. 1137, 89 L.Ed. 1628 (1945) [ (1945) ].\u201d <em>International Union, </em>429 U.S. at 243, 97 S.Ct. 441. Most importantly, in <em>International Union, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the precise application of <em>Danzer </em>that the Bank proposes here and observed that, accepting the argument would require an \u201cunwarrantedly broad reading of\u2019 <em>Danzer, International Union, </em>429 U.S. at 243, 97 S.Ct. 441. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">The Fourteenth Amendment does not make an act of state legislation void merely because it has some retrospective operation. What it does forbid is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>taking of life, liberty or property without due process of law.... Assuming that statutes of limitation, like other types of legislation, could be so manipulated that their retroactive effects would offend the Constitution, certainly it cannot be said that lifting the bar of a statute of limitation so as to restore a remedy lost through mere lapse of time is <em>per se </em>an offense against [Due Process].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><em>Id </em>at 243-44, 97 S.Ct. 441 (quoting <em>Chase Securities Corp., </em>325 U.S. at 315-16, 65 S.Ct. 1137). Applying that test to the federal law at issue in <em>International Union, </em>the Court held that \u201cCongress might constitutionally provide for retroactive application of the extended limitations period which it enacted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 97 S.Ct. 441. The Bank has submitted no sound argument that would lead to a different conclusion here. Indeed, Congress\u2019s choice of language clearly imposing retroactivity demonstrates that Congress has already \u201cdetermined that the benefits of retroactivity outweigh the potential for disruption or unfairness.\u201d <em>Landgraf, </em>511 U.S. at 268, 114 S.Ct. 1483.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">For these reasons, the <em>Litle </em>Opinion is vacated to the extent that certain plaintiffs\u2019 claims, as described in that Opinion, were dismissed as not falling within the then-applicable four-year statute of limitations. Those claims are restored and they shall proceed accordingly. In addition, the <em>Litle </em>Opinion is vacated to the extent that it describes the claims of three <em>Litle </em>plaintiffs \u2014 Shivi Keller, Chayim Brovender, and Mattityahu Zachariash \u2014 as timed-barred, though they were not formally dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"AgM\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-24\">. In light of the foregoing discussion, plaintiffs' alternative argument relating to the Scherzman plaintiffs raised in the January 23, 2013, letter need not be addressed here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
