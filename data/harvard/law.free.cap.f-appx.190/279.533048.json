On appeal, Brock argues that it was error for the district court to deny his motion to sever counts five and six, relating to two controlled purchases of narcotics by government agents, from counts one through four, relating to the distribution of narcotics to two friends. Brock also contends the district court abused its discretion by imposing a substantial upward departure. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-20\">This court reviews the denial of a motion to sever for an abuse of discretion. <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>ed States v. Rhodes, </em>32 F.3d 867, 872 (4th Cir.1994). We have held that all counts charged in a single indictment are generally tried together. <em>United States v. Samuels, </em>970 F.2d 1312, 1315 (4th Cir.1992). To obtain a severance under Fed.R.Crim.P. 14, a defendant must show that the joinder \u201cwas so manifestly prejudicial that it outweighed the dominate concern with judicial economy and compelled exercise of the court\u2019s discretion to sever.\u201d <em>United States v. Acker, 52 </em>F.3d 509, 514 (4th Cir.1995) (citing <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>621 F.2d 951, 954 (9th Cir.1980)). The burden is upon the defendant to make a particularized showing of prejudice from the denial of a severance motion. <em>United States v. Clark, </em>928 F.2d 639, 645 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Where evidence of the crimes \u201cwould be mutually admissible for legitimate purposes in separate trial for each offense,\u201d the possibility of prejudice requiring severance is \u201cgreatly diminished.\u201d <em>United States v. Cole, </em>857 F.2d 971 (4th Cir.1988). If much of the evidence could have been properly introduced in separate trials under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), then the possibility of prejudice is greatly mitigated. <em>Id. </em>The possibility of prejudice is further reduced if an instruction is given to the jury cautioning them to consider the evidence of each crime separately. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">We find that the district court properly denied Brock\u2019s motion to sever counts five and six. Because the evidence would have been admissible in separate trials for each group of charges, the interests of judicial economy were furthered, and the court gave a limiting instruction that guarded against the possibility of prejudice, we find the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Brock\u2019s sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment was based on an upward departure from the guidelines range of 110 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K2.0. Although the district court\u2019s ultimate decision to depart is reviewed de novo, we review the factual findings underlying that decision for clear error, and the extent of the departure for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>380 F.3d 183, 187-88 (4th Cir.2004). The district court must first determine the guidelines range and, if a sentence within that range is not adequate to meet the sentencing factors set forth pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), the court may \u201clook to whether a departure is appropriate based on the Guidelines Manual or relevant case law.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.) (explaining procedure to be followed when guidelines range is inadequate, and discussing difference between departures under the guidelines and variance sentences), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Brock does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of the guidelines range. Moreover, the court provided cogent reasons for departing from that range, including Brock\u2019s providing illicit drugs to a minor who did not want the drugs, failing to seek assistance for a person who overdosed on drugs in his presence, and hiding the overdose victim\u2019s body in the woods so Brock\u2019s involvement in the victim\u2019s death would not be discovered. On this record, we cannot say that the district court erred in applying an upward departure. <em>See Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 432-33; <em>see generally United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, - L.Ed.2d-, 2006 WL 1057741 (U.S. May 22, 2006) (No. 05-10474). Moreover, we conclude that the extent of the departure was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-16\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>gument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
