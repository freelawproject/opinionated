Dumonde, appearing pro se, appeals his conviction from a bench trial, in which he also proceeded pro se, for uttering a counterfeit security, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 513(a) and 2. In his first appeal, No. 04-14104, Dumonde argues that his arrest was illegal because it was fraudulently obtained without probable cause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dumonde also asserts that the district court unconstitutionally limited the compulsory process by denying his request to subpoena Judge Watkins, Sheriffs Internal Affairs Sgt. Moore, and Jefferson County Sheriff Mike Hale. Next, Dumonde <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>argues that his codefendant, Walker, committed perjury at trial, and his testimony should not have been admitted because it was uncorroborated and was inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">In second appeal, No. 05-12349, Dumonde argues that the account numbers on the counterfeit check were non-existent, and therefore, the check could not be drawn on any organization within the meaning of the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dumonde also asserts that Judge Blackburn of the district court should have recused herself from the proceedings because she was \u201coutrageously biased.\u201d Lastly, Dumonde argues that he was wrongly removed from state to federal custody without any authority, and that he was denied due process of law because he was required to give a handwriting sample before the grand jury, and he was forced to appear before the grand jury in a prison stripe uniform and leg shackles.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">I. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">In reviewing a denial of a motion to suppress, we review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings, and we review de novo its application of law to those facts. <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248, 1250 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, \u201call facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below.\u201d <em>United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256,1262 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Dumonde claims that the Government arrested him without probable cause. \u201cProbable cause to arrest exists if the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, of which he has reasonably trustworthy information, would cause a prudent person to believe, under the circumstances shown, that the suspect has committed or is committing an offense.\u201d <em>Ortega v. Christian, </em>85 F.3d 1521, 1525 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">The record shows that the government had probable cause to obtain an arrest warrant for Dumonde. By the time law enforcement sought an arrest warrant for Dumonde they knew of and were in possession of substantial evidence that would have led a prudent person to believe that Dumonde was involved in the subject offense. <em>Id. </em>For example, the officers knew that phone calls to the victim had originated from Dumonde\u2019s home. Also originating from Dumonde\u2019s home were phone calls to the Tennessee jewelry store where the victim\u2019s ring was sold. The jewelry store owner had identified Dumonde out of a photographic line up as the person who sold him the ring. The store owner further stated that Dumonde had used the name Daniel Spencer, one of his several aliases. In light of these facts demonstrating probable cause, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Dumonde\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">II. Compulsory Process</p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">The Sixth Amendment protects a defendant\u2019s right to have \u201ccompulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI.; <em>see U.S. v. Hurn, </em>368 F.3d 1359, 1362 (11th Cir.2004). However, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment does not by its terms grant to a criminal defendant the right to secure the attendance and testimony of any and all witnesses: it guarantees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>him \u2018compulsory process for obtaining <em>witnesses in his favor. \u2019 </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 867, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 3446, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982) (quoting U.S. Const, amend. VI). A defendant must, therefore, \u201cat least make some plausible showing of how [the witness\u2019s] testimony would [be] both material and favorable to his defense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The record here does not compel a reversal of the district court\u2019s refusal to issue a subpoena for Judge Watkins, Sgt. Moore, or Sheriff Hale. Dumonde had failed to present any evidence that the requested witnesses would testify favorably to his defense. He presented no evidence that Judge Watkins\u2019s signature was forged. Likewise, with regard to Sgt. Moore, Dumonde did not submit any support for his assertion that Sgt. Moore\u2019s testimony was needed to show a pattern of officer misconduct. Regarding Sheriff Hale, Dumonde failed to present his request for Hale\u2019s subpoena before the district court, when the district court inquired into Dumonde\u2019s subpoena requests. Even if Dumonde had made the request known to the district court, denying the request would not have been erroneous, because Dumonde failed to make \u201csome plausible showing\u201d that Hale\u2019s testimony would have been favorable to his defense. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Dumonde\u2019s requests for subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">III. Witness Credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">\u201cThe credibility of a witness is in the province of the factfinder and [we] will not ordinarily review the factfinder\u2019s determination of credibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994) (per curiam). Furthermore, the district court\u2019s credibility determinations are entitled to deference and its factual findings will be accepted, unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Holland, </em>874 F.2d 1470, 1473 (11th Cir.1989). In addition, even where a government witness testifies with immunity, it is the responsibility of the trier of fact to determine the truthfulness of witness\u2019s testimony. <em>See United States v. Hewitt, </em>663 F.2d 1381, 1385 (11th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">The district court did not err in admitting Walker\u2019s testimony. Although at trial Walker admitted to committing perjury, the district court found his testimony to be truthful. The district court knew of Walker\u2019s involvement in the subject offense, his admitted perjury, and the fact that he testified in exchange for a substantial assistance departure. Nevertheless, the court determined that Walker was credible and that much circumstantial evidence supported his testimony, which was within its province as the factfinder in a bench trial. <em>See Copeland, </em>20 F.3d at 413. In addition, Dumonde does not offer any support for his assertion that Walker\u2019s testimony was inadmissible hearsay. Accordingly, we affirm in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">IV. Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment. <em>United States v. Pielago, </em>135 F.3d 703, 707 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">It is a federal offense to make, utter, or possess, with the intent to deceive, a forged security of an organization. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a). The statute broadly defines an \u201corganization\u201d as \u201ca legal entity, other than a government, established or organized for any purpose, and includes a corporation, company, association, firm, partnership, joint stock company, foundation, institution, society, union, or any other association of persons which operates in or the activities of which affect interstate or foreign eommerce[.]\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Dumonde\u2019s motions to dismiss the indictment. Evidence showed that the check was a counterfeited security of an official Regions Bank check. The government established that Regions Bank, operating in at least thirteen states of the union, and IPS, by virtue of its agreement and cooperation with the bank, were organizations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(c)(4). Accordingly, we affirm in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Y. Recusal</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Ordinarily we review a district court judge\u2019s decision not to recuse herself for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Bailey, </em>175 F.3d 966, 968 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Two statutes govern recusal \u2014 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144 and 455. <em>See Hamm v. Members of Bd. of Regents of State of Fla., </em>708 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir.1983). Under \u00a7 144, a party can file a \u201ctimely and sufficient affidavit\u201d complaining of a trial judge\u2019s personal bias. Section 455(a) instructs a federal judge to disqualify herself if \u201c[her] impartiality might reasonably be questioned,\u201d and \u00a7 455(b) requires disqualification under specific circumstances, including having personal bias against a party or personal knowledge of disputed facts, expressing an opinion about the case as a government employee, holding a financial interest in the controversy, or having a spouse or relative involved with one of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">For recusal to occur under \u00a7 455(a), \u201cwe musk ask whether an objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Patti, </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1322 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotations omitted). Disqualification under \u00a7 455(b) \u201cis clear; once it has been established that one of the enumerated circumstances exists, there can be no dispute about the propriety of recusal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1321-22. To disqualify a judge under \u00a7 455(a) and (b)(1), the bias \u201cmust stem from extrajudicial sources, unless the judge\u2019s acts demonstrate such pervasive bias and prejudice that it unfairly prejudices one of the parties.\u201d <em>Bailey, </em>175 F.3d at 968 (internal quotations omitted). \u201c[Ajdverse rulings alone do not provide a party with a basis for holding that the court\u2019s impartiality is in doubt.\u201d <em>Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075,1103 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">In addition, a \u201c[district court] judge has wide discretion in managing the proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>661 F.2d 436, 450 (5th Cir. Unit B Nov.1981). \u201c[S]he may comment on the evidence, may question witnesses and elicit facts not yet adduced or clarify those previously presented, and may maintain the pace of the trial by interrupting or cutting off counsel as a matter of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Moreover, we are \u201ccognizant of the maxim that the trial judge has broad discretion in handling the trial and that the reviewing court should restrain itself from interposing its opinion absent a clear showing of abuse.\u201d <em>United States v. De La Vega, </em>913 F.2d 861, 867 (11th Cir.1990) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">The district court judge here did not abuse her discretion in failing to recuse herself. Dumonde accused the judge of having some personal bias against him, but he never presented any facts to support his claim. In this case, Dumonde proceeded pro se in a bench trial; thus, the judge necessarily had to become involved in managing the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">Although Dumonde\u2019s sentence exceeded the guideline range, the sentence was less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>than the statutory maximum, and at sentencing, the district court judge explained in detail her reasons for sentencing him above the recommended range. For these reasons, there was no evidence from which an objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>See Patti, </em>337 F.3d at 1322. Accordingly, we affirm in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">VI. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Any challenges based on prosecutorial misconduct before the grand jury are reviewed under a harmless-error standard. <em>Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, </em>487 U.S. 250, 254, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 2373, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988). Under the harmless-error standard, a reversal is required \u201conly if it is established that the violation substantially influenced the grand jury\u2019s decision to indict, or if there is grave doubt that the decision to indict was free from the substantial influence of such violations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256,108 S.Ct. at 2374 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">To the extent that Dumonde challenges events that occurred while he was in state custody, presumably on state charges, we do not address his claims. Dumonde argues that it was improper for him to appear before the grand jury wearing a prison uniform and leg shackles. <em>See Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 504, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 1693, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976) (holding that a defendant\u2019s appearance in prison attire at trial seriously compromises the defendant\u2019s right to the presumption of innocence basic to the adversary system). However, the rule in <em>Estelle </em>does not apply here because Dumonde was not a defendant on trial when he allegedly was forced to wear his prison uniform and leg shackles. Even assuming arguendo that an error did occur during the grand jury proceeding, any error was harmless because sufficient probable cause supported Dumonde\u2019s indictment. <em>See Bank of Nova Scotia, </em>487 U.S. at 254, 108 S.Ct. at 2373. For these reasons, Dumonde has failed to establish a denial of his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">VII. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">Finding no error, we affirm Dumonde\u2019s conviction and sentence. We also deny Dumonde\u2019s \u201cMotion for Immediate Reversal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-11\">. Dumonde asserts, admittedly for the first time on appeal, that the government committed misconduct and the district court erred in admitting evidence of a check imprinting machine found in his car because that machine was not found in the car during the first search. Because Dumonde raises this issue for the first time in his reply brief, he has abandoned the issue. <em>See United States v. Fiallo-Jacome, </em>874 F.2d 1479, 1481 (11th Cir. 1989) (noting that an appellant in a criminal case may not raise an issue for the first time in a reply appellate brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\">. On appeal, the government argues that we lack jurisdiction over the arguments raised in this appeal. Dumonde did perfect his appeal via his second and fourth notices of appeal, and therefore, we have jurisdiction to review the issues challenged here. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>760 F.2d 1079, 1079-80 (11th Cir. 1985) (per curiam) (holding that a premature notice of appeal made before judgment and conviction are entered is effective to perfect an appeal as of the date the sentence was entered as the judgment).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
