Counsel for Cortes has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which she states there are no meritorious issues for review, but presenting the issue of whether Cortes\u2019 plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered. Although informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Cortes has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">The Government has filed a motion to dismiss Cortes\u2019 appeal. Cortes\u2019 plea agreement included a provision by which he agreed to waive his right to appeal \u201cany sentencing guidelines factors or the Court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines factors to the facts of my case.\u201d Cortes knowingly and voluntarily agreed to this provision. We conclude that the appeal waiver is valid and enforceable. Therefore, Cortes has waived his right to appeal. <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162,168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore grant the motion to dismiss Cortes\u2019 appeal. Counsel has moved to withdraw from further representation. We deny the motion at this juncture. This court requires that counsel inform Cortes, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Cortes requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may then move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Cortes.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
