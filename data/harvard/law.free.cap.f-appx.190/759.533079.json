After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Collazo claimed that his constitutional rights were violated because his sentence was enhanced based on facts that were neither charged in the indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Collazo also alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">The district court noted that in his \u00a7 2241 petition Collazo averred that he was convicted and sentenced in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (\u201cEDPA\u201d), and that Collazo did not challenge the execution of his sentence. Thus, the district court concluded that Collazo should have filed his claims in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in the EDPA. The district court also pointed out that Collazo failed to state whether he applied for relief under \u00a7 2255 in the EDPA or whether he was entitled to relief under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255. Thus, the district court dismissed Collazo\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition without prejudice to re-file his claims in the appropriate court. Collazo moved for reconsideration of the dismissal, which the district court denied. Collazo timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241.\u201d <em>Skinner v. Wiley, </em>355 F.3d 1293, 1294 (11th Cir.2004). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). However, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 where \u00a7 2255 relief would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255. That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-9\">[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">The savings clause only applies when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the prisoner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order for a petitioner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy under <em>Wofford, </em>all three criteria must be satisfied. A petitioner may not argue the merits of his claim until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause applies to his claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>As to the first prong, the constitutional rule announced in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>\u201cfalls squarely under the category of new rules of criminal procedure that do not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 868 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 312, 163 L.Ed.2d 269 (2005). <em>Apprendi </em>also does not apply retroactively on collateral review. <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001). Collazo does not point to any other Supreme Court decisions in support of his claims. Therefore, Collazo has failed to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test, and we need not address the remaining prongs. Further, because Collazo failed to \u201copen the portal\u201d to \u00a7 2241, we do not reach the merits of his claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Collazo additionally argues that applying the savings clause to him violates the Suspension Clause,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, therefore, we should decline to apply the test in <em>Wofford. </em>Under the Suspension Clause, the \u201cwrit as it existed in 1789\u201d is a constitutional floor, below which Congress cannot restrict the writ of habeas corpus. <em>See INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 300-01, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2279-80, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (\u201c[A]t the absolute minimum, the Suspension Clause protects the writ as it existed in 1789.\u201d (quotation marks and citation omitted)). However, Congress can, and has, altered the writ since 1789. <em>See Felker v. Turpin, </em>518 U.S. 651, 663-64, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 2339-10, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996) (discussing history of the writ); <em>see also Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1057 (11th Cir.2003) (noting that the savings clause \u201cavoided any serious question about whether ... \u00a7 2255 caused an unconstitutional suspension of the writ.\u201d); <em>Swain v. Pressley, </em>430 U.S. 372, 381, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 1230, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977) (stating that District of Columbia legislation patterned after \u00a7 2255 did not violate the Suspension Clause because \u201cthe substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person\u2019s detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus\u201d). Moreover, the remedy created in \u00a7 2255 is \u201cthe exact equivalent of the pre-existing habeas corpus remedy.\u201d <em>Swain, </em>430 U.S. at 381, 97 S.Ct. at 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-13\">We readily conclude that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause does not violate the Suspension Clause, and we are bound by the test set forth in Wofford.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997) (stating that the \u201claw of this circuit is \u2018emphatic\u2019 that only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d). Accordingly, because Collazo failed to show that relief under \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective under the test in <em>Wofford, </em>the district court did not err by dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b786-6\">. The unavailability of a \u00a7 2255 motion because of a time limitation or procedural bar does not render \u00a7 2255 \"inadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b786-12\">. Collazo correctly argues that the text of \u00a7 2241 does not require a showing that \u00a7 2255 relief is inadequate or ineffective. However, that requirement does appear in the text of \u00a7 2255, which is the proper avenue for challenging a federal conviction and sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>as Collazo\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition seeks to do. Thus, Collazo must show that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective in order to proceed under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b787-9\">. We also reject Collazo's argument based on <em>Clisby </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir. 1992) <em>(en </em>banc), for this reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b787-10\">. U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2 (\"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b787-17\">. We have previously held that neither the one-year limitations period for filing an initial habeas corpus petition nor AEDPA's restrictions on successive petitions amounts to suspension of the writ. <em>See Wyzykowski v. Dep't ofCorr., </em>226 F.3d 1213, 1217 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
