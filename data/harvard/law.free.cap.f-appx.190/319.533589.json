He was sentenced to 260 months in prison and ten years of supervised release. On appeal, Moore\u2019s counsel asserts that Moore\u2019s sentence was imposed in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Moore has filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that his sentence violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment. We affirm Moore\u2019s conviction but vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Because Moore failed to challenge his sentence in the district court, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory guidelines scheme that provided for sentence enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing two statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (West Supp.2004) (requiring sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable guidelines range), and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2004) (setting forth appellate standards of review for guideline issues), thereby making the guidelines advisory. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">We conclude that the enhancement to Moore\u2019s sentence based on drug quantity was error under the Sixth Amendment as applied in <em>Booker, </em>because the facts supporting this enhancement were not alleged in the indictment or admitted by Moore.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Based on the facts presented in the indictment, Moore was responsible for in excess of fifty grams of cocaine base, resulting in a total offense level of thirty-two, instead of the level thirty-five used by the district court. Together with a criminal history category of IV, Moore\u2019s guideline range would be 168 to 210 months of imprisonment. Because Moore\u2019s offense carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 240 months, 240 months became the guideline sentence under USSG \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). The 260-month sentence imposed does not fall within the guidelines range calculated without the improper enhancement. Accordingly, Moore\u2019s sentence constitutes plain error that affects his substantial rights and requires resentencing pursuant to <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">As to Moore\u2019s assertion that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, such claims are generally not cognizable on direct appeal. To allow for adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>development of the record, a defendant must bring an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, unless the record conclusively establishes his rights to relief. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). We find no conclusive evidence of ineffective assistance on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We therefore affirm Moore\u2019s conviction but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker </em>and its progeny. We grant Moore\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\"> Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Moore\u2019s sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
