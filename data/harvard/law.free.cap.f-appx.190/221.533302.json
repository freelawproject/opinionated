Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">First, Hodges objected to an upward adjustment to his base offense level for committing the offenses after having been convicted of a crime of violence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.2(a)(4)(A). Our review is for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 415-16 (4th Cir.2006). After reviewing the record, we conclude the district court did not err in enhancing Hodges\u2019s sentence based on his prior conviction. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 24-25, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1262, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348,147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Next, Hodges argues that the district court erred in applying enhancements based on Hodges\u2019s possession of the firearm in connection with another crime, and for reckless endangerment during flight, even though the facts underlying these enhancements were not alleged in the indictment or found by a jury. The district court did not err because Hodges explicitly admitted the factual basis for these enhancements by stating at sentencing that \u201c[tjhere\u2019s no contest to the factual nature\u201d of the enhancements. <em>See United States v. Revels, </em>455 F.3d 448, 450 (4th Cir.2006) (discussing what constitutes an admission under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220,125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">Finally, pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel for Hodges presents the issue of whether the Government breached a plea agreement. Hodges has filed a pro se informal brief, which we have also considered. The record reveals that there was no plea agreement in this case, and therefore no breach by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Hodges\u2019s convictions and sentence. However, we deny the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance as such motions are appropriate in \u201cextraordinary cases only.\u201d <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 27(f). This court requires that counsel inform Hodges, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Hodges requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Hodges.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
