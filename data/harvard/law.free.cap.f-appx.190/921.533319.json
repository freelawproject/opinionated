Chahin missed his scheduled March 14, 2005, asylum hearing, and it is his reasons as to why he missed the hearing that are the subject of the instant petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">In his petition, Chahin argues that he suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel because, over the four-year course of their relationship, his attorney always had provided him with prior notice of his immigration hearings, so he expected to hear from his attorney regarding the hearing that he missed. He contends that, his failure to appear was understandable due to the facts that (1) shortly before the hearing, he and his family had to change residences; and (2) because of that change, his former attorney claimed that he was unable to get in touch with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-16\">\u201cIn this Circuit, we review the [IJj\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. Insofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (citations omitted). Here, because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, but also provided its own analysis for why the IJ was correct, we review the reasoning of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-17\">Any alien, who, after written notice has been provided, does not attend a proceeding, shall be ordered removed <em>in absentia </em>if the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) establishes by \u201cclear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence\u201d that it gave written notice and the alien was removable. INA \u00a7 240(b)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). An <em>in absentia </em>removal order may be rescinded if, within 180 days of the order, the alien moves to reopen, demonstrating that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances. INA \u00a7 240(b)(5)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C). Exceptional circumstances include circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the alien\u2019s spouse, child, or parent, but do not include less compelling circumstances. INA \u00a7 240(e), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e). Incompetent representation by counsel can qualify as an \u201cexceptional circumstance.\u201d <em>Saakian v. I.N.S., </em>252 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>Pursuant to the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, aliens enjoy the right to a fundamentally fair hearing with effective assistance of counsel. <em>Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1273. A petitioner claiming ineffective assistance must demonstrate prejudice. <em>Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1274. \u201cPrejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney\u2019s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Because Chahin has abandoned his argument, raised before the IJ, that the stress of his move was the cause of him missing his removal hearing, and he has failed to satisfy the prejudice component of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we conclude that the BIA did not err by affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Chahin\u2019s motion to reopen and rescind the removal order. We therefore deny his petition on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Chahin also argues that his wife, who suffers from depression and anxiety, was ill, and that illness was the cause of his failure to attend the hearing, which, although brought up in his <em>pro se </em>motion to reopen, was not considered either by the IJ or the BIA in their denials of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">We are obligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction whenever it may be lacking. <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe exhaustion requirement applicable to immigration cases is found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), which provides that \u2018[a] court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sundar v. I.N.S., </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003). We have \u201cinterpreted that requirement to be jurisdictional, so we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the BIA.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that we do not have jurisdiction to review Chahin\u2019s claim that his wife\u2019s illness was an exceptional circumstance justifying his failure to attend the hearing because it was not clearly raised below. Accordingly, Chahin\u2019s petition is dismissed on this ground. For the above-stated reasons, we deny the petition in part, and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-8\">. We DENY Chahin\u2019s motion to supplement the record as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
