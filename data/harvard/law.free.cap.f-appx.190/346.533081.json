However, Venegas now concedes that at least two of the convictions were not related under the Sentencing Guidelines because they were separated by an intervening arrest. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) &amp; comment, (n.3) (Nov.2004). He also concedes that any remaining error in his criminal history score would be harmless. No relief is warranted regarding Venegas\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-24\">Venegas also contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Venegas\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Venegas contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in hght of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Venegas properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
