On appeal, Putra challenges the denial of a third continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-23\">\u201cThe immigration judge may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (2006). Whether to grant such a motion \u201cis within the sound discretion of the immigration judge and is reviewed for abuse of discretion only.\u201d <em>Onyeme v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.1998). Based on the materials before us, we find no abuse of discretion in the denial of Putra\u2019s motion for a third continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-24\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-25\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
