Rodriguez petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) decision affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order denying his claim for asylum, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158, withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), and his claim for protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). Rodriguez, a long-time Conservative Party member and former collaborator with Conservative Party politician Mario Rincon Perez, alleged persecution by the FARC<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on account of his political opinion. Rodriguez argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is based on speculation and not supported by the record and that the IJ erred in denying asylum and withholding of removal. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">The IJ found Rodriguez not credible due to a number of implausibilities and inconsistences, which are enumerated in the IJ\u2019s opinion. Based on her adverse credibility finding and her finding that Rodriguez ceased his political activities because he became disaffected with the party, the IJ found that Rodriguez could not meet his burden of proof for asylum. As a result, the IJ further found that he could not meet his burden of proof for withholding of removal or CAT relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s opinion, and further found that Rodriguez offered no meaningful challenge to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and failed to show clear error as to that or any other factual find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>ing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Because the BIA both adopted the IJ\u2019s decision and made additional findings, we review both the BIA\u2019s decision and the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262,1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review factual determinations, including credibility determinations, using the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). We will affirm if the decision \u201cis supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted). We review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision. <em>Id. </em>To conclude that the IJ should be reversed, we \u201cmust find that the record not only supports that conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">The IJ must make an explicit credibility determination. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cThe trier of fact must determine credibility, and this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the [IJ] with respect to credibility findings.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). However, the IJ must provide \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for her credibility finding. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Here, the IJ made an explicit adverse credibility determination. Rodriguez appears to take the position that, because the IJ relied upon implausibilities and inconsistencies, the IJ based her adverse credibility finding on speculation. However, we have upheld a finding that the petitioner\u2019s testimony was not plausible where that finding was cogent and supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255-56 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>(llth Cir.2006); <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819. Moreover, the IJ could properly rely on inconsistencies in making her adverse credibility finding. <em>See D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819 (upholding a credibility determination based on inconsistencies between testimony, application and documentary evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Of the numerous implausibilities and inconsistencies cited by the IJ, Rodriguez only specifically challenges two on appeal: (1) the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility inference drawn from the length of time between the first two threats by the FARC in 1999 and the third threat in June 2001, and (2) the IJ\u2019s finding that Perez\u2019s letter was very vague with respect to describing the political support Rodriguez provided for Perez. Even if we were to find these reasons speculative or unsupported by substantial evidence, the record does not compel reversal because the remainder of the IJ\u2019s enumerated reasons are specific, cogent, and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The IJ\u2019s primary concern was with inconsistencies between Rodriguez\u2019s claimed fears and his actions. The IJ questioned the genuineness of Rodriguez\u2019s asserted fear for the safety of his family because: (1) after a threat, Rodriguez moved his family to a new house, but sent his daughter to the same school; (2) Rodriguez left his daughter in Colombia even though she had a visa; (3) his family returned to Bogota after he set them safely up in Cali; (4) Rodriguez left his daughter in Colombia because she would be safer, but a kidnaping attempt had been made against her; and (5) Rodriguez testified that he did not take his wife and son with him because they did not have a visa, yet admitted that they had never applied for a visa. In addition, the IJ also based her finding on Rodriguez\u2019s confusing testimony concerning the June 2001 threat, the contradiction between his intent, as expressed in Perez\u2019s letter, to leave Colombia in July 2001 and his representations to the court otherwise, and inconsistent evidence as to when he ceased participating in activities. These reasons are specific, cogent, and supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the record does not compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Nor does the record compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s finding that Rodriguez did not establish eligibility for asylum. To establish eligibility for asylum, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Alt\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (llth Cir.2005). In the absence of past persecution, \u201cthe petitioner must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257. \u201cThe subjective component can be proved \u2018by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u2019 while the objective component \u2018can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). We require the applicant to present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 a protected ground. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (quotation marks and citation omitted). We have noted that persecution is \u201can \u2018extreme concept,\u2019 requiring \u2018more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u2019 and that \u2018[mjere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quoting <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000)) (alteration in original). Furthermore, \u201c[n]ot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>212 F.3d at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Because the IJ did not find Rodriguez credible, the IJ found that he could not meet his burden of proof to show past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. As discussed above, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. As a result, Rodriguez\u2019s reliance on his testimony to establish asylum eligibility does not compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The IJ also found that Rodriguez did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution because he ceased his political activities as a result of becoming disaffected with the party. The content of the threats made to Rodriguez supports the finding that the FARC threatened Rodriguez due to his affiliation with and support of Perez. While the record would permit the conclusion that Rodriguez ceased his support of Perez out of fear for his safety, it does not compel this conclusion. Rodriguez\u2019s explanations as to why he told Perez that he could no longer work for him support the conclusion that Rodriguez ended his political involvement because, as a result of the threats, he became disaffected by Perez and the party, who he felt were not supporting him. Contrary to Rodriguez\u2019s contention, the IJ was not requiring him to suppress his political opinion in order to avoid future persecution. Instead, the IJ was implicitly finding that Rodriguez would not likely resume this support in the future because he had ceased his support due to dissatisfaction. As a result, the record does not compel a conclusion that Rodriguez has a well-founded fear of being singled out for persecution for supporting Perez.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Nor does the record compel a conclusion that Rodriguez would have a well-founded fear of persecution if he engaged in other political or community activities. Rodriguez\u2019s claim that the FARC would target him because of his political ideals and work with the youth is undermined by evidence that: (1) he spent 20 years as a Conservative Party member without incident or threat; (2) the FARC threatened him due to his support of Perez; and (3) even when threatened by the FARC, they told him that his work with the youth was good. As a result, substantial evidence in the record supports a finding that Rodriguez does not have a good reason to fear that the FARC would single him out for persecution on account of his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Because Rodriguez cannot establish a well-founded fear, he cannot meet the more stringent standard required for withholding of removal under the INA. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">In light of the foregoing, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-12\">.

On appeal, Rodriguez mentions his CAT claim in his statement of the issue, summary of the argument, and conclusion, but has abandoned the issue by making no argument as to the claim in his brief. <em>Huang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>429 F.3d 1002, 1007 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, this issue is not discussed further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">. The government argues that Rodriguez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his challenge to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. We disagree. Rodriguez took the position that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was erroneous in both his notice of appeal and brief to the BIA. Although Rodriguez did not make much more than bare assertions that the finding was erroneous, he put the BIA on notice that he was challenging the IJ's credibility finding, which satisfies the exhaustion requirement under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b889-8\">.
