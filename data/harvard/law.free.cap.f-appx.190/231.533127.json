We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Purvis contends the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his prosecution because there was no verified complaint and he is a sovereign who unwittingly relinquished his freedom to the United States. This argument is without merit. Subject matter jurisdiction over a federal prosecution is conferred on the district court by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 (2000). <em>United States v. Hartwell, </em>448 F.3d 707, 716 (4th Cir.2006). Moreover, \u201cthere can be no doubt that Article III permits Congress to assign federal criminal prosecutions to federal courts.\u201d <em>Hugi v. United States, </em>164 F.3d 378, 380 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Purvis\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
