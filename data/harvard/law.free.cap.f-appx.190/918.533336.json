After review, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b945-15\">Garcia-Arrieta and his codefendants were spotted in a \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat in international waters by the United States Coast Guard. Upon observing the Coast Guard, Garcia-Arrieta and his codefendants engaged in evasive maneuvers and began jettisoning overboard bales of what was later determined to be cocaine. After the crew refused requests to stop the \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat, the Coast Guard utilized disabling fire to incapacitate the boat\u2019s engines. Approximately 1,500 kilograms of cocaine ultimately were recovered from the boat and the water. An investigation revealed that Garcia-Arrieta was the captain of the \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat, while his codefendants acted as crewmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-16\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated Garcia-Arrieta\u2019s base offense level as 38 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), based on the fact that GarciaArrieta attempted to assist in the distribution of approximately 1,500 kilograms of cocaine. The PSI included a two-level enhancement based on Garcia-Arrieta\u2019s role as the captain of the boat, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B), and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility for his offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), (b). Thus, Garcia-Arrieta had a total offense level of 37 and criminal history category of I, resulting in an advisory Guideline imprisonment range of 210 to 262 months. The PSI did not recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>mend a safety-valve reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(7), 5C1.2 based on the government\u2019s assertion that Gareia-Arrieta had not fully cooperated.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">At sentencing, Gareia-Arrieta objected to the fact that he did not receive a safety-valve reduction. The government asserted that Gareia-Arrieta had not fully cooperated with the government and had not disclosed all the information of which he was aware. The government specifically noted that Gareia-Arrieta refused to reveal the identity of any co-conspirators who had provided him with global positioning system (\u201cGPS\u201d) coordinates for the \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat. Gareia-Arrieta did not testify at the hearing. The district court overruled Garcia-Arrieta\u2019s objection, stating that \u201cthe completeness of [Garcia-Arrieta\u2019s disclosure] is in the hands of the government, and this Court is going to honor that.\u201d The district court later stated that it was not the district court\u2019s role to determine whether Gareia-Arrieta had been truthful as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-5\">It is not the role of the Court to determine whether or not you have been complete and truthful with regard to what you have told the law enforcement agents. What they know this Court is not privileged to. If their evaluation is that you have not been complete, the Court is relying upon the issue of completeness with regard to the safety valve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">The district court sentenced Gareia-Arrieta to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years of supervised release on each count, to run concurrently. Gareia-Arrieta timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">On appeal, Gareia-Arrieta argues that the district court erred when it deferred to the government\u2019s assessment of the truthfulness and completeness of the information he provided regarding his offense conduct in connection with his request for \u201csafety-valve\u201d relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Garcia-Arrieta cites <em>United States v. Espinosa, </em>172 F.3d 795 (11th Cir.1999), in support of his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">We agree with Gareia-Arrieta that <em>Espinosa </em>controls this case. In <em>Espinosa, </em>the district court deferred to the government\u2019s assessment of the truthfulness of a statement the defendant provided to support his request for safety-valve relief. <em>Espinosa, </em>172 F.3d at 796-97. We vacated and remanded for resentencing, holding that \u201c[t]he district court erred in deferring to the Government; the responsibility for determining the truthfulness of the information the defendant provided to the Government was the court\u2019s.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">In resolving the parties\u2019 arguments concerning the completeness and truthfulness of Garcia-Arrieta\u2019s disclosure in this case, the district court stated that \u201cthe completeness of [Garcia-Arrieta\u2019s disclosure] is in the hands of the government, and this Court is going to honor that\u201d and \u201c[i]t is not the role of the Court to determine whether or not you have been complete and truthful with regard to what you have told the law enforcement agents.\u201d This was an improper deferral to the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>ment of the district court\u2019s responsibility for determining the truthfulness and completeness of Garcia-Arrieta\u2019s disclosure. <em>See id. </em>While the district court should certainly consider the government\u2019s evaluation, it is the district court\u2019s ultimate duty to make a fact finding as to whether a defendant \u201chas truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(5). Therefore, we must vacate and remand to the district court for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to make the required fact finding as to the truthfulness and completeness of Garcia-Arrieta\u2019s disclosure. The burden of proof on the issue lies with Garcia-Arrieta.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Although we vacate Garcia-Arrieta\u2019s sentences, we point out that he raises no challenge to the advisory Guidelines calculation or range other than the safety-valve issue. Thus, on remand, the only issue to be addressed is whether Garcia-Arrieta is entitled to a safety-valve reduction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">For the above reasons, we vacate Garcia-Arrieta\u2019s sentences and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b946-7\">. The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level \"safety-valve\u201d reduction in the offense level for certain drug-related crimes if the defendant meets five criteria as set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(7). The fifth safety-valve factor requires the defendant to show that: \"not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b947-11\">. We do not suggest that on remand the district court must impose any particular sentence or that the district court is not free to impose the same sentence. Furthermore, as this is a limited remand to permit the district court to determine the truthfulness and completeness of Garcia-Arrieta's disclosure, Garcia-Arrieta may not re-argue issues already or necessarily decided during the first sentencing which either have been affirmed in this appeal or could have been but were not raised by him during this appeal. <em>See United States v. Davis, 329 </em>F.3d 1250, 1252 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that when the appellate court issues a limited mandate, \"the trial court is restricted in the range of issues it may consider on remand\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
