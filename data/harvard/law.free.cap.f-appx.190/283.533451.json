In criminal cases, the defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>see United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>(holding that \u00a7 3582 proceeding is criminal in nature and ten-day appeal period applies). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The district court entered its order denying the motion for reduction of sentence on October 11, 2005, and the ten-day appeal period ordinarily would have expired on October 25, 2005. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26 (providing that \u201cintermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays\u201d are excluded when the time period is less than eleven days). Although Pabell\u00f3n did not file a notice of appeal within this ten-day period, she filed a motion for reconsideration on October 19, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Although \u201cthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not specifically provide for motions for reconsideration and prescribe the time in which they must be filed,\u201d <em>Nilson Van &amp; Storage Co. v. Marsh, </em>755 F.2d 362, 364 (4th Cir.1985), the Supreme Court has held that a motion for rehearing or reconsideration extends the time for filing a notice of appeal in a criminal case if the motion is filed before the order sought to be reconsidered becomes final. <em>See United States v. Ibarra, </em>502 U.S. 1, 4 n. 2, 112 S.Ct. 4, 116 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991) (holding that would-be appellants who file a timely motion for reconsideration from a criminal judgment are entitled to the full time period for noticing the appeal after the motion to reconsider has been decided); <em>United States v. Dieter, </em>429 U.S. 6, 7-8, 97 S.Ct. 18, 50 L.Ed.2d 8 (1976) (same); <em>United States v. Healy, </em>376 U.S. 75, 77-79, 84 S.Ct. 553,11 L.Ed.2d 527 (1964) (same); <em>United States v. Christy, </em>3 F.3d 765, 767 n. 1 (4th Cir.1993) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The district court entered its oral order denying Pabellon\u2019s motion to reconsider on October 25, 2005; she then had ten days or until November 8, 2005, to timely file her notice of appeal. Pabellon\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on November 16, 2005, after the expiration of the appeal period but within the thirty-day excusable neglect period. Because the notice of appeal was filed within the excusable neglect period, we remand the case to the district court; for the court to determine whether Pabell\u00f3n has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
