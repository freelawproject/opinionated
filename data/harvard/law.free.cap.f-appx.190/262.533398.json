Following a sentencing hearing, the jury recommended a sentence of death for the murder conviction and, in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict, the state trial court sentenced Daughtry to death for that conviction. After exhausting his state remedies, Daughtry filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, which the district court dismissed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 27, 2005, we granted Daughtry a certificate of appealability, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2253. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Daughtry\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b290-17\">As found by the North Carolina Supreme Court on direct appeal, the facts of this case are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-18\">The State\u2019s evidence tended to show that the victim was killed on 9 April 1992. At that time she was living with her boyfriend, Michael Hopkins, in his Smithfield apartment. Hopkins testified that he last saw the victim alive at about 4:00 p.m., just before he went to bed. When he awoke around 7:30 p.m., he discovered the victim\u2019s body lying in a pool of blood near the front steps outside his apartment. Hopkins ran to his landlady\u2019s house and called the police; he waited at the end of the driveway until the officers arrived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-19\">The Smithfield Police Department received a call at 7:38 p.m., and officers arrived at Hopkins\u2019 apartment a few minutes later. They found the victim\u2019s naked body face down next to the apartment steps. Her head lay in a pool of blood, and a stick protruded from her rectum. Her left arm extended along the left side of her body, palm up; her right index finger was in her mouth. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>SBI Special Agent David McDougall examined the scene. He found several articles of the victim\u2019s clothing on the ground near the body and a three-inch-thick log containing blood and strands of hair atop a woodpile not far away. He saw no signs of a struggle or other violence inside the apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">Dr. Karen Chancellor, a forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy, testified that she found multiple bruises and abrasions on the victim\u2019s head, face, and neck. The lower jawbone was fractured in two places, and the back of the scalp had four separate lacerations, each exposing bone. She also found multiple skull fractures, hemorrhaging around the brain and brain stem, and bruises of the brain tissue. Chancellor testified that both internal and external lacerations existed in and around the vagina and rectum. Further, the injuries around the rectal area were consistent with an object being rotated in the rectum. She opined that death resulted from blunt-force trauma to the head, the victim had been hit at least five times, and the log McDougall found could have been used to inflict the injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">SBI Special Agent Scott Worsham testified that hair taken from the log was consistent with the victim\u2019s. He removed the stick from the victim\u2019s rectum under McDougall\u2019s supervision. The stick had been embedded about six and one-half inches into the rectum and inserted at such an angle that it could have penetrated some other part of the body, such as the vaginal area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">SBI Special Agent Mark T. Boodee, an expert in forensic serology, testified about the results of DNA testing, which revealed that blood samples taken from the pants defendant wore on the night of the murder contained DNA material that matched the victim\u2019s. SBI Special Agent Peter Duane Deaver, another expert forensic serologist, testified that blood found on the log and on defendant\u2019s pants was the same type as the victim\u2019s blood but not the same as defendant\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">Defendant testified that he and the victim had lived together for about three and one-half years; they broke up in March 1992. On the day of the murder he left work around 3:00 p.m., drank some beer on the way home, and also drank a few beers at a local tavern. He arrived at his grandmother\u2019s house, where he was living, between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m. He then went to Mike Hopkins\u2019 home at about 6:30. He and the victim sat on the steps outside the apartment talking for a while. The next thing he remembered was being two or three blocks away from Hopkins\u2019 apartment, walking in an agitated state. He noticed a little blood on his hand. He then met some friends and drank with them from 8:30 until about 11:00 p.m. He did not get drunk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">Two psychiatric experts testified for defendant. Dr. Robert Rollins testified that defendant had average intelligence and no major disturbance of mood or thinking. Defendant was distrustful, expected people to mistreat him, and lacked concern about other people. Rollins diagnosed defendant with alcohol abuse and dependence as well as adjustment disorder, which included depression. Dr. Billy Royal diagnosed defendant with depression, alcohol and marijuana abuse, and personality disorder. He considered the disorder to include immaturity, impulsivity, and dependence in the relationship with the victim. Both doctors opined that defendant\u2019s ability to form a specific intent to kill and to premeditate and deliberate was impaired on 9 April 1992. Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>also noted defendant\u2019s history of violence toward the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">At sentencing the State relied on its guilt phase evidence and also introduced an eight-by-ten-inch photograph that depicted the stick protruding from the victim\u2019s rectum. This photograph had been excluded from the guilt phase. Defendant\u2019s sister testified at sentencing that defendant supported the victim as best he could and always helped his two deaf brothers. She also stated that their father, who was not at home much due to his work, hit defendant and assaulted their mother. Further, defendant used various drugs, including marijuana and cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">Psychiatric testimony offered at sentencing showed that defendant grew up in a dysfunctional family environment that included abuse of his mother and severe punishment of defendant for his transgressions. He became dependent upon alcohol early in his teenage years; this dependence exacerbated the difficulty he experienced in dealing with the end of his relationship with the victim. According to the expert testimony, defendant suffered from depression, substance dependence, and personality disorder at the time of trial.'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\"><em>State v. Daughtry, </em>340 N.C. 488, 459 SR .2d 747, 752-54 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">On May 11, 1992, Daughtry was indicted by a state grand jury sitting in Johnston County, North Carolina on charges of first-degree murder and first-degree sexual offense. On September 30, 1993, a jury convicted Daughtry of both offenses. The murder conviction rested on both premeditation and the felony murder rule, with the underlying felony being the first-degree sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">At the sentencing phase of the bifurcated proceeding, the State submitted, and the jury found the existence of, two aggravating circumstances: (1) the capital felony was committed while Daughtry was engaged in a sexual offense; and (2) the capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. The jury found one statutory mitigating circumstance (the capital felony was committed while Daughtry was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance) and fourteen of the nineteen nonstatutory mitigating circumstances submitted. After finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, the jury unanimously recommended a sentence of death, which the state trial court accordingly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">On direct appeal, the Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed, finding no error in either phase of Daughtry\u2019s trial. <em>See id. </em>at 754-70. On January 16, 1996, the United States Supreme Court denied Daughtry\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. <em>See Daughtry v. North Carolina, </em>516 U.S. 1079, 116 S.Ct. 789, 133 L.Ed.2d 739 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">On April 29, 1996, the Superior Court for Johnston County set an execution date for Daughtry. The court also appointed two attorneys to assist Daughtry in the preparation of a motion for appropriate relief (MAR). On June 24,1996, Daughtry moved for a stay of execution, which was denied. Daughtry appealed the denial of his motion for stay of execution to the North Carolina Supreme Court. The North Carolina Supreme Court granted relief in the form of allowing Daughtry time to prepare and file a MAR on or before October 28,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">On August 19, 1996, Daughtry filed a <em>pro se </em>\u201cMotion to Cancel Appeal,\u201d wherein he requested that his stay of execution be lifted and his sentence of death carried out. Upon inquiry by the Superior Court of Johnston County, Daughtry, through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>counsel, indicated that he did not wish to withdraw his motion to withdraw his appeal. The court then ordered that Daughtry be evaluated to determine his competency to decide to forego his post-conviction remedies and proceed to execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On October 21, 1996, a hearing was held in Johnston County Superior Court to determine Daughtry\u2019s competency. At the outset of the hearing, the court asked Daughtry if he wished to continue with his \u201cMotion to Cancel Appeal,\u201d but Daughtry declined to answer the question. The court then asked Daughtry if he wished to have his post-conviction counsel represent him and Daughtry indicated that he did so wish. Among the evidence submitted at the hearing was the mental health evaluation of Dr. Robert Rollins, a forensic psychiatrist, and a \u201crecord of contact\u201d between Daughtry and Dr. M.F. Baloch, Daughtry\u2019s treating psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The record of contact indicated that, on August 7, 1996, Dr. Baloch found that Daughtry: (1) \u201cdenied any symptoms\u201d; (2) was \u201cclinically stable\u201d; (3) \u201cdenied auditory and visual hallucinations\u201d; (4) denied \u201csuicidal or homicidal ideations\u201d; (5) denied depression; and (5) had a stable mood.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">According to Dr. Rollins\u2019 evaluation, he met Daughtry on two occasions, once on September 24, 1996 and again on October 8, 1996. Dr. Rollins noted that Daughtry\u2019s speech was \u201cdear\u201d and that his thinking was \u201corganized.\u201d He also noted that Daughtry\u2019s perception, concentration, orientation, memory, and intellectual functions were \u201cintact.\u201d During the interviews, Daughtry stated a desire to withdraw his appeal and proceed to execution to \u201cescape the stress of his present situation.\u201d Daughtry complained that \u201cvoices\u201d were \u201cdriving [him] to do this.\u201d According to Dr. Rollins, these auditory hallucinations were affecting Daughtry\u2019s judgment. Ultimately, Dr. Rollins diagnosed Daughtry as having major depression with psychotic features, although he could not rule out other possible diagnoses, including malingering. Based on the available information before him, Dr. Rollins concluded that Daughtry had a mental disorder which impaired his ability to make reasoned and rational judgments. According to Dr. Rollins, Daughtry understood \u201chis position with regard to the law and the nature and object of the proceedings against him.\u201d However, Dr. Rollins indicated that Daughtry\u2019s \u201cability to cooperate with his attorneys and conduct a defense in a rational manner\u201d was impaired. Consequently, Dr. Rollins concluded that Daughtry was not competent to make the decision to withdraw his appeals, although he did add that Daughtry was \u201ccompetent to [be executed] in that he understands that transaction.\u201d Dr. Rollins further concluded that, if Daughtry \u201cwere less depressed, he likely would not wish to withdraw his appeals and overall would be more comfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Following the October 21 hearing, the Johnston County Superior Court entered an order on October 24, 1996 finding that: (1) Daughtry\u2019s \u201cdecision to remain mute was a decision made\u201d by Daughtry and was not the result of any mental impairment; (2) Daughtry\u2019s \u201cconduct, considered in light of all of the evidence, appears to be a dilatory tactic to delay post conviction remedies allowed by law\u201d; and (3) Daughtry was \u201cwillfully\u201d refusing to assist his attorneys even though he is in fact able \u201cto assist his attorneys to the extent necessary in pursuing post-conviction remedies.\u201d In light of these findings, the court held that Daughtry\u2019s \u201cMotion to Cancel Appeal\u201d was \u201cnull and void\u201d because Daughtry refused to answer the court\u2019s question concerning his desire to abandon post-conviction rem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>edies and proceed with execution. The court also held that Daughtry was competent to assist his attorneys.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">On October 28, 1996, Daughtry filed his MAR, asserting a claim under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and twenty-three claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. While his MAR was pending, Daughtry filed a motion \u201cQuestioning the Capacity of the Defendant.\u201d The motion asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that Daughtry was unable to assist post-conviction counsel. On June 30, 1997, a hearing was held in Johnston County Superior Court concerning Daughtry\u2019s competency to assist counsel. At the hearing, Daughtry proffered the expert testimony of a psychiatrist, Dr. James Bellard.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Dr. Bellard testified that Daughtry was suffering from major depression with psychotic features, the same diagnosis offered by Dr. Rollins at the October 21, 1996 competency hearing. According to Dr. Bellard, Daughtry was able to understand the nature and the object of the proceedings against him and was aware of his surroundings, the reason he was in prison, and the reason he was sentenced to death. Dr. Bellard also found Daughtry\u2019s memory to be intact and that Daughtry had low to normal intelligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Dr. Bellard also testified as to Daughtry\u2019s ability to consult with counsel. Dr. Bellard testified that Daughtry was unable to assist his defense in a rational or reasonable manner because of his ambivalence about going forward with his appeals or ending them and being executed. According to Dr. Bellard, Daughtry\u2019s ambivalence was \u201ccomplicated\u201d by his depression and auditory hallucinations. Dr. Bellard testified that Daughtry \u201chasn\u2019t demonstrated an ability to be consistent about what is before him and how to work with attorneys.\u201d Dr. Bellard added that Daughtry \u201cis unclear about what he wishes to do, and I believe, is unclear about the role he may or may not play in all this.\u201d Although Dr. Bellard testified that alleged auditory hallucinations were one reason Daughtry wanted to end his appeals, Daughtry also gave him clear and rational reasons to end his appeals apart from any voices; for example, Daughtry indicated that he wanted to end his appeals because: (1) \u201che didn\u2019t see any sense in\u201d appealing; (2) \u201che wanted an end to the waiting\u201d; and (3) the appeals were \u201ctaking a toll on his family.\u201d Dr. Bellard indicated that being ambivalent about a decision which would end one\u2019s life was normal. Like Dr. Rollins, Dr. Bellard was unable to determine whether Daughtry was truthful about the voices he heard. The state court asked if a motive for Daughtry\u2019s malingering could be to forestall the death penalty, to which Dr. Bellard answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">At the June 30, 1997 hearing, the State introduced the testimony of Sally Gainey, the victim\u2019s mother. She testified that she had known Daughtry for ten years. While he was dating the victim, Daughtry lived in Gainey\u2019s home. Gainey had loved Daughtry much like she would one of her own children. As a result of a letter from Daughtry, Gainey visited Daughtry at Central Prison in February 1997. During her conversation with Daughtry, Gainey detected no difference in Daughtry\u2019s demeanor from the Daughtry she had always known. Daughtry also told Gainey that he was not going to help his counsel with his post-conviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>On July 1, 1997, based upon the evidence and the testimony proffered at the June 30 hearing, the Johnston County Superior Court found that Daughtry\u2019s \u201cdepression and extreme ambivalence\u201d towards being executed did not render him unable to assist his post-conviction counsel. The court also found that Daughtry was making a deliberate choice not to cooperate with his counsel. The court found that Daughtry was able to both \u201cunderstand the nature and object of the proceedings against him\u201d and \u201ccomprehend his own situation in reference to the proceedings.\u201d As a result of the evidence before it, the court concluded that there was no justifiable reason for the court to reconsider or vacate its October 24, 1996 order finding Daughtry competent to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Free to decide the MAR on the merits, the state habeas court denied Daughtry\u2019s MAR. On July 8, 1998, the Supreme Court of North Carolina denied Daughtry\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. <em>See State v. Daughtry, </em>348 N.C. 503, 510 S.E.2d 660 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">On October 13, 1998, Daughtry filed his federal habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. On August 27, 2003, the district court held that Daughtry was not entitled to federal habeas corpus relief and dismissed the petition. Thereafter, Daughtry filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">While his appeal in this court was pending, a \u201cPetition for Adjudication of Incompetence and Application for Appointment of Guardian\u201d was filed in Wake County Superior Court by one of Daughtry\u2019s counsel. In the petition, Daughtry\u2019s counsel sought to have Daughtry declared incompetent based on, among other things, Daughtry\u2019s refusal to meet with and communicate with his counsel. Daughtry\u2019s counsel also indicated that, in a letter authored by Daughtry in November 2003, Daughtry stated a desire to \u201ccancel all appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">As a result of Daughtry\u2019s stated desire to withdraw his appeal to this court, on March 25, 2004, the State filed in this court a motion for remand. In its motion, the State argued that Daughtry\u2019s appeal should be remanded to the district court for a hearing on and determination of Daughtry\u2019s desire to pursue his appeal to this court. On April 21, 2004, we granted the State\u2019s motion and remanded the case to the district court for the limited purpose of making factual findings concerning whether Daughtry desired to appeal the denial of his federal habeas petition and any related competency questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">In preparation for the proceeding before the district court, the State had Dr. Robert Brown, a forensic psychiatrist, evaluate Daughtry. In his evaluation, Dr. Brown noted that Daughtry\u2019s \u201cspeech was clear and well articulated.\u201d He also noted that Daughtry\u2019s thoughts were \u201clogical and linear.\u201d He noted that Daughtry\u2019s \u201cconcentration was good\u201d and he \u201cfollowed along appropriately during the evaluation.\u201d Dr. Brown noted that Daughtry wanted to \u201ccease his appeals\u201d because it \u201cwas his choice, his life, and that [he] would pay for his crime.\u201d Daughtry indicated that his decision to withdraw his appeal was not due to \u201chearing voices.\u201d He also indicated that his attorneys instructed him \u201cnot to work on the case.\u201d During his meeting with Dr. Brown, Daughtry was able to list the books that he had read recently and to describe in detail his religious views.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">Dr. Brown also described several letters Daughtry wrote Sally Gainey, the victim\u2019s mother. In the letters, Daughtry expressed extreme remorse and an intention to ignore his counsels\u2019 advice not to meet Gainey and her family alone. According to Dr. Brown, nothing in the letters suggest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ed that mental illness was driving Daughtry\u2019s decision to withdraw his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Dr. Brown diagnosed Daughtry as suffering from \u201cPersonality Disorder, NOS (Cluster B), ... with episodes of depression and auditory hallucinations flowing from the Personality Disorder diagnosis during times of intense stress.\u201d On the subject of Daughtry\u2019s competency, Dr. Brown concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">It is clear that [Daughtry] understands the legal processes that he has faced and that he has the ability to function within the legal process if he chooses to do so. There is not present a mental disease or defect that would cause him to be unable to meaningfully consult with attorneys if he chose to do so. Mr. Daughtry has the necessary transactional abilities to proceed with post conviction appeals if he chose to do so.... Mr. Daughtry is not mentally retarded and his diagnosed mental disorders and the medications he takes for them would not impair his ability to understand the appeals process in a factual and rational manner. In short, his cognitive functioning is good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">Mr. Daughtry understands the adversarial process. He has the ability to disclose pertinent facts and to voice choices he has made, and his behavior at this time is not inappropriate or disorganized. His decision to discontinue the appeals at this time, in my professional opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, is not coerced by mental illness. Therefore, with all relevant facts considered I am of the professional opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Mr. Daughtry is seeking to waive his appeals in a knowingly and intelligent manner that is also voluntary in that it is free of coercion from mental illness. He is not ambivalent about his choice to cease his appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">Mr. Daughtry believes that his [trial] was fair, and he seems to concur with the sentence given to him. He has expressed remorse. Mr. Daughtry is weary of life on death row, but he is not suicidal. If by miracle the governor should pardon him, he would not seek to die. Mr. Daughtry knows why the state is seeking to execute him, and he understands the concept of death and the method of lethal injection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">On May 9, 2005, while the case was pending in the district court, Daughtry\u2019s counsel filed a motion in the district court requesting the court to declare moot all issues on remand based upon a letter written by Daughtry indicating that he wished to continue his appeal and was willing to assist his counsel in the appellate process. On June 3, 2005, the district court found that Daughtry was competent and wished to pursue his appeal. In reaching its decision, the court relied on Dr. Brown\u2019s evaluation and Daughtry\u2019s letter indicating that he did not wish to withdraw his appeal. After the case returned to this court, we granted Daughtry a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">Daughtry first argues that the State withheld or suppressed critical crime scene evidence such that he was prejudiced during the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial in violation of <em>Brady. </em>According to Daughtry, the State withheld several reports by the investigating agents from the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation (SBI), including the May 6, 1992 report by SBI Special Agent P. Duane Deaver and the April 20, 1992 and April 16, 1993 reports by SBI Special Agent W. Scott Worsham. In a nutshell, Daughtry claims that these reports would have provided the following materially exculpatory evidence: (1) the victim\u2019s shorts and pant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ies were soaked with urine; (2) additional logs containing blood were found at the crime scene; and (3) bicycle tire tracks were found near the victim\u2019s body.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose evidence favorable to an accused \u201cviolates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s duty encompasses both impeachment and exculpatory evidence, and it includes evidence that is \u201cknown only to police investigators and not to the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 438, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). Along these lines, \u201cthe individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\u2019s behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555. Significantly, a <em>Brady </em>violation has three essential elements: (1) the evidence must be favorable to the accused; (2) it must have been suppressed by the government, either willfully or inadvertently; and (3) the suppression must have been material, <em>i.e., </em>it must have prejudiced the defense at trial. <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). Prejudice exists when there is a reasonable probability that, had the prosecution disclosed the suppressed evidence, the result of the trial would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 289,119 S.Ct. 1936.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">As to the urine soaked shorts and panties, Special Agent Deaver\u2019s May 6, 1992 report indicates that the victim\u2019s shorts and panties, which were recovered near her body, were \u201cwet[, and] smell[ed] of urine.\u201d According to Daughtry, had his trial counsel known that the shorts and panties were soaked with urine, his trial counsel would have been able to demonstrate that the victim was dead before her vaginal injuries occurred. According to Daughtry, if the sexual offense occurred after death, he was not only innocent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the sexual offense charge but also ineligible for the death penalty under the murder in the commission of a sexual offense aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">With regard to this evidence, Daughtry has failed to show that the result of either phase of his trial would have been different had the evidence concerning the victim\u2019s shorts and panties been disclosed. First, we note that the North Carolina Supreme Court has rejected the argument that a sexual offense can only occur while the victim is alive. <em>See State v. Thomas, </em>329 N.C. 423, 407 S.E.2d 141, 149-50 (1991) (holding that a sexual offense can occur after death as long as the sexual offense and the death are so connected as to form a continuous chain of events). In <em>Thomas, </em>the defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his felony murder conviction because the evidence established that the insertion of a telephone receiver into the victim\u2019s vagina occurred after her death. <em>Id. </em>at 148-49. The North Carolina Supreme Court rejected this claim, concluding that, \u201c[b]eeause the sexual act was committed during a continuous transaction that began when the victim was alive, ... the evidence was sufficient to support defendant\u2019s conviction for first-degree sexual offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149; <em>see also id. </em>at 150 (\u201cWhile the first-degree sexual offense (the insertion of the receiver into her vagina) could have occurred before or after the victim\u2019s death, clearly, it occurred near the time of the victim\u2019s final demise during a continuous transaction.\u201d). In our case, the sexual offense, like the sexual offense in <em>Thomas, </em>was part of a continuous transaction. Because the sexual offense in this case was committed as part of a continuous transaction, Daughtry was guilty of committing a sexual offense and eligible for the death penalty under the murder in the commission of a sexual offense aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Second, even if North Carolina recognized the principle that the sexual offense had to occur before death, the evidence concerning the urine soaked shorts and panties would have been of little help to Daughtry considering the evidence presented at his trial. When asked whether a person at death is likely to \u201cloose control of their bowels and bladder,\u201d Dr. Chancellor, who performed the autopsy on the victim, did not indicate that it was likely that a person loses control of either function. In fact, in reference to bowel movements, Dr. Chancellor specifically stated that there was \u201cno particular rule about that.\u201d Considering this testimony, it is clear that the presence of urine on the victim\u2019s shorts and panties was immaterial to the question of when the victim died. Moreover, the use of this evidence by Daughtry had an obvious downside. It would have opened the door for the State to argue that Daughtry\u2019s actions on the night of the murder were so threatening that they caused the victim to wet her shorts and panties. Thus, the use of this evidence obviously would have caused more harm than good. In short, a review of the record leads to the inescapable conclusion that Daughtry would have been convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death even if the evidence concerning the urine soaked shorts and panties was placed before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We now turn to Daughtry\u2019s claim that the State\u2019s alleged failure to disclose the evidence concerning the additional logs containing blood and the evidence concerning the bicycle tire tracks violated <em>Brady. </em>According to Daughtry, had this evidence been disclosed, his trial counsel would have been in a position to argue that the victim was either attacked by more than one person or that another person committed the sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>We harbor no doubt that, had the evidence concerning the additional logs and bicycle tire tracks been disclosed to the defense, the result of Daughtry\u2019s trial and sentencing would not have been different. The case against Daughtry was exceedingly strong. Daughtry\u2019s own testimony placed him at the crime scene. He testified that, immediately prior to the victim\u2019s death, they talked <em>\u201ca </em>good 10,15 minutes\u201d; that the next thing he remembered was being \u201ctwo or three blocks away\u201d; that he \u201cwas real hyper [and] agitated\u201d; that he \u201cnoticed there was a little bit of blood on [his] hand\u201d; and that he wanted to go back to the Hopkins\u2019 residence to see \u201cif she was okay, because she was the last person [he] was with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Dr. Karen Chancellor testified that the victim suffered multiple bruises and abrasions to her head, face, and neck. The victim\u2019s lower jawbone was fractured in two places and the back of her scalp had four separate lacerations, each exposing bone. Dr. Chancellor also found multiple skull fractures, hemorrhaging around the brain and brain stem, and bruises of the brain tissue. Dr. Chancellor testified that both internal and external lacerations existed in and around the vagina and rectum. Further, the injuries around the rectal area were consistent with an object being rotated in the rectum. Dr. Chancellor opined that death resulted from blunt-force trauma to the head, the victim had been hit at least five times, and a log found at the scene could have been used to inflict the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Forensic evidence also tied Daughtry to the crime scene. Hair removed from the log was consistent with the victim\u2019s hair. Blood found on the log and on Daughtry\u2019s pants was the same type as the victim\u2019s blood but not the same as Daughtry\u2019s blood. Also, the results of DNA testing revealed that blood samples taken from the pants Daughtry wore on the night of the murder contained DNA material that matched the victim\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">In view of all of this overwhelming evidence, the jury would have unhesitatingly rejected Daughtry\u2019s speculative assertion that somebody else (other than Daughtry and the victim) was present at the crime scene. There is no meaningful hair or blood evidence suggesting that another person was present at the crime scene. Daughtry\u2019s own testimony in the case does not suggest that another person was present and, in fact, he openly acknowledged that he was the last person with the victim. In his confession, Daughtry indicated that he hit the victim, but did not know how many times he had done so. After Daughtry was told by Detective Fred Dees that he had inserted a \u201ctree limb\u201d into the victim\u2019s rectum, Daughtry cried and asked Lieutenant R.J. Cuddington \u201cto place a bullet between his eyes.\u201d Given this evidence, it is understandable why the main thrust of Daughtry\u2019s defense centered on the lack of premeditation and deliberation. Finally, the additional logs and bicycle tire tracks evidence was of marginal, if any, exculpatory value. The blood stains found on the additional logs is not surprising considering that Detective Walter Martin found the three-inch-thick log containing the victim\u2019s blood and strands of her hair atop a woodpile a short distance from the victim\u2019s body. The presence of bicycle tire tracks found at the crime scene was not surprising when one considers that the location of the tracks was near the entrance of the apartment. Thus, while this evidence was at best of marginal exculpatory value if introduced, the jury would not have placed reliance on such speculative evidence to conclude that there was another person present at the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">In sum, when one considers the cumulative effect of all of the allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>undisclosed exculpatory or impeachment evidence and the role it would have played in the trial, it simply cannot be said that there is a reasonable probability of a different result during either phase of Daughtry\u2019s trial. <em>Cf Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 291-96, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (denying relief where, in light of the considerable forensic and other physical evidence linking petitioner to the crime, petitioner did not show a reasonable probability of a different outcome had the suppressed evidence been disclosed).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Daughtry also claims that the competency determinations made in state court (on October 24, 1996 and July 1, 1997) were unreasonable under clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We may grant a habeas petition with respect to any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the state court decision was either contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court or the decision was based on an unreasonable application of the facts. <em>Robinson v. Polk, </em>438 F.3d 350, 354-55 (4th Cir.2006). \u201cA decision of a state court is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the Supreme Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the Supreme Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355 (citation, internal quotation marks, and alterations omitted). \u201cA state court adjudication is an unreasonable application of federal law when the state court correctly identifies the governing legal rule from the Supreme Court\u2019s cases but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular case or applies a precedent in a context different from the one in which the precedent was decided and one to which extension of the legal principle of the precedent is not reasonable or fails to apply the principle of a precedent in a context where such failure is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355 (citations, internal quotation marks, and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from trying and convicting mentally incompetent defendants. <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 384-86, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>815 (1966).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The test for determining competency is whether \u201c[a defendant] has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>862 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960). \u201c \u2018Not every manifestation of mental illness demonstrates incompetence ...; rather, the evidence must indicate a present inability to assist counsel or understand the charges.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burket v. Angelone, </em>208 F.3d 172, 192 (4th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States ex rel. Foster v. DeRobertis, </em>741 F.2d 1007, 1012 (7th Cir.1984)). Similarly, \u201cneither low intelligence, mental deficiency, nor bizarre, volatile, and irrational behavior can be equated with mental incompetence.\u201d <em>Burket, </em>208 F.3d at 192.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Whether a defendant is competent is a question of fact. <em>See Mackey v. Dutton, </em>217 F.3d 399, 412 (6th Cir.2000) (competency to stand trial). We also must accord the state court\u2019s determination that Daughtry was competent to assist counsel a presumption of correctness under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). <em>See Demosthenes v. Baal, </em>495 U.S. 731, 735,110 S.Ct. 2223,109 L.Ed.2d 762 (1990) (concluding that a state court\u2019s competency determination is entitied to a presumption of correctness on federal habeas review). Thus, \u201cwe presume the [state] court\u2019s factual findings to be sound unless [Daughtry] rebuts the \u2018presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller-El v. Dretke, </em>545 U.S. 231, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 2325, 162 L.Ed.2d 196 (2005) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">In this case, on two occasions, the Johnston County Superior Court found Daughtry competent to assist his counsel on post-conviction review. With regard to the October 24, 1996 competency determination, on the one hand, there was ample evidence before the Johnston County Superior Court indicating that Daughtry had the ability to communicate and assist counsel. Dr. Rollins noted that Daughtry\u2019s speech was \u201cclear\u201d and that his thinking was \u201corganized.\u201d He also noted that Daughtry\u2019s perception, concentration, orientation, memory, and intellectual functions were \u201cintact.\u201d Dr. Rollins also noted that Daughtry understood \u201chis position with regard to the law and the nature and object of the proceedings against him.\u201d Dr. Rollins also could not rule out malingering as a cause for Daughtry\u2019s auditory hallucinations. The \u201crecord of contact,\u201d authored by Dr. Baloch (Daughtry\u2019s treating psychiatrist) less than two weeks prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>time Daughtry filed his \u201cMotion to Cancel Appeal,\u201d found that Daughtry: (1) \u201cdenied any symptoms\u201d; (2) was \u201cclinically stable\u201d; (3) \u201cdenied auditory and visual hallucinations\u201d; (4) denied \u201csuicidal or homicidal ideations\u201d; (5) denied depression; and (5) had a stable mood. Finally, when questioned by the court at the hearing, Daughtry expressed his verbal assent to having counsel represent him fully in post-conviction proceedings, but, when asked if he wanted to proceed with his \u201cMotion to Cancel Appeal,\u201d Daughtry refused to answer or in any way respond to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">On the other hand, there was evidence before the Johnston County Superior Court suggesting that Daughtry was unable to assist his counsel. Dr. Rollins diagnosed Daughtry as having major depression with psychotic features. Dr. Rollins found that Daughtry\u2019s alleged auditory hallucinations impaired Daughtry\u2019s ability to assist counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In this case, the Johnston County Superior Court took testimony, weighed the evidence, found that Daughtry was willfully refusing to assist his post-conviction counsel in order to delay his post-conviction proceeding, and concluded that Daughtry was competent and able to assist his post-conviction counsel. Obviously, the court was in the best position to make credibility determinations, assess the probative value of the evidence, and resolve conflicts in the evidence. The evidence in the record, as credited by the court, unquestionably supports the court\u2019s conclusion that Daughtry was competent and able to assist his post-conviction counsel. Thus, Daughtry has failed to rebut the court\u2019s October 24 1996 competency finding by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">With regard to the July 1, 1997 competency determination, again, on the one hand, there was ample evidence before the Johnston County Superior Court indicating that Daughtry had the ability to communicate and assist counsel. At the hearing, Dr. Bellard testified that Daughtry was able to understand the nature and the object of the proceedings against him and was aware of his surroundings, the reason he was in prison, and the reason he was sentenced to death. Dr. Bellard also found Daughtry\u2019s memory to be intact and that Daughtry had low to normal intelligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Dr. Bellard also testified as to Daughtry\u2019s ability to consult with counsel. Although Dr. Bellard testified that alleged auditory hallucinations were one reason Daughtry wanted to end his appeals, Daughtry also gave him clear and rational reasons to end his appeals apart from any voices; for example, Daughtry indicated that he wanted to end his appeals because: (1) \u201che didn\u2019t see any sense in\u201d appealing; (2) \u201che wanted an end to the waiting\u201d; and (3) the appeals were \u201ctaking a toll on his family.\u201d Like Dr. Rollins, Dr. Bellard was unable to determine whether Daughtry was truthful about the voices he heard. The state court asked if a motive for Daughtry\u2019s malingering could be to forestall the death penalty, to which Dr. Bellard answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">At the June 30, 1997 hearing, the State introduced the testimony of Sally Gainey, the victim\u2019s mother. As a result of a letter from Daughtry, Gainey visited Daughtry at Central Prison in February 1997. During her conversation with Daughtry, Gainey detected no difference in Daughtry\u2019s demeanor from the Daughtry she had always known. Daughtry also told Gainey that he was not going to help his attorneys with his post-conviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">On the other hand, there was evidence before the Johnston County Superior Court suggesting that Daughtry was unable to assist his counsel. Dr. Bellard testified that Daughtry was unable to as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>sist his defense in a rational or reasonable manner because of his ambivalence about going forward with his appeals or ending them and being executed. According to Dr. Bellard, Daughtry\u2019s ambivalence was \u201ccomplicated\u201d by his depression and auditory hallucinations. Dr. Bellard also testified that Daughtry \u201chasn\u2019t demonstrated an ability to be consistent about what is before him and how to work with attorneys.\u201d He added that Daughtry \u201cis unclear about what he wishes to do, and I believe, is unclear about the role he may or may not play in all this.\u201d Finally, Dr. Bellard indicated that he believed that Daughtry was being honest when he indicated that he was suffering from auditory hallucinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Like the October 24, 1996 competency determination, we cannot disturb the Johnston County Superior Court\u2019s July 1, 1997 competency determination. There was evidence before the court that allowed it to find that Daughtry was making a deliberate choice not to cooperate with his post-conviction counsel. While the auditory hallucinations were one explanation for Daughtry\u2019s decision not to assist his post-conviction counsel, there were other reasons, that if credited, would support the court\u2019s competency determination. Unquestionably, the court was at liberty to conclude that the alleged auditory hallucinations did not undermine Daughtry\u2019s ability to assist his counsel. Thus, it cannot be said that Daughtry has rebutted by clear and convincing evidence the court\u2019s July 1,1997 competency determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-12\">. Initially, Daughtry named James French, former Warden of the Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina as respondent. Now, Marvin Polk holds this position and has been substituted as respondent, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(d)(1). For ease of reference, we will refer to respondent as \"the State\u201d throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\">. Daughtry appealed the Johnston County Superior Court's October 1996 competency determination to the Supreme Court of North Carolina, which denied Daughtry\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari on February 7, 1997. <em>See State v. Daughtry, </em>345 N.C. 348, 483 S.E.2d 181 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\">. We note that the <em>Brady </em>claim Daughtry presses in this court was not raised either in state court or the district court below. In state court, Daughtry's <em>Brady </em>claim alleged that the State withheld evidence concerning Sally Gainey\u2019s desire not to see Daughtry executed. Here, Daughtry\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim relates to allegedly undisclosed SBI investigative reports. Obviously, Daughtry\u2019s failure to raise his present <em>Brady </em>claim in state court brings into play the principles of exhaustion and procedural default. Ordinarily, we are precluded from considering the merits of a defaulted claim absent a showing of cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>See Harris v. Reed, </em>489 U.S. 255, 262, 109 S.Ct. 1038, 103 L.Ed.2d 308 (1989). Moreover, Daughtry\u2019s failure to raise the claim in the court below is problematic, as this court usually does not entertain on appeal claims not raised below, <em>see Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 121, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976) (noting the general rule that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not addressed by the court below), and, at this late stage, Daughtry needs authorization from this court to file a successive petition to raise the claim, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. As a result of the procedural posture of the case, Daughtry filed during the pendency of this appeal a motion to amend the record to include the allegedly undisclosed materials and a motion to remand the case to the district court to allow the court to address Daughtry\u2019s new <em>Brady </em>claim in the first instance. We grant Daughtry\u2019s motion to amend. However, we deny the motion to remand because, for the reasons stated in this opinion, Daughtry\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim fails on the merits even if we accept his allegation that the allegedly undisclosed evidence was willfully or inadvertently withheld by the State. Because Daughtry\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim fails on the merits, we need not tackle the procedural questions that arise from Daughtry\u2019s failure to raise this claim in state court or the court below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b297-11\">. For purposes of our discussion, we will assume that the allegedly undisclosed evidence was willfully or inadvertently withheld by the State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\">. Daughtry also restates his <em>Brady </em>claim as a claim under North Carolina law. According to Daughtry, the State withheld materially exculpatory or impeachment evidence from Daughtry's trial and post-conviction counsel in violation of North Carolina General Statute \u00a7 ISA-1415(F), which, among other things, requires the \"State, to the extent allowed by law, [to] make available to the capital defendant\u2019s counsel the complete files of all law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies involved in the investigation of the crimes committed or the prosecution of the defendant.\u201d Unfortunately for Daughtry, a federal court may grant habeas relief only on the ground that the petitioner is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); <em>see also Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (emphasizing that \"it is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions. In conducting habeas review, a federal court is limited to deciding whether a conviction violated the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d). Because Daughtry's \u00a7 ISA-1415(f) claim rests solely upon an interpretation of North Carolina case law and statutes, it is simply not cognizable on federal habeas review. <em>See Wright v. Angelone, </em>151 F.3d 151, 157-58 (4th Cir.1998) (refusing to entertain under Virginia law the petitioner\u2019s claim that the state trial court lacked jurisdiction over two counts of petitioner\u2019s indictment); <em>Smith v. Moore, </em>137 F.3d 808, 822 (4th Cir.1998) (refusing to entertain claim that jury instruction misstated South Carolina law).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\">. The Constitution also prohibits the execution of the insane. See <em>Ford v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 399, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986). Daughtry does not raise a <em>Ford </em>claim at this time and, therefore, we need not address whether he is competent to be executed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\">. We note that the Supreme Court has not conclusively resolved the question of whether a person being held under a sentence of death has a right to be competent to pursue collateral review of a state conviction in state court. The constitutional requirement of competence to stand trial certainly does not imply a coordinate requirement on collateral review, as habeas is a \"secondary and limited\u201d component of the criminal justice process, <em>Barefoot </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 887, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983), where many of the defendant\u2019s rights no longer attach, like the right to counsel. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987) (holding that there is no constitutional right to counsel on habeas). However, for purposes of our discussion, we will assume that clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court requires that a capital habeas petitioner be competent on state habeas to assist his state habeas counsel. This assumption is of no help to Daughtry, because, for the reasons stated in the opinion, Daughtry\u2019s competency claim fails on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
