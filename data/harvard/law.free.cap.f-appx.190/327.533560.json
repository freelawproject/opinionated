The district court sentenced her to a 140-month term of imprisonment. Relying on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Montgomery appeals her sentence and asserts that it violates the Sixth Amendment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Montgomery contends that, in the absence of findings by the jury or admissions by her, the district court violated her Sixth Amendment rights by determining drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence. She therefore concludes that she is entitled to resentencing. The Government asserts, however, that Montgomery withdrew an objection to the recommendation in the presentence report holding her accountable for five ounces of crack cocaine and that such withdrawal constituted an admission under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">In <em>United States v. Milam, </em>443 F.3d 382, 383 (4th Cir.2006), we held that a defendant\u2019s failure to object to the facts set forth in the presentence report did not amount to an admission for Sixth Amendment purposes. The court noted that the \u201cSixth Amendment protections can be bypassed[ ][i]f the defendant ... admits the fact otherwise committed to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387. A defendant may admit facts through \u201cguilty pleas and stipulations, a defendant\u2019s own statements in open court, and representations by counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Revels, </em>455 F.3d 448, 450 (4th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). \u201cAny admission of fact must, of course, be of sufficient clarity and kind to justify taking the fact from the jury.\u201d <em>Milam, </em>443 F.3d at 387. Whether a defendant has admitted a fact for <em>Booker </em>purposes depends upon where a defendant\u2019s \u201cverbalizations ... fall along a spectrum\u201d from silence to \u201cstatements such as T admit,\u2019 or the functional equivalent thereof.\u201d <em>Revels, </em>455 F.3d at 450 (holding that defendant did not admit facts supporting sentencing enhancement where he lodged <em>Blakely </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> objection and replied \u201cNo, sir\u201d to court\u2019s inquiry as to \u201cwhether he had objections to anything contained or omitted from the [presentence report]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">Here, the presentence report attributed to Montgomery five ounces of crack based upon the fact that she told a confidential informant that she \u201cdid not have an \u20188-ball\u2019 because \u2018Jennifer\u2019 had flushed \u2018five ounces\u2019 down the toilet during an incident when the police arrived at Jennifer\u2019s house.\u201d (J.A. 124). Montgomery objected to the five-ounce amount on the ground that the controlled substance was marijuana \u2014 not crack cocaine. Because Montgomery refused to admit that the controlled substance was crack cocaine, the presentence report did not recommend a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>At the sentencing hearing, counsel represented that, after listening to a tape-recorded conversation between Montgomery and the informant during the controlled buy, Montgomery sought to withdraw the objection that the substance was not crack cocaine. Thus, the district court denied Montgomery\u2019s objection as moot. In light of the court\u2019s ruling, the Government then stated that \u201cin light of the fact ... that Ms. Montgomery has and is willing to accept responsibility for the five ounces of crack cocaine, it is the recommendation of the Government that she receive the three acceptance of responsibility points.\u201d (J.A. 72).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Taking these circumstances \u201cas a whole,\u201d <em>Revels, </em>455 F.3d at 450 the Government\u2019s statement operated as the functional equivalent of a stipulation regarding the five ounces of crack cocaine, with the attendant three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility inuring to Montgomery\u2019s benefit. Because the presentence report\u2019s recommendation regarding acceptance of responsibility hinged entirely on Montgomery\u2019s denial that the controlled substance was crack cocaine, the Government\u2019s statement and Montgomery\u2019s tacit assent to the reduction for acceptance of responsibility permit us to conclude that Montgomery knowingly waived her Sixth Amendment rights with respect to the five ounces of crack cocaine and that she admitted responsibility for that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Based on her admission, Montgomery was subject to a base offense level of thirty-two. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) (applicable to offenses involving at least fifty but less than 150 grams of crack). Without any downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), and with a criminal history category of III, the applicable guideline range would be 151 to 188 months of imprisonment. Because the 140-month sentence Montgomery received is below the guideline range calculated based upon her admission, no Sixth Amendment error occurred. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547-48 (4th Cir.2005) (discussing plain error standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Montgomery\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-12\"> <em>Blakely v.
