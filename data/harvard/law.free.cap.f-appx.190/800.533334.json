He again challenges his 110-month sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, arguing (1) that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), and (2) that his 110-month sentence is unreasonable. We affirm. In 2008, Molden was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and sentenced to 110 months\u2019 imprisonment. On direct appeal, we affirmed his conviction and sentence, rejecting his sentencing argument that the district court violated the \u201cspirit\u201d of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) by imposing a four-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), based on the court\u2019s finding that Molden possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense (an aggravated assault of a law enforcement officer that occurred in the course of the crime for which he was convicted). <em>See United States v. Molden, </em>Case No. 03-15931, 112 Fed.Appx. 3 (11th Cir.2004) (unpublished) <em>(\u201cMolden I\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">The Supreme Court vacated our <em>Molden I </em>decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On reconsideration, we held that the district court had committed (1) a <em>Booker </em>constitutional error by enhancing Molden\u2019s sentence based on facts not found by a jury, and (2) a <em>Booker </em>statutory error by applying the Guidelines as mandatory. The government conceded that it could not meet its burden of showing that these errors were harmless, and thus, we vacated Molden\u2019s sentence and remanded to the district court for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker. See United States v. Molden, </em>Case No. 03-15931,144 Fed.Appx. 11 (11th Cir.2005) (unpublished) <em>(\u201cMolden </em>II\u201d). In <em>Molden II, </em>we noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-11\">On remand, the district court is required to sentence Molden under an advisory Guidelines regime, and shall consider the Guidelines range and \u201cother statutory concerns as well, see [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp.2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757. By this order, we do not mean to imply that on remand the district court must impose a lesser sentence. Rather, we merely hold that the government has failed to meet its burden to show that the <em>Booker </em>error was harmless. We also will not attempt to decide now whether a particular sentence below or above the Guidelines range might be reasonable in this case, as that issue is not before us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-12\"><em>Id., </em>at 13 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">The district court conducted a resentencing hearing at which Molden made several arguments in favor of a lower sentence. According to the PSI, Molden\u2019s base offense level was 20 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). The probation officer recommended a four-level upward adjustment, pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), for possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense \u2014 an aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer \u2014 and a two-level upward adjustment, under \u00a7 3C1.2, for reckless endangerment during flight. Based on an adjusted offense level of 26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>and a criminal history category of V (from a total of 10 criminal history points), the advisory Guidelines range was 110 to 137 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">At the resentencing hearing, Molden argued (1) that, after <em>Booker, </em>it would be unfair to continue to sentence him based on facts not found by the jury; and (2) that the actual charged offense was not egregious because \u201cthere is nothing innately morally wrong about\u201d possessing a firearm when you are prohibited from doing so, and therefore, \u201cnine years for having a gun when you have a prior felony, and that is all, is an extremely egregious sentence\u201d. He admitted that he \u201coverreact[ed] to the situation and act[ed] in a hot-headed way,\u201d but argued that he was only 22 years old at the time and is \u201cnot a person who has a violent streak,\u201d but rather, is a \u201cthoughtful young man\u201d who is \u201credeemable\u201d and should have the rest of his life ahead of him, rather than spending nine years in prison. Molden suggested that the only way to cure the <em>Booker </em>error in his case would be for the district court not to impose the two offense level enhancements, totaling six offense levels, recommended by the PSI and applied in calculating his original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The government asserted that there was a factual basis for both enhancements that originally were applied, and therefore, that the Guidelines imprisonment range should remain the same. The government also urged the district court again to impose a sentence between 110 to 120 months, given the fact that this was \u201ca somewhat egregious felon in possession case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The district court found that \u201cthe Guidelines were properly computed in this case. I do believe that the enhancements that were made by the court were correct. And I\u2019m saying that now as the trier of fact on those issues. I think the range was properly derived.\u201d Thereafter, the court noted, \u201cI need to determine what sentence is reasonable,\u201d and elicited argument from the parties. The government stated that Molden\u2019s Guidelines imprisonment range of 110 to 137 months was \u201cmostly because of his prior criminal history,\u201d and because he \u201ccommitted the offense in a way that merited the enhancements.\u201d The government highlighted that this was Molden\u2019s <em>fifth </em>felony conviction, and that he \u201cis not some guy who is going to easily turn his life around.... \u201d The government also argued that it was appropriate for the court to consider Molden\u2019s criminal history in fashioning a reasonable sentence, as well as other factors, such as \u201chow society should be protected.\u201d The government asserted that Molden was a \u201cmenace,\u201d and therefore, concluded that a sentence within the Guidelines between 110 to 120 months would be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">The district court concluded that a 110-month sentence was reasonable in this case, noting that it had taken into account the nature and circumstances of the crime and Molden\u2019s criminal record, and that \u201c110 months is about right given the conviction and the facts surrounding the offense and [Molden\u2019s] prior record.\u201d Accordingly, the district court imposed the same sentence of 110 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release. This appeal, <em>\u201cMolden III, </em>\u201d followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">First, Molden asserts the district court erred by applying the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement. The government responds that the law-of-the-case doctrine precludes review of the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). In <em>Molden I, </em>in connection with our rejection of Molden\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>claim, we said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-10\">Section 2K2.1(b)(5) provides for a four-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. 2K2.1(b)(5). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>\u201c \u2018Felony offense,\u2019 as used in subsection (b)(5), means any offense (federal, state, or local) punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, whether or not a criminal charge was brought, or conviction obtained.\u201d U.S.S.G \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n.7). In <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1231 (11th Cir.2001), we affirmed application of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) adjustment where the defendant \u201crepeatedly attempted to reach into his left pant-pocket,\u201d in which a firearm was later found, during his resistance to police officers\u2019 attempt to arrest him. <em>Id. </em>at 1233-35. We concluded that, even though there was no evidence that the defendant armed himself as part of a preconceived plan to commit assault and battery upon a police officer and it was difficult to infer from the nature of the crime alone that the defendant intended to use the gun at the time of the assault, it was reasonable for the district court to find that \u201cthe defendant made a real and determined effort to use the gun in connection with the assault in some manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1235. <em>According to the PSI, as Molden fled on foot after crashing his motorcycle, he repeatedly attempted to reach for his weapon in his waistband in order to intimidate the troopers who were pursuing him. Accordingly, the record supports application of the enhancement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-5\"><em>Molden I, </em>slip op. at 11 n. 7 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The law-of-the-case doctrine provides that \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law by an appellate court are generally binding in all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on a later appeal.\u201d <em>Luckey v. Miller, </em>929 F.2d 618, 621 (11th Cir.1991) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe purpose of the law of the case doctrine is to establish efficiency, finality, and obedience within the judicial system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The law-of-the-case doctrine applies to findings made under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bordon, </em>421 F.3d 1202, 1207-08 (11th Cir. 2005) (declining to consider a challenge to the Guidelines calculations that was previously reviewed and affirmed by this Court). Simply put, as we noted in <em>Molden I, </em>the record supports the enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). In any event, the law-of-the-case doctrine precludes review of this issue for a second time in the instant appeal. <em>See Luckey, </em>929 F.2d at 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Molden also contends that his sentence was unreasonable under <em>Booker </em>and in light of the 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) factors. After <em>Booker, </em>a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must correctly calculate the sentencing range under the Guidelines and then consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1332 n. 9 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cA sentencing court under <em>Booker </em>still must consider the Guidelines, and, such consideration necessarily requires the sentencing court to calculate the Guidelines sentencing range in the same manner as before <em>Booker.\u201d). </em>These factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-9\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-10\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-11\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-12\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-13\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-14\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-4\">[and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-5\">(3) the kinds of sentences availahlef.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(3). \u201cAlthough sentencing courts must be guided by these factors, \u2018nothing in Booker or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u2019\u201d <em>United, States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1357 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">After a thorough review of the record, with particular attention to the transcripts from Molden\u2019s resentencing sentencing hearing and the PSI, we readily conclude Molden\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court explicitly stated it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense and the criminal history of the defendant. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). And from our review of the resentencing transcript, it is clear the district court understood the Guidelines range to be advisory. Moreover, the district court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the advisory Guidelines range, which we have said is an indication of a reasonable sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 788 (noting that \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable\u201d). Finally, \u201c[t]he parties\u2019 arguments and the PSI\u2019s calculations outlined \u2018the kinds of sentences available.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas, </em>446 F.3d at 1357 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">We are unpersuaded by Molden\u2019s argument concerning the weight given to the factors contained in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), which he urges would support a lower sentence. Put simply, the presence of other sentencing factors, such as Molden\u2019s criminal history and his reckless conduct during his attempt to elude law enforcement officers, also must be taken into account under \u00a7 3553(a) and amply support the sentence imposed. Accordingly, we conclude that Molden\u2019s sentence is reasonable and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
