We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Wright\u2019s motion for reduction of term of imprisonment for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>No. CR-95-76-BR (E.D.N.C.June 28, 2005). Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Wright\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
