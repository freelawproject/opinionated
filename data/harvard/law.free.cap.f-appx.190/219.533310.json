Hartwell, </em>448 F.3d 707, 712 (4th Cir.2006). Section 3742 allows the appeal of an \u201cotherwise final sentence if the sentence was imposed in violation of law.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1) (2000). Thus, unless the sentence was imposed in violation of law, the district court\u2019s ruling on the Rule 35 motion is not appealable. <em>Hartwell, </em>448 F.3d at 713; <em>United States v. Hill, </em>70 F.3d 321, 324 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-26\">McCoullough\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s order stems from his claim that a conflict of interest existed between himself and his court-appointed attorney, Michael Meetze. McCoullough claims Meetze failed to advocate for the reduction in sentence he desired \u2014 at minimum, a 75% reduction \u2014 because McCoullough had filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, alleging Meetze was ineffective. Because McCoullough fails to identify any error of law committed by the district court in failing to reduce his sentence to a greater extent than it did, this claim is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-27\">To the extent that McCoullough is attempting to argue he was denied the effective assistance of counsel based on the purported conflict of interest, we note that there is no constitutional right to counsel at a Rule 35 hearing. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>414 F.3d 528, 536 (4th Cir.2005). Absent a constitutional right to counsel, an ineffective assistance claim will not he. <em>Rouse v. Lee, </em>339 F.3d 238, 250 (4th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Accordingly, we dismiss McCoullough\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
