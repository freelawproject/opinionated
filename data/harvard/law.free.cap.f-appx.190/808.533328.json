Jenne, </em>326 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir.2003) (supervisory officials are not liable under \u00a7 1983 for the acts of their subordinates on the basis of respondeat superior or vicarious liability). Brown argues that the district court erred \u201cin misrepresenting [his] complaint as [a suit] based on vicarious liability.\u201d Brown claims that Head directly denied his request for prescribed medical treatment (a smoke-free environment). He further alleges that Head carried out a policy or custom of treating all ETS complaints alike, regardless of medical need, and that these actions violated Brown\u2019s constitutional rights. Brown also argues that the district court erred in denying him injunctive relief because he has sufficiently demonstrated he has a number of medical conditions that require a smoke-free environment, and Head has the authority to order prison officials to place him in a smoke-free environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standards as the district court. <em>Jackson v. BellSouth Telecomms., </em>372 F.3d 1250, 1279 (11th Cir. 2004). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A material fact is genuine only \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">\u201cTo show that a prison official acted with deliberate indifference to seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>ous medical needs, a plaintiff must satisfy both an objective and subjective inquiry.\u201d <em>Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir.2003). First, a plaintiff must show an objectively serious medical need. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSecond, a plaintiff must prove that the prison official acted with an attitude of \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to that serious medical need.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A medical need is serious when it \u201chas been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or ... is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Deliberate indifference may be evidenced by the intentional interference of a prison official with medical treatment once it is prescribed. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Here, Brown does not allege liability based on vicarious liability or respondeat superior. Instead, he alleges that Head was deliberately indifferent for denying Brown\u2019s appeal in a grievance proceeding. The record, however, shows that Head\u2019s staff investigated Brown\u2019s grievance and responded accordingly. The lack of enforcement of the existing smoking policy at best shows mere negligence and is insufficient to demonstrate deliberate indifference. <em>Farrow, </em>320 F.3d at 1243; <em>see also Kelley v. Hicks, </em>400 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Because we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we likewise affirm its denial of Brown\u2019s motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
