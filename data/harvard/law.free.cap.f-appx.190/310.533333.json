Dumas pleaded guilty but reserved the right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence and statements. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-29\">The factual findings underlying a motion to suppress are reviewed for clear error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>while the legal determinations are reviewed de novo. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 691, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">To assert a Fourth Amendment challenge to the Government\u2019s use of evidence obtained during the search of the plastic shopping bag, Dumas must establish that he had \u201ca legitimate expectation of privacy\u201d in the bag. <em>See Raleas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 148-49, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978). \u201cA subjective expectation of privacy is legitimate if it is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.\u201d <em>Minnesota v. Olson, </em>495 U.S. 91, 95-96, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85 (1990). The defendant has the burden of showing that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched. <em>See Rawlings v. Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 104, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court correctly denied Dumas\u2019 motion to suppress evidence and statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">We grant Dumas\u2019 motion to file a pro se supplemental brief. We have considered the arguments presented in that brief and find them to be without merit. We therefore affirm Dumas\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
