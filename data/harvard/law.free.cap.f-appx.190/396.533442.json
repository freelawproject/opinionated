We will uphold findings that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002). Under the substantial evidence standard, reversal of the BIA\u2019s decision is improper unless the alien shows that the evidence compels it. <em>Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 594 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">The evidence does not compel a conclusion that Pitalya suffered past persecution or that it is more likely than not that he will suffer persecution or torture if he is returned to India. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2)\u00ae, (\u00fc); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 304 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004). Pitalya\u2019s petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
