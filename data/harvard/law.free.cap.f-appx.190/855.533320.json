California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. We are unpersuaded by the argument Jackson raises in his response to counsel\u2019s motion, as it does not raise an issue of arguable merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, Jackson\u2019s motion for new counsel is denied as MOOT, and Jackson\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-9\">. Jackson suggests that he did not understand the plea agreement he signed and that his trial counsel lied to him in order to get him to sign the agreement. Our independent review reveals that the district court fully complied with the three \"core concerns\u201d of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b), <em>see United States v. Quinones, </em>97 F.3d 473, 475 (11th Cir.1996) (discussing core concerns of Rule 11), and we have found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number><em>no </em>evidence in the record of improper inducement or misrepresentation of the plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
