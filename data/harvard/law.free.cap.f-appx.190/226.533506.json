We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted). We uphold credibility determinations of the immigration judge if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-22\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the decisions of the Board and the immigration judge, and find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s negative credibility finding, as well as its conclusion that Barry failed to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zaca</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>rias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 488, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Moreover, as Barry cannot sustain his burden on the asylum claim, he cannot establish his entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-15\"> Barry did not challenge the immigration judge\u2019s denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture before the Board, and does not seek to raise the issue in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
