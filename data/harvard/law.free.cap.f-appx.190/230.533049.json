Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-21\">We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. A violation of a condition of supervised release must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 700, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). Here, the district court conducted a hearing, and the Government\u2019s witnesses testified that Lunsford possessed and discharged a firearm. The court found, after assessing the witnesses\u2019 credibility and by a preponderance of the evidence, that Lunsford violated the terms of supervised release, and ordered revocation on that basis. The district court\u2019s finding of witness credibility in the revocation hearing is not renewable. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-22\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment revoking Lunsford\u2019s supervised release. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-18\"> Lunsford does not challenge the twenty-four month term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
