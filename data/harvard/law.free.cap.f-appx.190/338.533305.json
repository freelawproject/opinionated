Sayno argues that her motion to reopen was timely filed because changes in the law liberalizing access to discretionary relief effectively tolled the limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-24\">This court applies a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard when reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000). Sayno does not challenge the BIA\u2019s ruling that she had until September 30, 1996, to file her motion to reopen the immigration proceedings that resulted in an order of deportation that was issued in 1982. Because Sayno\u2019s motion to reopen was not received until August 9, 2004, almost eight years after the deadline for filing the motion, the BIA correctly concluded that the motion to reopen was filed out of time. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-25\">Sayno argues that the motion to reopen was timely filed based upon the reasoning of <em>In re X-G-W- </em>22 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 71,1998 WL 378104 (BIA 1998), <em>opinion superseded by In re G-C-L, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 359, 2002 WL 1001051 (BIA 2002). These decisions do not indicate that the time limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>tions set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) are inapplicable to Sayno\u2019s motion to reopen. Rather, <em>In re X-G-W- </em>and <em>In re G-C-L </em>involve the BIA\u2019s policy, now suspended, of granting untimely motions to reopen by applicants claiming eligibility for asylum based on coercion control policies. <em>See In re G-C-L, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Her remaining arguments are irrelevant to the timeliness issue. Sayno argues that she is eligible to reopen removal proceedings because she is the beneficiary of an approved immigrant visa petition filed on her behalf by her spouse, a United States citizen. However, the authorities cited by Sayno do not address the timeliness considerations under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) and are not relevant to the BIA\u2019s rationale for denying the motion to reopen. Additionally, while Sayno argues that the BIA may reopen her case, she fails to explain why the BIA\u2019s discretionary authority to reopen her case indicates that the BIA abused its discretion in denying her motion as untimely. Sayno\u2019s argument that her case should have been reopened is premised, in part, on a hardship argument. However, Sayno\u2019s hardship argument addresses the merits of her request for relief and does not relate to the BIA\u2019s timeliness decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Sayno\u2019s arguments do not indicate that the BIA\u2019s decision was an abuse of discretion. Therefore, the petition for review is DENIED. Her renewed request in her brief for a stay of deportation pending this appeal is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
