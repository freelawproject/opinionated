Wells concedes that he previously filed the same complaint against the same defendants and that it was voluntarily dismissed pursuant to his \u201cNotice of Dismissal\u201d filed on August 19, 2003. Wells also concedes that his cause of action arose when he received the final response to his Step Two Grievance in 1999. <em>See Jackson v. Johnson, </em>950 F.2d 263, 265 (5th Cir. 1992). The applicable statute of limitations is two years. <em>See Hitt v. Connell, </em>301 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2002). Wells\u2019s voluntary dismissal of that complaint left him in the same position as if the lawsuit had never been filed. <em>Lambert v. United States, </em>44 F.3d 296, 298 (5th Cir.1995). Equitable tolling is not warranted in this case because Wells failed to act diligently to preserve his claims. <em>See id. </em>at 299 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1. Wells\u2019s complaint filed in September 2005 was therefore untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
