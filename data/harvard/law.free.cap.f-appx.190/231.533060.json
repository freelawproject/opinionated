Jones appeals this order and the order denying his motion for reconsideration. Although the district court construed the \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion, Jones clearly intended to file a \u00a7 2241 petition. Jones asserts on appeal that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective to test the legality of his detention and contends that his claims should be considered in the context of his \u00a7 2241 petition. Because Jones does not meet the standard set forth in <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333-34 (4th Cir.2000), we affirm the denial of relief and the court\u2019s denial of Jones\u2019 motion for reconsideration. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
