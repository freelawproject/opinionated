Lawton appeals the district court\u2019s order accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and granting summary judgment for the Commissioner on Lawton\u2019s claim that the Administrative Law Judge improperly determined the onset date of her disability as January 20, 2001, and not September 28, 1999. We must uphold the decision if the decision is supported by substantial evidence and the correct law was applied. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2000); <em>Craig v. Chater, </em>76 F.3d 585, 589 (4th Cir.1996); <em>see also Villa v. Heckler, </em>797 F.2d 794, 796 (9th Cir.1986) (noting that the question is whether the chosen onset date is supported by substantial evidence, not whether an earlier date could have been supported). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Lawton v. Social Security Admin., </em>No. CA-03-664-REP (E.D.Va. Sept. 20, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
