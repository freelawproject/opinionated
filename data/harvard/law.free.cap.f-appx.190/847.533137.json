On appeal, Parra argues that the IJ erred in finding her not credible and denying asylum and relief under the CAT.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth more fully below, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b874-19\">On February 25, 2002, Parra was issued a notice to appear, charging her with removability for falsely representing herself to be a U.S. citizen and for not possessing a valid entry document at the time she applied for admission. Parra admitted the allegations in the notice to appear and conceded the charges of inadmissibility. She sought asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, alleging persecution on account of her political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>In support of her application, Parra testified that she worked as a beautician and owned her own business. One of her clients asked Parra to provide beautician services for the client\u2019s husband, who was in prison. Parra subsequently learned that he was in jail because he was a paramilitary. Between November 1, 1999, and the end of August 2000, Parra went to the prison and provided him with hair cuts, fingernail services, and facials.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">At the end of June or July 2000, Parra was threatened by four people who arrived at her salon seeking information about this imprisoned client and his family. Parra did not give them any information. They stayed for about half an hour and, when they left, asked her to cooperate with them in a \u201cgood way,\u201d otherwise they would get her to cooperate in a \u201cbad way.\u201d The men never identified themselves or told Parra why they wanted the information. After this incident, Parra continued providing her services at the jail. She explained that she did not think about stopping this work because the prisoner was not her only client and, at that time, she was making her business grow and he paid her very well. In August 2000, the lock on her beauty salon was blown open. Nothing was stolen, but she received a message that she cooperate or die. After this, she stopped going to the prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Parra testified that the people who were after her were guerillas. Parra explained that, in May 2000, two men, who also were approached for information about this client, did not provide that information and were killed. The client\u2019s wife told Parra that she believed those men were killed by the guerillas and that Parra had been threatened by those same guerillas.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Parra left Colombia in December 2000 and went to Spain, leaving her daughter in Colombia. Parra stayed in Spain for one year and applied for residency. She left without completing the process for residency because she saw two of the persons that had threatened her in Colombia, and they tried to follow her. She did not file a police report with the Spanish authorities, and felt that there was not much justice in Spain. She next went to Canada and took a bus into the United States, using a false U.S. passport. Parra did not know that she could request asylum in Canada, and believed that, when she was in Canada, she already was in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">The IJ denied asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. The IJ found that Parra\u2019s testimony was not \u201ctotally logical,\u201d citing her claims that, <em>inter alia, </em>the government would allow Parra to perform her services for a jailed paramilitary member, Parra would do so just to build her client base, Parra did not go to the authorities in Spain because there was no \u201cjustice\u201d but sought permanent residency there, and Parra believed she was in the United States when she went to Canada. As a result, the IJ found that her credibility was \u201csignificantly diminished.\u201d The IJ further found that, even if he assumed that Parra was totally credible, she did not demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on a protected ground, and, thus, did not establish asylum eligibility. The IJ found that she was not harmed in either Colombia or Spain, nor that her fear of returning based on her refusal to collaborate was based on a protected ground. The IJ also denied asylum in the exercise of discretion because Parra used a false passport to enter the United States, used a \u201csecutive\u201d route to travel to the United States, and may have been firmly resettled or close to firmly resettled in Spain. The IJ found that Parra\u2019s CAT claim also failed because she had not been tortured and there was no reason to believe that she would be tortured by or with the acquiescence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Colombian government official. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">On appeal, Parra contends that the IJ\u2019s rejection of her testimony as illogical was erroneous, arguing that her work at the prison was plausible, her testimony was detailed, believable, and consistent, and the IJ applied a presumption that her testimony was not credible and failed to properly evaluate her credibility. On the merits, Parra appears to argue that, even though she could not conclusively show the motivation for the persecution, she feared persecution by non-governmental entities from whom the government could not provide protection. As a result, Parra also argues that the IJ erred in denying CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). We review factual determinations, including credibility determinations, using the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir. 2005). We will affirm if the decision \u201cis supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted). We review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision. <em>Id. </em>To conclude that the IJ should be reversed, we \u201cmust find that the record not only supports that conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]he mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). To the extent the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">The IJ must make an explicit credibility determination. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Yang, </em>we held that an IJ did not make an explicit credibility finding where the IJ described the petitioner\u2019s claims as a \u201cridiculous fabrication\u201d and her testimony as \u201cextremely inconsistent\u201d and making no sense whatsoever. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the IJ found that Parra\u2019s testimony was not \u201ctotally logical,\u201d and concluded that her credibility was \u201csignificantly diminished.\u201d Here, the IJ failed to make a clean determination of credibility. Therefore, as in <em>Yang, </em>we assume that any credibility determinations were not dispositive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">The Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if an alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-10\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). In order to carry this burden, the alien must, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005). In the absence of past persecution, \u201cthe petitioner must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe subjective component can be proved \u2018by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u2019 while the objective component \u2018can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). We require the applicant to present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 a protected ground. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">We have noted that persecution is \u201can \u2018extreme concept,\u2019 requiring \u2018more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u2019 and that \u2018[mjere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quoting <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000)) (alteration in original). Furthermore, \u201c[n]ot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>212 F.3d at 1355; <em>see also Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290-91 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that five-day detention during which petitioner was not harmed, petitioner\u2019s termination from his job and inability to find another in that city, and occasional search of his parents\u2019 home by the police constituted harassment but did not compel a finding of past persecution). The persecution must be on account of Parra\u2019s political opinion, whether actual or imputed, and not the beliefs or opinions of her persecutors. <em>See I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (holding that persecution on account of political opinion is \u201cpersecution on account of the <em>victim\u2019s </em>political opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437-38 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that the petitioner must establish past or future persecution because of her actual or imputed political opinion). \u201cIt is not enough to show that she was or will be persecuted or tortured due to her refusal to cooperate.... \u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">In order to obtain relief under the CAT, a petitioner must show that \u201cit is more likely than not that she will be tortured in her home country at the hands of her government or that her government will acquiesce in the torture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Torture is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-8\">any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">In this case, the IJ found that, even if totally credible, Parra failed to meet her burden to establish asylum eligibility. This finding is supported by substantial evidence. The arrival of four people at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Parra\u2019s beauty salon requesting information, the breaking of the locks on her salon, and the threatening note, and two of the men following her in Spain without incident \u201cdo not rise to the level of past persecution that would compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231; <em>Zheng, </em>451 F.3d at 1290-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Furthermore, substantial evidence supports the finding that Parra was not threatened based on her actual or imputed political opinion, but was threatened due to her refusal to cooperate, which is not persecution on a protected ground. <em>EliasZacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 482,112 S.Ct. at 816. Parra did not provide a political motive for having a jailed paramilitary as a client, and, because the men sought her cooperation to obtain information about her client, the record does not compel a finding that she was threatened on account of an imputed political opinion. As a result, the record does not compel the conclusion that Parra established that she suffered either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Because Parra offered no evidence that she ever was \u201ctortured\u201d within the meaning of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1), the record does not compel the conclusion that she was eligible for relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">In light of the foregoing, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-12\">. On appeal, Parra mentions the denial of withholding of removal under the INA in her statement of the issues, but has abandoned the issue by making no argument as to the claim in her brief. <em>Huang v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>429 F.3d 1002, 1007 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, this issue is not discussed further.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
