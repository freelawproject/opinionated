At the conclusion of the trial, the district court dictated detailed findings of facts and conclusions of law. It later memorialized these findings in a written order for entry of judgment filed on September 22, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">We review a district court\u2019s construction of a contract <em>de novo. See Am. Cas. Co. v. Etowah Bank, </em>288 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir.2002). We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard of review. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>Thelma C. Raley, Inc. v. Kleppe, </em>867 F.2d 1326,1328 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court\u2019s fact findings are supported by substantial, competent evidence, including its findings that Inland hid its intent to file a claim, which ultimately prejudiced the Authority. Moreover, we agree with the district court\u2019s determination that our precedents and Florida precedents mandated that Inland\u2019s claims for differing site condition damages were barred. <em>See Marriott Corp. v. Dasta Constr. Co., </em>26 F.3d 1057 (11th Cir.1994); <em>Tuttle/White Constructors, Inc. v. State Dep\u2019t. of Gen. Sens., </em>371 So.2d 1096 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.1979). Finally, we agree with the district court\u2019s finding that Inland was not entitled to any \u201cequitable adjustment\u201d to the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment entered in favor of Inland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-17\">. In its notice of appeal, Inland asserted that it was also appealing the amended judgment entered by the district court on September 29, 2005; the district court's order denying Inland\u2019s motion for new trial or to alter or amend the judgment entered on December 15, 2005; and the district court\u2019s order determining entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees entered on December 28, 2005. However, because Inland has not challenged these determinations in its appeal brief, we deem argument on them abandoned. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (issues not argued in initial brief are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b933-10\">. Inland is the appellant in this case because the judgment the district court entered <em>in its </em>favor was in an amount substantially less than Inland sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
