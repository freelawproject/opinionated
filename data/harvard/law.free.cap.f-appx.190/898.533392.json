The complaint seeks damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against attorney Frederick Sake on the ground that Sake breached his contract with Davis in conducting Davis\u2019s defense in a criminal case. The complaint stated that Davis brought the same claim against Sake in state court, and that state court entered judgment dismissing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine requires that we affirm the district court\u2019s decision. That doctrine holds that a federal district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to either review a state court decision or to hear a claim that is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a state court\u2019s final decision. <em>See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149,150, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 476-82, 103 S.Ct. 1303,1311-15, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). Because the state court had rejected the breach of contract claim Davis plead in his complaint, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine barred the district court from entertaining that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
