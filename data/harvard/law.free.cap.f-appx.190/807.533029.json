Davis and Chew alleged that the actions of which they complain were taken by the state-actor defendants in their individual capacities. Davis and Chew asserted a variety of contractual, constitutional, and civil rights statutory causes of action, including 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and asked for money damages, custody of Chew\u2019s son, reinstatement of Davis\u2019s driver\u2019s license, annulment of Chew\u2019s divorce agreement with Harry Sperl, punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and unspecified injunctive relief. Davis and Chew made it clear in their arguments to the district court that they are challenging the judgments against them in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-21\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine deprived the district court of subject-matter jurisdiction to hear Davis and Chew\u2019s claims. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine establishes that federal courts, other than the Supreme Court, do not have subject-matter jurisdiction over actions that effectively seek to appeal state court judgments. <em>Amos v. Glynn County Bd. of Tax Assessors, </em>347 F.3d 1249, 1265 n.11 (11th Cir. 2003); <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 1315, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 150, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). Davis and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Chew allege nothing to indicate that they were in any way deprived of the opportunity to raise their issues in the state court proceedings. To the extent that Davis and Chew raise issues that extend beyond a dissatisfaction with the outcome of their state court cases, those issues were decided by the state courts or inextricably bound up in those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
