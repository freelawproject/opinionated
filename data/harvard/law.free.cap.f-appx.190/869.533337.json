He raises two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">Gutierrez contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence, including drug evidence and statements he made to law enforcement officers before he was arrested. B3^ pleading guilty unconditionally, Gutierrez waived all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings including any error in the denial of his motion to suppress. <em>United States v. Patt% </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. McCoy, ATI </em>F.2d 550, 551 (5th Cir.1973). \u201cA defendant who wishes to preserve appellate review of a non-jurisdictional defect while at the same time pleading guilty can do so only by entering a conditional plea in accordance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Pierre, </em>120 F.3d 1153, 1155 (11th Cir.1997). Gutierrez did not do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-14\">Gutierrez also contends that his 24-month sentence was unreasonable because the district court failed to consider Gutierrez\u2019s extraordinary family circumstances adequately; only mentioned the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in a cursory manner; and imposed a sentence greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-15\">In imposing a sentence, after determining the advisory guidelines range, the district court should be guided by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). Section 3553(a) provides that district courts must consider, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) the applicable guideline range; (2) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (4) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>the offense; (5) the need for adequate deterrence; (6) protection of the public; and (7) the need for unwarranted sentencing disparities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Although the court must be guided by these factors, we have held that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United, States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324,1329 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 788. Although a sentence within the advisory guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 787-788. \u201cFamily responsibilities are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. DeVegter, </em>439 F.3d 1299, 1307 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The record shows that the district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and the advisory guideline range in sentencing Gutierrez. The 24-month sentence was reasonable for several reasons. First, as in <em>Scott, </em>the district court explicitly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court was referring to the seriousness of the offense, the need to provide just punishment, and protection of the public when it noted that Gutierrez supplied a \u201cgateway drug\u201d to many youth and destroyed the lives of other families in pursuit of a better life for his family. The court referred to Gutierrez\u2019s history and characteristics when it acknowledged that he had a stable employment history and a drug problem. Further, the court explained that Gutierrez\u2019s family circumstances were not extraordinary because a defendant\u2019s incarceration always devastates the family. The court did not need to state on the record its explicit consideration of every \u00a7 3553(a) factor. Finally, the court sentenced Gutierrez at the lower end of the guideline range. For all of these reasons, Gutierrez\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
