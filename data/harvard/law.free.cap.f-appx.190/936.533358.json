No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">In his Section 2255 motion, Gonzalez claims (i) his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to discuss the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) with him before filing objections and in advance of the sentencing hearing; and (ii) his appellate counsel was ineffective because appellate counsel failed to raise a claim based on the ineffective performance of trial counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The magistrate judge recommended the motion be denied. The magistrate judge noted that all the substantive sentencing issues Gonzalez has argued as ones that ought to have been raised in objections to the PSI and at the sentencing hearing, in fact, were raised by trial counsel; Gonzalez had not shown that the sentence imposed would have been different had trial counsel earlier spoken with Gonzalez. About appellate counsel\u2019s performance, the magistrate judge noted that appellate counsel had argued error based on the claimed failure to discuss the PSI with Gonzalez and that, in any event, as a general rule, a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is raised properly in a section 2255 motion and not on direct appeal. <em>See Massaro v. United, States, </em>538 U.S. 500,123 S.Ct. 1690,1694,155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (\u201cin most cases a motion brought under \u00a7 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective assistance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-15\">The district court denied the motion to vacate for \u201cthe reasons stated in the report of the Magistrate Judge and upon independent review of the file.\u201d This Court granted Gonzalez a certificate of appeal (\u201cCOA\u201d) on a single issue: whether the district court failed to address all of the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims raised in Gonzalez\u2019s section 2255 motion in violation of <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-16\"><em>Clisby </em>directs district courts to \u201cresolve all constitutional claims presented in a petition for habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 ... before granting or denying relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 927-28. Assuming that <em>Clisby </em>applies in the section 2255 context \u2014 the applicability of which this</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Court has not yet determined \u2014 we see no <em>Clisby </em>violation. The magistrate judge\u2019s report determined that \u201call\u201d of Gonzalez\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims were without merit. The district court also considered these claims; after independent review and for the reasons stated by the magistrate judge, the district court found no constitutional violation. No <em>Clisby </em>violation has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-12\">. The habeas petition was amended to include a third claim, but that claim is not raised in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b963-13\">. The government argues that Gonzalez has abandoned the Clisby claim because his brief argues the substantive merits of issues not included in the COA and does little more than list the <em>Clisby </em>issue. We construe appellate briefs drafted without the assistance of counsel liberally; the <em>Clisby </em>claim was raised sufficiently to allow our consideration. See <em>McBride v. Sharpe, </em>25 F.3d 962, 971 (11th Cir.1994). We give no consideration to the substantive issues raised that fall outside the scope of the COA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
