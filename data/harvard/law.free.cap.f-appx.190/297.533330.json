Subsequent to the filing of Lee\u2019s petition for review on May 27, 2005, he filed a motion to reopen with the Board that was denied by order of October 17, 2005. Lee did not petition for review of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-25\">On appeal, Lee challenges both the Board\u2019s affirmance of the denial of his motion to reconsider and its denial of the motion to reopen. Lee may not challenge in this appeal the Board\u2019s order denying the motion to reopen, as he did not file a timely petition for review from that order. A petitioner has thirty days to file a petition for review. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000). This time period is \u201cjurisdictional in nature and must be construed with strict fidelity to [its] terms.\u201d <em>Stone v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number><em>INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Accordingly, because Lee did not file a petition for review within thirty days of the Board\u2019s order denying his motion to reopen, this court\u2019s review is limited to the Board\u2019s order affirming the denial of the motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The Board ruled that Lee did not warrant the grant of a motion to reconsider because he did not assert an error of fact or law in the challenged decision. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of the motion to reconsider on this ground. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), 1003.23(b) (2006); <em>Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481 (4th Cir.2006). We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
