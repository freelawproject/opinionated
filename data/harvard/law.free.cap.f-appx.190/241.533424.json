Because neither party moved for a jury trial, the magistrate judge held a hearing on Hickman\u2019s claim that his right to privacy was violated when he was seen naked by female correctional officers. The magistrate judge made detailed findings of fact that were adopted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-25\">On appeal, Hickman challenges the district court\u2019s credibility findings, asserting that Defendants\u2019 witnesses\u2019 testimony was \u201creplete with contradictions and provable falsity.\u201d Our review of the record does not support Hickman\u2019s characterization. Instead, we find that Hickman\u2019s allegations involve either non-material facts or are not supported by the record. In addition, we give great deference to the magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>trate judge\u2019s credibility determinations, because the magistrate judge heard the actual testimony. <em>See United States v. D\u2019Anjou, </em>16 F.3d 604, 614 (4th Cir.1994). Thus, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
