On April 30, 1952, the plaintiff owned a lot on the westerly side of '\u25a0 Indian Field Road in Greenwich. The land was located within a so-called B-L (local business) zone. The lot had a street frontage of 156 feet, ran to a depth of approximately 170 feet, and abutted residential property on the south. On the date men-, tioned, the plaintiff applied to the defendant board ; for a special exception to erect on the lot an auto-! mobile salesroom and a repair garage. Authoriza-i tion for these uses was sought under \u00a7 10 of the Greenwich building zone regulations, quoted in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The board granted the application but] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>/imposed the condition, as one of several, that no <em>I </em>outside parking upon the lot would he permitted. <em>I </em>The plaintiff appealed from that decision to the / Court of Common Pleas, which sustained the appeal ' on the ground that \u201cit does not appear that the pro- , teetion of the interests of [the plaintiff\u2019s] neighbors ! requires or justifies that no parking shall be permitted on the plaintiff\u2019s land\u201d and that the prohibition of all parking was contrary to \u00a7 17 of the regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court then remanded the matter to the board for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><em>[ </em>Subsequently, the board held another hearing on 'the plaintiff\u2019s application and again granted the \u25a0 special exception but on the modified condition that outside parking on the lot should be restricted to <em>I its </em>westerly section. This would provide parking space for twenty-six automobiles. The number of spaces required by \u00a7 17 of the regulations, referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>to previously, is twenty-two. The condition imposed by the board will prohibit parking in an area containing about 5200 square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The plaintiff again appealed to the Court of Com-' mon Pleas, claiming that the board had acted il-; legally, arbitrarily and in abuse of its discretion in imposing the condition as to parking. Prom th\u00e9 judgment of the court sustaining that appeal the board has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The concept of zoning embodies a clash of conflicting forces. On the one hand is the common-law right of a man to use his land as he pleases, as long as that use does not create a nuisance. <em>Matter of Monument Garage Corporation </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>266 N.Y. 339, 344, 194 N.E. 848. On the other hand is the effort of the lawmaking body, acting under the police power, to limit that use in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community. To resolve this conflict in such a manner as to afford necessary flexibility, zoning regulations customarily provide for a board of appeals, empowered, among other functions, to grant variances and special exceptions. Without this authorization to a board of appeals or to some similar agency, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to keep the law \u201crunning on an even keel\u201d and to resist, with any assurance of success, attacks upon the constitutionality of the enactment. <em>St. Patrick\u2019s Church Corporation </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>113 Conn. 132, 139, 154 A. 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The regulations of the town of Greenwich follow the pattern of the aforementioned custom. They make provision for the defendant board and they set forth its powers. Greenwich Building Zone Regs., \u00a7 28 (1952). Among those enumerated therein is the power to grant variances and special exceptions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>The ease at bar is concerned solely with the latter. In a recent case the distinction between the two was recognized and explained. <em>Mitchell Land Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>140 Conn. 527, 531, 102 A.2d 316. We stated (p. 532) that a variance is authority extended to the owner to use his property in a manner forbidden by the zoning enactment, while an exception allows him to put his property to a use which the enactment expressly permits. The right to attach reasonable conditions to the grant of a variance is not dependent upon express authorization from the lawmaking body. 1 Yokley, Zoning Law &amp; Practice (2d Ed.) \u00a7144; Bassett, Zoning, p. 128; 58 Am. Jur. 1046; see <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>126 Conn. 648, 652, 13 A.2d 675. Were this not so, the board, for lack of such right, might be forced, at times, to deny a variance and thus to perpetuate an owner\u2019s plight crying for relief. But as regards the authorization of a special exception a different situation prevails. As was further pointed out in the <em>Mitchell Land Co. </em>case (p. 532), the conditions permitting an exception must be found in the regulations themselves, and these conditions, if any, may not be altered. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Cray, </em>89 N.H. 483, 487, 200 A. 517; 58 Am. Jur. 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The Greenwich regulations must be examined, then, to determine, in the first instance, whether authority to impose conditions when granting a special exception has been conferred upon the board and, if so, to what extent it runs. The board refers us to \u00a7\u00a7 28(b) (3) and 10(a) (4) of the regulations to justify its actions in imposing the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Section 28(b)(3)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> recites that the board may at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>taeli to a granted special exception \u201cappropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with, the public interest and the comprehensive plan set forth in these regulations, and in harmony with the purpose and intent expressed in Section 1 thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The power thus conferred upon the board is not unlimit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ed. It is, on the contrary, expressly circumscribed by the requirement that any condition imposed by the board upon the grant of a special exception shall, first, be in accordance with the public interest, second, be in accordance with the comprehensive plan found in the regulations and, third, be in harmony with the general purposes set forth in \u00a7 1. In other words, the conditions must meet all three standards. Whatever may be said as to its promotion of the [public interest, the condition limiting the extent of parking upon the plaintiff\u2019s property is not only not 1 in accordance with the comprehensive plan of zoning but is contrary to it. That plan, at least in the zone i in which the property in question lies, is to take j parking off the streets. Furthermore, the condition is directly at odds, rather than in harmony with, the general purpose, stated in \u00a7 1, \u201cof lessening congestion in the streets.\u201d The authority of the board to impose the condition cannot be found in \u00a7 28(b) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Nor does \u00a7 10(a)(4) empower the board to attach the condition to the grant. That section provides for the approval, as a special exception, of an automobile salesroom and garage \u201csubject to such limitation on outside storage ... as said Board may prescribe.\u201d In construing \u00a7 10(a) (4), we must remember that zoning regulations are in derogation of the rights attaching to private property and that they should not be extended beyond their fair import. <em>Langbein </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>135 Conn. 575, 580, 67 A.2d 5. Applying this principle, we can reach no other conclusion than that the section under consideration did not empower the board to limit parking in any manner. The storage of automobiles must be distinguished from parking. \u201cThere is a substantial distinction, clearly cognizable, between the meaning of \u2018storage\u2019 and \u2018park<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>ing.\u2019 One lias a certain degree of permanency, while the other connotes transience.\u201d <em>Matter of Monument Garage Corporation </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>266 N.Y. 339, 343, 194 N.E. 848. The language of the regulations may not be enlarged to include a subject matter which the words \u201coutside storage\u201d do not fairly embrace. In imposing the condition as to parking, the board, whether it acted under \u00a7 28(b) (3) or \u00a7 10(a)(4), or both, exceeded its authority, and the condition is of no force. <em>Matter of Small </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>279 N.Y. 288, 296, 18 N.E.2d 281. The court was correct in sustaining the appeal and ordering the matter remanded to the board for further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-8\"> \u201cSec. 10.
