There were several defendants. For the disposition of this appeal, it is necessary to mention only five of them. The defendants Eugene J. and Mary A. Rosadino are the owners of the house and lot subject to the lien under foreclosure. The defendant The First Federal Savings and Loan Association, hereinafter referred to as the loan association, advanced funds for the construction of the Rosadino house pursuant to the terms of its mortgage on the property. The defendant John Arida has a valid mechanic\u2019s lien for $181. The defendant David B. Greenberg is the successor trustee in bankruptcy of the estate of Alexander K. Frazer, who contracted to build the house. The loan association filed a counterclaim stating that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>had a balance in its hands of $1960 yet to be advanced on the mortgage and asking that the plaintiff and the several defendants who also claimed an interest in this snm be required to interplead. A judgment of interpleader having been entered, the plaintiff claimed a share of the $1960 by virtue of its lien. The trustee attacked the validity of the lien. The court found that the plaintiff\u2019s lien was valid and rendered judgment directing the apportionment of the $1960, less allowances for counsel fees, between the plaintiff and Arida, and adjudging that when that was done the loan association\u2019s mortgage would be a first lien upon the property for the full amount thereof. The trustee has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The facts pertinent to the disposition of the appeal are as follows: Frazer contracted with the Rosadinos to build a house for them. He purchased materials from the plaintiff but failed to make payment. The plaintiff\u2019s vice president, Ellsworth Mathias, executed a notice of intention to claim a mechanic\u2019s lien and gave it to Donald C. Finch, one of the plaintiff\u2019s salesmen, to make service upon the Rosadinos. Finch left a true and attested copy of the notice at the Rosadinos\u2019 house and made a return of service as \u201can indifferent person.\u201d Frazer was adjudicated a bankrupt, and his trustee claims that the service of the notice of intention to claim a mechanic\u2019s lien was invalid because Finch was not \u201can indifferent person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Section 7219 of the G-eneral Statutes provides that no person except the original contractor or a subcontractor whose contract with the original contractor is in writing and has been assented to in writing by the other party to the original contract shall be entitled to claim a mechanic\u2019s lien unless he shall, within the time prescribed by the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201cgive written notice\u201d to the owner of the building being constructed, raised, removed or repaired that he has furnished materials or rendered services for the work and intends to claim a lien therefor. If the owner resides in the same town where the materials are being furnished or the services rendered, the notice must be served upon the owner by \u201cany indifferent person,\u201d by leaving with the owner or at his usual place of abode a true and attested copy of the notice. The right to fix a lien for materials furnished or services rendered on buildings and land is created by statute, and the acts required by the statute must be done to entitle a party to the benefit of its provisions. <em>White </em>v. <em>Washington School District, </em>42 Conn. 541, 545; <em>McGann </em>v. <em>Sloan, </em>74 Conn. 726, 727, 52 A. 405; <em>Swift &amp; Upson Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>W. L. Hatch Co., </em>115 Conn. 494, 497, 162 A. 19; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Alling, </em>84 Conn. 487, 492, 80 A. 782. We have held that the requirement of notice of intention to claim a lien is primarily for the protection of the owner of the property. <em>Thames Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Cruise, </em>116 Conn. 273, 276, 164 A. 652. Nevertheless, we have also held that an owner cannot waive a strict compliance with the statute and, by so doing, make a lien which is defective for lack of proper notice valid as against subsequent incumbrancers. <em>White </em>v. <em>Washington School District, </em>supra. Lack of proper notice to claim a lien renders the lien invalid with respect to both the owner and all others.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Webster defines \u201cindifferent\u201d as \u201c[h]aving a neutral or unbiased disposition; . . . [n]ot inclined or affected to one side, party, or cause more than to another; unprejudiced.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed.). In <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Hills, </em>1 Conn. 295, this court had under consideration the validity of an execution on land made pursuant to a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>which required that \u201cwhensoever any execution shall be levied upon lands, the same shall be appraised by three indifferent freeholders.\u201d Statutes, 1808, p. 282, \u00a7 7. Judge Hosmer stated (p. 307): \u201cThe meaning of the term \u2018indifferent\u2019 cannot be mistaken. Its popular and legal signification are precisely the same. The person of whom \u2018indifference\u2019 is predicated, must be impartial, and free from bias.\u201d <em>Tweedy </em>v. <em>Picket, </em>1 Day 109, 111; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Kirtland, </em>7 Conn. 229, 231; <em>Anthony </em>v. <em>South Kingstown, </em>13 R.I. 129; <em>Wolcott </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>84 Mass. 338, 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In the light of the definition which the eminent lexicographer quoted above has given to the term \u201cindifferent\u201d and the interpretation which this court has accorded to it, albeit long ago, we are constrained to hold that a salesman regularly in the employ of a party claiming a lien, and therefore beholden to that party for his livelihood, is not an impartial, unbiased person and consequently is not the \u201cindifferent person\u201d who, under the statute, must make the service. We are bound to presume that when the legislature incorporated the phrase \u201cany indifferent person\u201d in the statute it had a purpose for doing so, and we cannot ignore the commonly accepted meaning of the words used. General Statutes \u00a7 8890; <em>Niedzwicki </em>v. <em>Pequonnock Foundry, </em>133 Conn. 78, 82, 48 A.2d 369; <em>Finoia </em>v. <em>Winchester Repeating Arms Co., </em>130 Conn. 381, 384, 34 A.2d 636; <em>Southington </em>v. <em>Southington Water Co., </em>80 Conn. 646, 658, 69 A. 1023. The lien is invalid because service was not made in conformance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">There is error in part; the judgment is affirmed except as to the claim of the Lampson Lumber Company, and, as to that, a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
