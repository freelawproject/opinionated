It issued a policy of automobile liability insurance to Sam Silverherz covering a motor truck. The truck was leased by him to the defendant corporation, hereinafter called the company, and was in use in connection with tobacco farming. An employee of the company, Dorothy Lee, was injured while riding on the truck. She brought a suit against Silverherz, which the plaintiff defended, and recovered judgment. The present action is against the company to recover the amount paid by the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>as Silverherz\u2019 insurer, in defending the suit and satisfying the judgment. Further facts, as established by a stipulation entered into between the parties and incorporated in the finding, may be summarized as follows: Pursuant to a lease between Silverherz and the company, the latter on August 2, 1947, was \u201coperating\u201d the motor truck belonging to Silverherz. Dorothy Lee was injured by reason of the fact that the company \u201cdid . . . negligently operate\u201d the truck. At the time of her injury she was engaged in the course and scope of her employment and, as to her employer, she was subject to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The company was notified by the plaintiff to defend the suit brought by Dorothy Lee against Silverherz and to hold the plaintiff harmless on account thereof. The company failed to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Upon the foregoing facts the trial court concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the company, and rendered judgment accordingly. It is from this judgment that the defendant has appealed. The assignments of error concern the above conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">While it is not specifically stated in the stipulated facts incorporated in the finding that it was an employee of the company who was operating the truck at the time the injury to Dorothy Lee occurred, this fact may be taken for granted. It is specifically found that Dorothy Lee\u2019s injuries were sustained as a result of the negligent operation of the truck by the company. The company is a corporation and therefore could act only by its agent. Furthermore, the Superior Court file in the action by Dorothy Lee against Silverherz, referred to in the stipulation, shows that at the time of the accident the truck was being operated by the servant and agent of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>pany. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Silverherz, </em>Superior Court, Tolland County, No. 5361. In that action Dorothy Lee alleged that the accident which befell her was due to the driver\u2019s negligence. Since we may take judicial notice of the files of the Superior Court <em>(McCleave </em>v. <em>John J. Flanagan Co., </em>115 Conn. 36, 39, 160 A. 305), we can and do take judicial notice of the facts disclosed by the file in <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Silverherz, </em>supra, to supplement and explain the finding of the trial court. Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc., \u00a7158; see <em>Woodward\u2019s Appeal, </em>81 Conn. 152, 164, 70 A. 453; <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Norfield Congregational Church, </em>73 Conn. 718, 731, 49 A. 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In this action the plaintiff stands in Silverherz\u2019 shoes as Silverherz\u2019 subrogee. Silverherz\u2019 liability to Dorothy Lee arose by operation of the statute. General Statutes \u00a7 2479. That statute reads as follows: \u201cAny person renting or leasing to another any motor vehicle owned by him shall be liable for any damage to any person or property caused by the operation of such motor vehicle while so rented or leased, to the same extent as the operator would have been liable if he had also been the owner.\u201d In short, the statute imposes the same liability upon Silverherz as the law imposes upon the operator of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Section 2479 is contained in chapter 110 of the General Statutes, which defines \u201coperator\u201d as meaning \u201cany person who operates a motor vehicle or who steers or directs the course of a motor vehicle which is being towed.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 2350 (28). In the light of this definition, the company could not be the operator. An operator must be an individual. As originally enacted, the statute on the liability of an owner for damage caused by a leased vehicle ended with the word \u201cleased.\u201d Public Acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>1925, c. 195, \u00a7 21. The words \u201cto the same extent as the operator would have been liable if he had also been the owner\u201d were added in 1929. Public Acts 1929, e. 256, \u00a7 1; Rev. 1930, \u00a7 1627; see <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>107 Conn. 728, 731, 142 A. 403. Dorothy Lee could have recovered from the driver for his negligent operation of the truck. <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Lavitt, </em>115 Conn. 117, 122, 160 A. 617. Therefore Silverherz\u2019 liability did not arise because of any liability of the company. It arose because of the liability of the operator of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Dorothy Lee could have looked to the company under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act or sued the driver in tort. She chose instead to sue Silverherz under the statute. Since Silverherz\u2019 liability under the statute is predicated upon the liability of the operator of the truck, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is not involved. Silverherz could not have set it up as a defense in the action brought by Dorothy Lee against him because neither he nor the operator of the truck was her employer. General Statutes \u00a7 7419. Nor could he have required that the company be cited in as a party defendant in the action against him, because the statute under which the action was brought created a liability in Silverherz separate and distinct from the liability of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Having noted the theory of the liability of Silverherz under the statute, we next consider whether the company owed him any duty by virtue of its legal relationship to him. As previously stated, Silverherz leased the truck to the company. It entrusted it to its driver. The negligence of that driver by virtue of the statute imposed liability upon Silverherz. The driver was the agent of the company and engaged upon its business, and so the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>is liable to Silverherz for its driver\u2019s acts. Its liability to Silverherz is predicated upon the leasing of the truck. It is not based upon any duty that the company owed to Dorothy Lee but upon an entirely independent and separate duty owed to Silverherz. <em>Westchester Lighting Co. </em>v. <em>Westchester County Small Estates Corporation, </em>278 N.Y. 175, 180, 15 N.E.2d 567; <em>Burris </em>v. <em>American Chicle Co., </em>120 F.2d 218, 222; <em>American District Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Kittleson, </em>179 F.2d 946, 953; <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc., </em>206 F.2d 784, 792. The situation does not differ from one wherein an owner of a car is held liable in damages merely because of his ownership. In such a case he can recover from the driver whose negligence caused the injury. <em>Chernoff </em>v. <em>Wholesome Bakery Products, Inc., </em>17 N.Y.S.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In this opinion Ingles, C. J., Baldwin and O\u2019Sullivan, Js., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b558-8\">Daly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjM\">(dissenting). The majority base their reasoning and decision upon the theory that the truck was being operated by the servant and agent of the defendant. This has been gleaned, not from the finding of the trial court in this case, but by taking judicial notice of the contents of the file of the case in which Dorothy Lee was the plaintiff and Silverherz, the plaintiff\u2019s assured, was the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The trial court did not find that a person who was the agent and servant of the defendant was operating the truck and that his negligent operation of it caused the injuries to Dorothy Lee. It found that the defendant \u201cwas operating\u201d it \u201cand did so negligently operate it as to cause injury to one Dorothy M. Lee.\u201d The court did not conclude that the liability of the plaintiff\u2019s assured to Dorothy Lee resulted from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>negligence of the defendant\u2019s agent and servant. It concluded that the liability \u201cresulted from the negligence of the defendant.\u201d To take judicial notice is a function of the court in the exercise of appellate as well as original jurisdiction. <em>McCleave </em>v. <em>John J. Flanagan Co., </em>115 Conn. 36, 38, 160 A. 305. Material facts, however, cannot be added now to those found by the trial court in its finding. \u201cIn every trial which may result in an appeal to this court, it is the duty of each party, so far as he is able, to see that whatever is material to support his contentions is proved and found. If he content himself with bringing forward only so much as he may deem sufficient to meet those of his adversary, he must be prepared, should an appeal be taken on either side, to have it decided with reference to no other facts than those apparent on the record.\u201d <em>Coughlin </em>v. <em>McElroy, </em>72 Conn. 444, 447, 44 A. 743; <em>Lamenza </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>96 Conn. 403, 413, 114 A. 96. \u201cWhere the subordinate facts are . . . partially omitted from the finding, we have no recourse save to determine this issue upon the facts as found.\u201d <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>98 Conn. 374, 381, 119 A. 341. \u201cAs we said in <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>[supra, 383]: \u2018The conclusion [of the court] must be tested by the facts as found.\u2019 That is, by the subordinate facts as found by the trial court and corrected by us, if corrections are made.\u201d <em>Dexter Yarn Co. </em>v. <em>American Fabrics Co., </em>102 Conn. 529, 540, 129 A. 527. \u201cA finding unattacked is presumed to contain all relevant facts, and if the finding fails to state all the material facts, the Supreme Court must nevertheless decide the case upon the basis of those which do appear.\u201d Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc., \u00a7 73. In the instant case the facts were stipulated by the parties, and the court found them as stipulated. No corrections of the finding have been requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>and none have been made. The confusion and difficulties which will result in future appeals as a result of the addition of material facts in this case are apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">As the trial court did not find that the operator of the truck was the agent and servant of the defendant and that his negligent operation of it caused the injuries, I cannot and do not agree that the defendant is liable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
