She was found guilty on one of the counts purporting to charge the crime of embezzlement and on each of the counts setting forth a violation of \u00a7 8696. After the verdict, she made a motion in arrest of judgment based upon the insufficiency of the information. From the denial of this motion she has appealed. The assignment of error is based solely upon the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The information is in the short form authorized by Practice Book, \u00a7 344. At common law it was necessary to set forth in.an information, in detail, the means by which the particular offense was accomplished. 2 Swift\u2019s Digest 378. That requirement has now been removed by the rule. It was to avoid unnecessary prolixity that the rule permitting short-form informations was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The third count of the information accused the defendant \u201con or about February 16,1953, at Cromwell, Connecticut, of taking, purloining, secreting, or of appropriating to her own use or to the use of others the monies in her care or custody as agent with the intent to defraud another,\u201d in violation of \u00a7 8693 of the General Statutes. As to this count, the argument is made by the defendant that neither the kind of agency supposed to have existed nor the principal is identified. \"While it is true that the count is in general terms, it does charge the defendant with the crime of embezzlement. It gives the date and the place in precise language, and it sets forth the statute in question. The count contained all the elements of the crime of embezzlement by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>agent, a crime defined by statute, and the statute was cited. <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>102 Conn. 658, 660, 129 A. 724; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>118 Conn. 501, 507, 173 A. 155; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pallotti, </em>119 Conn. 70, 72, 174 A. 74. It charged <em>the </em>crime in the manner prescribed by the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The counts relating to obtaining <em>money </em>by false pretenses were in substantial compliance with the rules, and in each case the statute was cited. They also satisfied the requirements of a short-form information as set forth in the rule. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mele, </em>140 Conn. 398, 402, 100 A.2d 570; <em>State </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>139 Conn. 234, 236, 93 A.2d 154. Any practical question that confronted the defendant could easily have been solved by obtaining a bill of particulars. Practice Book, \u00a7 345, provides for this, and it would seem that the objections now raised could easily have been overcome. The provision in the rules for a bill of particulars fully protected the defendant\u2019s right under article first, \u00a7 9, of the Connecticut constitution \u201cto demand the nature and cause of the accusation.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>124 Conn. 554, 560, 1 A.2d 274; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pallotti, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
