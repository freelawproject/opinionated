Because there are circumstances under which the statutes at issue could be constitutionally applied, we reverse the Appellate Division\u2019s finding of unconstitutionality and reject the intervenors\u2019 facial challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In June of 1998, petitioner Moran commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking, in relevant part, to overturn the Department of Taxation and Finance\u2019s decision denying its request for a refund of taxes paid under article 13-A of the Tax Law. Moran also challenged, as facially unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, \u00a7 8 [3]), those portions of Tax Law \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 301-a (hereafter the petroleum business tax or PBT) imposing a tax on fuel imported by a vessel for its consumption within the state while engaged in interstate commerce. Moran further contested the Legislature\u2019s retroactive application of the 1997 amendments to the PBT. Eklof and Reinauer,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> similarly denied refunds of taxes paid pursuant to the PBT, were granted permission to intervene in March of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Intervenor Eklof is a New York corporation with its principal place of business in Staten Island. Intervenor Reinauer was a New York corporation until 1993, when it became a Delaware limited partnership. Reinauer maintains its principal office in Staten Island. The intervenors operate tugboats and barges transporting cargo throughout the waters of the east coast, including the waters of New York.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Supreme Court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The court also found that the 1997 amendments to the PBT creating a retroactive adjustment to the Tax Law did not contravene the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. On appeal, the Appellate Division reversed and declared the tax on the consumption of fuel in section 301 (a) (1) (ii) and section 301-a (b) (2) and (c) (1) (B) of the Tax Law facially unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause (283 AD2d 78 [2001]). The Appellate Division noted that the petitioner and intervenors were being taxed on the consumption of fuel that had not \u201cbeen removed from the stream of interstate commerce\u201d and had not \u201ccome to rest\u201d within New York (283 AD2d at 82). The Court found that the challenged statute was unconstitutional because it artificially imposed a substantial nexus with New York, such \u201cthat an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>activity previously identified as simple interstate movement is now, without more, \u2018deemed to constitute a taxable use\u2019 \u201d (283 AD2d at 83 [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Subsequently, the Commissioner moved in Supreme Court for a final judgment consistent with the Appellate Division order. Eklof and Reinauer cross-moved for an order granting a refund of taxes paid and attorneys\u2019 fees. The court reluctantly granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for an order declaring Tax Law \u00a7 301 (a) (1) (ii), \u00a7 301-a (b) (2) and \u00a7 301-a (c) (1) (B) facially unconstitutional. Supreme Court denied the intervenors\u2019 claim for tax refunds for their failure to exhaust administrative remedies and denied the application for attorneys\u2019 fees. The Commissioner appeals as of right on constitutional grounds from the judgment of Supreme Court, bringing up for review the nonfinal order of the Appellate Division. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The PBT imposes a tax on petroleum businesses \u201cfor the privilege of engaging in business, doing business, employing capital, owning or leasing property, or maintaining an office in this state\u201d (Tax Law \u00a7 301 [a] [1]; \u00a7 301-a [a]). Intervenors qualify as petroleum businesses under section 300 (b) (1) (i) of the Tax Law as businesses that cause fuel to be imported into the state for their own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">From 1984 through August of 1990, an annual \u201cprivilege tax\u201d was imposed on each petroleum business calculated as a percentage of \u201cthe consideration given or contracted to be given by it for petroleum * * * which it imported or caused to be imported * * * into this state for consumption by it in this state\u201d (Tax Law \u00a7 301 [a] [1] [ii]). The statute further provides that \u201c[a] petroleum business, which brings petroleum into this state in the fuel tank connecting with the engine of a vessel propelled by the use of such petroleum\u201d shall receive a credit equal to the amount of gallons of fuel purchased in New York against the total gallons consumed by the business in New York (Tax Law \u00a7 301 [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Since September 1990, the \u201cprivilege tax\u201d is a monthly tax calculated on a cents-per-gallon basis <em>(see </em>Tax Law \u00a7 301-a). The statute now provides that \u201cfuel brought into this state in the fuel tank connecting with the engine of a vessel propelled by the use of such motor fuel shall be deemed to constitute a taxable use of motor fuel * * * to the extent that the fuel is consumed in the operation of the vessel in this state\u201d (Tax Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>\u00a7 301-a [b] [2]; <em>see </em>Tax Law \u00a7 301-a [c] [1] [B]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 301-a also provides a credit for the fuel a petroleum business has purchased in New York <em>(see </em>Tax Law \u00a7 301-a [b] [2]; [c] [1] [B]).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">These statutes reflect the amendments enacted in 1997 in response to <em>Matter of Tug Buster Bouchard Corp. v Wetzler </em>(217 AD2d 192 [3d Dept 1996], <em>affd </em>89 NY2d 830 [1996]), which declared Tax Law \u00a7 301 (a) (1) (ii) unconstitutional. The 1997 amendments added Tax Law \u00a7 301 (c), \u00a7 301-a (b) (2) and \u00a7 301-a (c) (1) (B) <em>(see </em>L 1997, ch 389, \u00a7 1, part A, \u00a7\u00a7 153, 154).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 301 (c) was to apply retroactively to April 1, 1984 and the amendments to section 301-a were to apply retroactively to September 1, 1990 <em>(see </em>L 1997, ch 389, \u00a7 1, part A, \u00a7 219 [24], [25]).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">At the outset, we note that interveners are making a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the PBT. In order to prevail, they must surmount the presumption of constitutionality accorded to legislative enactments by proof \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d <em>(see LaValle v Hayden, </em>98 NY2d 155, 161 [2002]). A party mounting a facial constitutional challenge bears the substantial burden of demonstrating \u201cthat \u2018in any degree and in every conceivable application,\u2019 the law suffers wholesale constitutional impairment\u201d <em>(Cohen v State of New York, </em>94 NY2d 1, 8 [1999]). In other words, \u201cthe challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid\u201d <em>(United States v Salerno, </em>481 US 739, 745 [1987]).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Early United States Supreme Court decisions held that states were unable to impose direct taxes on interstate commerce <em>(see e.g. Helson v Kentucky, </em>279 US 245, 248 [1929]). This line of reasoning has subsequently evolved to recognize that interstate commerce can be made to bear its portion of state taxes <em>(see Complete Auto Tr., Inc. v Brady, </em>430 US 274, 288 [1977], citing <em>Western Live Stock v Bureau of Revenue, </em>303 US 250, 254 [1938]; <em>Colonial Pipeline Co. v Traigle, </em>421 US 100, 108 [1975]).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Currently, a four-prong test is in place to determine whether a state tax imposed upon interstate commerce will survive a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>challenge under the Commerce Clause. The validity of the tax will be upheld \u201c[1] when the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, [2] is fairly apportioned, [3] does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and [4] is fairly related to the services provided by the State\u201d <em>(Complete Auto, </em>430 US at 279). The only portion of the <em>Complete Auto </em>test at issue in the present appeal is whether a substantial nexus could exist between New York and the activity to which the statutes at issue apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Intervenors\u2019 primary argument is that the fuel consumed in interstate commerce can never have a nexus with a taxing state because it does not \u201ccome to rest\u201d within the state. For this proposition, they rely on a line of cases decided prior to <em>Complete Auto (see Helson v Kentucky, </em>279 US 245 [1929]; <em>Edelman v Boeing Air Transp., </em>289 US 249 [1933]; <em>United Air Lines, Inc. v Mahin, </em>410 US 623 [1973]). These cases, decided at a time when states were prevented from taxing interstate commerce directly, draw a distinction between an approved tax on the withdrawal of fuel from storage for use in interstate commerce and a tax on the mere consumption of fuel in interstate commerce, which at that time was seen to be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of the United States has since determined that whether items remained \u201cin the stream of interstate commerce\u201d or \u201ccame to rest\u201d within the state \u201cmay be of some importance for other purposes * * * but for Commerce Clause analysis it is largely irrelevant\u201d <em>(D.H. Holmes Co. Ltd. v McNamara, </em>486 US 24, 31 [1988] [use tax imposed on catalogs mailed to customers within the state]). The Appellate Division erred when it applied the <em>pre-Complete Auto </em>cases to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">We have previously addressed what constitutes a substantial nexus for the purpose of Commerce Clause analysis in the context of sales and use taxes <em>(see Matter of Orvis Co. v Tax Appeals Trib., </em>86 NY2d 165 [1995]). <em>Orvis </em>examined the development of Supreme Court jurisprudence concerning the type of nexus required before a state could impose a valid tax on interstate commerce <em>(see Orvis, </em>86 NY2d at 170-178). That development culminated with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Quill Corp. v North Dakota </em>(504 US 298 [1992]), and held that the substantial nexus portion of the <em>Complete Auto </em>test requires the physical presence within the state of the entity being taxed <em>(see Orvis, </em>86 NY2d at 178). \u201cWhile a physical presence * * * is required, it need not be substantial. Rather, it must be demonstrably more than a \u2018slightest presence\u2019 \u201d <em>(Orvis, </em>86 NY2d at 178, quoting <em>National Geographic Socy. v Cali</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>fornia Bd. of Equalization, </em>430 US 551, 556 [1977]). Moreover, \u201cthe required nexus with the taxing State need <em>not </em>necessarily be directly related to the activity being taxed, but [could] simply [be] whether the facts demonstrate some definite link, some minimum connection, between [the taxing State and] the <em>person </em>* * * it seeks to tax\u201d <em>(Orvis, </em>86 NY2d at 174 [citations and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Other states have also addressed the nexus <em>prong of </em>the <em>Complete Auto </em>test. While not binding, these cases inform our inquiry. In <em>Western Md. Ry. Co. v Goodwin </em>(167 W Va 804, 282 SE2d 240 [1981], <em>appeal dismissed sub nom. Western Md. Ry. Co. v </em>Rose, 456 US 952 [1982]), the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia found that \u201cpurposive, revenue generating activities in the State are sufficient to render a person liable for taxes\u201d <em>(Western Md., </em>167 W Va at 809, 282 SE2d at 244). The same court subsequently addressed the constitutionality of an excise tax imposed upon motor carriers for the use or consumption within the state of fuel purchased outside of the state <em>(see Hartley Mar. Corp. v Mierke, </em>196 W Va 669, 672, 474 SE2d 599, 602 [1996], <em>cert denied sub nom. Hartley Mar. Corp. v Paige, </em>519 US 1108 [1997]). Among other things, the court found the requisite nexus had been established by the taxpayers\u2019 maintenance of offices and employees, the ownership of real property and the transportation of goods to and from businesses within the state <em>(see Hartley, </em>196 W Va at 679, 474 SE2d at 609).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The Supreme Court of Iowa, addressing whether a state excise tax discriminated against railroads, compared a sales tax levied on fuel purchased within the state for use by barges with the excise tax imposed on railroads <em>(see Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v Bair, </em>338 NW2d 338, 347 [Iowa 1983], <em>cert denied </em>465 US 1071 [1984]). The court, applying <em>Complete Auto, </em>held that the state had a sufficient relationship with the vessel traffic in its waters to satisfy the substantial nexus requirement <em>(see Atchison, </em>338 NW2d at 347).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">These decisions support our conclusion that the <em>Complete Auto </em>test is the appropriate test to determine whether these statutes violate the Commerce Clause. Further, consistent with our decision in <em>Orvis, </em>they support the conclusion that physical presence of a business in this state is sufficient to constitute a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d with the state under <em>Complete Auto. </em>The fact that the tax is measured by the consumption of fuel within the state does not alter the State\u2019s authority to tax the privilege of doing business in New York. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Eklof and Reinauer also argue that a tax on a medium of interstate commerce is not permitted (see <em>Quill Corp. v North Dakota, </em>504 US 298 <em>[1992]; National Bellas Hess, Inc. v Department of Revenue of State of Ill., </em>386 US 753 [1967]; <em>Helson v Kentucky, </em>279 US 245 [1929]). However, these cases are inapposite because, as the statute makes clear, it is the privilege of doing business in the state, as measured by the consumption of fuel, that is being taxed here. For the purpose of this facial challenge, it is not necessary to address whether this tax would be constitutional as applied to a foreign business whose only connection with the state is its consumption of fuel as its ships pass through New York in the course of interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Thus, intervenors\u2019 facial constitutional challenge must fail because there is a set of circumstances under which the statute would be valid. A sufficient nexus would exist where the entity being taxed was, for example, a New York corporation, with offices in the state, employing New York citizens and conducting business in the state. This set of facts would constitute a physical presence that is more than a \u201cslightest presence\u201d in New York. Therefore, we conclude that a substantial nexus could exist such that the first prong of the <em>Complete Auto </em>test would be satisfied and the statute could survive a facial constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Intervenors further argue that the retroactive application of the 1997 amendments to the statutes is a due process violation. We remit this issue, and any other issues raised but not determined by the Appellate Division, to that Court for its consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from, and the order of the Appellate Division brought up for review, should be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to that Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Wesley, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and Read concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\">.
