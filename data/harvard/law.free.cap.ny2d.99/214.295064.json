As a matter of public policy, New York State and its subdivisions should be answerable for injuries suffered by helpless children as a result of negligence in the placement and/or supervision of children in their charge. <em>(Barnes v County of Nassau, </em>108 AD2d 50.) II. The negligent placement and/or supervision during the attempt to place a child with a family member by an illegal order is tantamount to foster care when the Family Court has not divested the County of its custodial order and its attendant duties for the health, safety and welfare of said child, pending the interim, before the court renders a final judgment of either custody or adoption. <em>(DeShaney v Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., </em>489 US 189; <em>Burton v Richmond, </em>276 F3d 973.) III. Allegany County is not immune from the prosecution of this action because the standard of care rendered by the County in the placement and supervision of a child in its custody is not immune from a claim of negligence. <em>(Haddock v City of New York, </em>75 NY2d 478; <em>Wayne S. v County of Nassau, Dept. of Social Servs., </em>83 AD2d 628; <em>Barnes v County of Nassau, </em>108 AD2d 50; <em>Santangelo v State of New York, </em>101 AD2d 20.) IV. The \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine should permit the Supreme Court, in its discretion, to adopt the findings of the Federal District Court as a court of coordinate jurisdiction. <em>(People v Evans, </em>94 NY2d 499; <em>Martin v City of Cohoes, </em>37 NY2d 162.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-11\"><em>Colucci &amp; Gallaher, P.C., </em>Buffalo <em>(D.

An intermediate appellate court is not a court of coordinate jurisdiction with a trial court: the law of the case doctrine is not binding on appeal. <em>(Martin v City of Cohoes, </em>37 NY2d 162, 817; <em>Rager v McCloskey, </em>305 NY 75; <em>Matter of Doe, </em>184 Misc 2d 519; <em>People v Trabazo, </em>180 Misc 2d 961; <em>Bankers Trust Co. v Broten, </em>101 Misc 2d 227; <em>Matter of Hyatt Legal Servs., </em>97 AD2d 983; <em>Matter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>of Fry v Village of Tarrytown, </em>89 NY2d 714; <em>Topal v State of New York, </em>263 AD2d 414; <em>Gelin v Lehman Coll., </em>254 AD2d 119; <em>Lublin v State of New York, </em>135 Misc 2d 419, 135 AD2d 1155, 71 NY2d 802.) II. Common law provides absolute immunity from subsequent damages liability for all persons who are integral parts of the judicial process. <em>(Burns v Reed, </em>500 US 478; <em>Fariello v Campbell, </em>860 F Supp 54; <em>Forrester v White, </em>484 US 219; <em>Stump v Sparkman, </em>435 US 349; <em>Mireles v Waco, </em>502 US 9; <em>Cappello v State of New York, </em>125 F Supp 2d 75; <em>Schwartz v Weinstein, </em>459 F2d 882; <em>Pierson v Ray, </em>386 US 547; <em>Smallwood v United States of Am., </em>358 F Supp 398; <em>Gregoire v Biddle, </em>177 F2d 579.) III. A municipality is afforded qualified immunity for acts of discretionary decisionmaking by its officials. <em>(Hill v City of New York, 45 </em>F3d 653; <em>Hiller v County of Suffolk, </em>81 F Supp 2d 420; <em>Rottkamp v Young, </em>21 AD2d 373, 15 NY2d 831; <em>Gregoire v Biddle, </em>177 F2d 579; <em>Tango v Tulevech, </em>61 NY2d 34; <em>Lauer v City of New York, </em>95 NY2d 95; <em>Santangelo v State of New York, </em>101 AD2d 20; <em>Arteaga v State of New York, </em>72 NY2d 212; <em>Haddock v City of New York, </em>75 NY2d 478; <em>Mon v City of New York, </em>78 NY2d 309.) IV. Plaintiff-appellant\u2019s presentation of facts and policy arguments injects issues not properly before this Court. <em>(O\u2019Brien v City of Syracuse, </em>54 NY2d 353; <em>Matter of Frederick S., </em>178 Misc 2d 152; <em>Matter of Dale P., </em>84 NY2d 72; <em>Tilles Inv. Co. v Gulotta, </em>288 AD2d 303.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b282-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b282-6\">Wesley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Jarrett Eck, the 21/2-year-old son of plaintiff Melissa Jean Mosher-Simons, was fatally beaten by his maternal aunt and temporary custodian, Deborah Mosher. This appeal concerns a claim, brought on Jarrett\u2019s behalf by his mother, that a preplacement home study evaluation was inadequately performed by the County of Allegany. Because the court-ordered home study is an integral part of the judicial process, the County is entitled to judicial immunity. We therefore affirm the order of the Appellate Division dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">On April 16, 1991, the Allegany County Department of Social Services (DSS) took emergency custody of then seven-month-old Jarrett after receiving a report of suspected abuse and neglect at the hands of his mother. DSS brought a neglect proceeding in Allegany County Family Court against Jarrett\u2019s parents seeking termination of parental rights <em>(see </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b). After the court suspended judgment for one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>year (see Family Ct Act \u00a7 633), DSS assumed temporary custody of Jarrett and placed him in foster care. Mosher filed a custody petition with the court; Jarrett\u2019s paternal grandmother did the same two months later. The court held a hearing in December of 1992 during which plaintiff and the child\u2019s father admitted to permanently neglecting Jarrett. The court then ordered DSS to complete home studies of the parties requesting custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The home studies, which evaluated the \u201cresidential conditions, household composition, financial situation, and ability of both [parties] to provide a safe and stable environment,\u201d were delivered to the court. The studies did not recommend a specific placement but did provide information about both potential custodians to aid in the court\u2019s placement decision. Family Court then held a hearing on February 17, 1993 to, in the words of the Assistant County Attorney, \u201cpermanently settle the various files concerning [Jarrett] and [his] parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">With counsel present, the parties stipulated that the child be placed with his maternal aunt, Deborah Mosher.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on the stipulation, the court entered an order that granted Mosher custody and also assigned a caseworker to monitor Jarrett\u2019s placement. On March 29, 1993, Family Court considered a new custody application brought by Jarrett\u2019s former foster parents <em>(see </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 383). Plaintiff opposed the application and asked for sanctions, but the court instead made the Mosher placement temporary and scheduled a hearing. Tragically, Jarrett Eck died three weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Plaintiff then commenced an action against Allegany County and others in federal court seeking damages for Jarrett\u2019s injuries and death. In response to motions for summary judgment by the County and other defendants, the District Court dismissed, with prejudice, all state and federal causes of action except for a negligent placement claim founded on the County\u2019s alleged negligent performance of the aunt\u2019s home study. The court reasoned that, because the caseworker\u2019s \u201cevaluation led directly to the placement of the [child],\u201d plaintiffs allegations of negligence in preparing the home study extended to the placement of the child <em>(Mosher-Simons v County of Allegany, </em>1997 US Dist LEXIS 16426, *25, 1997 WL 662512, *9 [WD NY, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Oct. 8, 1997]). Relying on <em>Barnes v County of Nassau </em>(108 AD2d 50 [2d Dept 1985]), the court refused to bar the negligent placement claim based on governmental immunity; however, the court later dismissed that remaining claim, declining to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Second Circuit affirmed <em>(see Mosher-Simons v County of Allegany, </em>159 F3d 1347 [2d Cir 1998]).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Plaintiff then brought an action in Supreme Court alleging the same state law theories of negligence asserted against the County in the federal action. The County moved for summary judgment. The court ruled that res judicata precluded relitigation of the dismissed claims but refused to dismiss the negligent placement claim because the District Court decision constituted the law of the case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Appellate Division modified the court\u2019s order and dismissed that remaining claim (288 AD2d 823 [4th Dept 2001]). Initially, the Court noted that, as an appellate court, it was not bound by the District Court decision as law of the case <em>(see id. </em>at 824, citing <em>Martin v City of Cohoes, </em>37 NY2d 162, 165 [1975], <em>rearg denied </em>37 NY2d 817 [1975]). Turning to the merits, the Court held that the County was entitled to judicial immunity because the home study was performed at the direction of the Family Court. In addition, the Court determined that the County was also entitled to governmental immunity because it \u201cacted in a discretionary rather than a ministerial capacity when it issued the home study\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 825, citing <em>Tango v Tulevech, </em>61 NY2d 34, 40-42 [1983]; <em>see also Haddock v City of New York, </em>75 NY2d 478, 484 [1990]). We granted plaintiffs motion for leave to appeal, and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The only issue before us is whether summary judgment was properly granted on what the District Court categorized as plaintiffs negligent placement claim <em>(see Mosher-Simons, </em>1997 US Dist LEXIS 16426, *11, 1997 WL 662512, *4). All other causes of action, mirroring those previously dismissed on the merits in the federal action, are precluded by res judicata principles <em>(see People v Evans, </em>94 NY2d 499, 502 [2000], <em>rearg denied </em>96 NY2d 755 [2001]). Moreover, the law of the case doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>trine does not dictate our review of the remaining claim as this Court is not one of \u201ccoordinate jurisdiction\u201d in relation to the District Court <em>(see id., </em>at 503, citing <em>Martin, </em>37 NY2d at 165 [law of the case is \u201ca concept regulating pre-judgment rulings made by courts of coordinate jurisdiction in a single litigation\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The negligent placement claim is premised on an allegation in the complaint that the County \u201cfailed to * * * prepare adequate home evaluations,\u201d which were relied upon by the court in placing Jarrett with his aunt. The home study contains no specific recommendation, however, and did not effectuate the placement. Rather, placement was court-ordered after all parties, including plaintiff\u2019s attorney and Jarrett\u2019s law guardian, agreed. Thus, despite prior characterization of the claim at issue here as one of negligent placement, it can only be depicted as one premised on a faulty home evaluation by the DSS caseworker.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The County asserts that plaintiff\u2019s claim should fail because the court, not the County, placed Jarrett, and because the couft-ordered home study evaluation is cloaked in judicial immunity. According to the County, the caseworker\u2019s acts were essential to the judicial decision-making process and the caseworker functioned as an \u201carm of the court.\u201d Thus, the County asserts that, like the Family Court, it is immune from suit based on its having performed the court-ordered home study. Under these circumstances, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u201cCourts have recognized that it is imperative to the nature of the judicial function that Judges be free to make decisions without fear of retribution through accusations of malicious wrongdoing\u201d <em>(Tarter v State of New York, </em>68 NY2d 511, 518 [1986]; <em>see also Antoine v Byers &amp; Anderson, Inc., </em>508 US 429, 435 [1993]). Judicial immunity discourages inappropriate collateral attacks on court rulings and fosters judicial independence by protecting courts and judges from vexatious litigation. Indeed, \u201c[m]ost judicial mistakes or wrongs are open to correction through ordinary mechanisms of review, which are largely free of the harmful side-effects inevitably associated with exposing judges to personal liability\u201d <em>(Forrester v White, </em>484 US 219, 227 [1988]). Allowing members of the judiciary to exercise independent judgment, without the threat of legal reprisal, is \u201ccritical to our judicial system\u201d <em>(Tarter, </em>68 NY2d at 518).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Recognizing the distinct nature of the judicial process, \u201cjudicial immunity * * * protects Judges only in the perfor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>manee of their judicial functions\u201d <em>(id.). </em>A logical extension of this premise is that <em>\u201cother neutrally positioned government officials, regardless of title, who are delegated judicial or quasi-judicial functions should also not be shackled with the fear of civil retribution for their acts\u201d (id.). </em>\u201c[T]he common law provide [s] absolute immunity from subsequent damages liability for all persons \u2014 governmental or otherwise \u2014 who [a] re integral parts of the judicial process\u201d <em>(Briscoe v LaHue, </em>460 US 325, 335 [1983]; <em>see also </em>Prosser and Keeton, Torts \u00a7 132, at 1058 [5th ed] [\u201cjudicial immunity has been extended to * * * adjuncts of the judicial process\u201d]). Notably, this extension of judicial immunity to those whose actions are an integral part of the judicial process is limited. It is circumscribed to claims arising from the performance of the specific judicially delegated function.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In this case the Family Court, whose order placed Jarrett in Mosher\u2019s custody, is immune from a claim of negligent placement; the placement was undeniably the execution of a judicial function. In fact, plaintiff makes no attempt to raise such a claim. It follows then that the antecedent fact-gathering process necessary for the court to reach this placement decision also must be cloaked with judicial immunity. The court-ordered DSS home study was an integral part of the judicial decision-making process. The caseworker gathered and reported pertinent information to assist the court in determining an appropriate place for Jarrett to live. The information necessary for the placement decision was available only by way of evaluations that would be impracticable for the court to perform itself. Indeed, the Social Services Law recognizes the important role played by caseworkers in gathering information on behalf of the Family Court <em>(see </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 424 [12] [\u201cEach child protective service shall * * * assist the family court or criminal court during all stages of the court proceeding in accordance with the purposes of this title and the family court act\u201d]). Thus, the caseworker functioned as an extension of the court and was acting within the scope of the court\u2019s order when he completed the study. The County is therefore entitled to judicial immunity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a slightly different context, one court has noted that \u201cto permit [a DSS caseworker] to become \u2018a lightning rod for harassing litigation aimed at judicial orders\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>would seriously imperil the effectiveness of state child protection schemes\u201d <em>(Coverdell v Department of Social &amp; Health Servs., State of Wash., </em>834 F2d 758, 765 [9th Cir 1987]). Similar concerns inform our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">. Plaintiffs attorney specifically noted that she agreed with the stipulation, provided she could re-petition the court for expanded visitation after receiving counseling and an evaluation. The law guardian also ratified the stipulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\">. 28 USC 1367 \u00a7 (c) (3) provides that \u201c[t]he district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if * * * the district court'has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction * * *.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\">. Without opposition from the County, the court also granted plaintiffs motion to amend her complaint to withdraw the causes of action brought by her individually.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\">. In light of this determination, we need not address whether the County also had a defense to liability for allegations of an inadequate home study evaluation or negligent placement on a theory of governmental immunity (see <em>Haddock v City of New York, </em>75 NY2d 478, 484 [1990]; <em>Tango v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>Tulevech, </em>61 NY2d 34, 40-42 [1983]; <em>but see Barnes v County of Nassau, </em>108 AD2d 50 [2d Dept 1985]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
