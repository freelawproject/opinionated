The issue before us is whether petitioner is foreclosed from pursuing her complaint at the Division due to her failure to file a notice of claim with Nassau County within 90 days following her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>termination. We conclude, as did the Appellate Division, that petitioner was not required to file a notice of claim as a condition precedent to administrative review of her complaint by the Division of Human Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">On January 9, 1992, petitioner was terminated from her employment as Chief of the Office of Marine Ecology for the Nassau County Department of Health. Petitioner timely filed a formal charge of discrimination with the New York State Division of Human Rights in April 1992. As later amended, her claim alleged that she was terminated as a result of gender and age discrimination. The Division notified the Nassau County Department of Health of petitioner\u2019s allegations within weeks of the filing of the complaint and, soon thereafter, the Department filed written responses contending that petitioner\u2019s position was abolished due to budget cuts. After a preliminary investigation, the Division concluded there was probable cause to believe the Department had engaged in discrimination and recommended that a hearing be scheduled or, upon agreement of the parties, that the matter be submitted to arbitration. No hearing or other action was taken, however, until July 1999 when the Division notified petitioner of its intent to dismiss her complaint based on her failure to file a notice of claim with the County within 90 days after her termination in accordance with County Law \u00a7 52 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Petitioner then commenced this judicial proceeding against Nassau County and the Nassau County Department of Health seeking a declaratory judgment that her failure to file a notice of claim was not a valid ground for dismissal of her administrative complaint or, in the alternative, requesting permission to file a late notice of claim. Supreme Court declared that petitioner was not required to serve Nassau County with a notice of claim prior to pursuing relief from the Division of Human Rights and the Appellate Division affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Executive Law article 15, New York\u2019s Human Rights Law, precludes discrimination in employment on the basis of age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, sex, disability, genetic predisposition or carrier status, or marital status (Executive Law \u00a7 296 [1]). \u201cTo ensure the protection of [these rights] the Legislature enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme that provides employees with both the means to combat employment discrimination and a framework for redress\u201d <em>(Matter of Aurecchione v New York State Div. of Human Rights, </em>98 NY2d 21, 25 [2002]). Integral to the scheme was the creation in 1968 of the Division of Human Rights, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>executive agency whose primary mission is to actively enforce the substantive provisions of the Human Rights Law <em>(see </em>L 1968, ch 958). We have recognized that the agency has acquired \u201cdecades of special experience in weighing the merit and value of [Human Rights Law] claims\u201d <em>(Matter of New York City Tr. Auth. v State Div. of Human Rights, </em>78 NY2d 207, 216 [1991]).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In addition to a private right to commence a judicial action based on a Human Rights Law violation, the Legislature also provided a unique and exclusive forum for the adjudication of claims of unlawful discrimination \u2014 an administrative proceeding before the Division. Under the statutory election of remedies provisions, when an aggrieved party chooses to file a claim before the Division, the complainant is generally foreclosed from seeking redress elsewhere while the claim is pending <em>(see </em>Executive Law \u00a7 297 [9]; \u00a7 300).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Executive Law \u00a7 297 sets forth the procedures for the filing and resolution of complaints of unlawful discrimination by the Division. That statute specifically prescribes the time period within which an aggrieved party must pursue relief, requiring that the party file a verified complaint in writing with the Division \u201cwithin one year after the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice\u201d (Executive Law \u00a7 297 [5]; <em>see also </em>9 NYCRR 465.3 [e]). When a complaint is filed, the Division is obligated to promptly serve a copy on the respondents (Executive Law \u00a7 297 [2]; <em>see also </em>9 NYCRR 465.3 [g]), who are given an opportunity to respond. The Division then investigates and determines whether there is probable cause to proceed further <em>(see </em>Executive Law \u00a7 297 [2] [a]). Upon a preliminary finding of probable cause, the Division attempts conciliation of the dispute between the parties <em>(see </em>Executive Law \u00a7 297 [3] [a]) and, absent a settlement or an agreement to arbitrate, schedules the matter for a hearing <em>(see </em>Executive Law \u00a7 297 [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">In the event that a petitioner proceeds without legal representation, the Division will supply an agency attorney or other agent to present the complainant\u2019s case at the hearing <em>(see </em>9 NYCRR 465.13 [d] [1]). Even when a petitioner has retained private counsel, \u201c[w]here the division attorney determines that there exists a substantial public interest or an important or novel issue of law, the division attorney shall appear at the hearing\u201d (9 NYCRR 465.13 [h] [1]) and assist in prosecution of the claim. After the hearing, the Commissioner issues findings of fact and a determination addressing the merits of the discrimination claim <em>(see </em>Executive Law \u00a7 297 [4] [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>If the complaint is sustained, the Commissioner has broad powers to grant relief \u201creasonably related to the discriminatory conduct\u201d <em>(Matter of New York City Tr. Auth. v State Div. of Human Rights, </em>78 NY2d at 217). Indeed, \u201cthe extremely strong statutory policy of eliminating discrimination gives the Commissioner greater discretion in effecting an appropriate remedy than under strict common-law principles\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 216) and, as a result, \u201c[t]he administrative forum offers a complainant remedies not available from a court\u201d <em>(Marine Midland Bank v New York State Div. of Human Rights, </em>75 NY2d 240, 244 [1989], citing Executive Law \u00a7 297 [3] [a]). In addition to restoring a benefit unlawfully taken from the aggrieved party, the Commissioner is authorized to order an employer to cease and desist the discriminatory practice, direct the reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, and award compensatory damages, including for mental anguish and other forms of pain and suffering <em>(see </em>Executive Law \u00a7 297 [4] [c]; <em>Matter of New York City Tr. Auth. v State Div. of Human Rights, </em>78 NY2d 207). In short, the Division is empowered to make an aggrieved party whole and, in the process, to eradicate the underlying discriminatory practices that resulted in injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">As is evident from the foregoing, the Division\u2019s administrative forum affords petitioners seeking redress for their claims a procedurally less complicated alternative to litigation in court. The proceeding is also designed to be affordable; it allows a complainant to avoid filing fees and other expenses related to commencement of a civil action and facilitates prosecution of the claim without hiring an attorney. And because conciliation efforts are an integral part of the administrative process, it provides a unique vehicle \u2014 effective in some instances \u2014 to resolve claims expeditiously <em>(see </em>Executive Law \u00a7 297 [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In this case, it is undisputed that petitioner met the Executive Law \u00a7 297 (5) time requirement by filing her complaint with the Division within the one-year limitations period. Thereafter, the Division promptly notified the alleged wrongdoer of the complaint \u2014 the Nassau County Department of Health was advised of the allegations within weeks of the filing of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Although petitioner concededly complied with the procedural requirements of Executive Law \u00a7 297, respondents contend that the filing of a notice of claim with the County was a prerequisite to bringing a section 297 proceeding and her failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>to do so mandates dismissal of the proceeding. We disagree. Nothing in the Human Rights statutes or regulations suggests that an aggrieved party is required to take any action prior to seeking administrative relief beyond timely filing a complaint with the Division, nor would judicial imposition of such a requirement be consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent to provide aggrieved parties a simplified alternative to litigation as a means to resolve discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The only reference in the administrative scheme to additional procedural requirements appears in Executive Law \u00a7 297 (9) which states that, after the Division dismisses a complaint for administrative convenience, an aggrieved party who then seeks judicial relief is subject to \u201cthe statute of limitations in effect in such court at the time the complaint was initially filed with the division.\u201d Thus, the Legislature was well aware that statutes of limitations found outside Executive Law \u00a7 297 (5) would be applied to discrimination claims brought in court. If the Legislature intended that those limiting statutes apply to section 297 proceedings it would have so provided.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And if external statutes of limitations do not govern pending Division proceedings, we are not persuaded that notice of claim requirements should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The Division relied on <em>Mills v County of Monroe </em>(59 NY2d 307 [1983]) and County Law \u00a7 52 (1) as the basis for imposing a notice of claim requirement as a condition precedent to relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>in these circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither of those authorities compels us to import such a requirement into an Executive Law \u00a7 297 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The issue before the Court in <em>Mills </em>was whether the County Law \u00a7 52 (1) notice of claim requirement applied to plaintiffs employment discrimination action commenced in Supreme Court under Executive Law \u00a7 296 and 42 USC \u00a7 1981. Because <em>Mills </em>involved a judicial action rather than a Division of Human Rights administrative proceeding, Executive Law \u00a7 297 (5) was not implicated. Hence, in determining that the filing of a notice of claim was a condition precedent to judicial relief under the circumstances of that case, the Court was not presented with and did not decide the issue before us here\u2014 whether an aggrieved party\u2019s failure to file a notice of claim is a fatal defect necessitating dismissal of an Executive Law \u00a7 297 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">County Law \u00a7 52 (1) incorporates by reference the notice of claim requirement articulated in General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-e (1) (a), which provides that \u201c[i]n any case founded upon tort where a notice of claim is required by law as a condition precedent to commencement of an action or special proceeding,\u201d a notice of claim must be served within 90 days after the claim arises. The penalty for noncompliance appears in General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-i (1), which prohibits an \u201caction or special proceeding\u201d from being prosecuted against a \u201ccity, county, town, village, fire district or school district for personal injury, wrongful death or damage to real or personal property\u201d unless a notice of claim has been timely served. Given the Legislature\u2019s intent that the Division provide a unique vehicle for administrative relief, and in light of the specific procedure set forth in Executive Law \u00a7 297 (5) for commencing a Division proceeding, we discern no evidence of legislative intention to classify a Division of Human Rights proceeding as akin to the typical \u201caction or special proceeding\u201d referenced in the general notice of claim provisions upon which respondents rely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we concur with Supreme Court and the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Division that the General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-i penalty of dismissal for failure to file a notice of claim is inapplicable in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">To the extent that our decision in <em>Board of Educ. of Union Free School Dist. No. 2, E. Williston, Town of N. Hempstead v New York State Div. of Human Rights </em>(Arluck) (44 NY2d 902 [1978]) suggests that a petitioner must file a notice of claim prior to pursuing administrative relief from the Division, it is not to be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Because we hold that notice of claim requirements are inapplicable to Executive Law \u00a7 297 claims timely filed with the Division, we need not address petitioner\u2019s further argument that her claim fell within the exception to the notice of claim requirement for actions brought to vindicate a public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Ciparick, Wesley, Rosenblatt and Read concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-7\">. Notably, before Executive Law \u00a7 297 (9) was amended in 1997 (see L 1997, ch 374), a party who attempted to pursue a claim in the Division but failed to timely commence the proceeding under section 297 (5) was foreclosed either from obtaining relief from the Division or from bringing a judicial action (see <em>Marine Midland Bank v New York State Div. of Human Rights, </em>75 NY2d 240 [1989]). Even though the statute of limitations applicable to the judicial action had not elapsed, we held that once petitioner elected to initiate a Division proceeding, the claim was governed by the commencement requirements in section 297 (5) even though this provision imposed a shorter limitations period. The election of remedies provisions we interpreted in <em>Marine Midland </em>have since been substantially amended to allow aggrieved parties broader access to courts following a Division dismissal <em>(see L </em>1997, ch 374; Executive Law \u00a7 297 [9]). However, the one-year filing requirement in section 297 (5) remains unchanged. In this case, we are asked to determine the converse issue: if a petitioner timely files a claim under section 297 (5) must her complaint be dismissed due to her failure to file a notice of claim? Imposing this requirement would significantly reduce the complainant\u2019s time to act to protect the right to seek redress of a claim in the administrative forum. Having concluded in <em>Marine Midland </em>that a complainant who pursues a section 297 proceeding is not entitled to rely on the longer limitations periods available in court, we decline to hold in this case that a complainant is nonetheless required to comply with the shorter commencement requirements imposed by notice of claim statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b359-6\">. The Division has since altered its position and now contends, in an amicus brief submitted in this Court, that a petitioner need not file a notice of claim prior to pursuing relief before the Division under Executive Law \u00a7297.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\">. Although the Division referred only to County Law \u00a7 52 (1), respondents also rely on the comparable notice of claim requirement in Nassau County Administrative Code \u00a7 11-4.1. Because we conclude that Division proceedings are governed exclusively by the commencement procedures in Executive Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>\u00a7 297 (5), we have no occasion to address this Administrative Code provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
