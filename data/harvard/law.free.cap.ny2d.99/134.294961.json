At trial, two eyewitnesses testified to having observed defendant shoot the victim from point-blank range. One indicated that defendant had black <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>hair and distinctive green eyes. The other surmised that the murder was motivated by a drug turf dispute. Decedent\u2019s brother also testified to defendant\u2019s motivation for the shooting and described defendant\u2019s unique green eyes and black hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Defense counsel pursued a misidentification defense. In her opening statement, she indicated that \u201cthere might be possible discrepancies in identification\u201d and \u201cwhat the [shooter] looked like.\u201d Because a misidentification defense also might imply an alibi for defendant, the prosecutor noted prior to the defense case that no alibi notice had been filed as required by CPL 250.20, and sought confirmation that no alibi defense would be offered. Defense counsel told the court that none of the witnesses or defendant knew their whereabouts at the time of the shooting, and that their testimony would be offered only to establish that defendant\u2019s hair was a distinctive yellow-orange color at the time of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">To establish his defense, defendant called Vivian Rivera, who testified that defendant\u2019s hair had been dyed yellow-orange since 1992 and that defendant, who lived in Massachusetts, had been at her home in the Bronx several days before the shooting with his girlfriend, Iris Santiago. Santiago then testified to defendant\u2019s yellow-orange hair color, and further indicated that around June 20 \u2014 two days before the murder\u2014 she and defendant traveled to Philadelphia for the birthday party of his sister, Anna Torres.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">At the close of Santiago\u2019s direct testimony, the court announced at a bench conference that there was a \u201cproblem\u201d because Santiago\u2019s testimony suggested an alibi. The court and counsel discussed possible remedies, and the court reserved decision on what to do. Santiago on cross testified that she and defendant left Massachusetts around June 20th, spent about an hour in New York and then traveled to Philadelphia where they remained until after June 24, 1994 \u2014 Torres\u2019 birthday. Faced with this unnoticed alibi testimony, the court asked counsel for suggestions on how to proceed. Defense counsel reiterated that none of the defense witnesses had previously been able to recall their whereabouts on June 22, 1994 \u2014 the day of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The next day the People requested that Santiago\u2019s testimony be allowed to stand, indicating that the prosecution would inquire when Santiago had first related where she was with defendant on the day of the shooting <em>(see generally People v Dawson, </em>50 NY2d 311 [1980]). The People also asked that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Torres testified, she be precluded from offering any testimony about an alibi. The court indicated that Torres could testify about defendant\u2019s hair color at the time of the shooting, but expressed concern that her testimony was \u201cinextricably interwoven\u201d with defendant\u2019s presence in Philadelphia. Realizing that any limitation of Torres\u2019 testimony also might limit cross-examination, the prosecution withdrew its preclusion request.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The court then inquired of defense counsel why Santiago and Torres may have failed to disclose their exculpatory information prior to trial. Counsel indicated that neither she nor any other attorney had encouraged their silence in this regard, and reiterated that the witnesses had previously been unable to pinpoint defendant\u2019s whereabouts on the day of the shooting. The court expressed concern that defense counsel might be called as a witness and noted that \u201cit is not desirable that [defense counsel] be called * * * to impeach one of the defense witnesses.\u201d Defense counsel agreed and indicated that she might be willing to stipulate that the witnesses had not told her. of the alibi information prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">When the trial resumed, Santiago testified on cross-examination that she had told defense counsel she was with defendant in Philadelphia on the day of the shooting. Torres, who testified next, similarly stated that defendant was with her in Philadelphia from June 20 through June 25 and that she had previously related that fact to defense counsel. Defendant testified that he had yellow-orange hair at the time of the shooting and that he was in Philadelphia from June 20 to June 25 to celebrate his sister\u2019s birthday \u2014 information that he recalled for the first time at trial after hearing the testimony of Santiago and Torres.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">After the defense rested the court and counsel drafted the following stipulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">\u201cIt is stipulated and agreed by [defense counsel] that prior to their appearing in New York to give testimony in this case, Miss Santiago and Miss Torres had spoken with her and that neither Miss Santiago or Miss Torres told [defense counsel] that the defendant Dario Berroa had been in Philadelphia specifically on June 22nd, 1994.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The court read the stipulation to the jury at the start of the People\u2019s rebuttal case. During summation defense counsel continued to argue to the jury that the only issue in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>was misidentification. In addressing the alibi testimony and informing the jury of its option to either \u201cdisregard\u201d or \u201clook at\u201d the testimony, defense counsel also stated \u201cyou heard my stipulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Defendant was found guilty of murder in the second degree and sentenced to 25 years to life imprisonment. The Appellate Division affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction, rejecting his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. One Justice dissented and granted defendant leave to appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">As an initial matter, unlike the majority and the dissent at the Appellate Division, we do not view defense counsel\u2019s revelation of the witnesses\u2019 prior statements to be based on either an overzealous defense of her reputation or the fulfillment of her ethical duties. Before any potential conflict had arisen, and before any defense witnesses had testified, defense counsel initially disclosed the information to explain why no alibi notice had been filed. The attempt to remedy the dilemma that unfolded once the witnesses testified \u2014 not defense counsel\u2019s reason for the disclosure \u2014 is the appropriate focus of our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Defendant claims that he was deprived of his constitutional right to conflict-free counsel when his attorney agreed to stipulate that Santiago and Torres had not previously informed her that defendant was in Philadelphia on the day of the shooting. Defendant contends that the stipulation transformed his advocate into an adverse witness whose credibility was pitted against his other witnesses. Under the unusual facts of this case, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The right to effective assistance of counsel in criminal proceedings is guaranteed by the New York and Federal Constitutions <em>(see </em>US Const 6th Amend; NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6). Our state standard for effective assistance of counsel \u201chas long been whether the defendant was afforded \u2018meaningful representation\u2019\u201d <em>(People v Henry, </em>95 NY2d 563, 565 [2000], quoting <em>People v Benevento, </em>91 NY2d 708, 712 [1998]). In applying this standard we have emphasized the difference between ineffective representation and losing trial tactics <em>(see Benevento, </em>91 NY2d at 712). Indeed, counsel\u2019s performance will not be considered ineffective, even if unsuccessful, as long as it reflects an objectively reasonable and legitimate trial strategy under the circumstances and evidence presented <em>(see id. </em>at 712-713; <em>People v Satterfield, </em>66 NY2d 796, 799 [1985]). \u201cWhat constitutes effective assistance of counsel is not and cannot be fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>with yardstick precision, but varies according to the unique circumstances of each representation\u201d <em>(People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 146 [1981]).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">An ineffective assistance of counsel claim also may be premised on a conflict of interest. The right to effective counsel ensures not only meaningful representation but also the assistance of counsel that is \u201cconflict-free and singlemindedly devoted to the client\u2019s best interests\u201d <em>(People v Longtin, </em>92 NY2d 640, 644 [1998], <em>cert denied </em>526 US 1114 [1999]; see <em>also People v Ortiz, </em>76 NY2d 652, 656 [1990]). That right is impaired when, absent a defendant\u2019s informed consent, defense counsel represents interests which are actually or potentially in conflict with those of the defendant (see <em>People v McDonald, </em>68 NY2d 1, 8 [1986]; see <em>also Longtin, </em>92 NY2d at 644). Conflicting interests may arise in the simultaneous representation of clients with adverse interests (see <em>Ortiz, </em>76 NY2d at 656; <em>McDonald, </em>68 NY2d at 9; <em>People v Mattison, </em>67 NY2d 462, 468 [1986], <em>cert denied </em>479 US 984 [1986]), or in successive representations because of an attorney\u2019s duty to maintain the former client\u2019s confidences even after representation has ceased (see <em>Longtin, </em>92 NY2d at 644; <em>Ortiz, </em>76 NY2d at 656; <em>People v Alicea, </em>61 NY2d 23, 29 [1983]; <em>People v Krausz, </em>84 NY2d 953 [1994]).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Defense counsel\u2019s stipulation in this case presents a circumstance somewhat different from the simultaneous or successive representations usually associated with conflict of interest analysis. The conflict confronting defense counsel here was not that of competing loyalties to clients past or present. Rather, it arose out of counsel\u2019s efforts, taken on defendant\u2019s behalf, to interview friendly witnesses in preparation for trial, and her knowledge that their testimony at trial deviated from their pretrial statements. Notably, at this point the court did not exclude the putative alibi testimony pursuant to CPL 250.20 (3). Instead, the dilemma presented itself when the court suggested \u2014 and counsel did not dispute \u2014 that she was the only source who could impeach two of defendant\u2019s key witnesses and thus stood to be called as a witness. In an attempt to avert this prospect, the parties agreed to the stipulation. The use of the stipulation in lieu of her testimony did not cure the conflict as intended; in this case it exacerbated the conflict by eviscerating the credibility of her client\u2019s witnesses and his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">A lawyer is ethically required to withdraw from acting as an advocate if it is obvious that he or she \u201cmay be called as a witness on a significant issue other than on behalf of the client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>* * * [and] it is apparent that the testimony is or may be prejudicial to the client\u201d (Code of Professional Responsibility DR 5-102 [d] [22 NYCRR 1200.21 (d)]; <em>see also People v Paperno, </em>54 NY2d 294, 299-300 [1981]; Prince, Richardson on Evidence \u00a7 6-114, at 324 [Farrell 11th ed]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An attorney also should not continue to serve as an advocate when it is obvious that the lawyer will be called as a witness on behalf of the client <em>(see </em>DR 5-102 [c] [22 NYCRR 1200.21 (c)]). We acknowledge that the Code provisions concerning matters of professional conduct \u201ccannot be applied as if they were controlling statutory [authority] or decisional law\u201d <em>(S &amp; S Hotel Ventures Ltd. Partnership v </em>777 <em>S.H. Corp., </em>69 NY2d 437, 443 [1987]), and that not every violation of an ethical rule will constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. However, when a lawyer is called to testify against the client\u2019s interest the conflict is obvious. \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The People contend that decisions from Illinois <em>(People v Beals, </em>162 Ill 2d 497, 643 NE2d 789 [1994]) and Connecticut <em>(State v Crespo, </em>246 Conn 665, 718 A2d 925 [1998]) and our decision in <em>People v Baldi </em>(54 NY2d 137) demonstrate that a testimonial stipulation may constitute a legitimate trial strategy even when the facts stipulated may be prejudicial to the defendant. In <em>Beals, </em>the Supreme Court of Illinois approved the use of two trial stipulations by defense counsel that contained facts that were, in the court\u2019s opinion, insignificant or not relevant to the testimony of defendant\u2019s two key witnesses <em>(see </em>162 Ill 2d at 505, 643 NE2d at 79S-794).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As in this case, the stipulated facts arose from prior statements made by the two witnesses to defense counsel, but in <em>Beals </em>defendant\u2019s sister was also present when the statements were made and had taken notes of the interviews. In fact, those notes served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>as the basis for some of the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination of the witnesses and for the stipulations. Thus, when faced with the prospect of the state calling defendant\u2019s own sister to contradict defendant\u2019s witnesses, the court held that defense counsel employed a legitimate trial strategy by offering the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>Crespo </em>also involved the propriety of a stipulation provided by defense counsel <em>{see, </em>246 Conn 665, 718 A2d 925). The defendant in that case had strangled his girlfriend and sought counsel\u2019s aid to arrange his surrender. After consulting with the defendant and his family, counsel contacted the police and informed them of the location of the body and circumstances of his disclosure. The defendant was arrested and never denied that he caused the victim\u2019s death. He instead asserted that he did not intend to kill the victim and that he suffered from extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the killing. At trial defense counsel stipulated to the facts of his participation in the initial investigation. Specifically, the stipulation stated that counsel had contacted the state attorney, informed him of the location of the storage bin where the body was found, indicated that he had written consent authorizing the search, provided the keys to the bin and said that the person who gave him the keys was in his law office.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">On appeal defendant claimed that counsel testified against his interests by placing the stipulation of facts into evidence, thereby creating an actual conflict of interest. Although indicating its inability to rule on the ineffective assistance claim because it was unpreserved and the record was inadequate for review, the court noted that counsel\u2019s decision to stipulate to readily ascertainable facts could have been a reasonable trial strategy. The court compared <em>Beals </em>to the facts of its case, and noted that in both \u201cthe information in the stipulation otherwise cpuld have been presented by the prosecution, but the use of the stipulation was strategically preferable to the defendant and the state\u201d <em>(Crespo, </em>246 Conn at 691, 718 A2d at 939, citing <em>Beals, </em>162 111 2d at 504-505, 643 NE2d at 793). Interestingly, in <em>Crespo </em>the court stated, however, that \u201c[i]f the stipulation [by defense counsel] is the equivalent of an attorney testifying against his client, it is, ipso facto, an actual conflict of interest\u201d (246 Conn at 691, 718 A2d at 939).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">In <em>Baldi </em>(54 NY2d 137), this Court held that the defendant was not deprived of effective assistance of counsel even though his counsel testified as a witness, and portions of the counsel\u2019s testimony contradicted the defendant\u2019s testimony. <em>Baldi, </em>however, is readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Baldi\u2019s attorney, attempting to further an .insanity defense, <em>voluntarily </em>testified at both trials and at a <em>Huntley </em>hearing on the defendant\u2019s behalf <em>(see generally </em>22 NYCRR 1200.21 [c]). Here, by contrast, counsel was in jeopardy of giving compelled testimony against her client, in violation of the traditional advocate-witness rule <em>(see </em>22 NYCRR 1200.21 [d]). The decision to testify under the particular circumstances presented in <em>Baldi, </em>moreover, constituted a legitimate, if unique, trial strategy. The evidence against Baldi \u2014 who professed innocence \u2014 was overwhelming while counsel\u2019s testimony sought to establish a foundation for a credible insanity defense. Here, it was not trial strategy that motivated counsel to impeach her own witnesses via the stipulation. Rather, counsel became a witness in the case when defendant\u2019s witnesses provided a late alibi that differed from their earlier representations to her. Finally, Baldi\u2019s counsel was not, as defense counsel is here, the only source of the impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s stipulation in the instant case arose out of markedly different circumstances than the stipulations in <em>Beals </em>and <em>Crespo, </em>or defense counsel\u2019s testimony in <em>Baldi. </em>Unlike <em>Beals, Crespo </em>and <em>Baldi, </em>defense counsel in this case was the <em>only </em>source of the information contained in the stipulation. Moreover, unlike the insignificant information provided by stipulation in <em>Beals, </em>defense counsel\u2019s credibility was directly and necessarily pitted against that of the defense witnesses. Defense counsel\u2019s stipulation here did not support defendant\u2019s best defense or soften damaging evidence. Thus the stipulation was based on the assumed necessity of counsel\u2019s testimony rather than a legitimate trial strategy. In these unique circumstances, defense counsel\u2019s stipulation crystallized rather than cured the conflict of interest. Indeed, while counsel has a duty to disclose witness peijury to the court <em>(see People v DePallo, </em>96 NY2d 437 [2001]), that duty does not automatically require counsel to provide testimony to rebut the peijury.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Whether a conflict of interest operates on the defense is a mixed question of law and fact <em>(see People v Harris, </em>99 NY2d 202, 210 [2002]; <em>People v Ming Li, </em>91 NY2d 913, 917-918 [1998]). Here, however, there is no support in the record to conclude anything but that, as a matter of law, the conflict created by the adverse stipulation bore \u201ca substantial relation to \u2018the conduct of the defense\u2019 \u201d <em>(McDonald, </em>68 NY2d at 9, quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>People v Lombardo, </em>61 NY2d 97, 103 [1984]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It may well be that defendant\u2019s retrial will produce the same result, but there will be no question that defendant will have the benefit of representation that is not at cross purposes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AuC\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-6\">. The advocate-witness rule is nothing new; its genesis has been traced to both ancient Roman law and the treason trial of Sir Thomas More in 1535, where the prosecuting assistant called himself as a witness for the Crown <em>(see, </em>Luna, <em>Avoiding a \u201cCarnival-Atmosphere\u201d: Trial Court Discretion and the Advocate-Witness Rule, </em>18 Whittier L Rev 447, 453 [1997]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b206-7\">. The first stipulation, deemed insignificant by the court, involved whether or not defendant was wearing a certain jacket at the time of the shooting <em>(see Beals, </em>162 Ill 2d at 504-505, 643 NE2d at 793). The second stipulation, considered irrelevant by the court, indicated that the witness in question had previously given defendant\u2019s attorney a description of the <em>driver </em>of a car that picked up the shooter, and <em>not </em>the <em>shooter </em>as the prosecutor had incorrectly indicated during cross-examination <em>(see id.). </em>The court correctly noted that these stipulations contained no information that undermined or destroyed the witnesses\u2019 testimony that they \u201csaw a man wearing a blue or black outfit firing shots * * * at the approximate time the victims were shot\u201d (162 Ill 2d at 504, 643 NE2d at 793).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\">. In light of this holding, we need not address defendant\u2019s contention that the court failed to obtain a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to conflict-free counsel (see <em>McDonald, </em>68 NY2d at 9; see <em>also People v Gomberg, </em>38 NY2d 307, 312-314 [1975]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b209-8\">. \u201cWhen lawyers have become intertwined with the merits [of a case] * * * they begin to look more like a traditional fact witness. In these circumstances, any factual statements that a lawyer makes should be subject to the same vetting that all witnesses receive, including the requirement that the witnesses be sworn and subject to cross-examination\u201d (McMorrow, <em>The Advocate as Witness: Understanding Context, Culture and Client, </em>70 Fordham L Rev 945, 946 [2001]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
