As a first step, the moving party bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges. Second, the nonmoving party must give a race-neutral reason for each potential juror challenged. In step three, the court determines whether the reason given is merely a pretext for discrimination. Against this background we evaluate the challenged voir dire in the present case, in which defendant\u2019s conviction for criminal possession of stolen property \u2014 an automobile \u2014 was affirmed by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">During the first round of jury selection, the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to three of the first 12 prospective jurors. After the prosecutor removed one Hispanic and two African-American women, defense counsel stated, \u201cI am wondering if we are having a Batson issue here.\u201d Although the prosecutor maintained that the defense had failed to make a prima facie case, and thus no race-neutral reasons were yet required, the court responded, \u201cI am asking anyway. Why have you challenged them?\u201d The prosecutor replied that two, Torres and Gordon, were challenged for family involvement with police officers, and the third, Mapp, because her son had died and the prosecutor \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was appropriate to go into it.\u201d The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">\u201cthe court: Clearly there is good reason to challenge Torres and Gordon. And the only question is Mapp, but that doesn\u2019t make a pattern. I can understand not wanting to go into her son\u2019s death. The challenge is denied. Overruled. Let\u2019s go with defense peremptories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: I would just like to speak as to that. I don\u2019t see how it doesn\u2019t make a pattern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">\u201cthe court: There are reasons to challenge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: In the back row we have one black man left, otherwise he has knocked [out] every one\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">\u201cthe court: Let\u2019s not argue. Let\u2019s not belabor it. There are very good reasons to challenge Torres and Gordon where the whole case reflects on police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>officers, and both * * * have serious problems in their family with police officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Torres and Gordon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cthe court: Both had members of their family\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: They don\u2019t seem to [be] serious. She said a cop embarrassed her son and she told him not to do anything about it. How is that elevated to a serious problem with the police? She answered all the other questions about the police as honestly and openly as everyone else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">\u201cthe court: That\u2019s a good reason to challenge. Denied. You have an exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Thank you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">Before us, defendant maintains that the court improperly revisited step one \u2014 the prima facie case \u2014 after the prosecutor had given his reasons for the challenged strikes; that any possible ruling on pretext as to prospective juror Mapp is unsupported by the record; and that inadequacies in the record were chargeable to the court\u2019s impatience in conducting the inquiry. Although we agree that the trial court\u2019s analysis was less than ideal, because we conclude that defendant \u2014 who bore the ultimate burden of persuasion \u2014 failed at the time to raise his present claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">In furtherance of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cunceasing efforts to eradicate racial discrimination\u201d in the jury selection process, the Court in <em>Batson v Kentucky </em>(476 US at 85, 94-98) prescribed a now-familiar three-step test for determining whether peremptory challenges are based on invidious discrimination. That test is drawn from \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d cases under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 <em>(id. </em>at 94 n 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">Under <em>Batson </em>and its progeny, the party claiming discriminatory use of peremptories must first make out a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination by showing that the facts and circumstances of the voir dire raise an inference that the other party excused one or more jurors for an impermissible reason. \u201cThere are no fixed rules for determining what evidence will * * * establish a prima facie case of discrimination\u201d <em>(People v Bolling, </em>79 NY2d 317, 323-324 [1992]). Although as part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>their prima facie case parties often rely on numbers to show a pattern of strikes against a particular group of jurors, a prima facie case may be made based on the peremptory challenge of a single juror that gives rise to an inference of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Once a prima facie showing of discrimination is made, the nonmovant must come forward with a race-neutral explanation for each challenged peremptory \u2014 step two. If the nonmovant cannot meet this burden, an equal protection violation is established. However, once race-neutral reasons are given, the inference of discrimination is overcome. At this second stage the reasons need be only facially permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The third step of the <em>Batson </em>inquiry requires the trial court to make an ultimate determination on the issue of discriminatory intent based on all of the facts and circumstances presented. Unlike step two, this determination is a question of fact, focused on the credibility of the race-neutral reasons. Courts may determine that the proffered reasons are pretextual without further arguments by the moving party, but the moving party has the ultimate burden of persuading the court that the reasons are merely a pretext for intentional discrimination (Pe<em>ople v Payne, </em>88 NY2d 172, 183-184 [1996]). It is therefore the moving party\u2019s burden to make a record that would support a finding of pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">As should be clear from this summary, the <em>Batson </em>procedure effectuates its purpose only if the steps are followed in sequence. It makes no sense, for example, to revisit the issue of whether a prima facie case has been made once the prosecutor has come forward with race-neutral reasons. At that point, the presumption of discrimination raised by the movant\u2019s initial prima facie case has been rebutted, and to revisit the adequacy of the step one showing \u201cunnecessarily evade [s] the ultimate question of discrimination\u201d <em>(Durant v Strack, </em>151 F Supp 2d 226, 236 [ED NY 2001]). Similarly, when courts combine steps two and three by requiring the nonmoving party to provide <em>nonpretextual </em>race-neutral reasons, they inappropriately shift the ultimate burden from the moving party <em>(see Payne, </em>88 NY2d at 186-187).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Applying these principles to the present case, we conclude that although the court improperly rushed and compressed the <em>Batson </em>inquiry, defendant failed to meet his burden of establishing an equal protection violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">When defendant first raised a <em>Batson </em>objection, the trial court should have decided whether the defense met its step-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>one burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. That issue became moot when the People stated their reasons and the court ruled on the ultimate issue <em>(see People v James, </em>99 NY2d 264 [2002]). The prosecutor\u2019s reasons for all three challenged strikes were facially race-neutral, and thus met the step-two burden of production. The court appears to have melded steps two and three, however, by immediately concluding that the reasons were acceptable as to Torres and Gordon, without first allowing defense counsel to make an argument that the reasons were pretextual. This practice falls short of a \u201cmeaningful inquiry into the question of discrimination,\u201d and we caution trial courts to avoid undue haste and compression in this crucial process <em>(Jordan v Lefevre, </em>206 F3d 196, 201 [2d Cir 2000]).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In this case the proffered reasons as to Torres and Gordon are clearly nonpretextual, and defendant does not challenge those reasons on appeal. The situation is different with respect to prospective juror Mapp. The trial court was wrong in dismissing defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge with the statement that \u201cthe only question is Mapp, but that doesn\u2019t make a pattern.\u201d The fact that satisfactory reasons were given for striking two other jurors does not defeat defendant\u2019s prima facie case as to Mapp. Improper removal of even a single juror may be a violation of equal protection. The court should have moved on to a determination of pretext, or step three.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Here, however, defendant\u2019s argument regarding Mapp is unpreserved and cannot be reached. Based on this record, the prosecutor\u2019s proffered reason for challenging Mapp \u2014 the death of her child \u2014 also might have been nonpretextual <em>(see, by contrast, Jordan, </em>206 F3d at 201). Matters such as the prospective juror\u2019s demeanor may well have prompted the court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cI can understand not wanting to go into her son\u2019s death.\u201d While defense counsel persisted in her challenge regarding Torres and Gordon despite the court\u2019s impatience, she said nothing further about Mapp at a time when any ambiguity \u2014 if indeed she actually perceived any ambiguity \u2014 could have been clarified.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that counsel was \u201csquelched\u201d and not permitted to make her pretext case with respect to Mapp. Despite the sometimes enormous pressures of trial, it is for courts to discharge their responsibilities under the law and for counsel to voice objection when they do not. In particular, we underscore the importance both of trial court attention to each of <em>Batson\u2019s </em>well-articulated, sequential steps, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>and of trial counsel attention to placing their objections on the record so they may be addressed by the court. In this way, the law can be observed and potential error avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Judges Smith, Ciparick, Wesley, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and Read concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
