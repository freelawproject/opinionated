Both cases present the same question: whether the grievances are arbitrable. We conclude that they are, and therefore affirm the Appellate Division orders dismissing the Cities\u2019 petitions to stay the arbitrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">In December 1998 and April 1999, the PBAs and the Cities of Johnstown and Schenectady, respectively, signed the collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) at issue. The agreements contain the terms and conditions of employment for police officers, and were negotiated and signed by the municipalities and the PBAs. Under each CBA, retirement benefits were to be computed using the definition of \u201cFinal Average Salary\u201d in Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 302 (9) (d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the parties signed the CBAs, the statute provided that retirement benefits for Tier I police and fire employees could be based on an employee\u2019s average monthly salary for the 12 months immediately preceding retirement. Tier I employees were statutorily defined as \u201cemployees of a participating employer who were such employees on or before June thirtieth, nineteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>hundred seventy-three\u201d (former Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 302 [9] [d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">In November 1999, the Legislature amended Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 302 (9) (d). Under the amended statute, the Legislature extended the 12-month calculation formula to non-Tier I employees <em>(see </em>L 1999, ch 638, \u00a7 1). There was (and remains) no obligation on the part of employers, however, to provide this benefit. Instead, Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 443 (f-1) states that employee demands for the section 302 (9) (d) retirement benefits formula shall not be subject to compulsory interest arbitration <em>(see </em>Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 443 [f-1] [citing Civil Service Law \u00a7 209 (4) (b)- (c)]).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">After the amendment to section 302 (9) (d), the PBAs argued to the Cities that the CBAs\u2019 reference to section 302 (9) (d) made all members of the bargaining unit, specifically Tier II employees, eligible for those benefits. When the Cities declined to provide the section 302 (9) (d) benefits to Tier II employees, the PBAs issued a demand for arbitration, relying on the broad arbitration clauses of the CBAs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The Cities then filed CPLR article 75 petitions to stay the arbitrations, and Supreme Court, in each case, granted the stay. In <em>Johnstown, </em>the court reasoned that the City and the PBA did not intend to provide the retirement benefits to Tier II employees, given that when the agreements were signed, the City was not legally permitted to provide benefits to anyone other than Tier I employees. In <em>Schenectady, </em>the court held that Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 443 (f-1) prohibited arbitration of disputes concerning the allocation of these retirement benefits to Tier II employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In both cases, the Appellate Division reversed and dismissed the petitions. Finding a \u201creasonable relationship\u201d between the subject matter of the CBAs and the PBAs\u2019 grievances, the Court found the matters arbitrable <em>(see Matter of City of Johnstown [Johnstown Police Benevolent </em>Assn.], 289 AD2d 832, 833 [2001]; <em>Matter of City of Schenectady [Schenectady Police Benevolent Assn.], </em>289 AD2d 814, 815-816 [2001]). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">A grievance may be submitted to arbitration only where the parties agree to arbitrate that kind of dispute, and where it is lawful for them to do so. In determining whether a grievance is arbitrable, we therefore follow the two-part test enunciated in <em>Matter of Acting Supt. of Schools of Liverpool Cent. School Dist. (United Liverpool Faculty Assn.) </em>(42 NY2d 509 [1977] <em>[Liverpool]) </em>and <em>Matter of Board of Educ. of Watertown City School Dist. (Watertown Educ. Assn.) </em>(93 NY2d 132, 143 [1999] <em>[Watertown]). </em>We first ask whether there is any statutory, constitutional or public policy prohibition against arbitration of the grievance <em>(see Liverpool, </em>42 NY2d at 513). This is the \u201cmay-they-arbitrate\u201d prong. If there is no prohibition against arbitrating, we then examine the CBA to determine if the parties have agreed to arbitrate the dispute at issue <em>(see Water-town, </em>93 NY2d at 140; <em>Liverpool, </em>42 NY2d at 513-514). This is the \u201cdid-they-agree-to-arbitrate\u201d prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The Cities contend that this case fails both prongs. As to the \u201cmay-they-arbitrate\u201d prong, they, and the dissent, assert that when the parties signed the CBAs it would have been illegal to provide the retirement benefits of Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 302 (9) (d) to Tier II employees. Their argument misses the point. The relevant inquiry is not whether the benefits may be lawfully provided,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but whether law or public policy bars <em>arbitration </em>of the grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">As to that, the Cities cite Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 443 (f-1). That statute, however, does not control whether the grievance is arbitrable. True, pursuant to section 443 (f-1), the allocation of section 302 (9) (d) benefits is exclusively within the prerogative of the employer, and Tier II employees may not seek redress through interest arbitration when their employers refuse to give them that benefit during collective bargaining. The PBAs here, however, are not arguing that their Tier II members should be given the retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>benefits. Instead, they are arguing, in essence, that the preexisting CBA already gave them the benefits. In sum, the dispute at the heart of this case is not the <em>negotiation </em>of a provision of a CBA (which, pursuant to section 443 [f-1], may not go to arbitration), but the <em>interpretation </em>of a CBA provision (which section 443 [f-1] does not address). We conclude that there is no statutory, constitutional or public policy bar preventing the parties from agreeing that an arbitrator will decide whether they intended in these clauses to extend benefits to Tier II employees if and when it became lawful for municipalities to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In arguing that the case fails <em>Liverpool-Watertown </em>prong two, the Cities assert that the parties did not intend, and the CBAs do not evince any intent, to arbitrate this dispute. According to the Cities, they could not have intended to arbitrate whether Tier II employees were entitled to these retirement benefits because, under the law existing at the signing of the CBAs, Tier II employees were precluded from receiving those benefits. Again, however, by raising the merits of the grievance, the Cities frame the issue improperly. The appropriate inquiry is whether the parties agreed to have arbitrators decide the proper interpretation of the CBAs\u2019 retirement benefits provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We have steadfastly maintained a distinction between the merits of grievances and the threshold question of whether courts or arbitrators have the authority to decide the merits. In <em>Watertown </em>we stressed the importance of keeping the inquiries separate. \u201cEven an apparent weakness of the claimed grievance is not a factor in the court\u2019s threshold determination. It is the arbitrator who weighs the merits of the claim\u201d <em>(Water-town, </em>93 NY2d at 142). CPLR 7501 also directs that, when deciding whether a dispute is arbitrable, \u201cthe court shall not consider whether the claim with respect to which arbitration is sought is tenable, or otherwise pass upon the merits of the dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Our task, as we stated in <em>Watertown </em>and as the Appellate Division correctly held, is merely to \u201cdetermine whether there is a reasonable relationship between the subject matter of the dispute and the general subject matter of the CBA\u201d <em>(Water-town, </em>93 NY2d at 143). The CBAs provide that the PBAs may request arbitration for unresolved grievances. There is no exception in the CBAs for grievances concerning retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>benefits, either generally or for Tier II employees. Therefore, we conclude that the reasonable relationship test is readily met, and this dispute is arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Accordingly, in each proceeding, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-10\">. The Johnstown CBA states that retirement benefits should be calculated \u201cpursuant to Section 384 subdivision d of the New York Retirement and Social Security Law. (final 12 month average salary plan).\u201d That section, however, does not prescribe a method of calculating retirement benefits. The City of Johnstown agrees with the PBA that the CBA should be interpreted to refer to section 302 (9) (d). The City notes that section 302 (9) (d) benefits were automatically conferred to Tier I police officers when the benefits were given to Tier I firefighters in a separate CBA (see Brief of City of Johnstown at 3 n 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\">. The Johnstown agreement states that \u201c[i]n the case of unresolved grievances, the [PBA] may request arbitration in accordance with the rules of the Public Employment Relations Board relating to arbitration.\u201d The Schenectady agreement states that \u201c[a]ny unresolved grievance having been processed fully through the last step of the grievance procedure may be submitted to arbitration by either party * * Both agreements define \u201cgrievance\u201d to include disputes over the interpretation or application of the CBAs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b344-9\">. Even here, however, the Cities\u2019 argument is dubious. The Cities conceded at oral argument, correctly, that there would be no statutory, constitutional or public policy prohibition against awarding benefits to Tier II employees if the CBAs had explicitly said that they would incorporate any future changes made to Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 302 (9) (d). Accordingly, after the 1999 amendment to Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 302 (9) (d), there is no prohibition against calculating Tier II retirement benefits by using the 12-month average salary formula.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b346-6\">Graffeo, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgE\">(dissenting). Because I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the grievances at issue in these CPLR article 75 proceedings should proceed to arbitration, I respectfully dissent. The facts underlying these proceedings are set forth in the majority opinion and I concur with the majority\u2019s articulation of the two-step analytical framework for determining whether a grievance is arbitrable (see, <em>Matter of Acting Supt. of Schools of Liverpool Cent. School Dist. [United Liverpool Faculty Assn.], </em>42 NY2d 509 [1977]; <em>Matter of Board of Educ. of Watertown City School Dist. [Watertown Educ. Assn.], </em>93 NY2d 132 [1999]). The disputes arise from the failure of the Cities of Johnstown and Schenectady to extend to Tier II members of their fire and police departments a 12-month final average salary benefit option used for the calculation of retirement benefits. The majority claims that the Cities\u2019 argument that it would have been illegal for the parties involved to have provided for the extension of these retirement benefits to Tier II employees \u201cmisses the point\u201d (majority op at 278) \u2014 but that is precisely the point that should lead to a stay of arbitration in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In my view, these disputes fail the first prong of the Liverpool/ <em>Watertown </em>test \u2014 referred to as the \u201cmay-they-arbitrate\u201d test\u2014 because the statutory condition precedent that must be met before the parties can engage in collective bargaining regarding this type of retirement benefit did not occur. At the time the Cities entered into the respective collective bargaining agreements with the fire and police unions, the \u201cfinal average salary\u201d component of retirement benefit computation was addressed in then-section 302 (9) (d) of the Retirement and Social Security Law. That statute authorized a municipality, as the employer, to elect to use an employee\u2019s \u201cregular compensation earned from such participating employer by a member during the twelve months of actual service immediately preceding the date of such employee\u2019s retirement\u201d in calculating the employee\u2019s final average salary, provided the employee had been employed by the municipality \u201con or before June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-three\u201d (former Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 302 [9] [d]) \u2014 a reference that limited the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>option\u2019s availability to Tier I members of the retirement system. This was an enhanced pension benefit because a member\u2019s final average salary would otherwise have been based on the employee\u2019s \u201chighest average annual compensation earned during any three consecutive years of member service\u201d (Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 302 [9] [b]). It is important to note that both Cities elected to exercise the option for Tier I employees by adopting and filing legislative resolutions with the State Comptroller that authorized these members of their fire and police departments to be eligible for the more generous 12-month final average salary computation.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">After the parties executed the collective bargaining agreements under which the unions brought the grievances at issue, the State Legislature amended article 11 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, which defines the benefits available to Tier II members of public retirement systems. Among the changes, new subdivisions were added to section 443 that authorized an employer to elect to extend the enhanced 12-month final average salary benefit to Tier II members but expressly prohibited compulsory interest arbitration demands for such a benefit <em>(see </em>L 1999, ch 638, \u00a7 2; L 2000, ch 109, \u00a7 1; Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 443 [f|, [f-1]).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In the same legislation, Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 302 (9) (d) was amended to delete the provision that had previously limited the local option to provide 12-month final average salary eligibility to Tier I members <em>(see </em>L 1999, ch 638, \u00a7 1). As a result, in 2000 both Cities were served with policy grievances claiming that their failure to extend the newly-created 12-month final average salary benefit option to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Tier II members of the fire and police departments violated the collective bargaining agreements then in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In their CPLR article 75 petitions to stay arbitration, the Cities argued that since the agreements were entered into before the 1999 enactment of the statutory amendments, the grievances were not arbitrable. I believe this contention raises the threshold issue of whether it is legal to submit such disputes to arbitration under the Taylor Law (the first prong of the <em>Liverpool/Watertown </em>test), which inquiry must be answered before considering whether the parties in fact agreed to arbitrate the benefit (the second prong of the test).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Civil Service Law \u00a7 201 (4), a provision of the Taylor Law, expressly differentiates between retirement matters and all other issues subject to collective bargaining by excluding retirement benefits from the definition of terms and conditions of employment subject to collective bargaining. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\u201c Terms and conditions of employment\u2019 means salaries, wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment provided, however, that <em>such term shall not include any benefits provided by or to be provided by a public retirement system, </em>or payments to a fund or insurer to provide an income for retirees, or payment to retirees or their beneficiaries. <em>No such retirement benefits shall be negotiated pursuant to this article, and any benefits so negotiated shall be void\u201d </em>(Civil Service Law \u00a7 201 [4] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Under this statutory mandate, it could not be clearer that pension benefits are different from other terms and conditions of employment which may be negotiated in a collective bargaining agreement. Unlike other benefits, public employers are prohibited from negotiating and granting retirement benefits in a collective bargaining agreement that are not expressly provided under state law. The unique needs of administering a statewide retirement system require such restrictions to avoid unduly burdening the state retirement systems by forcing them to simultaneously apply a hodgepodge of varying benefits offered by different municipalities and other public employers to different groups of employees. The fact that the grievance at issue <em>here involves retirement </em>benefits distinguishes it from <em>Watertown </em>(which concerned health insurance benefits), <em>Liverpool </em>(which concerned procedures applicable to a teacher returning from sick leave) and our other grievance arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>cases (see <em>e.g., Matter of Committee of Interns &amp; Residents [Dinkins], </em>86 NY2d 478 [1995] [employer\u2019s obligation to provide legal defense and indemnification]).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Indeed, the Legislature explicitly stated that the benefit at the heart of this dispute \u2014 the extension of the 12-month final average salary benefit for Tier II employees \u2014 was not a proper subject of interest arbitration (L 1999, ch 638; Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 443 [f-1]). This prohibition was intended to preclude employee bargaining representatives from obtaining this benefit unless the local legislative bodies authorize the Cities to offer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Because retirement benefits are not a term or condition of employment under the Taylor Law and it would have been illegal for the Cities to have negotiated or agreed to extend this Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 302 (9) (d) benefit to Tier II employees at the time the collective bargaining agreements at issue were executed, the specific prohibition on interest arbitration found in the 1999 legislation should also bar grievance arbitration of this dispute. This is so because grievances, by definition, arise from benefits agreed to in a collective bargaining agreement. Permitting grievance arbitration of a benefit the Cities could not have lawfully agreed to provide in the collective bargaining agreement circumvents the fundamental purpose of grievance arbitration \u2014 to enforce the terms and conditions of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement \u2014 and allows the unions to use this procedure to obtain a benefit they could not have negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Furthermore, I believe the parties would have also been precluded from agreeing to confer a right of eligibility to employees at some future time in the event such a benefit option were later created by law. Any such action on the part of the Cities would directly violate the Taylor Law\u2019s prohibition on negotiating or granting retirement rights not authorized by law <em>(see </em>Civil Service Law \u00a7 201 [4]) and would improperly preempt the power of the local legislative bodies to authorize the extension of such benefits \u2014 power which the Legislature chose to place exclusively in their hands when it passed the 1999 legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The majority\u2019s focus on the second prong inquiry, that is the \u201creasonable relationship between the subject matter of the dispute and the general subject matter of the CBA\u201d <em>(Water-town, </em>93 NY2d at 143), ignores the right of a municipality to first determine if it is able to bear\" the cost of extending the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>12-month final average salary benefit to additional employees and to budget for that additional expense. In this case, the legislative bodies of these municipalities did not opt to extend the benefit to Tier II members under the collective bargaining agreements in effect at the time these grievances were filed. Indeed, to date, those legislative bodies have apparently not elected to extend the benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s characterization of this analysis as a matter of interpretation of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreements or a merits inquiry. Its holding \u201cthat an arbitrator will decide whether they intended * * * to extend benefits to Tier II employees if and when it became lawful for municipalities to do so\u201d (majority op at 279) contravenes the local option provision of the statute, thereby violating state law. Because there is no legal authority for an arbitrator to extend such retirement benefits in the absence of municipal authorization, I would reverse the orders of the Appellate Division and stay arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur with Judge Rosenblatt; Judge Graffeo dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In each case: Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-6\"> The legislation provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">\u201cf.
