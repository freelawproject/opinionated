We conclude that the statute authorizes the Family Court to review and adjust the underlying support order in accordance with the standards set forth in section 413 of the Family Court Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> not merely to decide whether or not the COLA amount should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Linda and Boyd Chamberlin were married in August 1972 and have two sons, born in 1977 and 1983. Linda retained custody of the children following the Chamberlins\u2019 May 1985 divorce. Boyd was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $70 per week until the children reached 21 or were otherwise emancipated. In May 1991, the parties entered into a stipulation modifying the divorce decree by increasing the weekly child support to $100. In 1997, after the older child\u2019s emancipation, Boyd\u2019s support obligation was reduced to $57 per week in accordance with the stipulation. The parties were receiving support enforcement services through the local support collection unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">In June 1999, the Tompkins County Support Collection Unit (SCU), on behalf of Linda Chamberlin, filed an adjusted order of support with Family Court that incorporated a seven dollar COLA, increasing Boyd\u2019s support obligation to $64 per week. Pursuant to its authority under Family Court Act \u00a7 413-a (3) (a), SCU simultaneously filed an objection to the adjusted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>order. In response, Boyd Chamberlin filed a motion for summary judgment to dismiss the objection to the COLA. The primary question raised by the motion was whether a party could request modification of the support order in excess of the COLA through the section 413-a objection process. The Hearing Examiner denied the motion, finding that the statute provided for a de novo review of the support order. Boyd Chamberlin then filed written objections with the Family Court, which were denied as premature. The matter proceeded to a fact-finding hearing, where the Hearing Examiner applied the child support guidelines set forth in Family Court Act \u00a7 413 and determined that Boyd Chamberlin\u2019s child support obligation was $149.62 per week. Chamberlin again filed objections to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision with the Family Court, claiming a due process violation based on inadequate notice and lack of opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Family Court concluded that the COLA objection process provided the parties with adequate notice and opportunity to be heard; that the decision to conduct a de novo review of the support order was correct; and that application of the Child Support Standards Act (CSSA) guidelines \u201cwas rationally related to the valid objective of ensuring adequate child support\u201d (185 Mise 2d 470, 475 [2000]). The Appellate Division modified by reversing the portion of the order that increased Boyd Chamberlin\u2019s support obligation to $149.62 and remitted the matter to Family Court for further proceedings. The Court held that the review of a COLA objection should result only in a determination of whether or not the statutory COLA should be applied, not a de novo hearing, and that \u201cthe CSSA comes into play only as a means of determining the appropriateness of the proposed COLA.\u201d (287 AD2d 138, 142.) In addition, the Appellate Division concluded that the objection process is not a means to obtain modification of a support order that a party otherwise would not be entitled to receive (287 AD2d 138). On remittal, Family Court found that the proposed COLA increasing the order to $64 per week was appropriate. We granted SCU leave to appeal and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The Federal Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Although this appeal requires us to determine the appropriate scope of review under Family Court Act \u00a7 413-a, we begin our analysis with the federal framework that underlies the state statute. As a condition to receiving federal funding, states are required to maintain uniform standards for determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>child support obligations and establish support enforcement programs <em>(see </em>42 USC \u00a7\u00a7 651-669b; <em>Matter of Dutchess County Dept. of Social Servs. v Day, </em>96 NY2d 149, 152 [2001], citing 42 USC \u00a7\u00a7 651-669). New York enacted section 413 of the Family Court Act (the CSSA) to meet those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">In 1996, the federal government expanded the framework for states to adopt, requiring periodic review and adjustment of child support orders but giving states some flexibility in the mechanics of the process. These amendments, contained in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), are the basis for section 413-a <em>(see </em>42 USC \u00a7 666; Pub L 104-193).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">As amended, the federal statute requires states to establish a procedure for review and adjustment of child support orders subject to enforcement by the support collection unit at least every three years upon the request of either parent or the appropriate state agency <em>(see </em>42 USC \u00a7 666 [a] [10] [A] [i]). The statute allows the state to choose from among three options: (1) review and adjustment of the order in accordance with the state child support guidelines if the amount in the existing order \u201cdiffers from the amount that would be awarded in accordance with the guidelines,\u201d (2) application of a cost of living adjustment to the existing order, or (3) use of automated methods to identify orders eligible for review and application of the appropriate adjustment. If the state chooses the second or third option, the state must establish \u201cprocedures which permit either party to contest the adjustment * * * by making a request for review and, if appropriate, adjustment of the order in accordance with the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 667 (a) of this title\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (42 USC \u00a7 666 [a] [10] [A] [ii]). The statute further provides that it is not necessary for the parties to prove a change in circumstances to receive the adjustment <em>(see </em>42 USC \u00a7 666 [a] [10] [A] [iii]).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The legislative history of this statute is instructive regarding the^ intended scope of review when a party objects to a COLA or other automated adjustment. Mandatory periodic review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>and adjustment of child support orders was originally implemented through the Family Support Act of 1988 (Pub L 100-485). As the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) later explained, those requirements were enacted to ensure the adequacy of child support orders <em>(see </em>57 Fed Reg 61559, 61560 [1992]). There was concern that support orders entered into prior to the establishment of state guidelines were inadequate, and also that orders in compliance at the start would not necessarily continue to provide the guideline amount of support over time <em>(see </em>57 Fed Reg 61559, 61560 [1992]). The OCSE explained that, for those reasons, periodic adjustments to the order would be made \u201cin accordance with the State\u2019s guidelines, which must be used as a rebuttable presumption in establishing or adjusting support obligations in the State\u201d (57 Fed Reg 61559, 61560 [1992]).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The PRWORA, the source of the current 42 USC \u00a7 666 (a) (10) review and adjustment procedures, instituted review upon request rather than mandatory review and allowed states to choose among three methods for review <em>(see </em>64 Fed Reg 6237, 6241 [1999]). There is no indication that the federal government, by enacting those new procedures, intended to restrict a party\u2019s ability to obtain review and adjustment. To the contrary, regardless of which method is adopted, each state ultimately must afford a requesting party the opportunity to seek adjustment of the child support order in accordance with the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The New York Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">In response to the federal legislation, New York has elected to provide a cost of living adjustment with an accompanying right to review by a court \u2014 the second option offered by the federal statute. Family Court Act \u00a7 413-a states that SCU may review an order of support to determine whether a COLA should be applied at the request of a party to a child support order receiving support enforcement services or a party to an order issued on behalf of a child receiving public assistance, provided that the review occurs at least two years after the order is issued or last modified or adjusted <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 413-a [1], [5] [a] [1]). SCU will adjust a support order to include a COLA \u201cif the sum of the annual average changes of the consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) * * * is ten percent or greater\u201d (Family Ct Act \u00a7 413-a [2] [a]). SCU issues an adjusted support order reflecting the COLA, calculated pursuant to the statutory formula, which remains the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>new order if no party objects (see Family Ct Act \u00a7 413-a [2] [b]; [3] [e]).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Either party or SCU may challenge the proposed COLA by submitting a written objection (see Family Ct Act \u00a7 413-a [3] [a]). Filing of the objection precludes the COLA from taking effect and prompts a hearing, which results either in a new order of support or an order of no adjustment (see Family Ct Act \u00a7 413-a [3] [b]). Under the statute, the court may issue an adjusted order without a showing of proof of a change in circumstances (see Family Ct Act \u00a7 413-a [3] [c]). However, nothing in the statute \u201cshall be deemed in any way to limit, restrict, expand or impair the rights of any party to file for a modification of a child support order as is otherwise provided by law\u201d (Family Ct Act \u00a7 413-a [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The parties disagree as to the scope of the court\u2019s authority under section 413-a (3) (b) (1) to issue \u201ca new order of support in accordance with the child support standards\u201d upon the filing of an objection. SCU argues that the statute authorizes the court to make an adjustment based on the guidelines, whereas Boyd Chamberlin argues that application of the standards would constitute a de facto modification of the order without a change in circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">To interpret a statute, we first look to its plain language, as that represents the most compelling evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent. However, \u201cthe legislative history of an enactment may also be relevant and \u2018is not to be ignored, even if words be clear\u2019 \u201d <em>(see Riley v County of Broome, </em>95 NY2d 455, 463 [2000], quoting McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 124, at 252). The primary goal of the court in interpreting a statute is to determine and implement the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Under the plain language of the statute, when a hearing is held pursuant to a COLA objection, the court is to review the order to determine whether an adjustment is warranted based on the guidelines, not merely whether the COLA should be applied. The statute directs the court to issue either \u201ca new order of support in accordance with the child support standards\u201d (Family Ct Act \u00a7 413-a [3] [b] [1]) or, \u201cwhere application of the child support standards * * * results in a determination that no adjustment is appropriate,\u201d to enter an order of no adjustment <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 413-a [3] [b] [2]). An order \u201cin accordance with the child support standards\u201d should be exactly that \u2014 an order that comports with the guidelines as set forth in section 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The legislative history of the state statute similarly supports this interpretation. The statute was intended to \u201cstrengthen and enhance the tools available for * * * the establishment, enforcement, and collection of child support orders and [to] bring the state into compliance with the child support provisions of the * * * (PRWORA)\u201d \u2014 a clear incorporation of that statute and its goal of ensuring adequate child support (Governor\u2019s Program Mem, L 1997, ch 398, 1997 NY Legis Ann, at 264). The Legislature envisioned that the use of a COLA mechanism would facilitate review and adjustment of support orders by applying a COLA <em>(see id.). </em>However, the Program Memorandum also provides that \u201c[e]very child is entitled to have both parents contribute to financial and medical support in accordance with uniform guidelines. Order amounts should be updated and the enforcement of child support orders should ensure regular compliance\u201d (Governor\u2019s Program Mem, L 1997, ch 398, 1997 NY Legis Ann, at 265).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Boyd Chamberlin places great emphasis on the portion of the statute that states this section does not \u201climit, restrict, expand or impair\u201d the parties\u2019 rights to modification of the order <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 413-a [4]), and argues that allowing de novo review of the underlying support order effectively expands the right to modification. However, the right to review and adjustment is separate and distinct from the right to seek modification of the support order. The COLA and its review procedures, which are not contingent on a change in circumstances, are triggered only when there is at least a 10% change in the CPI-U <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 413-a [2] [a]; [3] [c]). By contrast, parties may seek a modification at any time based upon an unforeseen change in circumstances <em>(see Matter of Boden v Boden, </em>42 NY2d 210, 213 [1977]) or the child\u2019s right to receive adequate support <em>(see Matter of Brescia v Fitts, </em>56 NY2d 132, 139-140 [1982]; <em>see also </em>Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 236 [B] [9] [b]). Family Court Act \u00a7 413 (3) (a) also authorizes a onetime review of pre-1989 support orders \u201cas calculated pursuant to the provisions of [the CSSA]\u201d (Family Ct Act \u00a7 413 [3] [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">We recognize that parties to support agreements that consciously deviate from the CSSA guidelines are concerned that the statutory review and adjustment procedures not eviscerate the purpose of those agreements, including the desire for certainty over time. While the review and adjustment procedures apply equally to orders based on an agreement and those based solely on the child support standards, parties to an agreement that deviated from the guidelines may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>demonstrate why, in light of the agreement, it would be unjust or inappropriate to apply the guideline amounts. Section 413 (1) (h) of the Family Court Act allows parties to enter into a support agreement that does not adhere to the CSSA <em>(see also Matter of Gravlin v Ruppert, </em>98 NY2d 1 [2002]). The statute also now indicates that the agreement must reflect that the parties were advised of the CSSA and that the amount of support calculated using its provisions is presumptively correct <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 413 [1] [h]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, if the amount of support in the agreement differs from the amount that would be awarded under the CSSA, the agreement must state that amount and the reasons for the deviation <em>(see id.). </em>The review and adjustment procedures specifically contemplate that a court reviewing an objection may consider the provisions of an existing agreement or stipulation in determining whether the amount calculated under the standards would be unjust or inappropriate (Family Ct Act \u00a7 413 [1] [Z]). Parties are encouraged to advance such arguments to the court during the objection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Here, we conclude that in reviewing SCU\u2019s objection to the proposed COLA under the statutory procedure, Family Court did not err in entering an order in accordance with the CSSA guidelines rather than merely determining whether or not the COLA amount should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Constitutional Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Boyd Chamberlin also argues that the interpretation of the statute we now adopt is in violation of the Contract Clause of the Federal Constitution <em>(see </em>US Const, art I, \u00a7 10 [1]). This argument lacks merit, because we perceive no impediment to the parties\u2019 right to contract. Even a substantial impairment of the right to contract would, moreover, not be unconstitutional if the State can demonstrate that \u201c \u2018it is reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose\u2019 \u201d <em>(19th St. Assoc. v State of New York, </em>79 NY2d 434, 443 [1992], quoting <em>United States Trust Co. of N.Y. v New Jersey, </em>431 US 1, 25 [1977]). Here, ensuring that children receive adequate support is an important public purpose, and review of support orders is a reasonable and necessary means of accomplishing that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Finally, Boyd argues that his due process rights were violated because the pleadings did not give adequate notice of what was being sought through SCU\u2019s objections. This argument also lacks merit because the statute itself notifies the parties that there will be a hearing in the event of an objection, what will be reviewed at the hearing and the possible outcomes (see Family Ct Act \u00a7 413-a [3] [a], [b]). In addition, in contrast to section 413 (3) (b), section 413-a does not require \u201cspecific written objections.\u201d We conclude that the objection process satisfies due process requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In light of our holding, we remit this case to the Appellate Division for consideration of other issues raised but not addressed by that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from and the order of the Appellate Division brought up for review should be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to that Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Wesley, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and Read concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\">. Family Court Act \u00a7 413 is also codified at Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 240, and Family Court Act \u00a7 413-a at Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 240-c.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\">. Section 667 (a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">\u201cEach State, as a condition for having its State plan approved under this part, must establish guidelines for child support award amounts within the State.
