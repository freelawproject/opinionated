For the reasons that follow, we conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Thomas Murray, along with his brother Timothy, owned all of the issued and outstanding stock of T &amp; T Murray Company, Inc., a small sheet metal and roofing company. The brothers served as the only corporate officers and worked as forepersons, sheet metal fabricators and roofers for T &amp; T, although there were additional employees. T &amp; T purchased a Workers\u2019 Compensation and Employers\u2019 Liability policy from the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Insurance Fund and, subsequently, elected to exclude Thomas and Timothy Murray, as executive officers, pursuant to section 54 (6). Accordingly, their salaries were not included in the payroll base T &amp; T submitted to the Fund to calculate the single set of premiums for both forms of coverage under T &amp; T\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Concept Construction Corp. hired T &amp; T as a roofing subcontractor on a job for the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority. While engaged in the roofing work, Thomas Murray was struck by a piece of lumber, causing him to fall and suffer severe injuries. He sued Concept, the general contractor, and Niagara, the owner, under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1). Ultimately, Murray recovered almost $6 million from claimant Continental Insurance Company, Concept\u2019s liability carrier. In turn, Concept was awarded a judgment against T &amp; T based on common-law indemnification <em>(see Murray v Niagara Frontier Transp. Auth., </em>229 AD2d 1015, 1016 [1996]).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">After the State Fund denied coverage based upon T &amp; T\u2019s previous election to exclude the Murray brothers under the policy, Continental, as equitable subrogee to Concept\u2019s rights against the State Fund, brought the instant claim against the State Fund in the Court of Claims. The court granted summary judgment to the State Fund, dismissing the claim. The court held that the uncontested evidence submitted on the motion indicated that T &amp; T had a single Workers\u2019 Compensation and Employers\u2019 Liability policy with the State Fund well before the accident occurred and that the corporation had elected that the Murray brothers be excluded from the policy. The Appellate Division affirmed <em>(see </em>290 AD2d 222) and we granted leave to appeal. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Continental\u2019s position is that the statutory election contained in section 54 (6) is limited in application to Workers\u2019 Compensation coverage. Continental bases its argument on the literal language of section 54 (6), arguing that the Murray brothers, as executive officers, elected to exclude themselves \u201cfrom the coverage of this chapter,\u201d referring solely to Workers\u2019 Compensation coverage. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The statutory framework, taken as a whole, does not support Continental\u2019s position. Instead, Employers\u2019 Liability insurance is inextricably linked to Workers\u2019 Compensation coverage. First, the two types of coverage are jointly defined under the Insurance Law as comprehensively insuring employers, as such, for any and all types of claims for injury to or the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>of an employee. Thus, Workers\u2019 Compensation and Employers\u2019 Liability insurance are defined as \u201cinsurance against the legal liability, under common law or statute or assumed by contract, of any employer for the death or disablement of, or injury to, his employee\u201d (see Insurance Law \u00a7 1113 [a] [15]).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Second, an insurance contract providing exclusively for Employers\u2019 Liability coverage, without correspondingly providing Workers\u2019 Compensation coverage, is void under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 54 (4) (see section 54 [4] [providing that \u201c(e)very contract or agreement of an employer the purpose of which is to indemnify him from loss or damage on account of the injury of an employee by accidental means, or on account of the negligence of such employer or his officer, agent or servant, shall be absolutely void unless it shall also cover liability for the payment of the compensation and for the payment into the special funds provided for by this chapter\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 54 (6) must be and is easily read consistently with the foregoing provisions. That subdivision is a statutory exception to the exclusion of executive officers such as the Murray brothers from the status of \u201cemployee\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 2 [4]). Thus, only by reason of section 54 (6), do such executive officers who do <em>not </em>\u201celect to be excluded from the coverage of this chapter\u201d enjoy the status of employees. Here, however, once T &amp; T and the Murray brothers elected to have Timothy and Thomas Murray excluded from \u201ccoverage under this chapter,\u201d they were no longer employees. Therefore, concomitantly, T &amp; T\u2019s Employers\u2019 Liability insurance \u2014 insuring only against liability for injuries to or death of employees\u2014 did not extend to the injury suffered by Thomas Murray, a nonemployee executive officer when the injury occurred <em>(see </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 1113 [a] [15], <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Moreover, any insurance arrangement with T &amp; T by virtue of which Thomas Murray remained in the status of an employee for purposes of Employers\u2019 Liability Insurance coverage, but was <em>not </em>an employee covered by T &amp; T\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation insurance, would directly contradict the legislative policy embodied in Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 54 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The pertinent language of T &amp; T\u2019s policy with the State Fund itself confirms the absence of Employers\u2019 Liability coverage here for Thomas Murray\u2019s injury. Referring to the Murray brothers, an endorsement to the policy provided that the corporation \u201cnamed below has * * * elected to exclude cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>age for injury to the following persons who are the only executive officers and who collectively own all stock of such corporation.\u201d Thus, the endorsement unambiguously excluded Thomas Murray, along with his brother, from all coverage under the policy and from the status as a T &amp; T employee insofar as the policy was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Similarly, the notice of election signed by both of the Murray brothers in their corporate capacities stated that, pursuant to Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 54 (6), T &amp; T \u201celects to exclude the [Murray brothers] from coverage under the New York Workers\u2019 Compensation Law with respect to <em>all the policies </em>issued to the corporation by the insurance carrier named above\u201d (emphasis added). Given that section 54 (4) mandates the linking of Workers\u2019 Compensation and <em>any </em>Employers\u2019 Liability coverage in a single policy, this language also indicates that the Murray brothers elected to forego all coverage \u2014 both Workers\u2019 Compensation and Employers\u2019 Liability \u2014 inasmuch as both were contained in the policy issued by the Fund. No reason exists for us to disregard the literal language of the notice of election to accept claimant\u2019s argument that <em>\u201call </em>the policies\u201d does not include Employers\u2019 Liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Finally, claimant does not dispute that both the Murray brothers\u2019 salaries were never included in the payroll base the corporation submitted to the Fund to calculate the premium. The policy itself did not separately price the coverage for Workers\u2019 Compensation and Employers\u2019 Liability insurance and, in any event, T &amp; T applied for <em>both </em>types of coverage for its employees in the single policy. Denying coverage here is consistent with holdings of earlier cases in which employers injured in the course of performance of work carried on by the enterprise were held ineligible for Workers\u2019 Compensation in the absence of choosing to avail themselves of compensation insurance coverage pursuant to the provisions of section 54 (6) (see <em>Matter of Lyle v Lyle Cider &amp; Vinegar Co., </em>243 NY 257 [1926]; <em>LeClear v Smith, </em>207 App Div 71 [1923]; <em>Matter of Weiss v Baker-Weiss Packing Box Co., </em>201 App Div 97 [1922], <em>affd </em>236 NY 521 [1923]).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, witb costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur; Judge Wesley taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
