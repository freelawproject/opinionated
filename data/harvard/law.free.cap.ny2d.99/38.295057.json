The pocketbook contained a \u201cdummy\u201d credit card, which had been provided by American Express to the New York City Police Department with a $100 limit under a fictitious name for the purpose of conducting undercover sting operations. The dispositive issue on this appeal is whether the card constitutes a \u201ccredit card\u201d within the meaning of Penal Law \u00a7 155.00 (7) and General Business Law \u00a7 511, elevating its theft to grand larceny in the fourth degree and criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree. We agree with the courts below that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">In order to establish that a defendant has committed grand larceny in the fourth degree and criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree where the property consists of a credit card, the People need not demonstrate that the defendant knew that the property was a credit card, but they must prove that the property, \u201cin fact, consisted of a credit card\u201d <em>(People v Mitchell, </em>77 NY2d 624, 629 [1991]). Penal Law \u00a7 155.00 (7) states that a \u201ccredit card\u201d is any instrument or article so defined in General Business Law \u00a7 511, which, in turn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">\u201cIn this article, unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">\u201c1. \u2018Credit card\u2019 means and includes any credit card, credit plate, charge plate, courtesy card or other identification card or device issued by a person to another person which may be used * * * to purchase or lease property or services on the credit of the issuer or of the holder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">Subdivision (2) of that section defines \u201cperson\u201d as including \u201cany * * * legal or commercial entity\u201d and subdivision (3) provides that an \u201cissuer\u201d is \u201ca person who issues a credit card or a debit card.\u201d A \u201cholder\u201d is defined as \u201ca person to whom such a credit card * * * is issued or who has agreed with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>issuer to pay obligations arising from the use of a credit card * * * issued to another person\u201d (General Business Law \u00a7 511 [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">At defendant\u2019s trial, a representative of American Express testified that, although the company printed a fictitious name on the card, someone purporting to be that person could have charged up to $100 on the card to purchase merchandise or services and American Express would have been liable to the vendor in that amount. The representative added that American Express would \u201close on the card if it [was] stolen\u201d and charges were placed on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The evidence in this case satisfies the literal language of the statute. The card here was issued by a person (American Express) to another person (the New York Police Department) and was capable of \u201cbe[ing] used * * * to purchase * * * property or services on the credit of the issuer\u201d (General Business Law \u00a7 511 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Defendant does not dispute that American Express and the Police Department fall within the definition of \u201cperson\u201d in section 511 (2) or that American Express established a $100 credit line for the card that could be used to make purchases. Defendant argues, however, the term \u201cissue,\u201d which is not defined by the statute, must be given its technical meaning of \u201cto send out or distribute officially,\u201d for example, to \u201cissue stock\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 836 [7th ed 1999]), instead of its ordinary dictionary meaning \u201cto put forth or distribute\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 622 [10th ed 1995]) adopted by the Appellate Division. Defendant maintains that \u201cofficially\u201d implies the creation of an actual credit relationship between the issuer and holder which did not exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Nothing in the statute, however, indicates that the Legislature relied upon a particular \u201ctechnical or special meaning\u201d of the term \u201cissue\u201d in enacting section 511 (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 233), rather than its everyday meaning <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 232). Moreover, even assuming that the definition proffered by defendant should apply, the use of the adverb \u201cofficially\u201d to modify the act of putting forth or distributing does not imply creation of a credit relationship between the issuer and the holder. Here, American Express generated an account number and internal records and established a credit line that could be used to obtain goods or services in connection with the card \u2014 the card was \u201cofficially\u201d created and distributed by the company. Using either definition, then, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>card was \u201cissued\u201d by American Express to the Police Department.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Our interpretation is supported by the legislative history of the statute. As originally enacted, General Business Law \u00a7 511 (1) stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">\u201c \u2018Credit card\u2019 means and includes any credit card, credit plate, charge plate, courtesy card, or other identification card or device issued by a person to another person <em>which authorizes the holder </em>to obtain credit or to purchase or lease property or services on the credit of the issuer or of the obligor\u201d (L 1961, ch 549 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u201cHolder\u201d was defined as \u201ca person to whom such a credit card is issued * * * including] an obligor\u201d <em>(id.). </em>In 1970, the Legislature expanded the reach of the statute by changing the phrase \u201cauthorizes the holder\u201d to \u201cmay be used,\u201d thereby including instances where the holder of the card was not authorized to use it, so long as its use as a credit card was possible. To adopt defendant\u2019s proffered interpretation would be to return to the prior version of the statute, rendering the amendment a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Ciparick, Wesley, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b108-11\"> By way of analogy, an issuer/payor\u2019s naming of a fictitious payee in a negotiable instrument does not render the instrument invalid <em>(see </em>UCC \u00a7 3-405 [1] [b]; <em>Getty Petroleum, Corp. v American Express Travel Related Servs. Co., </em>90 NY2d 322, 327 [1997]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
