The Government has moved to dismiss, alleging Rosario did not timely file his notice of appeal. We grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-19\">In criminal cases, the defendant is accorded ten days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 197 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-20\">The district court\u2019s order denying Rosario\u2019s motion was entered on its docket on May 20, 2002. Rosario filed a \u201cMotion to Prosecute the Appeal\u201d that he averred he mailed no earlier than June 11, 2002. The Government averred the motion was untimely filed, and the district court denied Rosario\u2019s \u201cMotion to Prosecute the Appeal\u201d as time-barred. Because Rosario failed to file a timely notice of appeal, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order. Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
