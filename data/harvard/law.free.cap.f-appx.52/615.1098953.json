Richardson filed an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (2000), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634 (2000), alleging Richland County School District Number One (\u201cRichland County\u201d) discriminated against her because of her race and age, that Richland County\u2019s actions against her constituted a hostile work environment, and that she was retaliated against for complaining about the conditions. Richland County moved for summary judgment, and after a hearing, the magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment to Richland County. Richardson objected, and the district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is appropriate only if there are no material facts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Because motive is often the critical issue, courts must take \u201cspecial care\u201d in considering summary judgment in a discrimination case. <em>Evans v. Technologies Applications &amp; Serv. Co., </em>80 F.3d 954, 958-59 (4th Cir.1996). Summary judgment remains proper if Richardson cannot prevail as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Richardson alleged Richland County discriminated against her because of her race and age by giving her an undesirable classroom assignment, not giving her a new computer during the first round of distribution, not giving her keys to a classroom, and by assigning her the task of correcting over 350 records. To establish a prima facie case of discrimination Richardson must demonstrate: (1) she was a member of a protected class; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; (3) she met her employer\u2019s legitimate job expectations at the time of the adverse employment action; (4) the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances that raised an inference of unlawful discrimination. <em>See EEOC v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>243 F.3d 846, 851 n. 2 (4th Cir.2001); <em>Brinkley v. Harbour Recreation Club, </em>180 F.3d 598, 609 (4th Cir.1999); <em>see also Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 142, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (assuming <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), framework applies to ADEA claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">If Richardson establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to Richland County to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. <em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 142, 120 S.Ct. 2097. Richardson must show by a preponderance of the evidence the employer\u2019s proffered reason was a pretext for illegal discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">The parties do not contest Richardson was a member of a protected class and was meeting Richland County\u2019s legitimate job expectations. An adverse employment action requires actions having an adverse effect on the terms, conditions, or benefits of employment. <em>Von Gunten v. Maryland, </em>243 F.3d 858, 866 (4th Cir.2001). We conclude Richardson\u2019s complaints concerning room assignment, availability of a key, and allocation of new computers fail because they are not adverse employment actions. As to Richardson\u2019s claim that she was required to cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>rect certain records, even if Richardson has shown a prima facie case as to this claim, Richland County offered a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for assigning Richardson this task: that Richardson was previously in charge of those records. The district court thus properly granted summary judgment as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Richardson also argues she was subjected to a hostile work environment. To state a claim for hostile work environment, Richardson must demonstrate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">(1) the harassment was unwelcome; (2) the harassment was based on [her] race or age; (3) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive atmosphere; and (4) there is some basis for imposing liability on the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-7\"><em>Causey v. Balog, </em>162 F.3d 795, 801 (4th Cir.1998). We conclude, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Richardson, Richardson has not shown Rich-land County\u2019s conduct objectively created an abusive work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Lastly, Richardson states Richland County retaliated against her for filing a complaint regarding her work conditions with the acting superintendent. Richardson has not presented any evidence that she informed Richland County that her complaints were based on race or age discrimination; therefore Richardson cannot show she engaged in protected activity. <em>See Galdieri-Ambrosini v. Nat\u2019l Realty &amp; Dev. Corp., </em>136 F.3d 276, 291-92 (2d Cir.1998) (finding the employer must be made aware that the employee\u2019s complaint is based on Title VII prohibited discrimination); <em>see generally Kubicko v. Ogden Logistics Servs., </em>181 F.3d 544, 551 (4th Cir.1999) (analyzing protected activity in Title VII retaliation claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
