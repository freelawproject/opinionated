R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"ASY\">PAUL KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Mr. Lacey, appearing pro se and in for-ma pauperis, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for grand jury transcripts. Mr. Lacey argues that he needs the transcripts to prepare a collateral attack on the indictment. He claims that he is not the \u201cRichard Ray Lacey\u201d named in the original indictment (instead he is \u201cRick Ray Lacey\u201d), a somewhat belated theory given the protracted proceedings in this case. The district court denied the motion, and further noted that even if the grand jury transcript were unsealed, Mr. Lacey had not made an adequate showing to obtain it. <em>See Sistrunk v. United States, </em>992 F.2d 258, 259 (10th Cir.1993) (requiring a showing of \u201cparticularized need\u201d for a transcript under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Mr. Lacey\u2019s motion seeking grand jury transcripts is civil in nature and we have jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>See In re Grand Jury 95-1, </em>118 F.3d 1433, 1436 (10th Cir.1997); see <em>also United States v. Campbell, </em>294 F.3d 824, 826-27 (7th Cir.2002) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Miramontez, </em>995 F.2d 56, 58 (5th Cir.1993). Because Mr. Lacey failed to show a particularized need for the transcripts, the district court did not abuse its substantial discretion in denying the motion. <em>See Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, </em>441 U.S. 211, 222-23, 99 S.Ct. 1667, 60 L.Ed.2d 156 (1979); <em>United States v. Warren, </em>747 F.2d 1339, 1347 (10th Cir.1984). After reviewing the record <em>in </em>this case, it is apparent that Mr. Lacey\u2019s claims are based upon incorrect information, <em>see </em>Aplee. Br. at 7, or are entirely speculative, <em>see </em>Aplt. Reply Br. at 3 (arguing that grand jury indicted based upon \u201crecord of violence\u201d of someone else).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">Were that not enough, Mr. Lacey\u2019s theory is inadequate to meet the requirements to file a second or successive petition, i.e. newly discovered evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 8. Mr. Lacey\u2019s narcotics convictions were affirmed on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Lacey, </em>86 F.3d 956 (10th Cir.1996). His initial \u00a7 2255 motion was denied by the district court as time-barred and this court denied him a certificate of appealability. <em>United States v. Lacey, </em>162 F.3d 1175, No. 98-3030, 1998 WL 777067 (10th Cir. Oct.27, 1998). Thus, to obtain a certificate of appealability for a second \u00a7 2255 motion, he would be required to demonstrate newly discovered evidence that \u201cwould be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found [him] guilty of the offense.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 8. Given the discussion of the evidence in his direct appeal, <em>Lacey, </em>86 F.3d at 961-62, he cannot make this showing on the theory that he was not the person named in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b167-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
