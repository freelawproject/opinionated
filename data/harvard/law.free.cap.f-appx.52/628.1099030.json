Wease, a state prisoner, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his habeas corpus petition, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000), as time-barred. The district court dismissed the petition as untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-36\">To be entitled to a certificate of appealability, Wease must make \u201ca substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(2) (2000). When a district court dismisses solely on procedural grounds, the movant \u201cmust demonstrate both (1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right,\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019\u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). Upon examination of Wease\u2019s petition, we cannot conclude that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether the district court correctly concluded that the petition was untimely filed. Accordingly, we deny Wease\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
