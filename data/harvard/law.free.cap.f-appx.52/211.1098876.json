Mullins claims that the district court engaged in impermissible double counting by enhancing his sentence under separate provisions of the guidelines. Specifically, Mullins claims that the court erred by applying enhancements under both <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(2) (2000) (providing two-level enhancement for offense involving more than minimal planning), and USSG \u00a7 2F 1.1(b)(5)(C)(ii) (providing two-level enhancement for scheme that involved five or more documents of false identification).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Because Mullins did not preserve this objection at sentencing, we review his claim for plain error. <em>United States v. Ford, </em>88 F.3d 1350, 1355 (4th Cir.1996). Double counting is permitted by the guidelines except where it is expressly forbidden. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>18 F.3d 1173, 1179 (4th Cir.1994). Neither \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(2) nor \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C)(ii) precludes double counting. Moreover, Mullins fails to suggest any factual connection between the use of five or more documents of false identification and his enhancement for more than minimal planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not engage in impermissible double counting. Because we discern no error, let alone plain error, we affirm Mullins\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
