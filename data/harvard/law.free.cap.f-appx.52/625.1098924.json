We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and find no substantial question that Carter was deprived of a constitutional right. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. See <em>Carter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>v. Angelone, </em>No. CA-00-708-2 (E.D. Va. Aug. 27, 2001; Oct. 25, 2001; Nov. 7, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
