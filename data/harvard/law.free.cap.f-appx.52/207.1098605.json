I.A.S. No. 11,670, 19 I.L.M. 1501 (Hague Convention). Isidoro Rodriguez appeals the district court\u2019s order requiring (pursuant to the Hague Convention) the return of his thirteen-year-old son, Isidoro, to Colombia, Isidoro\u2019s country of habitual residence and the residence of his mother. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-25\">Amalin Hazbun Escaf (Hazbun), a Colombian citizen, married Isidoro Rodriguez (Rodriguez), a U.S. citizen, in Colombia in 1988. They lived in Barranquilla, Colombia after the marriage. In 1989 the couple had a son, Isidoro Rodriguez Hazbun (Isidoro), and Isidoro has joint Colombian-U. S. citizenship. Hazbun and Rodriguez divorced in 1997, and both continued to live in Barranquilla. Rodriguez claims that he and Hazbun had an initial oral agreement providing that Isidoro would split his time evenly between his parents; Hazbun disputes this. In August 1997 a Colombian family court approved a different custody agreement entered into between Hazbun and Rodriguez. The court-approved agreement provided that Isidoro would live primarily with his mother, but would spend every other weekend with his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-27\">Rodriguez returned to the United States in January 2000, taking up residence in Virginia. Later in 2000 Isidoro spent summer and Christmas vacations with Rodriguez in the United States. After Isidoro returned to the United States for a visit during the summer of 2001, Rodriguez filed (in Isidoro\u2019s name) a petition for a change of custody in the Fairfax County, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Virginia, Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court. Rodriguez then sent a facsimile transmission to Hazbun, telling her that Isidoro would be staying in the United States and would not be returning to Colombia. Included in the transmission to Hazbun was (1) a letter from Isidore to his mother, saying that he wanted to stay with his father and (2) a copy of the petition for change of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In August 2001 Hazbun filed a Hague Convention Return Application with the Colombian Civil Authority, seeking Isidoro\u2019s return to Colombia under the Hague Convention. In December 2001 Hazbun sued Rodriguez in federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia, asking for an order requiring Isidoro\u2019s immediate return to Colombia under the Hague Convention and its implementing legislation, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 11601 et seq. (West 1995 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Rodriguez filed a motion to dismiss Hazbun\u2019s complaint, raising several issues that were thoroughly considered by the district court. First, the district court rejected Rodriguez\u2019s argument that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that jurisdiction was proper under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 11603(a). Second, the district court rejected Rodriguez\u2019s argument that Isidoro was an indispensable party in the federal lawsuit and that the failure to join him was grounds for dismissal. Because a Hague Convention proceeding deals with the rights of those claiming custody, Hazbun and Rodriguez in this case, the court determined that it could afford complete relief to the parties without joining Isidoro. The court thus concluded that Isidoro was not an indispensable party, although the court was careful to note that his rights and wishes could be taken in account. Third, the district court rejected Rodriguez\u2019s arguments that it should abstain from deciding the Hague Convention case while a state custody proceeding was pending. The court determined that <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), did not require it to abstain. The court noted that <em>Younger </em>calls for federal courts to abstain from decision when (1) a concurrent state proceeding is pending, (2) an important state interest is implicated, and (3) the parties may seek review of their federal claims in state court. The court concluded that Rodriguez\u2019s argument failed on the second <em>Younger </em>requirement because Hague Convention cases implicate only the international movement of children, which is a federal, rather than a state, interest. The district court also declined to abstain based on <em>Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976), which applies only when ongoing federal and state proceedings are parallel. Because the federal and state proceedings here do not involve the same parties and issues, the court concluded that they are not parallel and that <em>Colorado River </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">After denying Rodriguez\u2019s motion to dismiss, the district court held a bench trial to determine whether Isidoro had been \u201cwrongfully removed or retained in\u201d the United States, a country that is a party to the Hague Convention. In its final opinion, which set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law, the district court found that Colombia was Isidoro\u2019s habitual residence and that he had been wrongfully retained in the United States. The court then considered and rejected possible defenses to Hazbun\u2019s claim that Isidoro should be returned to Colombia. First, the district court determined that Rodriguez had not presented clear and convincing evidence that Isidore would be at grave risk if he returned to Colombia. Second, the court determined that Isidoro\u2014who said that his preference was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>remain in the United States for now, but that later he wanted to spend equal time in the United States and Colombia\u2014was not of a sufficient age and maturity for his views to be given conclusive weight. The district court ultimately concluded that the Hague Convention and 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 11603 et seq. required that Isidoro be returned to Colombia forthwith, and an order to that effect was entered. After Rodriguez was unsuccessful in his efforts in this court and in the Supreme Court to obtain a stay pending appeal, Isidoro was returned to Colombia on June 11, 2002, pursuant to the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Rodriguez appeals, challenging the district court\u2019s decision that Isidoro is not an indispensable party, its refusal to abstain, and its determination that Rodriguez did not establish a defense under the Hague Convention. Rodriguez also asserts that the proceedings in district court violated his parental rights and Isidoro\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The district court noted that this case arises from \u201can exceptionally difficult situation\u201d for Isidoro and for the parties. We agree. Accordingly, we have carefully considered the briefs, the joint appendix, and the oral arguments. We conclude that the proceedings in district court did not violate either Rodriguez\u2019s or Isidoro\u2019s rights. As to the other issues, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Hazbun v. Rodriquez, </em>191 F.Supp.2d 685 (E.D.Va.2002) (opinion denying motions to dismiss); <em>Hazbun v. Rodriquez, </em>200 F.Supp.2d 603 (E.D.Va.2002) (memorandum opinion containing findings of fact and conclusions of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
