The warrant was signed by \u201cBertha A. Brainerd, Justice of the Peace No. 2.\u201d Defendants were charged with various crimes as a result of evidence discovered in the search of the ranch.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants moved to suppress the evidence seized on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Red Willow Ranch was not in the district for which Brainerd is a justice of the peace. The trial court granted the motions. The state and defendants stipulated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">\u00ab* * * There are two Justice of the Peace districts in Grant County denominated by Number 1 and Number 2; that the Red Willow Ranch, which is the object of the search warrant in evidence here, is entirely within Justice District Number 1; that Bertha [Brainerd] is the Justice of the Peace for District Number 2; that she is not the elected justice for District Number 1; that Bertha [Brainerd] signed the search warrant, Exhibit Number 2; that Bertha [Brainerd] lives in Justice District Number 2; that Justices are elected by the voters within their respective districts only. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The record also indicates that the justice of the peace for District Number 1 was not in Oregon on April 4,1983. The two Grant County justices of the peace have an agreement, on file with the county governing body, that each would act for the other in the other\u2019s absence; the county governing body \u201cconcurred with the intent\u201d of that agreement. The state acknowledges that the agreement is not in strict compliance with ORS 51.260(2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which states the requirements for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>appointment of a justice of the peace <em>pro tempore. </em>It contends, however, that the agreement is in substantial compliance with the statute. Additionally, the state argues that it does not matter whether Brainerd was a properly appointed <em>pro tern </em>justice for District Number 1, because justice courts have jurisdiction over offenses committed or triable in their respective counties, not merely their respective districts. ORS 51.040 and 51.050.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state is correct on the second ground, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Counties are authorized to establish justice of the peace districts. ORS 51.020. A justice court is held by a justice of the peace within the district for which the justice was elected. ORS 51.010. To be eligible for election to the office of justice of the peace, one must be a resident of the electing district. ORS 51.240.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Defendants contend that the cited provisions, especially ORS 51.010, limit a justice court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction to the district from which the justice is elected. As we read them, however, those provisions have nothing to do with jurisdiction. They deal only with the establishment of justice courts, their location and the qualifications for the office of justice. They do not delineate the jurisdiction of the court or limit the authority of a justice of the peace to issue a search warrant. There is no hint whatsoever that justice court district boundaries are jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Four statutory sections deal specifically with the justice court\u2019s jurisdiction over criminal matters. ORS 51.040 and 51.050 state that justice courts have jurisdiction over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>specified categories of crimes \u201ccommitted or triable in their respective counties.\u201d <em>See </em>n 3, <em>supra. </em>A crime is \u201ctriable\u201d in a justice court when an action may be commenced in the county where the court is held. ORS 51.070. There is no question but that the crimes charged here are triable in Grant County and are among those enumerated or included within ORS 51.040 and 51.050. In addition to those specified areas of subject matter jurisdiction, ORS 51.060 provides that justices of the peace have \u201cjurisdiction concurrent with the circuit court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">One case is particularly in point. In <em>State v. Bunke, </em>113 Or 523, 233 P 538 (1925), the defendant was charged in the justice court for District Number 4, Clackamas County, with the crime of possession of intoxicating liquor. The objection was raised that the justice court of District Number 4 had no jurisdiction to try the case, because the defendant lived and was arrested at his home outside of the district. The provisions of Oregon Laws 1920, \u00a7 2224-57, stated, similarly to ORS 51.060: \u201cJustices of the peace * * * shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts.\u201d Because the jurisdiction of the circuit court extended to the entire county, the court reasoned that the statutory language left no doubt that the jurisdiction of any justice in the county extended to the entire county.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We reach the same conclusion as to the authority of a justice of the peace to issue a search warrant. In <em>State v. Plankinton, </em>62 Or App 554, 661 P2d 1387, <em>rev den </em>295 Or 297 (1983), we reasoned, citing ORS 133.545(1) and 133.120,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that a \u201cmagistrate,\u201d including a justice of the peace, may issue a search warrant. The only limitation is that, when the criminal prosecution is not already pending, the warrant must be executed within the territorial jurisdiction of the magistrate\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>court. 62 Or App at 561. Because we hold that the justice court\u2019s criminal territorial jurisdiction extends to the entire county, <em>State v. Burke, supra, </em>we also hold that a justice of the peace may issue a search warrant to be executed anywhere in the county. The trial court improperly suppressed the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-8\"> The crimes charged included menacing, ORS 163.190, manufacturing a controlled substance, ORS 475.992, possession of a controlled substance, ORS 475.992, and frequenting a place where controlled substances are used.
