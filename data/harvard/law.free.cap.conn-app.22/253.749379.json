The trial court granted a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">This case is controlled by <em>DelVecchio </em>v. <em>Department of Income Maintenance, </em>18 Conn. App. 13, 555 A.2d 1007 (1989). This court in <em>DelVecchio </em>said: \u201cIn addition to proper service, a valid appeal must contain a citation signed by a competent authority and contain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>a notice of the return date and notice of the requirement of filing an appearance. <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>CHRO, </em>201 Conn. 350, 356-57, 514 A.2d 749 (1986); <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co., </em>5 Conn. App. 643, 645-46, 501 A.2d 1223 (1985). Here, the plaintiff failed to annex a citation to her petition. She claims that the elimination of the requirement of service by a sheriff also abolished the necessity of a citation. That is not the law; nor is this a case of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u201cThe necessity of a citation was first ruled upon by the Appellate Session of the Superior Court in <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 712, 716, 461 A.2d 997 (1983), and subsequently by this court in <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co., </em>supra. \u2018 \u201cThe citation is a matter separate and distinct from the sheriffs return and is the important legal fact upon which the judgment rests. ... A proper citation is essential to the validity of the appeal and the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Village Creek Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>[148 Conn. 336, 339, 170 A.2d 732 (1961)]. The purpose of General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b) is not to obviate the need for a citation, but rather to permit service upon the administrative agency in a manner different from ordinary civil actions, that is, by registered or certified mail.\u2019 <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u201cEither the lack of proper service upon the department of income maintenance or the lack of a citation would have been fatal to the plaintiffs appeal.\u201d <em>DelVecchio </em>v. <em>Department of Income Maintenance, </em>supra, 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Since the adoption of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act; General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.; and through every amendment since its adoption, a cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>tion is required for the trial court to acquire jurisdiction over an administrative appeal from a state agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
