The plaintiff claims that the trial court should not have dissolved the execution of judgment without first finding that the funds in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>tion were exempt from execution under General Statutes \u00a7 52-352b.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The following facts are pertinent to this appeal. The plaintiff, People\u2019s Bank, filed an action in May, 1988, alleging that the defendant failed to make payments due pursuant to a \u201cVisa\u201d credit card agreement. On December 7, 1988, the trial court rendered a default judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $5187.46, and ordered the defendant to make weekly payments of $10. The defendant made only a few of the weekly payments. On April 19, 1989, the plaintiff applied for a bank execution pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-367b (a). Five days later, the court issued the execution, which was served on the Gateway Bank in Newtown. The plaintiff then levied on the defendant\u2019s two checking accounts and a savings account.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The defendant, citing various statutory bases,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claimed an exemption from execution against the two checking accounts. The matter was heard on August 11, 1989. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney explained her client\u2019s position but offered no testimony or evidence, and the trial court did not ask whether the plaintiff was prepared to present any testimony or documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The defendant, acting pro se, did not take the stand, but told the court the reasons for the missed payments. The court asked the defendant what it would take to bring the payments up to date. The defendant stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>that she had missed the payments from April through July. The court then ruled on the motion, ordering that \u201cupon a payment of $500 lump sum within the next five days to be worked out, the motion to exempt is granted, otherwise it remains in full force and effect.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"A15\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court should not have dissolved the execution of judgment on the defendant\u2019s bank accounts without first determining whether the funds were exempt under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-352b and 52-353. The defendant, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4013, presented alternate grounds on which the trial court\u2019s decision could be affirmed, namely, (1) that the trial court correctly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to exempt because the plaintiff failed to refute the prima facie evidence of the defendant\u2019s exemption claim, and (2) that the plaintiff failed to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 52-356 (d) in pursuit of the execution. We address the plaintiff\u2019s claim first.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Section 52-367b<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> governs the execution against debts due from banks. Once a judgment debtor claims an exemption from execution pursuant to \u00a7 52-367b (e), the court must schedule a short calendar hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the exemption claim. The exemption claim filed by the debtor is considered prima facie evidence that the claimed exemption exists. General Statutes \u00a7 52-367b (f). The court, after conducting this hearing, must decide whether the exemption claim is meritorious; General Statutes \u00a7 52-367b (i); and, if so, whether all or only part of the money deposited in the subject account is exempt. General Statutes \u00a7 52-367b (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">In the present case, the court heard argument from the parties, but heard no sworn testimony and received no evidence. The court had before it a disputed issue of fact, namely, whether the defendant\u2019s claimed exemption was valid. The determination of such a factual issue requires the taking of evidence; <em>Land Enterprises </em>v. <em>Dorman, </em>17 Conn. App. 4, 11, 549 A.2d 672 (1988); not merely the presentation of legal argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>by the parties or their counsel. Even if the plaintiff was unprepared to present evidence at the hearing, in which event the court would have had before it only the \u201cprima facie\u201d evidence of the defendant\u2019s exemption claim, the court, before seeking to fashion relief, failed to make any determination of the principal factual issue, namely, the validity of the defendant\u2019s exemption claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The court was required to enter an order determining the issues raised by the defendant\u2019s exemption claim. General Statutes \u00a7 52-367b (i). It did not make any such determination. The very nature of the relief fashioned by the court indicates that it reached no concrete conclusion on whether the defendant\u2019s bank accounts were exempt from execution. The court ordered the executions dissolved, provided that the defendant paid the plaintiff $500 within five days of the order. Had the court reached a conclusion on the exemption issue, such an order would have been logically impossible, because the court cannot permit execution against bank accounts or portions thereof that it has found to be exempt; General Statutes \u00a7 52-367b (a); and there is nothing in the statute allowing the court to condition the execution against nonexempt accounts upon the debtor\u2019s failure to pay a court ordered sum by a certain date.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The defendant claims that the judgment should be upheld because the court had before it the prima facie evidence of the exemption claim, which, in the absence of rebuttal evidence offered by the plaintiff, was sufficient to sustain the trial court\u2019s decision. This argument is unsatisfactory because it fails to address the other flaws in the proceeding: the court\u2019s failure to take evidence from the plaintiff and its failure to decide the exemption claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The defendant\u2019s remaining ground for affirming the trial court is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new hearing on the defendant\u2019s exemption claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-352b lists the categories of property exempted from execution under \u00a7 52-353. The defendant claimed that a portion of the money in one of the accounts was exempt under \u00a7 52-352b (e) as health and disability insurance payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\"> The defendant claimed that one checking account was exempt in the amount of $764 under General Statutes \u00a7 52-361a; the other checking account was claimed to be exempt in the amount of $872.35 under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-352b (e) and 52-361a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-367b provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) exempt debts. Execution may be granted pursuant to this section against any debts due from any banking institution to a judgment debtor who is a natural person, except to the extent such debts are protected from execution by sections 52-352a, 52-352b, 52-352c, of the general statutes revised to 1983, 52-354 of the general statutes revised to 1983, 52-361 of the general statutes revised to 1983 and section 52-361a, as well as any other laws or regulations of this state or of the United States which exempt such debts from execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">* ** *</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\u201c(e) claim OP exemption.
