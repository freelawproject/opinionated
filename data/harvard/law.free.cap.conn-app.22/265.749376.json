We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">In its memorandum of decision, the court found the following facts. At approximately 2 a.m. on May 16, 1987, the defendant, Harold Holloway, and the victim, Shirley Holloway,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were together in the vicinity of the Keney Grill in Hartford. They were arguing, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>defendant exerted some degree of physical force on the victim. The victim said \u201cStop, leave me alone,\u201d and the defendant replied, \u201cShut up or I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d The court further found, on the basis of the testimony of Iris Santiago, a state\u2019s witness, that between 3:30 and 4 a.m. Santiago heard and saw the defendant and the victim arguing in the vicinity of an after-hours bar on Main Street across the street from Santiago\u2019s home. The defendant was holding the victim in a headlock as he punched her in the face. Shortly thereafter, the victim screamed, \u201cNo, Harold, please Harold, no, Harold.\u201d The court also found that later Santiago, having heard a loud scream, looked out of her window and saw the defendant carrying the victim\u2019s limp body into an alley between a market and a laundromat. At approximately 6:30 a.m., the victim\u2019s body was found in a vacant lot at the end of that alley. The court concluded that the defendant had committed manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Although not referred to in the court\u2019s decision, there was the following uncontroverted evidence. When the victim was found, she was lying on her back, naked from the waist down with her shirt and bra pulled up exposing her breasts. Her eyes were swollen, and her lips and neck were bruised. There was dried semen on her abdomen and pubic area, and blood stains on the left front part of her chest, at the junction of her right hip and abdomen, on the back of her left hand and on the inside of her left thigh. The semen and blood contained type A blood substances. There was also undisputed evidence that both the victim and the defendant had blood type O.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Wayne Carver, the state medical examiner, testified that the victim died on May 16 between 1 and 5 a.m. He also testified that the cause of death was manual strangulation, and that the blood stains had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>deposited on the victim\u2019s body \u201cabout the time [when] she stopped moving, and certainly not more than a couple hours of active lifetime before she died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The defendant first claims that the court should not have sustained the state\u2019s objection to a hypothetical question asked of an expert defense witness. This claim arises out of the following context.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Medical records were introduced establishing that the defendant had blood type O. Beryl Novitch, a criminalist with the state forensic laboratory,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> testified for the defendant. She testified that she examined the semen and blood samples taken from the victim\u2019s body, that the victim had blood type 0, and that both the semen and blood samples contained type A blood substances. She also testified that blood and semen samples came from a secreter, that is, one of the 80 percent of the population that secretes blood group substances into other body fluids, such as semen. Novitch, having been asked to assume that the semen stain came from one person, testified that it was consistent with having been deposited by a person with type A blood. She also testified that the victim was a secreter.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The defendant then asked Novitch the following hypothetical question: \u201cAssuming that the blood type of the victim is an 0 <em>and assuming that there is only one person involved in an incident with the victim, </em>do you have an opinion with reasonable medical certainty of the blood type of the person that left the stain on the victim\u2019s body and semenal fluid on the victim\u2019s body?\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court sustained the state\u2019s objection, presumably on the ground that the question assumed facts not in evidence, namely, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>only one person was involved in the incident causing the victim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant excepted to the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The defendant argues that there was sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis stated in the question that only one person was involved in causing the victim\u2019s death, and that, therefore, the court should not have sustained the objection. We agree, but we conclude that the ruling was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Whether a hypothetical question is admissible is within the sound discretion of the court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardwick, </em>1 Conn. App. 609, 617, 475 A.2d 315, cert. denied, 193 Conn. 804, 476 A.2d 145 (1984). It may be admissible within that discretion, even if it does not contain all the facts in evidence, as long as it presents those facts truly and fairly to each other and to the rest of the evidence, it is not worded so as to mislead or confuse the factfinder, and it is not as lacking in facts as to be without value to the decision in the case. Id; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>14 Conn. App. 309, 319-20, 541 A.2d 880 (1988), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 212 Conn. 50, 561 A.2d 422 (1989). The court\u2019s ruling will not be disturbed unless its discretion has been abused, or the error is clear and stems from a misconception of the law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>196 Conn. 157, 166, 491 A.2d 1075 (1985). Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the court abused its discretion in excluding the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Although there was no evidence that directly precluded the participation of more than one person in the victim\u2019s death, there was sufficient evidence to permit the inference that only one person was involved. San<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>tiago testified that between 3:30 and 4 a.m. she saw and heard the defendant and the victim arguing, that the defendant had the victim in a headlock and was punching her in the face with his fist, and that she heard the victim scream the defendant\u2019s name. Santiago also testified that later she heard a loud scream and saw the defendant carrying the victim\u2019s limp body into the alley. Carver\u2019s testimony put the time of death at no later than 5 a.m. There also was evidence that between 1:30 and 2 a.m., the defendant and the victim left the Keney Grill, at which time the defendant had physically abused her and had threatened to kill her. Aside from the forensic evidence yielded by the semen and blood stains, there was no evidence of any other person\u2019s involvement in the victim\u2019s death. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s theory of defense was that someone else hit the victim and carried her limp body into the alley. He testified that he was not in the vicinity of the Keney Grill that evening, and that he was at home at the time of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Under these circumstances, the court should have permitted Novitch to respond to the question. The question presented facts and evidence in accurate relation to each other and to the rest of the evidence, it was not worded in a misleading or confusing manner, and the assumption that only one person was involved in the victim\u2019s death was sufficiently rooted in the evidence to afford some value to the court as factfinder. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardwick, </em>supra, 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The state argues that the court\u2019s ruling was correct because Novitch\u2019s testimony itself, by tending to indicate the involvement of someone in addition to the defendant, belied the assumption that there was only one criminal actor, as was stated in the question. The state incorrectly limits the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from Novitch\u2019s testimony. We view her testimony as indicating at least three permissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>scenarios accounting for the presence of the semen and blood on the victim\u2019s body. First, there was someone else, in addition to the defendant, involved in the victim\u2019s death; second, as the defendant argues, someone else other than the defendant was responsible for the victim\u2019s death, and the identification of the defendant by Santiago and the other witnesses must have been flawed; and, third, someone other than the defendant deposited the semen and blood on the victim\u2019s body after it was left in or near the alley. Under the facts of this case, the defendant was entitled to have Novitch give her opinion based on the defendant\u2019s theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We conclude, however, that this ruling was harmless because we are unpersuaded that the exclusion of this evidence probably affected the decision. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>214 Conn. 616, 629, 573 A.2d 716 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Horton, 8 </em>Conn. App. 376, 381-82, 513 A.2d 168, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 813, 517 A.2d 631 (1986). Prior to the excluded question, Novitch, who had been asked to assume that the semen came from one person, had already testified that that person had type A blood. Furthermore, after the question was excluded, Novitch testified without objection that \u201c[i]f this [blood] was just deposited by one person . . . it could not be deposited by an ... 0 person. On the seminal stain, if it was a seminal stain deposited by one person . . . it would not be deposited by ... an O secreter or a non-secreter.\u201d Thus, the substance of the testimony sought by the excluded hypothetical question was received into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The defendant next claims that the court should not have overruled his objection to a question asked by the state on its cross-examination of Novitch. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The state asked Novitch the following question: \u201c[T]he results that you received from your testing on the seminal stains does not exclude . . . combined donations by an A secreter and an O secreter, does it?\u201d The defendant objected on the bases that there was no evidence that more than one person was involved, and that the question called for speculation. The court overruled the objection, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">This question was proper cross-examination of Novitch because she had testified on direct examination that if one person had deposited the seminal fluid, he could not be an O secreter. Thus, the question was a proper method of challenging one of the permissible inferences from her direct examination, namely, that some person other than the defendant killed the victim. Furthermore, Novitch\u2019s testimony on direct examination, taken together with the eyewitness testimony implicating the defendant, could have also permitted the inference that more than one person was responsible for the victim\u2019s death. Thus, this question was not based on speculation, but was based on evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The defendant next claims that the court should have granted his motion for articulation regarding the effect of certain evidence on the court\u2019s factfinding process. We first consider a procedural question that has not been authoritatively determined by either this court or the Supreme Court: May an appellant, after the denial by the trial court of his motion for articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4051,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and after review of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>denial by this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4054,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> present the same issue to this court on the merits of the appeal as a claimed ground for reversing the trial court? We conclude that the ruling of the trial court on a defendant\u2019s motion for articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4051 does not ordinarily provide the basis of a claim on appeal. Moreover, we conclude that, in this case, the trial court acted properly in denying the motion for articulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">After the court rendered judgment, and while the case was on appeal, the defendant moved for an articulation of the following matters: (1) Did the panel find credible the forensic evidence regarding the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and the defendant\u2019s blood types, and the source of the semen and blood found on the victim\u2019s body? (2) If so, was there any relationship between that evidence and the defendant\u2019s guilt? and (3) If there was no such relationship, on what did the court base its conclusion?</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">After the trial court denied the motion, the defendant moved, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4054, for review of the trial court\u2019s denial. This court granted the motion for review but denied the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 4051 provides for a motion for \u201carticulation or further articulation of the decision of the trial court . . . .\u2019\u2019The purpose of such a motion is to clarify an ambiguity or incompleteness in the decision of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>199 Conn. 417, 434, 513 A.2d 620 (1986). It is appropriate, for example, where the factual or legal basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is unclear or has been omitted entirely, where the reviewing court cannot discern whether the decision was based on a factual finding or on a particular construction of a statute, where the meaning of an ambiguous phrase used by the trial court is unclear, where it is unclear whether the trial court considered the applicable statutory criteria, and where the appellant claims that the facts found were not supported by the evidence. Id., 434-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u201cThe circumstances are indeed diverse where an articulation may be necessary or useful for meaningful appellate review. Broad diversity, however, does not imply an abrogation of standards. An articulation is appropriate where the trial court\u2019s decision contains some ambiguity or deficiency reasonably susceptible of clarification.\u201d Id., 435. A trial court\u2019s later articulation cannot, however, be used to contradict its earlier factual findings. Id., 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Appellate consideration of the action of the trial court pursuant to such a motion is provided by a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>review pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4054. \u201cThe action of the trial judge as regards such a correction or addition may be reviewed by the supreme court [or the appellate court; see Practice Book \u00a7 2000] under Sec. 4054.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4051. \u201cAny party aggrieved by the action of the trial judge as regards rectification of the appeal or articulation under Sec. 4051 may make a written motion for review to the supreme court, to be filed with the chief clerk of the supreme court, and the supreme court may, upon such a motion, direct any action it deems proper.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4054.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In <em>Harris Calorific Sales Co. </em>v. <em>Manifold Systems, Inc., </em>18 Conn. App. 559, 568, 559 A.2d 241 (1989), which presented a closely analogous situation, we declined to consider a claim that the trial court should not have denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a special finding under General Statutes \u00a7 52-226. The basis for that decision was that the defendant\u2019s argument had \u201calready received adequate review\u201d by way of its motion for review in this court. Id. In contrast, our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 438, did consider the defendant\u2019s claim because the court had earlier denied its motion for review \u201cwithout prejudice, subject to its renewal on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Although the language of Practice Book \u00a7 4054 is not as definitive as that of \u00a7 4049 (\u201c[t]he sole remedy of any party desiring the supreme court to review an order concerning a stay of execution shall be by motion for review under Sec. 4053\u201d), we believe that the same policy applies to Practice Book \u00a7 4054. To hold otherwise would mean that a defendant, having unsuccessfully sought review by this court of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for articulation, could thereafter present the same issue to this court on the merits of the appeal. We would then be providing two appellate reviews of the same issue. We are unaware of any other provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>sion of our rules for such double review, and we see no reason to construe the rules to provide for such review of the issue of the clarity or completeness of the trial court\u2019s decision, an issue that is ordinarily subsidiary to the substance of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">This does not mean, however, that a decision regarding review under Practice Book \u00a7 4054 is irrevocable. We are, of course, free to make that decision without prejudice to its renewal on the merits of the appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra. We are also free to reexamine that decision sua sponte when plenary review of the case on the merits of the appeal discloses that our earlier decision was ill considered, and that further articulation is necessary for the just determination of the appeal. Cf. <em>Rostain </em>v. <em>Rostain, </em>213 Conn. 686, 694-95, 569 A.2d 1126 (1990) (sua sponte remand for articulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We conclude that no such necessity exists here. The trial court clearly stated the essential facts that it found and the application of the law to those facts. Furthermore, although the circumstances are diverse where further articulation may be necessary for appellate review; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 435; even those circumstances have limits. In this case, the trial court not only fully stated its factual findings, but also referred to the evidence it found credible to support those findings. The just resolution of this appeal did not require it to go further by delineating the effect of the defendant\u2019s arguably exculpatory forensic evidence on its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court should not have found him guilty because that finding was clearly contrary to all the evidence. The defendant does not argue that the facts that the trial court did find were not supported by sufficient evidence to sustain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>those facts. Rather, the defendant argues that (1) if the court disbelieved Novitch\u2019s testimony, that disbelief was unwarranted because there was no contrary evidence, and (2) if the court believed Novitch\u2019s testimony, it must have speculated regarding what happened to the victim\u2019s body after the victim died, and that speculation was inconsistent with Carver\u2019s testimony that the blood stains were deposited on the victim at the time of or two hours before her death. We are unpersuaded.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Carver\u2019s opinion that the blood on the victim\u2019s wrist was deposited at the time of her death was based on his observation of the blood on her body when he first saw it and on his \u201cknowledge of what blood is like when people are walking around doing things.\u201d The court was not compelled to accept this opinion, even though the state did not attempt to rebut it. If it was not accepted, the inference was permissible that the blood and semen were deposited on the victim\u2019s body by someone else, at the time the defendant left her body in or near the alley, or some time thereafter, before her body was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We turn, then, to the defendant\u2019s argument that the court was bound to accept Novitch\u2019s testimony because it was uncontradicted, and because the state did not attempt to impeach her qualifications as an expert. Implicit in this argument, however, is the related notion that the trial court was required to accept Carver\u2019s testimony that the blood was deposited on the victim\u2019s body at the time of her death or within two hours prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>thereto, because the defendant\u2019s argument, namely, that the difference in blood types must have rationally excluded the defendant as the killer, necessarily depends on the related idea that whoever strangled the victim deposited the blood and semen on her body at or near the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The defendant relies on <em>Builders Service Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 267, 294, 545 A.2d 530 (1988), where our Supreme Court, in a 3-2 decision, held that the trial court was required to accept an expert\u2019s testimony in the absence of contradictory evidence or impeachment of his testimony on cross-examination. The court stated that \u201c[a] trial court cannot . . . arbitrarily disregard, disbelieve or reject an expert\u2019s testimony in the first instance. <em>Rock Creek Plaza - Woodner Ltd. </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>466 A.2d 857, 859 (D.C. App. 1983). There are times, as the First Circuit Court of Appeals said in <em>Santana </em>v. <em>United States, </em>572 A.2d 331, 335 (1st Cir. 1977), that \u2018the trial judge, despite his superior vantage point, has erred in his assessment of the testimony.\u2019 We, as did the court in <em>Santana, </em>\u2018think this is one of those rare cases.\u2019 Id. Where the trial court rejects the testimony of a plaintiff\u2019s expert, \u2018there must be some basis in the record to support the conclusion \u201cthat the evidence of the [expert witness] is unworthy of belief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rock Creek Plaza - Woodner Ltd. </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>supra; <em>Cullers </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>237 F.2d 611, 616 (8th Cir. 1956).\u201d <em>Builders Service Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra. We do not believe that <em>Builders Service </em>applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">First, <em>Builders Service </em>simply cannot be read to have implicitly overruled the well settled principle that a fact-finder \u201cis under no obligation to credit the evidence proffered by any witnesses, including experts; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>183 Conn. 514, 516-17, 440 A.2d 765 (1981); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>183 Conn. 121, 123, 438 A.2d 842 (1981); even if that evidence is uncontroverted. <em>Pisel </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>[180 Conn. 314, 344, 430 A.2d 1 (1980)]. \u2018[T]he acceptance or rejection of an opinion of a qualified expert is a matter for the trier of fact unless the opinion is so unreasonable as to be unacceptable to a rational mind.\u2019 <em>National Folding Box Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>46 Conn. 578, 586, 153 A.2d 420 (1959).\u201d <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Griffin Hospital, </em>207 Conn. 125, 145, 540 A.2d 666 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>178 Conn. 450, 461, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980), aff\u2019d, 188 Conn. 626, 453 A.2d 418 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 928, 103 S. Ct. 2088, 77 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1983); <em>Pischitto </em>v. <em>Waldron, </em>147 Conn. 171, 177, 158 A.2d 168 (1960); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>77 Conn. 266, 275, 58 A. 705 (1904); <em>Bricklin </em>v. <em>Stengol Corporation, </em>1 Conn. App. 656, 665, 476 A.2d 584, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 803, 482 A.2d 709 (1984). The majority in <em>Builders Service Corporation </em>did not explain why that was one of those rare cases where the trial court was incorrect in its assessment of the expert testimony, other than to say that the court did not specifically refer in its memorandum of decision to the expert\u2019s testimony. Until the contours and limits of <em>Builders Service Corporation </em>are more clearly defined, we hesitate to apply it beyond its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Second, <em>Builders Service Corporation </em>is factually distinguishable. Unlike that case, here,the state\u2019s cross-examination of Novitch elicited testimony that her finding did not exclude combined semen donations by an A secreter and nonsecreter, or by an A secreter, an O secreter and a nonsecreter. Thus, the inference from Novitch\u2019s testimony, upon which the defendant relied, namely, that someone else had killed the victim, was undermined on cross-examination. This cross-examination permitted the inference that someone in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>addition to the defendant was responsible for her death. Furthermore, although the court in its memorandum of decision did not specifically refer to the testimony of Novitch and Carver regarding the semen and blood stains, it did at the time of sentencing make clear that it had considered that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">After the defendant, in his statements to the court at sentencing, denied ever having met the victim, and referred to the \u201csemen and everything found at the scene,\u201d the court stated: \u201cAlright, Mr. Holloway, as far as the remarks made by yourself and your attorney are concerned, the panel heard all of the evidence, <em>we heard whatever might be considered to be contradictory evidence presented by the various witnesses. </em>But the state must prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt. We found that the state did prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt. Although there may have been some minor inconsistencies, they were not of a nature that would change the verdict of this court\u2014of this panel. <em>We took everything into consideration, discussed it very thoroughly. </em>When we entered our finding of guilty of manslaughter in the first degree, we were of the opinion that the actual death occurred at the time that you had this young lady by the\u2014around the neck with your arm. We made that finding that it was at that particular moment this young lady was killed. We cannot speculate nor will we speculate as to what happened to that body after it was placed behind the dump truck. Something else may have happened, we don\u2019t know and we\u2019re not going to speculate about it and we don\u2019t speculate about it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Third, the testimony of Novitch was subject to at least three possible inferences, one inconsistent and two consistent with the defendant\u2019s guilt. Faced with this choice, and faced with more than ample other evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, the trial court was not required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>to draw that inference inconsistent with guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dumlao, </em>3 Conn. App. 607, 616-17, 491 A.2d 404 (1985). Put another way, the court was not required to infer that the blood and semen were deposited on the victim\u2019s body by her killer at the time of her death. The state was required only to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; it was not required to disprove any contact between the victim and a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">This reasoning also largely disposes of the second part of the defendant\u2019s argument, namely, that if the court believed Novitch\u2019s testimony, it must have speculated on what had happened to the victim\u2019s body after she died. The court, in its sentencing remarks, specifically disclaimed any such speculation. Furthermore, as we have indicated, the court was not required to accept Carver\u2019s opinion that the blood was deposited on the victim\u2019s body at the time of or shortly before her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In sum, to accept the defendant\u2019s argument that the decision was contrary to the evidence would require that we sit as a fourth panel member whose vote exceeds that of the three judges who heard the case. That we cannot do. <em>State </em>v. <em>Osman, </em>21 Conn. App. 299, 303, 573 A.2d 743 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\"> The defendant was charged with the crime of murder and elected to be tried by a three judge panel.
