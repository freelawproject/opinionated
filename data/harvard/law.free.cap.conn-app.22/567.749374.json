She was charged by means of a substitute information, in three counts, with the following offenses: (1) possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell or dispense by a person who is not drug-dependent, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) transportation of a narcotic substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>with intent to sell or dispense by a person who is not drug-dependent, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b); (3) conspiracy to possess or transport a narcotic substance with intent to sell or dispense, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 21a-277.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a jury trial, she was convicted on only the third count. She raises the following claims in this appeal: (1) the trial court did not instruct the jury on the elements of the substantive offenses when giving instructions on the conspiracy charge; (2) the wording of the conspiracy charge failed to advise her adequately of the nature and cause of the accusations against her; (3) remarks by the state\u2019s attorney during closing argument deprived her of a fair trial; (4) the court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>not have admitted evidence of a sum of money found in the defendant\u2019s purse; (5) the third count of the substitute information was fatally defective because it charged three offenses in the disjunctive;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (6) the trial court should not have denied her motion to correct sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The jury could have reasonably found the following facts, among others. The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office and the Stratford police department established a surveillance at the Howard Johnson\u2019s Motor Lodge in Stratford, on the basis of information received through a wiretap. At approximately 8 p.m. on July 24, 1987, a white vehicle containing four occupants entered the parking lot. Two females, the defendant and her daughter, exited the vehicle and were arrested. The daughter was carrying a satchel on her shoulder that contained approximately $900,000 worth of cocaine. The defendant had $31,480 in her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the elements of the offense alleged in the third count. At trial, she objected to the court\u2019s charge on the third count, stating that although the court had instructed on the elements of conspiracy, the court did not elaborate upon the elements of the substantive offense alleged in that count, viz., a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">We review claims regarding the court\u2019s charge to the jury according to certain well established principles. Jury instructions must be read as a whole. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rouleau, </em>204 Conn. 240, 252, 528 A.2d 343 (1987). We review \u201c \u2018the substance of the charge rather than the form of what was said . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>204 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Conn. 769, 776, 529 A.2d 1283 (1987). The charge must be considered from the standpoint of its probable effect on the jury in guiding them to a proper verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>McCalpine, </em>190 Conn. 822, 830, 463 A.2d 545 (1983). It must fairly present the case to the jury so that no injustice is done. <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>191 Conn. 453, 466, 464 A.2d 829 (1983). It need not be exhaustive, perfect or technically accurate. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>186 Conn. 574, 585, 442 A.2d 1335 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The record reveals that although the court gave detailed instructions on the elements of conspiracy and on the elements of the violations of \u00a7 21a-278 (b) alleged in the first two counts, it did not instruct the jury on the elements of a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a). In its instruction on the third count, however, the court stated that the underlying crime, which was the object of the conspiracy alleged in the third count, was \u201cthe possession and distribution of cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Section 21a-278 (b) and 21a-277 (a) both proscribe the activities of possessing or transporting narcotics with intent to sell. The only significant difference between the two statutes, for purposes of this case, is that \u201cunlike \u00a7 21a-278 (b), drug dependency is neither an exemption nor an element of \u00a7 21a-277 (a).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Luca, </em>19 Conn. App. 668, 673, 563 A.2d 752 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The court\u2019s instructions could have misled the jury to believe that it could not convict her of the charge alleged in the third count unless it found beyond a reasonable doubt that she was not drug-dependent. If the jury was confused in this manner, that confusion could have only benefitted the defendant by making her conviction on the third count less likely. We conclude that although the court\u2019s instruction possibly misled the jury, the inaccuracy in the instruction had no effect on the ultimate verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>The charge was favorable to the defendant and is therefore not a justifiable basis of complaint by her. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cochran, </em>191 Conn. 180, 188, 463 A.2d 618 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Two of the defendant\u2019s claims will be considered together because they are closely related. First, the defendant claims that the third count of the substitute information failed to apprise her adequately of the nature and cause of the accusations against her.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The third count refers to General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277, but does not refer to a specific subsection of that statute. The defendant did not request a bill of particulars. \u201cUnder our practice, it is sufficient for the state to set out in the information the statutory name of the crime with which the defendant is charged, leaving to the defendant the burden of requesting a bill of particulars more precisely defining the manner in which the defendant committed the offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>171 Conn. 264, 270, 368 A.2d 222 (1976); see Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 830-833; <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>141 Conn. 319, 320-21, 106 A.2d 159 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The defendant claims that Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 831 and 832 are unconstitutional in that they place the burden of requesting a more definite statement of the charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>upon the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Prior to 1965, the Connecticut constitution provided that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right ... to demand the nature and cause of the accusation.\u201d Const, of 1818, art. I, \u00a7 9. The defendant contends that the rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, placing the burden of requesting a bill of particulars on the defendant, made sense under the constitution in effect at that time because the former article first, \u00a7 9, gave the defendant only a right \u201cto demand\u201d such a bill. At present, the constitution provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right <em>... tobe informed </em>of the nature and cause of the accusation.\u201d Const, of 1965, art. I, \u00a7 8. (Emphasis added.) According to the defendant, the substitution of the phrase \u201cto be informed\u201d in lieu of \u201cto demand\u201d shows that the framers of the 1965 constitution intended to relieve the defendant of the burden of having to demand a bill of particulars. A criminal defendant has a right, under our present constitution, to be informed of the accusations against him, and if he is deprived of this right, the fact that he did not request a bill of particulars is irrelevant\u2014so this defendant argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The relevant portion of art. I, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution of 1965 and of that section as amended in 1982; Conn. Const., amend XVII; is identical to language in the sixth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 831 and 832 are consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>with that language. Under federal law, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be informed of the charges against him is met \u201c[w]hen each count of [the] indictment contains the official citation of the statute under which the defendant is charged and the evidence constitutes precise proof of the charges in the indictment . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bales, </em>813 F.2d 1289, 1294 (4th Cir. 1987). This is similar to the rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra. Under <em>Davis, </em>however, once the constitutional minimum has been met by an appropriate citation, the defendant has the burden of requesting a bill of particulars if she wants a more definite statement of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The defendant argues that even under <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, the third count of the substitute information is defective in that it failed to cite a subsection of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277. She contends that because the subsections of \u00a7 21a-277 proscribe different acts and carry different maximum penalties, she had a right to be charged under a particular subsection. She fails to, show, however, that her ability to prepare a defense was in any way prejudiced by the fact that she was not charged under a subsection. The defendant must show prejudice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 241, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Because the defendant and her daughter were arrested with approximately $900,000 of cocaine in their possession, the defendant could not be prosecuted under any subsection other than \u00a7 21a-277 (a). Subsection (a) applies to narcotics and hallucinogenic substances other than marihuana. Subsection (b) is expressly made inapplicable to narcotics such as cocaine. Subsection (c) applies to the possession of drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>paraphernalia in a drug factory situation. \u201c \u2018The offense should be described with sufficient definiteness and particularity to apprise the accused of the nature of the charge so he can prepare to meet it at trial.\u2019 \u201d Id., 240. In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s decision to cite section 21a-277 rather than subsection 21a-277 (a) could not possibly have misled the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>178 Conn. 163, 167-68, 422 A.2d 299 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Another claim of the defendant, closely related to the one just decided, is that, by failing to cite a subsection of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277, the state, in effect, charged her under subsections (a), (b) and (c) in the disjunctive. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>164 Conn. 162, 167, 319 A.2d 381 (1972), our Supreme Court stated \u201cThe language of an indictment serves two primary purposes: it informs the accused of the nature of the crime charged and it acts as a bar to future criminal proceedings on the same cause. These functions dictate the retention of some limitations. Disjunctive charges, for example, are disfavored because they fail to apprise an accused of an exact crime; he, therefore, may not be able to prepare an adequate defense.\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>192 Conn. 37, 40, 470 A.2d 688 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The state\u2019s decision to charge the defendant with conspiring to violate \u00a7 21a-277, rather than subsection 21a-277 (a), did not render the defendant vulnerable to prosecution under subsections (b) or (c). She and her daughter were not found in possession of a nonnarcotic controlled substance (subsection [b]) or drug paraphernalia in a drug factory situation (subsection [c]). The state\u2019s citation to \u00a7 21a-277 would have apprised a reasonable person, exercising common sense, that she was being charged in the third count with conspiracy to sell or dispense cocaine. Again, there is no possibility that the citation to \u00a7 21a-277 failed to apprise the accused of the exact crime, or impaired her ability to prepare a defense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The third claim of the defendant is that certain remarks by the prosecutor during closing argument deprived her of due process and a fair trial. No .objection was taken to the allegedly improper comments at the time they were made, and, thus, the defendant does not challenge any action on the part of the court. We have reviewed the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct under the four guidelines of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Focusing on the second guideline, we find that her claim is not of constitutional magnitude even though it alleges the violation of a constitutional right. \u201cThe defendant . . . bears the responsibility of demonstrating that [her] claim is indeed a violation of a fundamental constitutional right. Patently nonconstitutional claims that are unpreserved at trial do not warrant special consideration simply because they bear a constitutional label.\u201d Id., 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">\u201cReview of unpreserved claims of prosecutorial misconduct has been reserved for instances where the claimed misconduct was part of a pattern of misconduct repeated throughout the trial or was blatantly egregious.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>19 Conn. App. 111, 128, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>562 A.2d 43 (1989), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 537, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). Such circumstances do not exist in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Next, the defendant claims that the trial court should have granted her motion in limine and not allowed testimony regarding the seizure of $31,480 from her purse. Her objection is that this evidence is not relevant to the conspiracy charge contained in the third count of the substitute information. She cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Groos, </em>110 Conn. 403, 408, 148 A. 350 (1930), for the proposition that \u201c[t]he admissibility of articles found in a defendant\u2019s possession depends upon their being connected with or traced to the crime charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The trial court possesses broad discretionary power in determining the relevancy of evidence, and its determinations will remain undisturbed unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mendez, </em>15 Conn. App. 531, 536, 545 A.2d 587, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 810, 548 A.2d 441 (1988). The quantity of money seized from the defendant was relevant to the issue of intent to sell cocaine. <em>State </em>v. <em>Holeman, </em>18 Conn. App. 175, 179, 556 A.2d 1052 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruth, </em>16 Conn. App. 148, 155, 547 A.2d 548 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Uribe, </em>14 Conn. App. 388, 393-94, 540 A.2d 1081 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court should have granted her motion to correct her sentence. The trial court sentenced the defendant on August 26, 1988, to ten years incarceration for \u201cconspiracy to commit violation of the state dependency producing drug law, in violation of section 53a-48 and 21a-277 of the Connecticut General Statutes in the manner and form as per said substitute information on file.\u201d The basis for her motion to correct sentence is, in her own words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>that \u201c[tjhere is no articulated penalty for a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. Sec. 21a-277. Any sentence, therefore, is without legislative authority and is illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">As we have stated throughout this opinion, it was abundantly clear under the circumstances of this case that the defendant was tried and convicted of a violation of subsection 21a-277 (a). There is an articulated penalty for such a violation. The maximum sentence includes incarceration for fifteen years. The same maximum sentence may be imposed upon a person who conspires to violate \u00a7 21a-277 (a). See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-51. The trial court lawfully sentenced the defendant to ten years incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any narcotic substance, hallucinogenic substance other than marihuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 provides in relevant part: \u201cPENALTY FOR ILLEGAL MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION, SALE, PRESCRIPTION, DISPENSING, (a) Any person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marihuana, or a narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years and may be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars or be both fined and imprisoned; and for a second offense shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than one hundred thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned; and for each subsequent offense, shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">\u201c(b) Any person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with intent to sell or dispense, possesses with intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any controlled substance, except a narcotic substance, or a hallucinogenic substance other than marihuana, except as authorized in this chapter, may, for the first offense, be fined not more than twenty-five thousand dollars or be imprisoned not more than seven years or be both fined and imprisoned; and, for each subsequent offense, may be fined not more than one hundred thousand dollars or be imprisoned not more than fifteen years, or be both fined and imprisoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">\u201c(c) No person shall knowingly possess drug paraphernalia in a drug factory situation as defined by subdivision (20) of section 21a-240 for the unlawful mixing, compounding or otherwise preparing any controlled substance for purposes of violation of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-9\"> The defendant\u2019s second and fifth claims are closely related and will be considered together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\"> The third count reads as follows: \u201cAND SAID STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY FURTHER accuses the said GLORIA MONAR of Conspiracy and charges that at the Town of Stratford, Fairfield County, between the approximate times of 7:30 p.m. and 8:03 p.m., July 24, 1987 at Stratford and at other locations the said GLORIA MONAR, with intent that conduct constituting the crime of Violation of the State Dependency Producing Drug Law in violation of Section 21a-277 be performed, agreed with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct and there were committed one or more overt acts in the performance of such conspiracy in violation of Section 53a-48 of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b595-6\"> \u201c[Practice Book] Sec. 831.
