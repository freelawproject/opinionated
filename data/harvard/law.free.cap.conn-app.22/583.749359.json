She claims that the state trial referee, sitting as the trial court in this case, (1) should have awarded her full prejudgment support and maintenance expenses and the full amount of lying-in expenses, (2) should have granted a support award reflecting the respective financial abilities of the parties, and (3) should have awarded the plaintiff the full amount of her attorney\u2019s fees. We reverse as to the first claim only.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">The plaintiff claims that once the trial court determined that the defendant is the father of her minor child, it was required to award her prejudgment financial support and the full amount of her lying-in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>expenses. The trial court ascertained that the amount of support and maintenance from the time of birth to the date of judgment was $5550 and that the amount of lying-in expenses was $8437.75. The court did not award the plaintiff the full amount of such prejudgment support and lying-in expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-171 provides in relevant part that if the defendant in a paternity suit is found guilty, \u201cthe court shall ascertain the expense of lying-in and of support and maintenance of the child until the time of rendering judgment, and <em>order him to pay the amount thereof </em>to the complainant . . . Z\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The defendant\u2019s liability for the total lying-in expenses is made absolute by statute. <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Saba, </em>6 Conn. Cir. 22, 23-24, 262 A.2d 617 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">On the basis of the trial court\u2019s findings of facts, as contained in its articulation, we find that the plaintiff is statutorily entitled to the full amount of her lying-in expenses of $8437.75 and prejudgment support expenses of $5550, a total amount of $13,987.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The plaintiff also claims that the court\u2019s award of continuing child support and attorney\u2019s fees is so minimal as to amount to an abuse of discretion. The record reveals no such abuse here. \u201cThe support orders entered in this case are well within the limits of reasonable discretion vested in the trial court with respect to such matters.\u201d <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 628, 639, 403 A.2d 1103 (1978). General Statutes \u00a7 46b-171 provides that a successful plaintiff in a paternity action is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, but the trial court has broad discretion in determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ing the amount of attorney\u2019s fees that will be allowed under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The judgment is reversed as to the award of lying-in and pr\u00e9judgment support and maintenance expenses, and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment as on file except that the award of those expenses shall be modified to an amount of $13,987.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">In this opinion, the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\"> This statutory provision was subsequently amended by Public Acts 1989, No. 89-360, \u00a7 42. This amendment, effective July 1, 1989, does not apply to the present case, which was commenced on November 2,1988. Legislation is to be applied prospectively, unless there are clear indications to the contrary. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>201 Conn. 16, 22, 513 A.2d 660 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
