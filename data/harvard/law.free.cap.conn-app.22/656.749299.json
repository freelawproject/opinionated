We conclude that the designated representative is a party whose presence should have been allowed by the trial court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">The following facts are relevant to the disposition of this appeal. On August 24,1984, the respondent father was convicted of manslaughter in the stabbing death of his wife, which occurred on September 26, 1982, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of fifteen years. The husband and wife had two children during their marriage. Christopher was born on May 18,1976, and Michael was born on August 12, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">In December, 1983, the children were placed with DCYS. On July 18,1984, with the respondent father\u2019s consent, the children were adjudged uncared for and committed to DCYS for eighteen months pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129. That commitment was extended for an additional eighteen month period on April 2, 1987. Since their commitment to DCYS, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>children have lived together in two foster homes and were placed in a third foster home at the time of the termination proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">On October 22, 1987, Wayne A. Kamens, acting as the duly authorized agent of the commissioner of DCYS, petitioned to terminate the parental rights of the father, alleging (1) that the father had failed personally to rehabilitate himself, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2), (2) that the children had been denied by reason of acts of parental commission or omission the care, guidance or control necessary for their physical, educational, moral, or emotional well being, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (b) (3), and (3) there is no ongoing parent-child relationship pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (b) (4). The third allegation was subsequently withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">At the start of the proceedings, on June 8, 1988, Diane Whitney, who was assistant attorney general, counsel for the petitioner, stated for the record that the following people were present: (1) attorney Patsy Renzullo, representing the respondent father, (2) attorney Donald Mackie, representing the children, (3) Thomas A., the respondent father, (4) Barbara A., the respondent\u2019s present wife, (5) Kathleen Miller-Schuyler, a caseworker for DCYS, (6) Roseann Gesmonde, the respondent\u2019s sister, and (7) Whitney, representing DCYS. After setting forth who was present, Whitney requested that Gesmonde leave because she was not \u201cappropriately here.\u201d The court agreed and stated, \u201cParties certainly have a right to be here, but other than that, I don\u2019t think it is appropriate that anyone else attend.\u201d Renzullo, the respondent\u2019s attorney, argued that Gesmonde would be testifying and that she wanted to be present. The court responded, \u201cIf she is going to testify, she especially may not attend. What I am going to do is not permit the attendance of witnesses except during the times they testify. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>words, on the court\u2019s own motion, which I think is appropriate in this court. So for two reasons, one, I don\u2019t think persons other than the parties should be present during the proceeding. Secondly, if she is going to testify, she should not be present . . . .\u201d The court also applied this ruling to Barbara A. The respondent objected to the court\u2019s rulings that prevented these persons\u2019 presence, but there was no objection by anyone present to the court\u2019s ruling to sequester witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Following this ruling, the court heard several motions filed by DCYS. The respondent then questioned the presence of Miller-Schuyler in the courtroom, arguing that this witness should not be present because having someone from the state would be an \u201cintimidating factor.\u201d The court stated, \u201cShe will not be [present] . . . . As I said, we are going to sequester witnesses.\u201d Whitney then objected to this ruling stating that Miller-Schuyler, as an agent of DCYS, was a party and had a right to be present. The court reserved its ruling. Miller-Schuyler was then called as DCYS\u2019s first witness. After she testified, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">\u201cMs. Whitney: Your Honor, I have a problem first. The question of whether Kathleen Miller-Schuyler can be in the the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">\u201cThe Court: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">\u201cMs. Whitney: She is my client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">\u201cThe Court: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-10\">\u201cMs. Whitney: May I have an exception to that ruling, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-11\">\u201cThe Court: I mean, you can\u2014she is your client. You can have one hundred clients\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-12\">\u201cMs. Whitney: But, she is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-13\">\u201cThe Court:\u2014under that definition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>\u201cMs. Whitney: But, the petition is filed by the commissioner of the department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">\u201cThe Court: She may be present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">\u201cMs. Whitney: She may be present?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">\u201cThe Court: The commissioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">\u201cMr. Mackie: A designee can\u2019t be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-9\">\u201cThe Court: No. She is a witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-10\">\u201cMs. Whitney: But, she has already testified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-11\">\u201cThe Court: I know, but she may be called again. I don\u2019t know. You may need to call her again, or want to call her again for rebuttal. Mr. Mackie might want to recall or he or Mr. Renzullo might. So, the purpose of sequestration ... is that the witness would not be present during the testimony of another witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-12\">* * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-13\">\u201cThe Court: I know the commissioner is a party. But the commissioner is not here. A person came from the department, and there may be many people from the department coming to testify. But, they do not all qualify as parties within the definition of the statute to be present in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-14\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-15\">\u201cThe Court: So what? What is the purpose of having her here? What purpose is there? Why do you want her here? What good is it going to do on your case if she sits in this room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-16\">\u201cMs. Whitney: Well, it is hard to anticipate what could happen. But, without her present, I have no client to refer to, I have no authority, if there is a question of settlement or any issues that might arise. I am not authorized to act on behalf of the client other than as their attorney, which means I would have to confer with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>\u201cThe Court: You certainly can confer with her at any time if you want to talk to her about settlement, we can easily take a recess. But, you can\u2019t really confer with her during the proceedings in any event . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The trial continued without Miller-Schuyler. The petitioner was given several opportunities for a recess but each time objected and argued that this opportunity did not sufficiently allow DCYS to present the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court issued its memorandum of decision denying the petition and concluding that DCYS did not meet its burden. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">DCYS first argues that Miller-Schuyler, its designated representative, was a party to the proceeding. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">We begin our analysis by looking to Practice Book \u00a7 1049 entitled \u201cTermination of Parental Rights.\u201d That section provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he hearing on such application shall be in accordance with and conform to the provisions of Gen. Stat., \u00a7 45-61d and, insofar as consistent therewith, with Secs. 1039 through 1042 hereof.\u201d We then see that General Statutes \u00a7 45-61d (b) (4) mandates that the commissioner of the department of children and youth services receive legal notice of the termination hearing. Next, we turn to Practice Book \u00a7 1023 <em>(l) </em>(3) which defines a legal party in interest to be \u201c[a]ny person . . . whose legal relationship to the matter pending before the court is of such a nature and kind as to mandate the receipt by him of proper legal notice as a condition precedent to the establishment of the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, as the trial court correctly determined, the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>sioner of the department of children and youth services is a party to a termination of parental rights proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The point of deviation between the trial court\u2019s ruling and this court\u2019s holding is whether the commissioner may designate any agent of DCYS to take her place as the representative party. We disagree with the trial court that DCYS was limited to designating non-witnesses to be the representative party. Public Acts 1975, No. 75-544, added the following language to General Statutes \u00a7 17-32c, \u201cThe commissioner of children and youth services may delegate any power, duty or function regarding such children, except for consent for adoption, marriage and joining of the armed services and except to the extent that the federal government may require that any responsibility for children be retained by said commissioner as a prerequisite to federal reimbursement of state expenditures for such children.\u201d The effect of the language was to give the commissioner the right to designate a representative for someone who is under the care of DCYS and the right to delegate <em>any </em>power, duty or function she may have with respect to being the children\u2019s guardian, within the above described limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">This section applies to the present ease because the children were committed to the DCYS. This language prevents a court from interfering with the decision making of the commissioner and, thus, a court has no authority to require the petitioner\u2019s counsel to have the commissioner designate a different representative to be present once the commissioner has designated a representative. In the present case, the court\u2019s statements to the petitioner\u2019s attorney that any other nonwitness designee could represent DCYS as the party, but not Miller-Schuyler, did not cure its exclusion of the commissioner\u2019s designated representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Our holding that the commissioner had the right to designate Miller-Schuyler as the party representative is not, however, dispositive of this appeal. We must now determine whether the court should have allowed this party to be present during the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We begin our analysis by noting that termination of parental rights cases are juvenile proceedings; see footnote 1, supra; that \u201cconstitute \u2018 \u201ca civil inquiry.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Dart </em>v. <em>Mecum, </em>19 Conn. Sup. 428, 431, 116 A.2d 668 (1955), quoting <em>Cinque </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>99 Conn. 70, 83, [121 A. 678 (1923)]. In a civil proceeding, a court has the discretion to sequester any witness, including a party, \u201cif (1) seasonably requested, (2) specific and supported by sound reasons, and (3) false corroboration would probably result. <em>State </em>v. <em>DiBella, </em>157 Conn. 330, 342, 254 A.2d 477 (1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>150 Conn. 195, 200, 187 A.2d 442 (1960).\u201d C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 7.29. In <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>91 Conn. 404, 409, 99 A. 1032 (1917) the court held that the party had a right to be present at a deposition. In that case, the court adopted a stricter standard for preventing a party\u2019s presence during a trial, where he will also be a witness; \u201cwe think each party to a litigation has the undoubted right to be present at the trial. An occasion may arise where, to prevent a similarity of statements by different witnesses, the court may exclude any witness, including a party to the litigation, from the court room, but this is a power to be sparingly exercised and only upon the clearest grounds so far as the party is concerned.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>supra, 408-409.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Thus, while there is authority for the court to exclude a party-witness during the course of a trial, \u201c \u2018this is a power to be sparingly exercised and only upon clearest grounds so far as the party is concerned.\u2019 \u201d <em>Donaghue </em>v. <em>Nurses Registry, Inc., </em>40 Conn. Sup. 196, 198, 485 A.2d 945 (1984); compare <em>Rozbicki </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>Huybrechts, </em>22 Conn. App. 131, 576 A.2d 178 (1990) (party has the right to be present during jury selection following <em>Anderson </em>rule); with <em>Donaghue </em>v. <em>Nurses Registry, Inc., </em>supra, (granted motion to sequester party defendants during respective depositions relying on <em>Anderson </em>exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">We have already determined that Miller-Schuyler, as the commissioner\u2019s designated representative, was a party to this proceeding. Accordingly, the court\u2019s sequestration order, as it pertains to Miller-Schuyler, is subject to the higher standard announced in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>supra. On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the matter at issue does not present adequate grounds to invoke the exception set forth in <em>Anderson </em>and thus the court abused its discretion when it refused to permit the petitioner\u2019s agent to be present for the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The grounds for excluding this witness were (1) the court believed that Miller-Schuyler was merely an employee of DCYS and not entitled to the rights of a party, (2) it did not want this witness to be able to hear other witness\u2019 testimony, (3) it saw no necessity for her presence, and (4) it believed Miller-Schuyler would serve no useful purpose. We are not persuaded by these reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">For the reasons previously stated, the court\u2019s belief that Miller-Schuyler was not, entitled to the rights of a party was incorrect. The court gave no indication why it would not permit this party-witness to hear the testimony of other witnesses when it permitted other party-witnesses to be present. Further, the court\u2019s reasoning that Miller-Schuyler was not needed is without merit. Miller-Schuyler had been the caseworker in this case since 1986. She had firsthand knowledge of the facts of this case and responsibility for the two minor children. Her need to be present during the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ceeding to assist Whitney in the presentation of DCYS\u2019 case addresses the exact concerns expressed in <em>Anderson </em>for adopting the rule that only rarely should a court prevent a party\u2019s presence: \u201cIn many cases the cross-examining attorney cannot anticipate, no matter how thorough his preparation, the developments in the examination of a witness. He cannot know all that his client knows. Often it is essential for the proper presentation of the case to have the client at hand ready to prompt the cross-examiner and to respond to his inquiries. The object of the trial is the ascertainment of the truth. The presence of a party to the litigation who is conversant with the facts which the witness is to relate, not infrequently produces upon him a moral effect and serves as a deterrent to an untruthful statement.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>supra, 408. In the present case, Miller-Schuyler\u2019s inability to assist in the presentation of DCYS\u2019 case impeded DCYS\u2019 ability to present its case and impeded the court\u2019s ability adequately to ascertain the facts, thus creating an unfair termination of parental rights proceeding. Accordingly, the trial court should have permitted Miller-Schuyler to be present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 1023 is the definitions section to juvenile proceedings. Termination of parental rights proceedings are juvenile proceedings; see General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121; and, therefore, this section applies to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
