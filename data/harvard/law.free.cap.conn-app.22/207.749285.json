The defendant was charged with failure to notify the motor vehicle department of a change of address as the registrant of a motor vehicle, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-17a,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and as the holder of a motor vehicle operator\u2019s license, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-45.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court (1) entered guilty verdicts upon insufficient evidence, (2) improperly decided the case prior to hearing closing arguments, (3) failed to read a defendant\u2019s exhibit, and (4) improperly limited the cross-examination of a state\u2019s witness. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The defendant claims that the evidence presented at his trial was not sufficient to convict him of either infraction. General Statutes \u00a7 51-164n (f) provides that \u201c[i]n any trial for the alleged commission of an infraction, the practices, procedure, rules of evidence and burden of proof applicable in criminal proceedings shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>apply.\u201d Thus, the state had the burden of proving every element of the infractions beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Braxton, </em>196 Conn. 685, 691, 495 A.2d 273 (1985). In reviewing a sufficiency of evidence claim, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the conviction and determine whether the trier of fact could reasonably have inferred guilt beyond a reasonable doubt from the evidence presented. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The record discloses that the trial court could reasonably have concluded that the defendant did not give notice of his address change to the motor vehicle department within the required forty-eight hour period.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The defendant was cited for the infractions on November 25,1988. On that date, as the defendant followed a police cruiser into the parking lot of a donut shop, the officer noticed that the front license plate was missing from the defendant\u2019s car and, in the course of questioning the defendant about the absence of the license plate, the officer asked the defendant for his license and registration. The officer had personal knowledge that the defendant had recently changed his address. The officer later testified that there was no indication on the license or registration that the defendant had given notice of his address change. Also, an immediate check with the motor vehicle department\u2019s \u201ccollect system\u201d indicated a listing of only the defendant\u2019s <em>prior </em>address.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The defendant testified that he changed his address on September 17,1988. His theory of the case was that he had sent a change of address postcard to the depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ment of motor vehicles in a timely manner (although he could not remember the date), but the new address was not recorded in the motor vehicle department\u2019s system. The defendant testified that he once had worked at the motor vehicle department and knew from experience that there is a lag between the time papers are sent to the department, and the time that they are processed. In his oral argument, the defendant stated that delays in processing by the department can be as long as thirty days. The trial court noted that the lapse in the present case would have to have been almost seventy days.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The credibility of the witnesses was for the trier of fact to assess and that assessment will not be disturbed on appellate review. <em>Kimberly-Clark Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>204 Conn. 137, 153, 527 A.2d 679 (1987). The trial court simply did not believe the defendant. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the convictions, we find that it was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not give the required notice within forty-eight hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court should not have rendered judgment prior to hearing oral arguments. At the close of evidence, the court immediately announced its findings of guilty and imposed fines on both counts. The defendant objected, stating that he was entitled to give a closing argument. The court then agreed to hear the defendant\u2019s argument, and, afterward, reduced the amount of the fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Both the Connecticut and the United States constitutions protect a defendant\u2019s right to voice closing arguments before the trier of fact. The sixth amendment guarantee in the federal constitution of the right to assistance of counsel has been held to include the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>to present closing arguments. <em>Herring </em>v. <em>New York, </em>422 U.S. 853, 95 S. Ct. 2550, 45 L. Ed 2d 593 (1975). Also, article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, which provides that \u201cthe accused shall have a right to be heard by himself and by counsel,\u201d has been held to guarantee a right to present a closing argument. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>47 Conn. 518, 534-37 (1880). The defendant enjoys the same right whether the trial is to a jury or to the bench. <em>Herring </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 859-60. If the trial court denies the defendant an opportunity to give closing arguments, the reviewing court should grant a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>supra, 536; see also <em>Herring </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra. Under Practice Book \u00a7 874, the defendant may make a single closing argument, and, although a defendant represented by counsel has no right to share closing arguments with his attorney; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>20 Conn. App. 721, 724, 570 A.2d 234 (1990); a pro se defendant must be allowed to make a closing argument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In the present case, the pro se defendant was afforded an opportunity to present a closing argument. He claims, however, that because the court announced its findings before hearing his closing argument, the court was no longer an impartial factfinder and the trial, as a whole, was rendered unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The defendant cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>182 Conn. 419, 438 A.2d 1144 (1980), for the proposition that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>court was unfit to sit as trier of fact and listen to oral argument after having rendered findings. In that case, our Supreme Court held that the trial judge <em>in a jury case </em>must not expressly instruct the jurors that they may discuss the case among themselves prior to its submission to them. Id., 429. This rule is based on the concern that jurors who discuss the case before all of the evidence is presented to them will not weigh all of the evidence with the same degree of impartiality as they would otherwise. Id., 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The same concern is not present in this case. First, the court did not announce its findings until after <em>all </em>of the evidence was presented. Second, because the trial court agreed to listen to oral argument, we presume that it listened with impartiality, and our review of the record discloses nothing to the contrary. Finally, the fact that the court reduced the fine after listening to the defendant\u2019s oral argument amply persuades this court that the defendant received fair consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court should have read the entire 122 pages of an exhibit. Because the defendant did not raise an objection at trial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we must consider whether to review this unpreserved claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). We decline to review this claim because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>although there is an adequate record for review, the defendant\u2019s claim is not of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The defendant fails to allege a constitutional violation in that he merely cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>208 Conn. 125, 132-33, 545 A.2d 1026, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 895, 109 S. Ct. 235, 102 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1988), for the proposition that the court was obligated to read the exhibit. This is an inaccurate reading of that case. In <em>Wood, </em>the court held that the trial judge has discretion to instruct the jurors simply to consider all of the evidence even when requested by the defendant to instruct the jurors to read all exhibits in their entirety. The defendant\u2019s claim does not present a constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We have already rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence against him was insufficient to support the convictions. That being so, his present argument seems to be made in the alternative: that although the evidence was sufficient to convict him on both counts, the trial court would have been more likely to acquit him had it read the entire exhibit. The defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, goes to the weight that the trial court gave the exhibit. Although the weight that the trial court gave the exhibit was minimal, such was not a violation of a constitutional right of the defendant. \u201cWeighing the evidence ... is the function of the trier of fact and this court will not usurp that role.\u201d <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>184 Conn. 36, 38, 440 <em>A.2d </em>782 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Finally, the defendant claims that he was denied an opportunity to cross-examine the state\u2019s witness on issues affecting the witness\u2019 reliability and credibility. We review this claim under the <em>Evans </em>bypass,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>although the defendant did not raise the point at trial, because the issue implicates a fundamental constitutional right of the defendant to confront the witnesses against him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Claims of this nature are subject to a two step analysis. First, we determine whether the defendant received the minimum opportunity for cross-examination of adverse witnesses required by the constitution. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974). If so, we then consider whether the trial court\u2019s restriction of cross-examination amounted to an abuse of discretion under the rules of evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>21 Conn. App. 291, 294, 573 A.2d 1218 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>196 Conn. 421, 424-25, 493 A.2d 223 (1985). \u201c \u2018 \u201cTo establish an abuse of discretion, [the defendant] must show that the restrictions imposed upon the cross-examination were clearly prejudicial.\u201d. . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>supra, 426. If, however, the defendant is denied the right of effective cross-examination, there \u201c \u2018 \u201cwould be constitutional error of the first magnitude and no amount of showing of want of prejudice would cure it.\u201d <em>Brookhart </em>v. <em>Janis, </em>348 U.S. 1, 3 [86 S. Ct. 1245, 16 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1966)].\u2019 <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>390 U.S. 129, 131 [88 S. Ct. 748, 19 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1968).\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">This is not a case in which the defendant was barred from cross-examining an adverse witness on matters relating to credibility and reliability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After carefully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>reviewing the record we find that the defendant received at least the minimum required opportunity to cross-examine.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Moreover, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting cross-examination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The ultimate issue was whether the defendant had notified the commissioner of motor vehicles of his change of address within forty-eight hours. The officer testified that there was no indication on the defendant\u2019s license or registration, or in the police department\u2019s \u201ccollect\u201d system that the defendant had given such notification. The defendant did not claim during his testimony at trial that his license and registration reflected his address change on November 25,1988, the day in question. As stated, his theory of the case was that he had sent in timely notice to the department of motor vehicles, but it was not processed before November 25, 1988. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Because the defendant did not dispute the officer\u2019s statements of fact, his attempt to impeach the officer was not relevant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>182 Conn. 501, 509, 438 A.2d 479 (1980) (no abuse of discretion where questions asked on cross-examination are collateral or cumulative).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 14-17a. notice of change in registrant\u2019s address, (a) A person holding a certificate of registration for a motor vehicle issued by the commissioner shall notify the commissioner within forty-eight hours of any change of his address.

The notification shall include his old address and his new address, (b) Failure to give the notice required by this section shall be an infraction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\"> In his brief, the defendant points out that the state did not lay a foundation demonstrating that the \u201ccollect system\u201d represents an up-to-date source for all new addresses for which the commissioner of motor vehicles has received notice. The defendant, however, failed to make this objection at trial. In the absence of exceptional circumstances, this court will not review a claim that was not raised in the trial court. Practice Book \u00a7 4185; <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\"> The defendant refers us to <em>Yopps </em>v. <em>State, </em>288 Md. 204, 178 A.2d 879 (1962), a case discussed in <em>Herring </em>v. <em>New York, </em>422 U.S. 853, 95 S. Ct. 2550, 45 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1975). <em>Yopps </em>involved a bench trial in which the court summarily announced its verdict of guilty after the close of evidence. The defendant in <em>Yopps </em>objected and stated that he wanted to give closing arguments, but the court still refused to hear his arguments. The Maryland Court of Appeals held that the denial of an opportunity to present arguments violated the defendant\u2019s rights to assistance of counsel. <em>Yopps </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 207. The obvious difference between <em>Yopps </em>and the present case is that the defendant in this case was allowed to give oral arguments after he objected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\"> The court and the defendant engaged in the following colloquy concerning the defendant\u2019s exhibit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">\u201cThe Court: I will admit [the exhibit] into evidence.
