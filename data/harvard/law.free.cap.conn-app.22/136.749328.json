App. 815, 559 A.2d 1185 (1989), in which we affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment holding the defendant in contempt of court. Following our decision in that case, the plaintiff moved the trial court to order the defendant to reimburse her for the expenses she incurred in defending the appeal. After a hearing, the trial court awarded the plaintiff an allowance for attorney\u2019s fees to defend the appeal. The defendant now appeals from that order and claims that the trial court failed to take into consideration the parties\u2019 respective financial situations when it awarded the plaintiff the allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">The dispositive issue in this case is whether General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62 applied, prior to October 1,1988, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the award of attorney\u2019s fees in appeals from contempt matters arising out of dissolution cases. We find that \u00a7 46b-62 did apply and, accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The uncontroverted facts are as follows: The marriage between the plaintiff and the defendant was dissolved on April 11,1986. Subsequent to the dissolution judgment, a civil judgment in an unrelated matter was entered against both parties in the amount of $31,000 for a debt shown on the defendant\u2019s financial affidavit. A judgment lien was filed on the plaintiff\u2019s property, and the plaintiff satisfied the judgment and the associated costs. The plaintiff then filed a contempt motion against the defendant for his failure to indemnify and hold her harmless, as he had been ordered to do under the terms of the judgment of dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">On July 13, 1988, the defendant was found in contempt. He appealed to this court, which, in a per curiam decision, affirmed the trial court. See <em>Messina </em>v. <em>Messina, </em>supra. The plaintiff then filed a motion for an allowance to defend the appeal. The trial court, without examining the parties\u2019 respective financial resources, awarded the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $4807. The trial court found that General Statutes \u00a7 52-256b<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> gave it the power to award attorney\u2019s fees in a contempt situation without examining the respective financial abilities of the parties. The defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Several statutory sources of authority exist under which a trial court may award a party attorney\u2019s fees. These statutes, however, apply in only certain situations and the trial court based its order on the wrong statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Section 52-256b (a), the section upon which the trial court relied, authorizes the court to award attorney\u2019s fees to a successful contempt petitioner. This section does not apply, however, in the case of a person found in contempt of an order entered under \u00a7 46b-81. General Statutes \u00a7 52-256b (b). The trial court\u2019s judgment ordering the defendant to indemnify the plaintiff was an assignment of property authorized by \u00a7 46b-81. <em>Beede </em>v. <em>Beede, </em>186 Conn. 191, 440 A.2d 283 (1982). Because the defendant was found in contempt of an order entered under \u00a7 46b-81, the trial court could not award the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 52-256b (a). General Statutes \u00a7 52-256b (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The trial court, as it correctly noted, was also foreclosed from relying on General Statutes \u00a7 46b-87,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which authorizes the court to award successful contempt petitioners attorney\u2019s fees. Although this section authorizes contempt awards specifically against parties found in contempt of orders entered, inter alia, under \u00a7 46b-81, the specific provision authorizing the award of attorney\u2019s fees as a contempt award was not made part of the statute until October 1, 1988. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>defendant was found in contempt prior to October 1, 1988, and this portion of the statute therefore did not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In <em>Krasnow </em>v. <em>Krasnow, </em>140 Conn. 254, 261-62, 99 A.2d 104 (1953), the court defined the inherent power of the trial court to award counsel fees on an appeal from an order of contempt based on the financial abilities of the parties. The court held that \u201cthe fact that there is no statute providing for an allowance in a divorce action is not decisive. The question is whether the power to make an allowance continues after the original decree, regardless of whether that power is inherent in the court, as some of the cases hold, or is granted by statute. As the jurisdiction of the court to modify the decree in matters of alimony and custody is a continuing one, so too, in reason and justice, is its power to make an allowance when these matters are again in issue after the final decree.\u201d Id., 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u201cWhether to allow counsel fees, and if so in what amount, is a matter which, like the fixing of alimony, calls for the exercise of a judicial discretion. <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>123 Conn. 564, 567, 196 A. 791 [(1938)]; Keezer, Marriage &amp; Divorce (3d Ed.), p. 676.\u201d <em>Krasnow </em>v. <em>Krasnow, </em>supra, 262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">This inherent power was later codified in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62. Under this section, the court \u201cmay order either spouse ... to pay the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of the other in accordance with their respective financial abilities and the criteria set forth in section 46b-82.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This section has been used to order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the payment of attorney\u2019s fees to defend an appeal from a contempt judgment; see <em>Friedlander </em>v. <em>Friedlander, </em>191 Conn. 81, 87, 463 A.2d 587 (1983); which is precisely the scenario presented by the present case. Thus, \u00a7 46b-62 was the proper vehicle for the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">We note that the decisive issue before us in the present case concerns the parameters of the trial court\u2019s inherent power to award an allowance to defend an appeal from a contempt judgment in light of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62. We do not need to decide, and we do not address, the question of whether that statute affects the trial court\u2019s inherent power to impose fines and award attorney\u2019s fees to <em>enforce </em>its contempt judgment. This distinction is clearly present in <em>Fried-lander. </em>The <em>Friedlander </em>court held that the trial court has the inherent power to fine one who has been found in contempt and to award counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The <em>Friedlander </em>court then went on to hold, however, that the trial court has the inherent power to award an allowance <em>to defend an appeal from </em>a contempt judgment, but that in the exercise of this discretion, the court should \u201cconsider the statutory criteria set out in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-62 and 46b-82 and the respective financial abilities of the parties.\u201d Id., 87. It appears to us, therefore, <em>that Fried-lander </em>stands for the proposition that the trial court\u2019s inherent power to award an allowance to defend an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>appeal from a contempt judgment is tempered by the statutory considerations in \u00a7\u00a7 46b-62 and 46b-82. The allowance in the present case was not a contempt award per se, but an allowance to defend an appeal from a contempt judgment. Thus, the second portion of the <em>Friedlander </em>holding, not the first, controls the present case. See <em>also Mallory </em>v. <em>Mallory, </em>207 Conn. 48, 55-56, 539 A.2d 995 (1988); <em>Mays </em>v. <em>Mays, </em>193 Conn. 261, 268-70, 476 A.2d 562 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The trial court, however, failed to consider the respective financial positions of the parties, as required by \u00a7 46b-62, and its award to the plaintiff of an allowance to defend the appeal is therefore improper under that section. <em>Caracansi </em>v. <em>Caracansi, </em>4 Conn. App. 645, 496 A.2d 225, cert. denied, 197 Conn. 805, 499 A.2d 56 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-256b. award of attorney\u2019s and officer\u2019s fees IN contempt action, (a) When any person is found in contempt of any order or judgment of the superior court, the court may award to the petitioner a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and the fees of the officer serving the contempt citation, such sums to be paid by the person found in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\u201c(b) This section shall not apply to the case of any person found in contempt of an order of the superior court entered under sections 46b-60 to 46b-62, inclusive, 46b-81 to 46b-83, inclusive, or 46b-86, which is provided for under section 46b-87.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-87 provides: \u201cWhen any person is found in contempt of an order of the superior court entered under section 46b-60 to 46b-62, inclusive, 46b-81 to 46b-83, inclusive, or 46b-86, the court may award to the petitioner a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and the fees of the officer serving the contempt citation, such sums to be paid by the person found in contempt, provided if any such person is found not to be in contempt of such order, the court may award a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to such person.
