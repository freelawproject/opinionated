He claims that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>(1) should not have denied his motion for judgment of acquittal on the burglary count, (2) should not have instructed the jury that the section of the store where the theft occurred was a building, and (3) should not have submitted the case to the jury under both alternatives of the burglary statute. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. At about 5 a.m. on April 11,1987, the night manager of the Pathmark grocery store in East Haven was making a routine check of the premises. The store is open twenty-four hours a day. A portion of the store known as the \u201cservice center,\u201d however, is closed daily from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. The service center contained various items of \u201chigh value merchandise,\u201d such as cigarettes, electronic equipment, film, and small appliances, and it was secured at night from public access by a padlocked, eight foot tall folding metal gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">As the night manager walked past the service center, he noticed that the cigarette display was in disarray and that several cartons of cigarettes<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeared to be missing. The night manager, accompanied by the store detective, unlocked the gate and went inside to investigate. They noted that many cartons of cigarettes were missing, and they discovered a brown wallet, containing the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, on the floor of the service center. In an aisle adjacent to the service center, they discovered a child\u2019s car seat that had been removed from its box and placed on the floor. They reviewed a videotape recording made by the store\u2019s surveillance camera, which revealed that at approximately 2:20 a.m. a male subject removed the car seat from its box and then climbed over the gate, with the box, into the service center. The subject climbed back over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>gate several minutes later, still carrying the box, and moved quickly toward the store exit. Although the quality of the tape was said to be good, the tape did not reveal the facial features of the subject because of the camera\u2019s distance from the service center.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The theft was reported to the East Haven police, who went to the address listed on the driver\u2019s license found in the service center. In a trash can near the rear of the house they discovered an empty box for a child\u2019s car seat. They then obtained search warrants for both the house and a car parked next to the house. Upon executing the warrants, the police found numerous cartons of cigarettes in the house and in the car, all of which bore the Pathmark store\u2019s tax number. The defendant was subsequently arrested pursuant to a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal on the burglary count. In making the motion, the defendant argued that because the Pathmark store was open to the public at the time of the relevant events, the state had failed to present sufficient evidence that the defendant entered and remained unlawfully in a building. The defendant\u2019s argument is bottomed on the premise that the entire Pathmark store, rather than just the closed service center therein, is the space relevant to the burglary count. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Burglary in the third degree is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103 (a) as \u201capersonas] . . . entering] or remaining] unlawfully in a building with the intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100 (a) (1) provides that \u201cbuilding\u201d carries its own meaning, but \u201c[wjhere a building consists of separate units, such as, but not limited to separate apartments, offices or rented rooms, any unit not occupied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>by the actor is, in addition to being part of such building, a separate building.\u201d Id. The basic issue, then, is whether the statutes permit the \u201cservice center\u201d area of the Pathmark store to be deemed a separate building. We conclude that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>210 Conn. 199, 554 A.2d 1048 (1989), recently addressed this general issue without reaching the exact question we face in the present case. In <em>Thomas, </em>the court held that the area behind a cash register counter in a convenience store could not be deemed a \u201cbuilding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-100 (a) (1). The court, however, did not elaborate on the reasoning behind its holding, and <em>Thomas, </em>therefore, is of limited use as we face a much closer version of the same question.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cochran, </em>191 Conn. 180, 463 A.2d 618 (1983), the court upheld the burglary conviction of a defendant who, while invited into a portion of the victim\u2019s home, broke into two locked bedrooms and stole a stereo system. The court\u2019s decision turned on the fact that the defendant\u2019s invitation never \u201cexpressly or impliedly extended to either of the bedrooms, which were locked.\u201d Id., 185. The bedrooms, the court concluded, were \u201cdistinct parts\u201d of the building for the purposes of the burglary statute. Id. The court reached its conclusion because it found that the state satisfied the burden of \u201cshowing that any license or privilege -to remain in one section of the structure did not extend to the separate unit wherein the burglary allegedly occurred.\u201d Id., 186 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">We receive further guidance from the comments by the commission to revise the criminal statutes: \u201cThe basic definition of the crime of burglary, implicit in these sections, is: an unlawful entry into or remaining in a building with the intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Code Comments, Connecticut General Statutes (1969), p. 50. The original and basic rationale of the crime is the \u201cprotection against invasion of premises likely to terrorize occupants.\u201d Id; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>190 Conn. 496, 506, 461 A.2d 973 (1983). In light of our consideration of these authorities, when considering whether the closed portion of a commercial building otherwise open to the public is to be deemed a separate building, therefore, we make the following inquiry. Is the closed portion of the building sufficiently demarcated and secured so that (1) persons licensed or invited to be in the open part of the building could not fail to realize that their license or invitation does not extend to the closed area; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Cochran, </em>supra; and (2) any rightful occupants of the closed area would have a reasonable expectation of not being confronted by unauthorized intruders. See id., 185; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">There was substantial evidence before the court to support the conclusion that the service center was a separate building. It was closed by a padlocked, eight foot tall gate that precluded the public\u2019s entry into the area by any normal means. It was thus abundantly clear that the public was not invited into the service center when it was closed in that manner, and any employee working in the center at that time could reasonably have believed that it was secured against intrusion by outsiders. The defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on this issue, therefore, was and is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions improperly required the jury to find that the service center was a separate building and that this instruction both denied him due process by relieving the state of the burden of proof on this issue, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>infringed his constitutional right to a jury trial. The defendant did not raise this claim at trial, and, after examining the challenged instruction in its proper context; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Cato, </em>21 Conn. App. 403, 410, 574 A.2d 240 (1990); we conclude that this claim is not truly of constitutional magnitude. <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>20 Conn. App. 410, 417, 567 A.2d 1245 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The challenged instruction was part of the court\u2019s instructions on the elements of the crime of burglary. After giving a general description of the elements of the crime, the court elaborated on the definition of a building and clearly charged the jury with deciding the question of whether \u201cthe premises in this case was a building, as that term has been defined.\u201d The court then discussed unlawful entering and remaining in a building, instructing the jury that \u201c[a] person enters and remains unlawfully in a or upon a premises when the premises at the time of such entry or remaining is not open to the public and when the defendant is not otherwise licensed or privileged to do so.\u201d The court then gave the challenged instruction: \u201cAs you heard from the testimony, the area in question here within the Pathmark store was closed off, it was a closed off area where the cigarettes allegedly were locked, which would have been a closed off area to the public. Therefore, it would be an area which would be affected by this charge as to whether a person unlawfully goes into that area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The challenged instruction focused the jury\u2019s unlawful entry inquiry onto the relevant space, namely, the closed service area. Because the defendant\u2019s initial entry and remaining in the greater part of the Path-mark store was lawful, regardless of his motive in making that entry; <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 206-208; the relevant issue before the jury was the legality of the defendant\u2019s entry into the <em>service center. </em>We conclude that the only effect of the challenged instruction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>in its proper context, was to narrow the issues before the jury. To the extent that the challenged instruction affected the court\u2019s earlier instruction on buildings, it narrowed the jury\u2019s inquiry to whether it considered the service center to be a separate building. The defendant\u2019s claim is not of constitutional magnitude, and we will not review it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The defendant\u2019s last claim is that the trial court should not have submitted the case to the jury under both alternatives of the burglary statute without giving the jury a unanimity instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The trial court charged the jury on both the \u201centering\u201d and the \u201cremaining\u201d theories of burglary. Within the factual context of other cases, the acts of \u201centering\u201d and \u201cremaining\u201d were found to be conceptually distinct, thus necessitating a unanimity instruction; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>10 Conn. App. 503, 513, 524 A.2d 648, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 808, 528 A.2d 1155 (1987). \u201cIn considering whether alternative statutory elements are conceptually distinct for purposes of requiring a unanimity instruction, however, the analysis \u2018turns, not only on the language of the two statutory subsections or elements, but also on the evidence in the case and how the case is presented to the jury in the court\u2019s instructions.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Velez, </em>17 Conn. App. 186, 199, 551 A.2d 421 (1988).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>19 Conn. App. 245, 248, 562 A.2d 539 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>In this case, the defendant\u2019s acts of entering and remaining were conceptually indistinct and inseparable. The state\u2019s evidence was that the defendant entered the service center unlawfully and continued to remain there unlawfully. The videotape of the incident shows the subject entering the service center and exiting several minutes later. The defendant\u2019s theory of defense was that, because the service center was not a separate building, the defendant\u2019s license both to enter and to remain in the Pathmark store extended to the service center, and both his entry and remaining therein were lawful for the purposes of the burglary statutes. Thus, \u201cthe jury\u2019s verdict could have resulted only from its determination that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted one continuous course of unlawful conduct\u201d; id., 248-49; namely, that he entered the service center unlawfully and remained there without any change in his legal status. \u201cUnder these circumstances, the unlawfulness of his entry determined the unlawfulness of his remaining. The two inexorably intertwined acts were conceptually indistinct.\u201d Id., 249</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Moreover, the defendant\u2019s conduct did not \u201c \u2018comprise \u201cseparate incidents\u201d implicating alternative or conceptually distinct bases of liability\u2019; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>[209 Conn. 322, 336, 551 A.2d 1206 (1988)]; and this was not a case where the complexity of the evidence or other factors created a genuine risk of jury confusion. Id., 337.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>supra. The defendant\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\"> A subsequent inventory determined that eighty-two cartons, worth approximately $11.50 each, had been stolen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"><em> \u2018 </em>\u2018Where a trial court charges a jury that the commission of any one of several alternative acts would subject a defendant to criminal liability, a unanimity charge on a specific act is required only if two conditions are met: (1) the alternative acts are <em>eoneeptually distinct </em>from each other; <em>and </em>(2) the state has presented <em>supporting evidence </em>on each alternative act.\u201d \u2019 (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>[209 Conn. 322, 334, 551 A.2d 1206 (1988)] quoting State v. <em>Flynn, </em>14 Conn.
