Superior Court (1978) 23 Cal.3d 55 [151 Cal.Rptr. 547, 588 P.2d 249].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The issue, as phrased by appellants, is: \u201cWhether a cause of action was stated by the allegations of the complaints] that the Board of Supervisors [of the City and County of San Francisco (San Francisco)] failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Sections 3504.5 and 3505 of the Government Code prior to submitting to the electorate proposed amendments to the San Francisco Charter which change wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of municipal employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">We have reconsidered the appeals, as directed, in the light of <em>Los Angeles County Civil Service Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court. </em>Our conclusion is that the judgments of the superior court must be affirmed. We state our reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">California\u2019s Constitution, article XI, section 3, confers upon the electors of a chartered county or city, the <em>absolute right </em>to amend such a public entity\u2019s charter. It states that charter amendments may be proposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">(1) By the required number of the county\u2019s or city\u2019s electors under the initiative (see Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 11); or,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">(2) <em>By the county\u2019s or city\u2019s governing </em>body.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The Legislature may, of course, \u201cenact legislation to facilitate the exercise of the powers directly granted by the Constitution\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Western Air Lines, Inc., </em>42 Cal.2d 621, 637 [268 P.2d 723]), such as the procedure for exercise of the constitutionally granted initiative process <em>(District Election etc. Committee </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>78 Cal.App.3d 261 [144 Cal.Rptr. 442]). But such enactments \u201c \u2018 \u201cmust not in any particular attempt to narrow or embarrass\u201d \u2019 \u201d the related constitutional provision. <em>(Chesney </em>v. <em>Byram, </em>15 Cal.2d 460, 464 [101 P.2d 1106]; <em>Chester </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>55 Cal.App. 611, 616 [204 P. 237].) \u201c \u2018It is not and will not be questioned but that if the constitution has vested such power, it is not within the legislative power, either by its silence or by direct enactment, to modify, curtail, or abridge this constitutional grant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Western Air Lines, Inc., supra, </em>42 Cal.2d at p. 637; <em>Western Assn. etc. R.R. </em>v. <em>Railroad Comm., </em>173 Cal. 802, 804 [162 P. 391, 1 A.L.R. 1455].) And it has been held \u201c \u2018self-evident that the legislature itself could not abridge nor even hamper the exercise of those powers\u2019 \u201d reserved by the Constitution to the electors of a city or county. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>33 Cal.App.2d 416, 421 [91 P.2d 926].)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Where the state\u2019s Constitution, as here, reserves legislative power to the people, statutes will be liberally construed so as to give effect to that power. <em>(Warner </em>v. <em>Kenny, </em>27 Cal.2d 627, 629 [165 P.2d 889]; <em>Gage </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>23 Cal.2d 794, 799 [147 P.2d 387]; <em>Ley </em>v. <em>Dominguez, </em>212 Cal. 587, 593 [299 P. 713].)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Article XI, section 3, of the state\u2019s Constitution thus gives to San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors the <em>unabridged </em>right to propose charter amendments to the city\u2019s electors.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">We next observe that the wages, hours, and conditions of employment embraced by the subject charter amendments are matters of local, not statewide, concern. (See Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Sonoma County </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>Organization of Public Employees </em>v. <em>County of Sonoma, </em>23 Cal.3d 296, 317 [152 Cal.Rptr. 903, 591 P.2d 1], the high court stated: \u201cIt seems clear to us . . . that both the language of the Constitution and prior authority support the proposition advanced by petitioners that the determination of the wages paid to employees of charter cities as well as charter counties is a matter of local rather than statewide concern.\u201d Appellants have expressed no disagreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Adverting now to the here at issue Government Code sections 3504.5 and 3505, we note that they are part of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (enacted 1968) which is codified as part 7, division 4, chapter 10 (entitled \u201cLocal Public Employee Organizations\u201d) and as sections 3500-3510, of the Government Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">It provides, inter alia, that \u201cpublic employees shall have the right to form, join, and participate in the activities of employee organizations of their own choosing for the purpose of representation on all matters of employer-employee relations.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3502.) It also requires that the public employer <em>\u201cshall give reasonable written notice </em>to [the] employee organization affected of any ordinance, rule, resolution, or regulation directly relating to matters\u201d within the employee organization\u2019s scope of representation, and give the \u201cemployee organization the opportunity to meet with\u201d representatives of the public employer. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3504.5.) It then provides that such public employer representatives and the employee organization <em>\u201cshall meet and confer in good faith\u201d </em>in respect of such matters. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3505.) (The italics of this paragraph have been supplied by us.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Parenthetically, at this point, we opine that a legislative purpose that the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act shall <em>necessarily </em>apply to proposals to amend a county\u2019s or city\u2019s charter in respect of wages, hours and conditions of employment, is most unlikely. It will be recalled that the state\u2019s Constitution, article XI, section 3 (fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>provides that such proposals shall be by <em>\u201cinitiative or by the governing body. \u201d </em>(Italics added.) Application of Government Code section 3505\u2019s \u201cmeet and confer\u201d requirements to a county\u2019s or city\u2019s <em>initiative process </em>would be manifestly impossible. Nor is it reasonable to suppose a purpose that the MeyersMilias-Brown Act apply to one, but not to the other, of the constitutional alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">But we conclude that Government Code section 3504 is dispositive of the appeals. It provides that a local public entity\u2019s duty to meet and confer in good faith <em>does not extend to a consideration of the \u201cmerits [or] necessity\u201d of any public \u201cactivity provided by </em>law.... \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Giving effect to section 3504, it has been held that a public agency is bound to so \u201cmeet and confer\u201d <em>only </em>in respect of <em>\u201cany agreement that the public agency is authorized </em>[by law] <em>to make . . . </em>.\u201d <em>(East Bay Mun. Employees Union </em>v. <em>County of Alameda, </em>3 Cal.App.3d 578, 584 [83 Cal.Rptr. 503]; italics added.) The agency must \u201cmeet and confer\u201d on such wages, hours, and conditions of employment matters <em>as it would be permitted by law to voluntarily engage upon. </em>\u201c[T]he entire import of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act is to permit as much flexibility in employee-governmental agency relations with regard to all aspects in the employer-employee milieu <em>as a voluntary system will permit.\u201d (San Joaquin County Employees\u2019 Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Joaquin, </em>39 Cal.App.3d 83, 88 [113 Cal.Rptr. 912]; italics added.) It is only when \u201c \u2018the [voluntary] rules and regulations of a public agency do not meet the standard [of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act, that] the deficiencies of those rules and regulations as to rights, duties and obligations of the employer, the employee, and the employee organization, are supplied by the appropriate provisions of the act.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Huntington Beach Police Officers\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Huntington Beach, </em>58 Cal.App.3d 492, 502 [129 Cal.Rptr. 893]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>Los Angeles County Firefighters, Local 1014 </em>v. <em>City of Monrovia, </em>24 Cal.App.3d 289, 295 [101 Cal.Rptr. 78].)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">It is observed also, that the guideline case of <em>Los Angeles County Civil Service Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 55, expressly recognizes a county\u2019s section 3504 privilege not to \u201cmeet and confer\u201d in relation to the <em>merits or necessity of any activity provided by law. </em>(P. 63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">It will thus be seen that a county or city is required by. the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act to \u201cmeet and confer\u201d with employee representatives on wages, hours, and conditions of employment, <em>only </em>in respect of such agreements and changes in its rules and regulations as it would be permitted <em>by law </em>to make or enter upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\"><em>Los Angeles County Civil Service Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court concerned no county or city charter amendment. </em>There, a county charter established a civil service commission and gave that agency broad powers, including the authority to adopt and amend its own rules, but \u201conly after public notice and hearing.\u201d The commission proposed to amend its rules \u201cgoverning layoffs and grade reductions in lieu of layoff.\u201d Employee representatives\u2019 requests that the commission \u201cmeet and confer in good faith\u201d with them according to Government Code section 3505 were rejected, leading to litigation which finally reached the state\u2019s high court. The civil service commission there contended that the county\u2019s constitutionally ordained (\u201chome-rule\u201d) charter provisions controlled over the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The Supreme Court disagreed. It found no conflict between the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act\u2019s \u201cmeet-and-confer session and an objectively conducted public hearing.\u201d Instead it concluded, in effect, that such \u201cmeet-and-confer\u201d sessions were implementive of the charter\u2019s civil service provisions, for \u201cguaranteeing public employees an opportunity to have their views seriously considered . . . serves employees\u2019 interests without destroying the [civil service] commission\u2019s merit objectives,\u201d or otherwise affecting constitutional purpose. Instead of curtailing, or abridging, or hampering, the related charter provisions, the MeyersMilias-Brown Act was found to be in aid of them. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Western Air Lines, Inc., supra, </em>42 Cal.2d 621, 637; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Boyd, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.2d 416, 421.) The county\u2019s civil service commission was accordingly denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Thus, in <em>Los Angeles County Civil Service Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>the commission was freely permitted by the county\u2019s charter and otherwise by law, to adopt appropriate rules for, and to engage in, \u201cmeet and confer\u201d sessions. No controlling law or executive order would be abridged (see Gov. Code, \u00a7 3504, fn. 3, ante); instead the sessions would relate to such an agreement as \u201cthe public agency is authorized to make\u201d (see <em>East Bay Mun. Employees Union </em>v. <em>County of Alameda, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.3d 578, 584). And assuredly, no constitutional requirement would have been contravened by such sessions. Application of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act was accordingly mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">On the other hand, in the case at bench San Francisco\u2019s governing body, its board of supervisors, was by the Constitution given absolute authority to propose charter amendments to the city\u2019s electorate. As pointed out, \u201c \u2018it is not within the legislative power, either by its silence or by direct enactment, to modify, curtail, or abridge this constitutional grant.\u2019 \u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Western Air Lines, Inc., supra, </em>42 Cal.2d 621, 637; <em>Western Assn. etc. R.R. </em>v. <em>Railroad Comm., supra, </em>173 Cal. 802, 804.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Application of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act\u2019s \u201cmeet and confer\u201d provisions to the case before us would bring about the following results.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors, before proposing any charter amendment affecting wages, hours, and conditions of employment must give written notice thereof to appropriate employee representatives. The board of supervisors, or its representatives, will then \u201cmeet and confer\u201d in good faith <em>on the question whether there shall be such a charter amendment proposal, and if so, upon its terms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The parties in such a case must display \u201ca genuine desire to reach agreement,\u201d and \u201cmust make a serious attempt to resolve differences and reach a common ground . . . .\u201d <em>(Placentia Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>City of Placentia, </em>57 Cal.App.3d 9, 25 [129 Cal.Rptr. 126].) The city\u2019s representatives would be under a \u201cduty to bargain\u201d and to \u201cgive and take,\u201d with \u201cproposals and counterproposals\u201d and \u201can open mind and sincere intention to reach an agreement\u201d or \u201ccompromise.\u201d (See <em>Los Angeles County Civil Service Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 55, 61; <em>Glendale City Employees\u2019 Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Glendale, </em>15 Cal.3d 328, 336 [124 Cal.Rptr. 513, 540 P.2d 609] [cert. den., 424 U.S. 943 (47 L.Ed.2d 349, 96 S.Ct. 1411)]; <em>State Assn. of Real Property Agents </em>v. <em>State Personnel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>Bd., </em>83 Cal.App.3d 206, 211 [147 Cal.Rptr. 786]; <em>Placentia Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>City of Placentia, supra, </em>pp. 22-25; <em>Lipow </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 215, 227 [126 Cal.Rptr. 515]; <em>Dublin Professional Fire Fighters, Local 1885 </em>v. <em>Valley Community Services Dist., </em>45 Cal.App.3d 116, 118-119 [119 Cal.Rptr. 182]; <em>San Juan Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Juan Unified Sch. Dist., </em>44 Cal.App.3d 232, 252, fn. 13 [118 Cal.Rptr. 662]; <em>East Bay Mun. Employees Union </em>v. <em>County of Alameda, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.3d 578, 584, fn. 10; Gov. Code, \u00a7 3505; Grodin, <em>Public Employee Bargaining in California: The Meyers-Milias-Brown Act in the Courts </em>(1972) 23 Hastings L.J. 719, 731, 732, 749.) If the conferring parties shall reach an impasse they are permitted to settle the dispute through <em>mediation, </em>if possible. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3505.2; <em>Alameda County Employees\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.3d 518, 523-525.) If the parties\u2019 representatives reach and prepare a \u201cmemorandum of agreement,\u201d and secure its approval by the city\u2019s board of supervisors, the charter amendment proposal will be modified, or not be made at all, according to the agreement. And if the city\u2019s representatives shall fail to meet the employees\u2019 representatives\u2019 concept of \u201cgood faith\u201d bargaining then the proposed charter amendment election, at the latter\u2019s option, will ordinarily await the uncertain outcome of mandate proceedings. (See <em>Los Angeles County Civil Service Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 55; <em>Huntington Beach Police Officers\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Huntington Beach, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.3d 492; <em>San Leandro Police Officers Assn. </em>v. <em>City of San Leandro, </em>55 Cal.App.3d 553 [127 Cal.Rptr. 856].)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Any argument that such was the statutory purpose must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We discern in the state\u2019s Constitution, article XI, section 3 (see fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>a clear purpose that when a county\u2019s, or city\u2019s, governing body shall find it to be in the public interest to propose a specific charter amendment for adoption by the electorate, it shall have the absolute and untrammeled right and duty to do so. Just as clearly appears a corollary intent that such charter amendment proposals, or the decision whether they be made at all, shall not be the product of bargaining and compromise between the public entity\u2019s representatives, and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">It was undoubtedly with such considerations in mind that the Legislature enacted Government Code section 3504 to provide that the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act\u2019s duty to \u201cmeet and confer\u201d did \u201cnot include consideration of the merits [or] necessity ... of any . . . activity provided by law . . . .\u201d (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>In the case at bench, proposal of charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>amendments deemed appropriate by San Francisco\u2019s governing body was an activity provided by the highest law of the state, i.e., its Constitution. Under section 3504 consideration of the <em>merits </em>or <em>necessity </em>of such a proposal was <em>expressly </em>exempted from the \u201cmeet and confer\u201d requirements of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">And even in the absence of Government Code section 3504\u2019s express exemption of charter amendments from operation of the MeyersMilias-Brown Act, we should nevertheless be obliged to hold that the Constitution\u2019s absolute grant of authority to counties\u2019 and cities\u2019 governing bodies, to propose charter amendments to the electors, must be respected.  It is settled that the constitutionally prescribed method of amending a city\u2019s charter is \u201cexclusive\u201d and \u201cmandatory,\u201d and any other method is \u201cprohibited.\u201d <em>(State Board of Education </em>v. <em>Levit, </em>52 Cal.2d 441, 461 [343 P.2d 8]; <em>Santa Clara County </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>33 Cal.2d 552, 554 [203 P.2d 1]; <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Hartwell, </em>131 Cal. 263, 266-267 [63 P. 349]; <em>Garver </em>v. <em>Council of City of Oakland, </em>96 Cal.App. 560, 562 [274 P. 375].) \u201cThe mode provided in the constitution for the proposal of charters is deemed to be the measure of power.\u201d <em>(Doran </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>189 Cal. 610, 611 [209 P. 548]; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>City of San Buenaventura, </em>213 Cal. 637, 640 [3 P.2d 3].) Appellants\u2019 argument would add to the constitutional requirements for amending the city\u2019s charter other and onerous conditions, in clear contravention of this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We have considered the argument that our holding would necessarily allow charter cities to \u201cescape [the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act] through the strategem of engaging in or avoiding labor relations through the charter amendment process.\u201d It is suggested that some unfairness or other public or social evil would result. As we have pointed out, by virtue of Government Code section 3504 the act does not apply to the \u201cmerits [or] necessity\u201d of charter amendment \u201cactivity provided by\u201d the state\u2019s Constitution. But were it otherwise, we would observe no prejudice in such a charter amendment election attended by free and open debate, and an opportunity for interested parties to make written ballot argument as provided by law. (See Elec. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5012-5016, 5350.) \u201cAll political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their protection, security, and benefit, and they have the right to alter or reform it when the public good may require.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 1.) \u201cThe legislative power of this State is vested in the California Legislature which consists of the Senate and Assembly, but the people reserve to themselves the powers of initiative and referendum.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>art. IV, \u00a7 1.) \u201c[T]he people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>in our democracy are entrusted with the responsibility for judging and evaluating the relative merits of conflicting arguments. They may consider, in making their judgment, the source and credibility of the advocate. But if there be any danger that the people cannot evaluate the information and arguments ... it is a danger contemplated by the Framers of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>(First National Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 791-792 [55 L.Ed.2d 707, 727-728, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 1424], fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">From all of the foregoing it appears that no \u201ccause of action was stated by the allegations of the complaints] that the Board of Supervisors [of the City and County of San Francisco] failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Sections 3504.5 and 3505 of the Government Code prior to submitting to the electorate proposed amendments to the San Francisco Charter which change wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of municipal employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We now iterate our earlier analysis, reasons, and determinations in respect of the remaining issues of the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">One of them is stated as follows:  \u201cWhether a cause of action was stated by the allegations of the complaint[s] that the submission to the electorate and subsequent adoption of the proposed amendments to the San Francisco Charter set forth in [the ballot propositions] contravened a written agreement executed by Mayor Joseph L. Alioto in the exercise of emergency powers granted him by the Charter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">The issue is based upon section 3.100 of the city\u2019s charter which provides: \u201cIn case of public emergency involving or threatening the lives, property or welfare of the citizens, or the property of the city and county, the mayor shall have the power, and it shall be his duty, to summon, organize and direct the forces of any department in the city and county in any needed service; to summon, marshal, deputize or otherwise employ other persons, or to do whatever else he may deem necessary for the purpose of meeting the emergency. The mayor may make such studies and surveys as he may deem advisable in anticipation of any such emergency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Under the claimed authority of this provision the city\u2019s mayor declared an emergency on account of a fire fighters\u2019 and policemen\u2019s strike, and then himself reached and signed, on behalf of the city, an agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>acceptable to the strikers. The agreement declared in part: \u201c4. Amnesty. The City agrees that as an essential condition of this Agreement it shall provide \u2018Total Amnesty\u2019 as to all occurrences arising out of or related to the recent labor dispute. \u2018Total Amnesty\u2019 shall include, but not be limited to, action of any kind which in any way adversely affects or discriminates in regard to hire or tenure of employment, or any wages, terms or conditions of employment.\u201d The proposed charter amendments were contrary to the amnesty agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">It is argued that since section 3.100 of the city\u2019s charter gave the mayor power to do whatever \u201che may deem necessary for the purpose of meeting the emergency,\u201d the city\u2019s electors were powerless to amend the charter in any manner contrary to the \u201cAmnesty\u201d provision of the agreement signed by the mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">This argument also lacks validity. Such power as the mayor may have had to declare an emergency and agree to conditions of the strike\u2019s settlement was derived from the city\u2019s charter. The charter was subject to \u201cconflicting provisions in the United States and California Constitutions, and to preemptive state law.\u201d <em>(Harman </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, </em>7 Cal.3d 150, 161 [101 Cal.Rptr. 880, 887, 496 P.2d 1248, 1255].) Among such conflicting provisions were Government Code section 34459, and the state\u2019s Constitution, article XI, section 3, empowering the city\u2019s board of supervisors to propose charter amendments for consideration by the city\u2019s electors. We accordingly find the second appellate contention also to be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">No merit is seen in the argument that a holding of <em>Glendale City Employees\u2019 Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Glendale, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 328 [124 Cal.Rptr. 513, 540 P.2d 609] (cert. den., 424 U.S. 943 [47 L.Ed.2d 349, 96 S.Ct. 1411]), somehow validates the city\u2019s mayor\u2019s \u201camnesty agreement.\u201d In that case, an agreement between the city\u2019s legislative body, with full constitutional, statutory and charter authority to enter into such an agreement, and the city employees\u2019 association was declared valid. Here, as we have pointed out, the city\u2019s mayor was without authority to abrogate constitutional requirements for amendment of the city\u2019s charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The remaining argument of the appeals is that the city\u2019s charter amendment election was void because it was \u201csubmitted in violation of mandatory and prohibitory provisions [of \u00a7 2.23] of the San Francisco Administrative Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Section 2.23, and the administrative code in which it was to be found, were enacted by ordinance of the city\u2019s board of supervisors. The section\u2019s preamble stated: \u201cAny proposal for amendment of the charter ordered submitted to the electors by the board of supervisors on its own motion shall be so ordered pursuant to the provisions of applicable state law, with the further limitations imposed as follows: . . .\u201d There follow generally provisions for reference of the proposed amendment to, and reports thereon from, a committee of the board of supervisors and certain of the city\u2019s agencies and officials, and concerning allotted time periods therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The complaints of the respective actions and judicial notice properly taken by the trial court established, and it appears conceded, that the requirements of section 2.23 were not substantially followed by the city\u2019s board of supervisors in relation to the charter amendment election.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The city contends that the section constituted an invalid self-imposed abridgment (it will be noted that it is expressly described as \u201climitations\u201d by its preamble) of the constitutional power conferred upon its board of supervisors to propose charter amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Appellants, on the other hand, insist that it was implemental (as found proper in <em>Chesney </em>v. <em>Byram, supra, </em>15 Cal.2d 460, 464 [101 P.2d 1106] and <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Kenny, supra, </em>27 Cal.2d 627, 629 [165 P.2d 889]) of the constitutional authority to propose such charter amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">We need not resolve this argument for, assuming arguendo the validity of appellants\u2019 position thereon, we are of the opinion that other legal principles mandate the conclusion that the final contention of the appeal is likewise without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">In <em>Rideout </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>185 Cal. 426, 430-431 [197 P. 74, 75] it is stated: \u201cIt is a primary principle of law as applied to election contests that it is the duty of the court to validate the election if possible. That is to say, the election must be held valid unless plainly illegal. . . . Accordingly, a distinction has been developed between mandatory and directory provisions in election laws; a violation of a mandatory provision vitiates the election, whereas a departure from a directory provision does not render the election void if there is a substantial observance of the law and no showing that the result of the election has been changed or the rights of the voters injuriously affected by the deviation. . . . Whether or not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>provision, the observance of which is not expressly declared by law to be essential to the validity of the election, is mandatory or merely directory, depends upon the character of the act prescribed. If the act enjoined goes to the substance or necessarily affects the merits or results of the election, it is mandatory; otherwise directory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><em>Menlo Park City School Dist. </em>v. <em>Tormey, </em>218 Cal.App.2d 76, 80-81 [32 Cal.Rptr. 82, 84] quotes with approval these rules: \u201c \u2018[W]e are of the opinion that the correct rule, and the one supported by the great weight of authority, may be stated as follows: Statutory directions as to the time and manner of giving notice of elections are mandatory upon the officers charged with the duty of calling the election, and will be upheld strictly in a direct action instituted before an election; but after an election has been held, such statutory requirements are directory, unless it appears that the failure to give notice for the full time specified by the statute has prevented electors from giving a full and free expression of their will at the election, or unless the statute contains a further provision, the necessary effect of which is that failure to give notice for the statutory time will render the election void. \u2018Upon considerations like these the courts have held that the voice of the people is not to be rejected for a defect, or even a want of notice, if they have, in truth, been called upon and have spoken.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\"><em>Dennen </em>v. <em>Jastro, </em>23 Cal.App. 264, 267 [137 P. 1069, 1076] says: \u201cA failure to comply with some technical direction of the statute, where due alone to mistake or inadvertence on the part of those whose duty it is to prepare and furnish the ballot, should not disfranchise the entire vote of the district and vitiate the election, unless it be made to appear that by reason of the irregularity the result was different from what it would otherwise have been, or that it prevented the voter from freely, fairly, and honestly expressing his choice ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The rule has often been iterated; see <em>Canales </em>v. <em>City of Alviso, </em>3 Cal.3d 118, 127 [89 Cal.Rptr. 601, 474 P.2d 417]; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Kenyon, </em>16 Cal.2d 197, 202 [105 P.2d 291]; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>12 Cal.2d 412, 426-427 [84 P.2d 1034]; <em>Kenworthy </em>v. <em>Mast, </em>141 Cal. 268, 271 [74 P. 841]; <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Kirkwood, </em>136 Cal. 396, 401-402 [69 P. 30]; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>City of San Luis Obispo, </em>119 Cal. 624, 632 [51 P. 1085]; <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Lorbeer, </em>111 Cal. 419, 421 [44 P. 162]; <em>Tebbe </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>108 Cal. 101, 111-112 [41 P. 454]; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>83 Cal. 70, 77-78 [23 P. 183]; <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>212 Cal.App.2d 764, 771-772 [28 Cal.Rptr. 387].</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>It does not appear from the actions\u2019 complaints or otherwise, nor is it contended that the city\u2019s board of supervisors\u2019 failure to follow section 2.23 \u201cinjuriously affected the rights of the voters,\u201d or \u201caffected the results of the election,\u201d or \u201cprevented electors from giving a full and free expression of their will at the election,\u201d or \u201cfrom freely, fairly, and honestly expressing [their] choice ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">It follows that the requirements of section 2.23 in the case before us must be deemed <em>directory, </em>and that the city\u2019s board of supervisors\u2019 failure to observe them did not affect the validity of the charter amendment election.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">For these several reasons the complaints of the instant actions and relevant judicial notice taken in aid of them established no cause of action against the city, or its board of supervisors, or anyone, and the respective judgments of dismissal were properly entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">It is found unnecessary to consider other contentions and points raised by the parties, including the city\u2019s contention that an official act of a state or municipal legislative body will never be declared void for noncompliance with rules of procedure made by itself (see <em>City of Pasadena </em>v. <em>Paine, </em>126 Cal.App.2d 93, 96 [271 P.2d 577]; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>State, </em>80 Wis. 407 [50 N.W. 185, 186]; <em>South Georgia Power Co. </em>v. <em>Baumann, </em>169 Ga. 649 [151 S.E. 513, 516]), and the argument that the San Francisco Fire Fighters\u2019 union may not rely upon an agreement whose validity depends upon an emergency created by itself in violation of law (see Lab. Code, \u00a7 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">Appellants petitions for a hearing by the Supreme Court were denied November 8, 1979. Bird, C.
