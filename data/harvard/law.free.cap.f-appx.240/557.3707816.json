Henriquez was sentenced to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the bottom of his sentencing guidelines range. The district court found Torres qualified for a \u201csafety valve\u201d sentencing reduction, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(f) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), and sentenced Torres to eighty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment, below the statutory minimum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">On appeal, counsel for Henriquez and Torres have filed a consolidated brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for appeal but stating their clients challenge the propriety of their guilty pleas and sentences. Neither Henriquez nor Torres filed pro se supplemental briefs, despite being notified of their right to do so. The Government declined to file a responding brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">Counsel raised as a potential issue the adequacy of the plea colloquy conducted pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, but they do not specify any deficiencies in the district court\u2019s Rule 11 inquiries. Because neither Henriquez nor Torres moved in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, any error in the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (discussing standard of review). Our careful review of the record convinces us that the district court fully complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting the guilty pleas. The court ensured Henriquez and Torres entered their pleas knowingly and voluntarily and that their pleas were supported by an independent factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991). We therefore conclude this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">Counsel also raised as a potential issue whether the district court erred in adopting the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) and its calculations. As they raise this issue for the first time on appeal, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 (4th Cir.2005). We find no such error in the district court\u2019s adoption of the PSR or its calculations. Accordingly, this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Finally, the <em>Anders </em>brief seeks review of whether the district court improperly found Henriquez qualified for a criminal history category of II based on prior state misdemeanor convictions in which Henriquez was not represented by counsel. Henriquez bears the burden of showing the prior conviction is invalid, <em>United States v. Jones, </em>977 F.2d 105, 110 (4th Cir.1992), and because Henriquez did not object to the use of these misdemeanor convictions in the PSR\u2019s calculations, we review for plain error. A prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction may be used to enhance the sentence for a subsequent offense only if no prison term was imposed. <em>See Nichols v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 738, 748-49, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994). Henriquez does not dispute he was sentenced to probation on both state offenses. Furthermore, Henriquez\u2019s conclusory and unsupported allegation fails to overcome the presumption that the state court informed him of his right to counsel as it was required to do. <em>Parke v. Raley, </em>506 U.S. 20, 28-34, 113 S.Ct. 517, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Henriquez\u2019s and Torres\u2019s convictions and sentences. We deny counsels\u2019 motion to withdraw from representation. This court requires that counsel inform Henriquez and Torres, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Henriquez or Torres requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Any such motion to withdraw must state that a copy thereof was served on the moving attorney\u2019s client.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
