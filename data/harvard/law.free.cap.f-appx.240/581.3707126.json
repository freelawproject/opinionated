We previously granted a certificate of appealability on Benenhaley\u2019s claim that trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to assert that his second indictment on drug conspiracy charges violated the thirty-day rule of the Speedy Trial Act (\u201cSTA\u201d). We now affirm the district court\u2019s implicit denial of this claim.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Under the STA, an indictment must be filed within thirty days from the date on which a defendant is arrested. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(b) (2000). \u201cThe purpose of the STA\u2019s thirty-day arrest-to-indictment requirement is to ensure that the defendant is not held under an arrest warrant for an excessive period without receiving formal notice of the charge against which he must defend himself.\u201d <em>United States v. Spagnuolo, </em>469 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Thus, \u00a7 3161(b) generally is not triggered where the indictment precedes the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">Here, Benenhaley was initially indicted for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine on May 20, 1998. He was not arrested until after the grand jury returned the indictment. Thus, his initial indictment did not trigger \u00a7 3161(b). On February 8, 1999, the drug conspiracy charge was dismissed without prejudice; however, Benenhaley remained in custody on separate charges. He was indicted on new conspiracy charges on February 17, 1999, and a new arrest warrant was issued and executed subsequent to the new indictment. Again, because Benenhaley was indicted before his arrest on the new charges, we find that \u00a7 3161(b) was not triggered. Because there was no \u00a7 3161(b) violation, we find that trial and appellate counsel were not ineffective for failing to assert such a claim. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (applying standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s implicit rejection of this claim. Benenhaley\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is granted. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b604-11\"> By omitting this claim from its opinion, the district court implicitly rejected it. <em>Cf. Miller v. Auto. Club of N.M., Inc., </em>420 F.3d 1098, 1117 (10th Cir.2005) (a district court\u2019s failure to respond to arguments raised in Fed. R.Civ.P. 72(a) objections is tantamount to an implicit denial of those claims and \"a refusal to overrule the magistrate judge\u2019s order\u201d); <em>Alpine View Co. v. Atlas Copco AB, </em>205 F.3d 208, 219-20 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
