When he committed those offenses, he was serving a term of supervised release after a conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine. At the sentencing hearing for the new offenses, his supervised release was revoked and he was sentenced to an additional 60 months in prison. On appeal, Beatty challenges only this 60-month sentence, arguing that the district court did not elicit objections as required by <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir.1990), and did not consider the sentencing range established by the Sentencing Guidelines before imposing the 60-month sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">Under the procedure established in <em>Jones, </em>\u201cthe district court must give the parties an opportunity to object to the court\u2019s ultimate findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the manner in which the sentence is pronounced, and must elicit a full articulation of the grounds upon which any objection is based.\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir.2007). The purpose of the rule is twofold. \u201cFirst, an objection, if well made, may permit the court to cure an error on the spot \u2014 perhaps making an appeal unnecessary. Second, by eliciting the parties\u2019 objections, the trial judge narrows, and sharpens, the issues presentable on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Snyder, </em>941 F.2d 1427, 1428 (11th Cir.1991). When the district court fails to elicit articulated objections, we ordinarily \u201cvacate the sentence and remand to the district court to give the parties an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1347. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>We recently held in <em>Campbell </em>that the <em>Jones </em>procedure must be followed in supervised release revocation proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The district court did not follow the <em>Jones </em>procedure in this case. After sentencing Beatty, informing him of his appeal options, and asking him whether he understood the sentence, the district court simply asked, \u201cAnything else?\u201d We have noted that \u201cwhen the district court merely asks if there is \u2018anything further\u2019 or \u2018anything else?\u2019 and neither party responds with objections, then the court has failed to elicit fully articulated objections and has therefore violated <em>Jones.\u201d Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1348. The exchange in <em>Campbell, </em>which we held violated <em>Jones, </em>was virtually identical to the exchange in the instant case. <em>See id. </em>As a result, we must conclude that the district court did not elicit articulated objections as required by <em>Jones. See also United States v. Holloway, </em>971 F.2d 675, 681 (11th Cir.1992) (finding <em>Jones </em>violation where, after sentencing the defendant, the court only asked if there was \u201canything else\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Despite the <em>Jones </em>violation, a remand would not be necessary if the record on appeal were sufficient to enable appellate review of Beatty\u2019s claim. <em>See Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1347; <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>946 F.2d 122, 124 n. 1 (11th Cir.1991). Beatty\u2019s claim is that the district court did not consider the Guidelines range when determining the sentence he would receive upon the revocation of his supervised release.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a supervised release revocation hearing, the record must show that the district court at least \u201cconsider[ed] the sentencing range established under the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1349. Because the Guidelines have always been advisory with respect to sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release, \u201cit is sufficient that there be some indication that the district court was aware of and considered the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(punctuation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">In <em>Campbell </em>there was no indication that the district court considered the Guidelines range: the district court never even said the word \u201cGuidelines\u201d during the revocation hearing. <em>See Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1349. In this case, the district court said the word \u201cGuidelines\u201d during the hearing. Beatty was also being sentenced on the armed robbery and possession of a firearm convictions. The court expressly stated the Guidelines range for each of these convictions, and then gave a within-Guidelines sentence for each.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">There is no indication, however, that the district court considered the Guidelines range for the revocation of supervised release. The Court simply said, \u201cI also find that you violated the terms and conditions of supervised release ... and sentence you to 60 months imprisonment to be served consecutively to the sentence imposed\u201d for the other convictions. Sixty months was within the Guidelines range of 51 to 60 months (51 to 63 months based on offense level and criminal history, but with a 60-month statutory maximum). But the district court never mentioned the Guidelines range with respect to the revocation of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">From the 60-month sentence alone, it is not possible to tell whether the court considered the Guidelines range. The court may have considered the Guidelines range and then chosen the top end. Or it may not have considered the Guidelines range, and simply sentenced Beatty to the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>tory maximum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we cannot discern from the record whether the district court considered the Guidelines range in revoking Beatty\u2019s supervised release, and because the district court did not elicit objections as required by Jones, we must vacate Beatty\u2019s 60-month sentence and remand for resentencing on the revocation of supervised release. <em>See Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-11\">. Beatty\u2019s counsel initially filed a motion to withdraw on appeal supported by a brief prepared pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We denied the motion to withdraw and directed counsel to file a merits brief addressing these two issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\">. Beatty did not make this argument in the district court, but because of the <em>Jones </em>violation, we overlook the failure to object. <em>See Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1348.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b388-14\">. The fact that the district court mentioned the Guidelines range with respect to the two convictions but not with respect to the revocation of supervised release tends to suggest that it did not consider the Guidelines range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
