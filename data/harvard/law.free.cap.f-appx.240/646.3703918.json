Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-80. Lopez makes no arguments relevant to the dismissal of his <em>Bivens </em>claims; he has abandoned any such arguments for appeal. <em>See In re Municipal Bond Antitrust Litigation, </em>672 F.2d 436, 439 n. 6 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">Lopez contends that the physician defendants were agents of the Government for purposes of the FTCA and that the duty imposed on the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4042 to care for prisoners extends the scope of the FTCA to include the physician defendants. The FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity does not extend to negligent acts of independent contractors such as the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) or contract physicians. <em>See Linkous v. United States, </em>142 F.3d 271, 275-77 (5th Cir.1998). Lopez\u2019s contention that the independent-contractor physician defendants in his case were agents of the Government is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">Assuming, arguendo, that Dr. Jorge Partida was a federal employee, then recovery from the United States might be possible under to the FTCA. <em>See Bodin v. Vagshenian, </em>462 F.3d 481, 484 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Gil v. Reed, </em>381 F.3d 649, 658 (7th Cir.2004). The BOP\u2019s FTCA claims procedure is separate from the BOP\u2019s administrative remedies procedure, <em>see </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 543.30-543.32. A plaintiff must exhaust administrative remedies before pursuing relief under the FTCA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a); <em>Frantz v. United States, </em>29 F.3d 222, 224 (5th Cir.1994). We need not determine whether Lopez exhausted his FTCA administrative remedies, as his FTCA claim against Dr. Partida is unavailing on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-18\">Under Texas law, which applies to Lopez\u2019s FTCA claim, <em>Cleveland v. United States, </em>457 F.3d 397, 403 (5th Cir.2006), Dr. Shah\u2019s alleged negligence in tearing Lopez\u2019s stitches while examining his eye was a \u201csuperseding cause\u201d that \u201cdestroy[ed] [any] causal connection between the negligent act or omission of [Dr. Partida] and the injury complained of, and thereby [became] the immediate cause of such injury.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Carley, </em>158 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>S.W.3d 1, 9 (Tex.App.2004). Lopez therefore could not recover from Dr. Partida based on the referral to Dr. Shah. Lopez\u2019s complaint states no other basis for recovery based on Dr. Partida\u2019s alleged actions or omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal of Lopez\u2019s action constitutes a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Lopez that if he accumulates three strikes, he will be barred under \u00a7 1915(g) from proceeding in forma pauperis in a civil action or an appeal unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">AFFIRMED. SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b669-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
