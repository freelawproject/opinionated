Robinson was also convicted of one count of conspiracy to distribute five or less grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000). The district court sentenced Robinson to seventy months\u2019 imprisonment. Robinson now appeals the district court\u2019s judgment, challenging only his sentence. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">Robinson first asserts that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the district court, instead of the jury, determined the drug weight used in calculating Robinson\u2019s advisory guideline range. However, because the district court sentenced Robinson under an advisory guideline scheme, no Sixth Amendment error occurred. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (in post-Booker<footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>sentencing, district court should make all factual findings appropriate to determination of advisory guideline range).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">Robinson also argues that the district court\u2019s finding of the drug weight used in calculating his advisory guideline range was not supported by the preponderance of the evidence. We review findings of fact related to a district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines for clear error. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). This deferential standard of review requires reversal only if this court is \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d 538, 542 (4th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). Because trial testimony supports the district court\u2019s calculations of drug weight, the district court did not clearly err in making these factual findings. <em>See United States v. Lamarr, </em>75 F.3d 964, 972 (4th Cir.1996) (noting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>approximation of amount of drugs for sentencing not clearly erroneous if supported by competent record evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Finally, Robinson alleges that the district court should have granted him a downward departure for diminished capacity pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K2.13, p.s. (2005). However, a district court\u2019s failure to grant a downward departure is not renewable unless a district court was under the mistaken impression that it lacked the authority to depart. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>209 F.3d 338, 352 (4th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 333 (3d Cir.2006) (collecting cases declining to review a district court\u2019s decision not to depart, even after <em>Booker). </em>Here, the district court clearly understood its authority to depart. Accordingly, this claim is not cognizable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b578-12\"> <em>United States v.
