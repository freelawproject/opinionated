No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Perry first argues that the government failed to show at his trial that the firearm in this case affected interstate commerce.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Perry \u2014 who was charged with possessing the firearm in Florida \u2014 contends that the government did not prove that the firearm was manufactured outside of Florida. He also asserts that, even assuming that the firearm was produced outside of Florida, the government failed to show that the gun traveled to Florida through interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">We review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>resolving all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. See <em>United States v. Rudisill, </em>187 F.3d 1260, 1267 (11th Cir.1999). We must affirm Perry\u2019s conviction \u201cunless, under no reasonable construction of the evidence, could the jury have found [him] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260,1269 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">At Perry\u2019s trial, Special Agent Michael Gistinger with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives testified that the gun involved in this case \u2014 a Moss-berg pistol grip shotgun \u2014 was manufactured in Connecticut, where Mossberg is based, and traveled in interstate commerce. Agent Gistinger\u2019s testimony provided sufficient evidence that the gun Perry possessed was in or affected interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2001) (concluding that testimony by Special Agent of Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that firearm \u201cwas manufactured in California and had moved in interstate commerce to Georgia where [defendant] was caught with the weapon\u201d was sufficient \u201cto demonstrate the required nexus to interstate commerce\u201d); <em>United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2001) (explaining that \u201cby brandishing a firearm that was manufactured in California and found in his car,\u201d defendant\u2019s acts satisfied the \u201cminimal nexus to interstate commerce\u201d required by section 922(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Perry also asserts that section 922(g) is unconstitutional as applied to him. Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), Perry contends that his conviction is unconstitutional because his firearm possession did not bear a substantial relationship to interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">We review constitutional issues <em>de novo. United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1280 (11th Cir.2004). We have consistently upheld the validity of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) against the constitutional challenge raised by Perry. <em>See United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 389-90 (11th Cir.1996) (rejecting \u2014 in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Lopez </em>decision \u2014 both a facial challenge to the constitutionality of section 922(g) and a challenge to section 922(g), as applied to defendant, based on defendant\u2019s claim that the government failed to show how his gun possession affected interstate commerce); <em>see also Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1280; <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>345 F.3d 1285, 1297 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Scott, </em>263 F.3d at 1274; <em>Dupree, </em>258 F.3d at 1259-60 (all upholding constitutionality of section 922(g)). Perry\u2019s constitutional claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">Perry next contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) based on prior convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>that were not proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, in violation of the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review constitutional challenges to a sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1144 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Perry\u2019s position is precluded by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). In that case, the Supreme Court explained that \u201cthe government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had pri- or convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.2004). Later decisions by the Supreme Court, including <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) , have not disturbed that conclusion. <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 951, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005). \u201cAlthough recent decisions, including <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), may arguably cast doubt on the future prospects of Almendarez-Torres\u2019s holding regarding prior convictions, the Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>As a result, we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres.\u201d Id. </em>at 1316 n. 3. Therefore, the district court did not err in enhancing Perry\u2019s sentence based on his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">We affirm Perry\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-6\">. To convict a defendant under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, among other things, \u201cthat the firearm was in or affecting interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Deleveanx, </em>205 F.3d 1292, 1297 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\">.
