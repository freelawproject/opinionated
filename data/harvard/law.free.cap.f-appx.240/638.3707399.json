We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-22\">The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Sheppard\u2019s suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). He has since fulfilled the administrative remedy review but the district court\u2019s decision must be affirmed on other grounds. <em>See Sojourner T v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992). In this case, Sheppard alleges, at most, negligence on the part of the vehicle driver and the Commissioner for hiring the driver. \u201c[T]he Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is simply not implicated by a <em>negligent </em>act of an official causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property.\u201d <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 328, 106 S.Ct. 662, 663, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). Thus, Sheppard has not stated a claim for a constitutional violation under \u00a7 1983. We affirm the dismissal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b660-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
