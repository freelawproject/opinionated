Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In <em>United States v. Loflin, </em>91 Fed.Appx. 873 (4th Cir.2004), <em>vacated, </em>543 U.S. 1100, 125 S.Ct. 993, 160 L.Ed.2d 1001 (2005), we affirmed John William Loflin\u2019s conviction on three counts of traveling interstate with intent to engage in sexual relations with a juvenile (Counts 3, 5, and 7), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b) (2000), and three counts of interstate travel to engage in criminal sexual activity with a juvenile (Counts 4, 6 and 8), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a) (2000). We also affirmed his 144-month sentence for each count to run concurrently. The Supreme Court granted Loflin\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Booker. </em>After reviewing Loflin\u2019s appeal in light of <em>Booker, </em>we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Loflin contends that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment because the district court at sentencing accepted the presentence report and increased his base offense level by two levels for each of the following factors: (1) undue influence under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B) (2000), (2) using a computer or Internet access device to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct under USSG \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(3), and (3) obstruction of justice based on perjured testimony pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3C1.1. Thus, Loflin argues that his total offense level was increased by six levels based upon facts not found by the jury or admitted by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Because Loflin did not raise a Sixth Amendment issue in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. </em>Hughes, 401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). To demonstrate plain error, Loflin must establish that error occurred, that it was plain, and that it affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 547-48. If a defendant satisfies these requirements, our discretion is appropriately exercised only when failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice, such as when the defendant is actually innocent or the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal Sentencing Guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. 543 U.S. at 226-27, 125 S.Ct. 738. The Court remedied the constitutional violation by making the Guidelines advisory through the removal of two statutory provisions that had rendered them mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 227,125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Here, the district court sentenced Loflin under the then-mandatory federal Sentencing Guidelines by making the above three determinations. These findings raised Loflin\u2019s total offense level from 27 to 33. Without the disputed enhancements, Loflin\u2019s advisory sentencing range would have been 70-87 months of imprisonment, given his criminal history category of I. Thus, in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes, </em>we find that the district court\u2019s plain error in sentencing Loflin, based on facts found only by the court, affects his substantial rights and warrants correction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Agy\">Accordingly, we vacate Loflin\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>tentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-11\">. Disposition of this appeal was delayed as this court had not decided whether <em>Booker </em>applied to the child and sex crimes of which Loflin had been convicted. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b)(2) (West Supp.2007). This court has now held that <em>Booker </em>applies to such crimes. <em>See United States v. Hecht, </em>470 F.3d 177, 178 (4th Cir.2006) (\u2018\u2018[W]e agree that section 3553(b)(2) violates the rationale of <em>Booker, </em>that Hecht\u2019s sentence must be vacated, and that the action must be remanded for resentencing.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-5\">. Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>\"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Loflin\u2019s sentencing. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4; <em>see generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \u201cplain\u201d if \u201cthe law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b598-6\">. Although the Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007), and then impose a sentence. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (West Supp.2007). <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546 &amp; n. 5. The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
