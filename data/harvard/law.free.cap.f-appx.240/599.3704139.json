The district court docketed this pleading as a notice of appeal. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Tracy\u2019s pleading failed to comply with Fed. R.App. P. 3, and as a consequence failed to invoke the jurisdiction of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-16\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). A proper notice of appeal must specify the parties to the case, the order appealed from, and the court to which the appeal is taken. Fed. R.App. P. 3(c). Tracy\u2019s post-judgment pleading filed in the district court fails to comply with this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-17\">Because Tracy failed to invoke the jurisdiction of this court, we dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We also deny Tracy\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-18\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b622-13\"> To the extent that Tracy\u2019s informal brief could be construed as a notice of appeal, it was untimely. <em>See </em>Fed.
