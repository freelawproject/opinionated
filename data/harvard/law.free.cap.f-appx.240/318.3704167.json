The government argues that the sentence imposed by the district court is unreasonable because the court erroneously considered an impermissible factor \u2014 the court\u2019s own disagreement with the career-offender provision of \u00a7 4B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines\u2014 thus, rendering Vazquez\u2019s sentence procedurally unreasonable. The government also argues that a sentence of 110 months\u2019 imprisonment is substantively unreasonable. After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we vacate Vazquez\u2019s sentence and remand for further proceedings, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The relevant facts are these. On December 15, 2004, Vazquez and co-defendant Adalberto Rosa were indicted on one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture containing cocaine powder, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B)(ii), and 846. Vazquez pled guilty, pursuant to a written plea agreement, which included a statement providing the factual basis for Vazquez\u2019s guilty plea. According to that statement, a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) contacted agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) to alert them that Vazquez and co-defendant Rosa were traveling from Massachusetts to Orlando, Florida, with the intent of purchasing multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine powder. Once they arrived in Orlando, Vazquez called the Cl to complete the transaction. The Cl came to the hotel where Vazquez and Rosa were staying, at which point Vazquez presented the Cl with the money. Vazquez then followed the Cl to his car, where the Cl produced a duffel bag containing cocaine. As Vazquez walked with the duffel bag back towards the his hotel room, he was intercepted and arrested by DEA agents. Rosa also was arrested. Vazquez subsequently waived his right to remain silent and admitted \u201cthat he had picked up money earlier in the day from various Western Union money locations to buy three kilograms of cocaine and was planning on transporting the cocaine back to Massachusetts.\u201d After two change-of-plea colloquies, at which Vazquez agreed with the foregoing factual description of his offense, the district court accepted his plea and he proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">According to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Vazquez had provided $18,000 in U.S. currency to the CI, in exchange for 8 kilograms of cocaine, which he intended to transport back to Massachusetts. The PSI recommended that because the offense involved between 2 kilograms and 3.5 kilograms of cocaine, Vazquez\u2019s base offense level was a 28, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(6). The PSI further recommended that Vazquez qualified as a career offender, under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the Guidelines, because he previously had pled guilty to a controlled substance offense and had at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>a controlled substance offense. In support of its recommendation, the PSI noted that Vazquez was convicted on two separate occasions of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance (heroin) in April 1991, and was convicted of the rape of a child, a crime of violence, in January 1996. The PSI recommended that as a career offender facing a statutory maximum penalty of 25 or more years, Vazquez\u2019s offense level should be adjusted from 28 to 34, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. The PSI also recommended a 2-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a), resulting in a total offense level of 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Based on 12 criminal history points, Vazquez\u2019s criminal history category was V. Due to Vazquez\u2019s career-offender status, his criminal history category was adjusted to VI, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. With an adjusted offense level of 32 and a criminal history category VI, Vazquez faced an advisory Guidelines range of 210 and 262 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">At sentencing, Vazquez did not object to the PSI\u2019s factual findings or the calculation of his Guidelines range, prior to application of \u00a7 4B1.1. Vazquez did challenge the application of the Guidelines\u2019 career-offender provision, arguing that the two qualifying drug convictions occurred approximately 15 years prior to the instant offense, and that the qualifying crime of violence (rape of a child) occurred 10 years prior to the instant offense. Vazquez stated that he had served two years for sexual battery, stemming from a \u201cconsensual-type offense,\u201d and had not committed a crime in the past eight years, since he was released. Vazquez argued that the remoteness of his past crimes and his willingness to accept responsibility warranted imposition of a sentence closer to the 37-month term of imprisonment that co-defendant Rosa received. Vazquez acknowledged that \u201cin terms of ... community deeds and so on, [he] does not have that sort of mitigation,\u201d but asked that the court consider that he had a close family that had traveled from Massachusetts to support him.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The government requested that the court sentence Vazquez to a term of imprisonment within the Guideline range of 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment, as scored by the PSI after application of \u00a7 4B1.1. As for Vazquez\u2019s challenge to the PSI\u2019s application of the career-offender provision, the government responded to Vazquez\u2019s request for mitigation by stating that Vazquez had committed an act of sexual battery when he was 28 years old and the victim was only 14. The government argued that the sentence issued to Vazquez should \u201cnot be close\u201d to the term given to Rosa because Rosa had a lesser criminal history and was issued a downward departure for his substantial assistance, to which Vazquez was not entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">After hearing the parties\u2019 arguments, the district court stated that \u201cwe\u2019ve established a guideline range of 210 to 262 months; but while the guidelines, of course, are important and entitled to deference ... I have a statutory obligation to consider the factors in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ], in determining a reasonable sentence in the context of guideline scoring.\u201d The district court stated that the career-offender provision found in \u00a7 4B1.1 created \u201ca quantum leap in the guideline calculation,\u201d in which the Sentencing Commission \u201cattempt[ed] to come up with a definition that applie[d] to all people in all circumstances, without regard to the actual offenses or the nature of the offense or the timing of the offense.\u201d The court explained that it felt \u201cthe guidelines simply cannot operate realistically on the human level\u201d and take the proceedings \u201castray in situations where you have these quantum-type leaps.\u201d The court then stated its had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>considered the nature and circumstances of the offense and noted the \u201cfairly significant amount of drugs involved,\u201d but also indicated that this case was \u201cnot like an ongoing conspiracy in which the defendant is charged with multiple transactions of trafficking. It\u2019s a one-incident offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">As for Vazquez\u2019s criminal history, the district court stated that Vazquez was 23 when he committed two drug felonies in 1991, which it noted were sentenced together concurrently. The court opined that the career-offender provision failed to take into account that the two convictions \u201cw[ere] a drug offense or offenses, if you want to separate them, that occurred almost 15 years ago.\u201d The court also found that \u201cthe other offense that r[an] his score up and qualifies him under [the career offender provision] [wa]s the statutory rape charge; and, while reprehensible, it also was some time ago and was not a crime of violence, unless that\u2019s the way you want to define it. It was consensual albeit illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The district court determined that, absent the career-offender enhancement, Vazquez would be subject to a Guidelines imprisonment range of 110 to 137 months. Questioning the value of criminal sentences as deterrence to the illicit drug trade, the court explained that it felt a mandatory minimum sentence of five years would \u201cbe adequate deterrence\u201d and a sentence \u201cin the hundred-plus range\u201d was \u201cway in excess of what is necessary to deter this type of criminal conduct.\u201d The court then stated that, after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the arguments by the parties, and the Guidelines range, a 110-month sentence was appropriate, as it was \u201cat the low end of what would be the non-enhanced guideline, just in terms of reference as to how the Court arrived at that, that sentence as being, in the Court\u2019s view, reasonable.\u201d The court explained that after considering the advisory Guidelines and the sentencing factors, it found that its sentence was reasonable, \u201cnot greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes,\u201d and in excess of the mandatory minimum. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error, and then review the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1360 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. petition dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3040, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2007) <em>(\u201cAaron Williams </em>\u201d). Although the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory, the district court is required to correctly calculate the sentencing range and take that range into account when imposing a sentence. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005). Once the court correctly calculates the advisory sentencing range, \u201cit may impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as it is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Pope, </em>461 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">The Sentencing Guidelines contain a career-offender provision, in accordance with Congressional dictates, to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities amongst recidivist offenders who commit crimes of violence or drug offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (comment, background (2004)) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h)). The provision applies to a defendant who is at least eighteen years of age, with at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and has committed, as the instant offense, a felony that is a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). The provision enhances the offense level of the instant offense, in accordance with a table contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>section, and the criminal history category to a category VI. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">There is no question, and the parties do not argue otherwise, that the district court correctly calculated the Sentencing Guideline range of 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment, after application of \u00a7 4B1.1\u2019s enhancement provision. The PSI stated that Vazquez was convicted of two felony drug offenses in 1991 and, in 1996, he was convicted of the rape of a child, a felonious crime of violence. Because Vazquez faced a statutory maximum of 40 years imprisonment on his current drug offense, the court properly scored his offense level at 34, which was reduced to a 32 after factoring in a 2-level reduction for his acceptance of responsibility, and classified his criminal history as a category VI. The court then correctly announced that it \u201cestablished a guideline range of 210 to 262 months.\u201d The remainder of the sentencing hearing was devoted to ascertaining a reasonable sentence and it is that which we now review.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Regardless of whether the court imposed a sentence within the correctly calculated sentencing range, we next consider whether the sentence is reasonable. <em>Aaron Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1360. The party challenging the sentence has the burden of proving the sentence unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1361. A sentence can be deemed unreasonable because of the procedure used to derive the sentence (procedural unreasonableness) or because the length of the sentence is unreasonable (substantive unreasonableness). <em>Id. </em>at 1361-63. A sentence is reasonable if it achieves the purposes of sentencing as stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>That provision requires that the district court \u201cshall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense,\u201d \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d and \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A-C). The court also may consider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d \u201cthe kinds of sentences available,\u201d the Sentencing Guideline range, and \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u201cThe reasons given by the district court for its selection of a sentence are important to assessing reasonableness.\u201d <em>Aaron Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1361. If the party challenging the sentence as unreasonable demonstrates that the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence \u201cwas substantially affected by its consideration of impermissible factors,\u201d we will vacate the sentence and remand, unless the party defending the sentence can establish that the error is harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 1361-62. Whether a factor is impermissible is a matter of law that is reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 1361. We will uphold a sentence as procedurally reasonable where we are convinced that the district court did not impose the sentence \u201cbased solely on its disagreement with the Guidelines,\u201d which is one \u201cimpermissible factor\u201d we have recognized. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1354-55 (11th Cir.2006), <em>(\u201cMarcus Williams </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">In the instant case, the district court began its \u00a7 3553(a) analysis with a discussion of how the career-offender enhancement creates a \u201cquantum leap in the guideline calculation\u201d that does not accurately apply to \u201call people in all circumstances.\u201d Accordingly, the court explained that the provision \u201ccannot operate realistically on a human level\u201d and leads the court \u201castray\u201d at sentencing. These views <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>permeate the court\u2019s subsequent discussion of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. The district court explained that the career-offender enhancement did not adequately consider Vazquez\u2019s criminal history, then discredited the predicate offenses based on their remoteness and their characteristics. With regard to the two drug felonies, the court stated that they could be considered as one offense because they were sentenced concurrently. The court cited no authority for its treatment of the two prior drug felony convictions as one. The court also reasoned that although the statutory rape offense was \u201creprehensible,\u201d it \u201cwas not a crime of violence, unless that\u2019s how you want to define it.\u201d This reasoning was in direct conflict with our precedent on the issue \u2014 we recently defined statutory rape, even if \u201cconsensual,\u201d as a crime of violence that qualifies towards the career-offender enhancement. <em>United States v. Ivory, </em>475 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Based on its own personal disagreement with the way that the career-offender provisions affected the instant case, and its decision to treat the <em>two </em>prior drug felony convictions as <em>one </em>and the statutory rape conviction as <em>not </em>a crime of violence, the district court then proceeded to determine what the sentencing range would be if the career-offender provision did not apply. The court arrived at a sentence of 110 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was \u201cat the low end of what would be the non-enhanced guideline, just in terms of reference as to how the [cjourt arrived at that ... sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">The court\u2019s disagreement with the effect of the career-offender provision in this case imbued the entire sentencing hearing, and we readily conclude that the court\u2019s disagreement with the Guidelines, an impermissible factor, \u201csubstantially affected\u201d its sentencing calculus. <em>Aaron Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1361-62. In <em>Aaron Williams, </em>we vacated and remanded a below-Guidelines sentence that was based on similar disagreement with the effect of the career-offender provision of \u00a7 4B1.1. In that case, the district court said that the career-offender enhancement \u201cis a totally inappropriate way to consider the individual nature of an offense or a defendant\u2019s individual background\u201d and said it was not going to sentence Williams as a career offender. In its sentencing memorandum, the district court again explained what it considered to be the \u201carbitrary compounding\u201d effect of the career-offender enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Section 4B1.1 embodies Congressional policy, reflected in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cthat repeat drug offenders receive sentences \u2018at or near\u2019 the enhanced statutory maximums set out in [21 U.S.C.] \u00a7 841(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Congressional goal \u2014 to target specific recidivists, particularly repeat drug offenders and violent criminals\u2014 clearly is implicated here, as there is little question that Vazquez is a recidivist, within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h), and therefore \u00a7 4B1.1 applies to him. On this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>record, the government has met its burden to prove that the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence was \u201csubstantially affected\u201d by an impermissible factor, the district court\u2019s disagreement with the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Moreover, Vazquez has not shown that the district court\u2019s erroneous consideration of its disagreement with the career-offender provision was harmless. The court did not otherwise reasonably justify its sentence, which varied downwards from the sentencing range by a period of 100 months and was based, in part, on other impermissible factors. The other factors that the court considered were the remoteness of Vazquez\u2019s prior felonies, the court\u2019s belief that Vazquez\u2019s two prior drug convictions should count as only one, the court\u2019s belief that Vazquez\u2019s statutory rape conviction was not a crime of violence, and that Vazquez was engaged in a drug conspiracy that involved a single objective rather than an ongoing conspiracy. Vazquez even admitted that he had not participated in any \u201ccommunity deeds\u201d that warranted mitigation. Although the court expressed its belief that the statutory mandatory minimum would sufficiently deter such conduct, and that a sentence \u201cin the hundred-plus range\u201d was \u201cin excess of what [wa]s necessary to deter this type of criminal conduct,\u201d it was only considering a sentence in that range because it felt that a reasonable sentence in this case would be one not enhanced by the career-offender provision. The government has met its burden to show that Vazquez\u2019s sentence is procedurally unreasonable due to the district court\u2019s use of a faulty procedure to fashion Vazquez\u2019s sentence. <em>Aaron Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1361.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate and remand for re-sentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-19\">. Before the government\u2019s filing of the cross-appeal, Vazquez filed a notice of appeal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>challenge his conviction. Vazquez's attorney, Ernest L. Chang, then filed a motion to withdraw from representation on appeal, pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). With regard to Vazquez\u2019s conviction, an independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel's assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit regarding Vazquez\u2019s conviction, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Vazquez\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"AqZ8\">As to the government\u2019s cross-appeal of Vazquez\u2019s sentence, Mr. Chang has filed a brief in opposition to the government\u2019s arguments. Accordingly, we DENY AS MOOT the motion to withdraw as to Vazquez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-6\">.
