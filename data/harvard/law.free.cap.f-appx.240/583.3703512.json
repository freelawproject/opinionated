Harrison\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which counsel identifies the issue of voluntariness of the guilty plea, but submits there are no meritorious issues for appeal. In response, the Government has moved to dismiss the appeal on the basis of a waiver of appellate rights contained in its plea agreement with Harrison. Although advised of his right to do so, Harrison has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-29\">This court\u2019s interpretation of Harrison\u2019s plea agreement is guided by contract law. <em>United States v. McQueen, </em>108 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1997). In the instant matter, the waiver provision applies only to a challenge to Harrison\u2019s sentence: \u201c[t]he Defendant ... knowingly and expressly waive[s] all rights conferred by 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 to appeal whatever sentence is imposed..... [T]he Defendant waives any right to appeal from any sentence within or below the advisory guidelines range resulting from an adjusted base offense level of 27.\u201d (J.A. 29). The district court sentenced Harrison based on a total offense level of 27. Although we conclude the waiver is enforceable to the extent Harrison challenges his sentence, it does not preclude Harrison from appealing his conviction. Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion only to the extent that it applies to Harrison\u2019s appeal of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">With regard to the voluntariness of Harrison\u2019s guilty plea, we have reviewed the transcript of the plea hearing and have found no error. Because Harrison\u2019s plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered, the district court did not err in accepting Harrison\u2019s plea. Accordingly, we find no error in Harrison\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Finding no meritorious issues upon our review of the record, we affirm Harrison\u2019s conviction and dismiss the portion of his appeal relating to his sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
