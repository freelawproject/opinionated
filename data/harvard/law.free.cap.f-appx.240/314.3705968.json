After careful review, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">When, as here, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirms without opinion the decision of an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), the IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final agency determination subject to review. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>827 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). To the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001). Under this test, which is \u201chighly deferential,\u201d we \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). In order to reverse a finding of fact, \u201cwe must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. See INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d See INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to his home country or to avail himself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that her statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). \u201cTo establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that she was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). \u201cTo establish eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must prove (1) a \u2018subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable\u2019 fear of persecution, that is (2) on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">While the INA does not expressly define \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have recognized that it is \u201can extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>harassment or intimidation, and that [m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). There must be \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that [the petitioner] will be singled out for persecution on account of [her political] opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. Additionally, we have held that \u201cevidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision that Petitioners were not entitled to asylum, based on either Viveros-Velez\u2019s past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, on account of political opinion. The only evidence of Viveros-Velez\u2019s alleged past persecution attributable, with any degree of specificity, to the FARC consisted of her own testimony about FARC members\u2019 threatening phone calls to her brothers, who she said own construction materials warehouses and are wealthy. The brothers had refused to provide monetary support to the FARC cause, after which Viveros-Velez testified she received phone calls from the FARC seeking to know the whereabouts of her brothers and threatening her life and the lives of her daughters, if she did not provide information about the brothers\u2019 whereabouts. Petitioners presented no evidence that the phone calls were based on Viveros-Velez\u2019s political opinion, or for that matter, that the FARC attributed <em>any </em>political opinion to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In short, a mere refusal to cooperate with the FARC\u2019s demands is insufficient to show past persecution. <em>See Sanchez v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that alien did not establish past persecution by FARC where FARC\u2019s harassment was due to alien\u2019s refusal to cooperate rather than actual or imputed political opinion); <em>see also INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816,117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (concluding that persecution because of refusal to join forces with the guerillas is not persecution on account of a political opinion). Nor does evidence that \u201cmerely shows that a person has been a victim of criminal activity,\u201d such as financial extortion, \u201cconstitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1258. Moreover, it is well-settled that menacing phone calls, alone, are not sufficient to establish past persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (concluding that \u201cmenacing\u201d telephone calls and threats to the alien and her brother constituted \u201ca few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u201d and were insufficient to establish past persecution). On this record, we cannot say the evidence before the IJ <em>compelled </em>a contrary result as to the present petition for asylum based on past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Because Petitioners did not establish past persecution, they were not entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Petitioners did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution, because they did not present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that [Viveros-Velez] ... will be singled out for persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, we are not compelled to conclude that Petitioners established a case for asylum based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>well-founded fear of future persecution by the FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-16\">. Because we conclude Petitioners have not met their burden to establish eligibility for asylum under the INA, we also conclude that they cannot meet the higher standards for withholding of removal under the INA or relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). <em>See Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-30\">. We deny the petition for review, without further discussion, to the extent that Petitioners based their asylum claim on Viveros-Ve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>lez\u2019s membership in a particular social group consisting of people who have refused to cooperate with the FARC. The members of the proposed group do not compose a \"particular social group,\u201d as defined by the Board of Immigration Appeals, because they do not \"share a common, immutable characteristic ... such as sex, color, or kinship ties, or in some circumstances it might be a shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.\u201d <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985), <em>overruled on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 439 (BIA 1987); <em>see also Castillo-Arias v.
