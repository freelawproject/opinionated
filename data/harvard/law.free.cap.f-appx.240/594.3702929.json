Wiggins was sentenced pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000) (\u201cACCA\u201d). On appeal, Wiggins asserts the district court erred in admitting certain evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment and contends his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-16\">Wiggins first contends the police violated his Fourth Amendment rights by stopping him without reasonable suspicion as required under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Taking into account the collective knowledge of the officers involved in the investigation, <em>United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, 232, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985), we conclude the initial vehicle stop was supported by \u201cspecific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant ... intrusion\u201d on a suspect\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-17\">Second, Wiggins argues that the police detained him for an unreasonable period of time while a K-9 unit was called. We find that the length of Wiggins\u2019 detention fell within the scope of a <em>Terry </em>stop. We have previously upheld the investigative detention of an individual suspected of drug activity, along with his luggage, for thirty-eight minutes while officers awaited the arrival of a K-9 unit to sweep for. drugs. <em>See United States v. McFarley, </em>991 F.2d 1188, 1193-94 (4th Cir.1993). In <em>McFarley, </em>we found the scope of the detention reasonable because there was no evidence that officers unduly extended the defendant\u2019s detention or failed to act with diligence in conducting their investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 1194. The same reasoning controls here.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-18\">Third, Wiggins argues the offense he was charged with at the scene could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>support an arrest. However, the record reflects Wiggins was arrested pursuant to North Carolina law identifying as a Class Three misdemeanor the transport of \u201cspirituous liquor in the passenger area of a motor vehicle in other than the manufacturer\u2019s unopened original container.\u201d N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 18B-401(a) (2005). Here, because Wiggins handed police an opened bottle of liquor that police had seen under the passenger seat of his vehicle, Wiggins\u2019 arrest was lawful. Ultimately, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of Wiggins\u2019 motion to suppress evidence found subsequent to Wiggins\u2019 stop, arrest and search.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">With respect to his sentence, Wiggins contends it was imposed in violation of the rule in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), for two reasons: first, because the predicate convictions supporting his sentence under the ACCA were not determined by a jury or admitted by him; and second, because the district court did not make a specific finding that the criminal offenses were committed separately from one another. The former position is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in which the Supreme Court stated that a district court may rely on the fact of a prior conviction for sentencing purposes. <em>See also United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 354 (4th Cir.2005). Wiggins\u2019 latter position is precluded by <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278 (4th Cir.2005), in which we found that the date of a conviction is inherent in the conviction itself and conclusive judicial records. 421 F.3d at 286. Further, because one panel of this court may not overrule another, we decline Wiggins\u2019 invitation to overrule <em>Thompson. See United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999). We therefore find no error in the district court\u2019s classification of Wiggins as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Wiggins\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
