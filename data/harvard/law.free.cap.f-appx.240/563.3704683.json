He was sentenced to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. Hill\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), concluding there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questioning whether the district court erred in denying Hill\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant. Hill has filed a pro se supplemental brief alleging there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction and the Government\u2019s 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) notice was inadequate because it did not identify his prior conviction. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">I. <em>Motion to Suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">Counsel contends the district court erred in denying Hill\u2019s motion to suppress drug evidence because the search warrant was not supported by probable cause. This court reviews the factual findings underlying the denial of a motion to suppress for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>400 F.3d 187, 193 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 856, 126 S.Ct. 134, 163 L.Ed.2d 133 (2005). The evidence is construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-14\">Probable cause is judged by an analysis of the totality of the circumstances, weighed \u201cnot in terms of library analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 230, 232, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). Probable cause means that there is a \u201cfair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317. The facts presented to the issuing judge need only convince a person of reasonable caution that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found at the place to be searched. <em>Texas v. Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 742, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983). Appellate courts pay great deference to the district court\u2019s findings of probable cause in relation to warrants. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 236, 103 S.Ct. 2317.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-15\">While executing an arrest warrant on March 16, 2005, arising from a prior drug buy from Hill\u2019s residence, Sheriff\u2019s officers saw Hill look out the front window of his mobile home and quickly move back into the mobile home. As the officers knocked on Hill\u2019s front door and announced them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>selves several times, the officers heard footsteps moving quickly through the mobile home and a toilet flushing. Because Hill did not come to the door and based on the narcotics officers\u2019 experience with drugs being disposed of through toilets, the officers entered the mobile home, detained Hill on the ground, and conducted a protective sweep to secure the remainder of the mobile home. No other individuals were located during the sweep, but the officers saw in plain view that the toilet tank lid in the bathroom was ajar, there was water on the bathroom floor, and there was a set of digital scales in the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">An application for a search warrant was prepared with that information, including a recitation of Hill\u2019s prior drug related offenses and convictions. A search warrant issued and was executed that day. During the search, the officers seized two Crown Royal bags in the toilet tank containing fourteen plastic bags of cocaine base, the digital scales from the kitchen counter, sandwich bags consistent with those in which the cocaine was packaged, and approximately $500 cash. We find there was a substantial basis to conclude that there was probable cause to issue the search warrant for Hill\u2019s mobile home on March 16, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">II. <em>Adequacy of \u00a7 851 Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Hill argues in his pro se supplemental brief that the Government\u2019s 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) notice was inadequate because it did not identify any prior convictions. To seek enhanced penalties under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000), the Government must file an information giving its notice to seek such penalties prior to trial or the entry of a plea. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000). The Government filed an \u00a7 851 notice of potential increased penalties listing Hill\u2019s prior conviction as: \u201c[o]n July 9, 1998, the defendant pleaded guilty to seven (7) counts of manufaeture/distribution of crack cocaine and received a term of imprisonment of seven (7) years and a fine of $25,000.00.\u201d We find the Government gave Hill adequate notice by fully describing his prior 1998 guilty plea conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">III. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">Hill argues in his pro se brief that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction. To determine if there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction, this court considers whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Substantial evidence is \u201cevidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). This court reviews both direct and circumstantial evidence, and permits the \u201cgovernment the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982). In resolving issues of substantial evidence, this court does not weigh evidence or reassess the factfinder\u2019s assessment of witness credibility. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">In order to prove Hill violated 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), the Government must establish that he knowingly possessed a controlled substance with the intent to distribute it. <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 519 (4th Cir.2005). Intent to distribute may be inferred from quantities too large for personal consumption, <em>Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 873, or \u201cfrom possession of drug-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>packaging paraphernalia,\u201d <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>912 F.2d 728, 730 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Hill was the only person at the mobile home where the cocaine was found in the commode after officers had heard the commode flush when attempting to execute an arrest warrant on Hill for a previous drug offense. Fourteen plastic sandwich bags of cocaine base were found in the bathroom commode. Plastic sandwich bags of the same type used to package the cocaine were found in the kitchen, along with digital scales. We thus find there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Hill was guilty of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Hill\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
