Finding no reversible <em>error, we </em>affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">Proffitt pled guilty to and was sentenced to 190 months\u2019 imprisonment for participation in a conspiracy to manufacture and possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Proffitt\u2019s sentence was imposed on May 10, 2005, and we affirmed his conviction and sentence on appeal. <em>See United States v. Proffitt, </em>173 Fed.Appx. 245 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-17\">On September 18, 2006, Proffitt filed a letter in the district court requesting his appeal be \u201creentered.\u201d The district court issued an order in accordance with <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644, 649 (4th Cir.2002), giving Proffitt notice and opportunity to respond before the court construed the letter as an initial 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. Proffitt responded that he was attempting to re-appeal his conviction to this court and requested an extension of the appeal period. Thus, because Proffitt objected to characterization of his pleading as a \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court properly filed the letter as a notice of appeal as requested. <em>See Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d at 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-18\">In a criminal case, a defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)(i). With or without a motion, the district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal for an additional thirty days upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985). When the notice of appeal is filed more than thirty days after expiration of the appeal period, neither the district court nor this court may grant an extension of time to appeal. <em>United States v. Schuchardt, </em>685 F.2d 901, 902 (4th Cir.1982); <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(b)(1). The appeal periods established by Rule 4 are mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-19\">Proffitt\u2019s filing on September 18, 2006, is well outside both the appeal period and excusable neglect period. Though the district court should have left the assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>of the timeliness of Proffitt\u2019s appeal to this court, we construe the court\u2019s order as implicity denying Proffitt\u2019s request for an extension of time to appeal his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Clearly, there is no basis for jurisdiction over any attempt by Proffitt to re-appeal his 2005 conviction and sentence. Thus, he was not entitled to an extension of time in which to note such an appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order construing Proffitt\u2019s filing as a notice of appeal and implicitly denying an extension of time to file it. We also affirm the court\u2019s order denying Proffitt\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We further deny as unnecessary Proffitt\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
