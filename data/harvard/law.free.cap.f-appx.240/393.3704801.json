Boyd did not respond. We affirm the summary judgment against the claim of retaliation, the denial of the motions to amend the complaint and extend discovery, and the refusal to enforce the purported assignment of Evans\u2019s rights. Because Evans did not waive her right to a trial by jury, we reverse the judgment entered against Evans\u2019s claim of employment discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">From January 8, 2004, to February 8, 2004, Evans worked at a Popeye\u2019s Fried Chicken restaurant owned by Boyd. James Summers was the general manager of the restaurant and Delores Simmons was the assistant manager. Summers was also the pastor of a local pentecostal church.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Evans contends that Boyd forbade the employees from attending services at Summers\u2019s church because it could create an appearance of impropriety, but Evans attended Summers\u2019s church on several occasions. Evans contends that she was terminated because she attended Summers\u2019s church. Although Boyd did not appear in this appeal, Boyd argued to the district court that Evans was not terminated, but quit after a disagreement with Simmons about Evans\u2019s uniform.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Evans commenced an action <em>pro se </em>against Boyd and alleged that Boyd subjected her to religious discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Civil Rights Act of 1871. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq.; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Evans later moved to amend her complaint to add a First Amendment claim and also moved to extend the discovery deadline. The district court denied her motions. Boyd moved for summary judgment, and the district court granted a partial summary judgment on Evans\u2019s retaliation claim and her complaint under section 1983. Evans\u2019s complaint of religious discrimination remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">In her complaint, Evans demanded a jury trial. The Proposed Consolidated Pretrial Order filed by Evans on November 16, 2005, provided that the action would be tried to a jury. On November 17, 2005, an order was entered setting a pretrial conference for November 28, 2005, before the magistrate judge assigned to the case. The order stated, \u201cAt the pretrial conference, the parties should be prepared to state whether they will consent to a jury trial before the undersigned Magistrate Judge. If any party does not consent, the undersigned Magistrate Judge will preside over a special master trial. Either the jury trial or the special master trial will be scheduled at the pretrial conference.\u201d The minutes from the pretrial conference stated, \u201cPretrial Conference held. Parties to inform Court by close of business on December 2, 2005 of decision to proceed before the Magistrate Judge with a jury trial or decision to proceed with special master trial.\u201d On December 5, 2005, the magistrate judge entered an order scheduling the action for a special master trial on February 27, 2006. No order appears in the record appointing a special master or specifying the duties and authority of the special master.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">At the special master hearing, the magistrate judge heard testimony from Evans, Summers, Boyd, and Simmons. At the outset of the hearing, the magistrate judge explained that it would prepare a special master report for possible use at a later jury trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>I just want to make sure that everyone understands I don\u2019t make an ultimate decision about the case. It doesn\u2019t matter. I may be able to give the parties counseling or guidance at the conclusion of the hearing. All I\u2019ll be doing is a special master report. A trial will result regardless of what I make \u2014 I\u2019m not even really making a recommendation to the district judge. I want to make sure everyone understands that although it is very, very important that all the evidence that you wish to be considered by a jury I hear because Judge Moye will have the report. It may be read to the jury in fact. So it\u2019s very important that we do this. I\u2019m not saying that this is a good procedure. It\u2019s a procedure that we all have to abide by in this district. So just make sure everyone understands that there\u2019s really not a directed verdict or an ultimate resolution of the case at the end of this proceeding; however, it may assist the parties in deciding how and if they wish to proceed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">At the end of the proceeding, the magistrate judge repeated, \u201cAs I indicated it\u2019s not binding, although I would expect you will hear from Judge Moye once he gets this, if you haven\u2019t resolved the case by then before he conducts a jury trial. Judges do many things with the special master report from reading them to the jury to they never see the light of day again, or they use them to consult with the parties about mediation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Although Evans filed her complaint <em>pro se, </em>Evans was represented by counsel at the pretrial conference and the special master hearing. Counsel for Evans withdrew after the special master hearing. Afterward, Evans proceeded <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">After her counsel withdrew, Evans attempted to assign her action to Leonard Smith Sr. Boyd opposed the assignment, and the district court determined that the claim was not assignable and declared the assignment void.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">On June 9, 2006, a special master report was filed by the magistrate j\u00fcdge. The report entered findings of fact and conclusions of law. The special master found Evans\u2019s testimony incredible and recommended that judgment be entered against Evans and in favor of Boyd on Evans\u2019s employment discrimination complaint. Evans filed a response to the special master report and argued, among other things, that any credibility determinations should be made by the jury. Over Evans\u2019s objection, the district court entered an order adopting the findings of fact and entered judgment against Evans. The district court expressly found Evans\u2019s testimony to be incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">We review a denial of discovery order for abuse of discretion. <em>Moorman v. UnumProvident Corp., </em>464 F.3d 1260, 1264 (11th Cir.2006). We review the denial of a motion to amend a complaint for an abuse of discretion. <em>Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co., </em>341 F.3d 1292, 1300 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cHowever, when the district court denies the plaintiff leave to amend due to futility, we review the denial <em>de novo </em>because it is concluding that as a matter of law an amended complaint \u2018would necessarily fail.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freeman v. First Union Nat\u2019l., </em>329 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and apply the same legal standards as the district court. <em>Waddell v. Valley Forge Dental Assoc., Inc., </em>276 F.3d 1275, 1279 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">\u201cWe review the denial of a jury trial with the most exacting scrutiny.\u201d <em>Bums v. Lawther, </em>53 F.3d 1237,1240 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Cir.1995). \u201c \u2018[A]s the right of jury trial is fundamental, [we must] indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver.\u2019 \u201d <em>LaMarca v. Turner, </em>995 F.2d 1526, 1544 (11th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>Aetna Ins. Co. v. Kennedy, </em>301 U.S. 389, 393, 57 S.Ct. 809, 811-12, 81 L.Ed. 1177 (1937)).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Whether an assignment is valid is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. See Craven v. United States, </em>215 F.3d 1201,1204 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\n<em>A. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion When It Refused to Extend Discovery and Denied Evans\u2019s Motion to Amend Her Complaint.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Evans contends that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to extend discovery and denied her motion to amend her complaint, but we disagree. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the request to extend discovery, which was made the day before the end of the discovery period with no explanation for the delay. The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it denied Evans\u2019s motion to amend her complaint. The district court correctly concluded that the proposed First Amendment claims would be futile because Boyd is not a state actor.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">\n<em>B. The District Court Did Not Err When It Entered Summary Judgment Against Evans\u2019s Complaint of Retaliation.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Evans argues that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment against Evans\u2019s claim of retaliation under Title VII. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, based on circumstantial evidence, a plaintiff must present evidence of (1) participation in statutorily protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>Brown v. Snow, </em>440 F.3d 1259, 1266 (11th Cir.2006). Because Evans\u2019s complaint to the EEOC occurred a month after her termination and Evans failed to produce admissible evidence that Boyd adversely affected the terms or conditions of her employment after her termination, Evans did not establish a prima facie case of retaliation. The district court correctly entered summary judgment in favor of Boyd and against Evans\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">\n<em>C. The District Court Erred When It Entered Judgment In Favor of Boyd on Evans\u2019s Claim of Religious Discrimination.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">Evans argues that, by adopting the recommendation and report of the special master, the district court erroneously denied Evans\u2019s right to a trial by jury. We agree. A party seeking compensatory or punitive damages under Title VTI for intentional discrimination is entitled to demand a trial by jury. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(c). Although a district court may appoint a special master in a Title VII employment discrimination case when a case has not been scheduled for trial within 120 days, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(5), reference to the special master \u201cis subject to the parties\u2019 right to a jury trial.\u201d 9 James Wm. Moore et al, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>1153.14 (3d ed.2007). Evans made a timely demand for a jury in her complaint. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 39(a) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-14\">When trial by jury has been demanded as provided in Rule 38, the action shall be designated upon the docket as a jury action. The trial of all issues so demanded shall be by jury, unless (1) the parties or their attorneys of record, by written stipulation filed with the court or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>by an oral stipulation made in open court and entered in the record, consent to trial by the court sitting -without a jury....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">On the record before us, Evans did not consent to a non-jury trial of her complaint. No written consent to a bench trial was filed. Evans\u2019s actions do not imply consent. Although Evans participated in the special master proceeding without objection, she and the other participants were instructed by the magistrate judge that \u201ca trial will result regardless\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s really not ... an ultimate resolution of the case at the end of this proceeding.\u201d We cannot imply consent from Evans\u2019s participation in the special master hearing, and in the light of Evans\u2019s demand for a jury trial we are at a loss to understand the purpose of that hearing. <em>C.f Haynes v. W.C. Caye &amp; Co., 52 </em>F.3d 928 (11th Cir.1995) (where a party demanded a jury trial but then proceeded to sign a document providing for a trial by a magistrate judge and participated in the bench trial without objection, she was deemed to have waived her right to a trial by jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Because Evans did not waive her right to a trial by jury, the district court erred when it made credibility determinations and entered judgment against Evans\u2019s complaint of employment discrimination. We reverse the judgment entered against Evans\u2019s complaint and remand to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\n<em>D. The District Court Did Not Err When It Refused To Allow The Assignment of Evans\u2019s Complaint.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Evans argues that the district court erred when it concluded that the assignment of her employment discrimination claim to Smith was invalid. Whether an individual can assign her pre-judgment rights under Title VII is an issue of first impression for this circuit and we could find no other reported decision that has addressed this issue. The novelty of this issue is what law governs its resolution, but we leave that issue to be decided another day. Because a cause of action for discrimination in violation of Title VII is not assignable under either Georgia or federal law, we need not decide which law applies. <em>See Kilgo v. Bowman Transp., Inc., </em>789 F.2d 859, 875-76 (11th Cir.1986) (Where action arising under Title VII survived under both federal and state law, we declined to decide the law that governs the survival of an action under Title VII).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">As the district court concluded, both Georgia and federal law provide the same rule regarding the assignment of claims for personal injuries. Under Georgia law, \u201ca right of action for personal torts ... may not be assigned.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-12-24 and under federal common law, \u201cpersonal injury claims are not assignable absent a statute to the contrary.\u201d <em>See Casino Cruises Inv. Co., L.C. v. Ravens Mfg. Co., </em>60 F.Supp.2d 1285, 1287 (M.D.Fla.1999). The remedial scope of Title VII, which encompasses backpay, front pay, emotional pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and punitive damages, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981a(a)(1), (b), and 2000e-5(g), makes it more similar to a personal injury tort action than an action to enforce contractual or property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Although the Supreme Court, in <em>United States v. Burke, </em>held that awards received in settlement of Title VII actions were \u201cnot excludable from gross income as \u2018damages received ... on account of personal injuries,\u2019 \u201d it explicated that its decision applied to awards for claims brought under Title VII before the effective date of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which expanded the remedies available for a Title VII claim. 504 U.S. 229, 238-241 n. 8, 112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>S.Ct. 1867, 1872-1874 n. 8, 119 L.Ed.2d 34, (1992). The Supreme Court stated that \u201cCongress\u2019 decision to permit jury trials and compensatory and punitive damages under the amended Act signals a marked change in its conception of the injury redressable by Title VII.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241 n. 12, 112 S.Ct. at 1874 n. 12. Because we conclude that actions arising under Title VTI are not assignable, the district court did not err in declaring the assignment void.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED and REMANDED, in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
