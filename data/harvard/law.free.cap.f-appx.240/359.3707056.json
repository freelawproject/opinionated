Stallings argues that his below-Guidelines sentence was unreasonable because he received a \u201cpatently excessive and unfair\u201d career offender enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a), which was based on \u201cstale and remote\u201d predicate offenses and produced an unreasonable sentencing disparity between Stallings and his more culpable codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">We apply the deferential standard of reasonableness to the final sentence, in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.2006). However, the district court need not explicitly state on the record that it has considered each factor and need not discuss each factor. <em>Id. </em>An acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>Id.; see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (noting that the \u201csentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision making authority\u201d). In determining if the district court has adequately considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we look to the district court\u2019s statements over the entire sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir.2006). The burden of proving that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and these factors rests on the challenger. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-16\">In this case, the district court considered Stallings\u2019 arguments at sentencing, stated that it had considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and imposed sentences below both the statutory maximum and the advisory Guidelines range. Stallings\u2019 suggestion that the sentencing disparity between him and his co-defendants renders the district court\u2019s sentence unreasonable is insufficient to show unreasonableness because Stallings had a different criminal history than his co-defendants. The differences between his and his co-defendants\u2019 criminal histories accounted for their different sentences as contemplated by both the purposes of sentencing embod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ied in the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the Guidelines calculation itself. Thus, Stallings has failed to meet his burden of establishing that his sentences are unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm both of Stallings\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
