He argues first that his criminal history score was miscalculated because he should have received zero, instead of one, criminal history point(s) for his prior state conviction for evading a peace officer and that he should have received only four, instead of six points, for his two state probation revocation sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">We disagree with Gonzalez-Barreiro\u2019s assertion that he adequately preserved his objection to the criminal history point assessed for his state conviction for evading a peace officer. The only mention of that conviction before the district court was in the context of Gonzalez-Barreiro\u2019s written request for a downward departure wherein he referenced the \u201ctechnical!]\u201d error of assessing a point for that conviction as a basis for a downward departure. Moreover, when the district court asked Gonzalez-Barreiro what objections needed a ruling from the court, Gonzalez-Barreiro made no mention of his conviction for evading a peace officer. <em>Cf United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 589 (5th Cir.2000). With respect to his criminal history, Gonzalez-Barreiro stated only that he requested a downward departure because he believed it was over-represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-15\">!2] Accordingly, we review all of Gonzalez-Barreiro\u2019s challenges to his criminal history score for plain error. Assuming the assignment of the three criminal history points was error that was plain, Gonzalez-Barreiro cannot show that such error affected his substantial rights. Although Gonzalez-Barreiro argues that, because the district court sentenced him to the bottom of the erroneously calculated guidelines range, the district court would also have sentenced him to the bottom of the correctly calculated guidelines range, a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range does not alone establish that the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 909, 126 S.Ct. 264, 163 L.Ed.2d 238 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-16\">\u00cd3] Gonzalez-Barreiro contends that the presumption of reasonableness this court accords sentences imposed within the advisory guidelines range erroneously constrains the district court\u2019s discretion. This argument is now foreclosed by <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456,168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), which upheld this court\u2019s <em>post-Booker </em>methodology articulated in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-19\">Finally, Gonzalez-Barreiro challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Gonzalez-Barreiro\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Accordingly, Gonzalez-Barreiro\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b673-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
