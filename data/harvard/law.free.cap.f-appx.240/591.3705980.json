Newkirk appeals, challenging the validity of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-19\">Newkirk argues that his sentence was unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007). In sentencing a defendant after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court must calculate the advisory guideline range and then consider whether that range \u201cserves the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.A.] \u00a7 3553(a) and, if not, select a sentence that does serve those factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). This court reviews a post <em>-Booker </em>sentence \u201cto determine whether the sentence is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). \u201c[A] defendant can only rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Here, the district court sentenced Newkirk <em>post-Booker </em>and appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory. The record shows that the court considered Newkirk\u2019s claim that his criminal history category overstated the seriousness of his past conduct because it asked the probation officer what Newkirk\u2019s guideline range would be with lower criminal history categories. Newkirk\u2019s fifty-one-month prison term is the bottom of the guideline range and is below the statutory maximum ten-year sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). We find that Newkirk has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded to sentences within the properly calculated guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Next, Newkirk argues that he is entitled to be resentenced because the district court failed to comply with 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007), which requires sentencing courts to \u201cstate in open court the reasons for [their] imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Newkirk did not raise this objection in the district court, we review his claim for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">It is undisputed that the court did not state the reasons for the sentence in open court. However, because we find that Newkirk has not shown that this error affected his substantial rights, we conclude that the district court\u2019s omission did not amount to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Newkirk\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
