Haddad\u2019s original complaint asserted state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty, specific performance, constructive trust, and joint venture accounting. The district court purportedly had subject matter jurisdiction based upon diversity of citizenship. RAV Bahamas and Capo moved to dismiss on the grounds that RAV Bahamas was a foreign corporation and Haddad was a foreign individual and, thus, there was no diversity. Haddad filed an amended complaint, in which he added a purported federal securities fraud claim, invoking the district court\u2019s federal question jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-24\">RAV Bahamas and Capo again moved to dismiss the Complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), arguing that the Complaint failed to allege a transaction in securities. After oral argument, the district court held that Haddad failed to state a claim for securities fraud, and therefore failed to raise a federal question. The court granted RAV Bahamas and Capo\u2019s 12(b)(6) motion, dismissed Haddad\u2019s securities fraud claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>declined jurisdiction over the pendant claims, and closed the case. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">We review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo, </em>upholding the lower court\u2019s decision \u201conly if it appears beyond doubt that the allegations in the complaint, when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, do not state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d <em>Theoharous v. Fong, </em>256 F.3d 1219, 1224 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The district court relied heavily on the fourth circuit decision in <em>Robinson v. Glynn, </em>349 F.3d 166 (4th Cir.2003), to hold that Haddad\u2019s interests in companies which would be created in the future did not convert his investment into a security. <em>Robinson </em>and this case, however, are not alike. In <em>Robinson, </em>the interest that the plaintiff was to receive was \u201cneither denominated stock by the parties, nor did it possess all the usual characteristics of stock.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173. That is not the case here, as the agreement between the parties refers to a \u201cShareholders Agreement,\u201d discusses \u201csecurities,\u201d and calls the holders of these securities \u201cstockholders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The definition of \u201csecurity\u201d in federal securities laws is quite broad. <em>Landreth Timber Co. v. Landreth, </em>471 U.S. 681, 685, 105 S.Ct. 2297, 2301, 85 L.Ed.2d 692 (1985). Given this broad definition and the fact that we must take all of the complaint\u2019s factual allegations as true and draw all inferences in Haddad\u2019s favor, we find that it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that Haddad did not state a claim that implicated federal securities laws. In' short, it does not appear \u201cbeyond doubt that the allegations in the complaint, when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, do not state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-7\">. In reversing and remanding, we hold only that Haddad\u2019s complaint should have survived Capo and RAV Bahama's 12(b)(6) motion. Beyond that, we make no judgment and offer no opinion on the merits of Haddad\u2019s claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
