R. BankR.P. 8009.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying reconsideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-24\">During the course of Peque\u00f1o\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the bankruptcy court entered several orders that Peque\u00f1o, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>individually appealed to the district court. Peque\u00f1o, however, failed to file briefs in those appeals as required by the bankruptcy rules, and the district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed each of Peque-\u00f1o\u2019s appeals for want of prosecution. At the time the appeals were dismissed, the briefs were overdue by two to nine months, and the notices of appeal were insufficient to satisfy the briefing requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-25\">Peque\u00f1o filed separate motions for reconsideration of the dismissal orders pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>suant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> asserting generally that he failed to file briefs because he was unaware that there was an active briefing deadline. Peque\u00f1o averred that he assumed the briefing deadline was abated because (1) there were pending motions to dismiss some of the eases at the time briefs were due, (2) status hearings had previously been held in some prior appeals before briefs were due, (3) a then-pending Fifth Circuit appeal might have mooted issues in some of the cases, and (4) this Court allegedly granted a motion to dismiss in a related civil case before appellate briefs were filed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court consolidated the appeals and denied the motions for reconsideration in a single order. At the time the district court denied the motions, which was thirty days after the appeals were initially dismissed, Peque\u00f1o still had not filed any of the outstanding appellate briefs. Peque\u00f1o finally filed a consolidated brief ten days after the motions for reconsideration were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Peque\u00f1o now appeals the order denying his Rule 59(e) motion. The denial of a Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration is reviewed for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Under this standard [of review], the district court\u2019s decision and decision-making process need only be reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The granting of a Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis an extraordinary remedy and should be used sparingly.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This is because a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e) \u201cserve[s] the narrow purpose of allowing a party \u2018to correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-14\">Federal Bankruptcy Rule 8009 requires bankruptcy appellants to file a brief within 15 days of docketing,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the district court may dismiss an appeal for failure to comply with this rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pro se litigants are charged with knowing and following the law and the rules of procedure,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and in this case, the district court determined that Peque\u00f1o had demonstrated knowledge of the brief-filing requirement based on his conduct in sixteen prior bankruptcy appeals in the two years preceding dismissal of the subject appeals. In fact, Peque\u00f1o had filed motions for extensions of time to file briefs in four other cases and subsequently timely filed briefs in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-15\">On appeal, Peque\u00f1o does not contend that he was unaware of the brief-filing deadline. Rather, he claims that he reasonably believed that he was not required to file briefs based on the procedural posture of the appeals at the time of dismissal. He asserts that his prior bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ruptcy cases did not prepare him to handle these particular appeals, which he perceived to be more complex, and argues that he should be excused from failing to comply with the briefing deadlines because he did not understand how the procedural rules applied to these particular appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">However, Peque\u00f1o does not assert that the district court actually abated the filing deadline or stated an intent to do so. Nor does he argue that he requested or was granted a stay or abatement order from this Court while his related appeal was pending. He also has not argued or submitted evidence that he requested a status conference. Peque\u00f1o\u2019s alleged misperception about his filing requirements was both unwarranted and unsubstantiated. Furthermore, even after dismissal, Peque\u00f1o failed to achieve compliance with the rules either before seeking reconsideration of the dismissal orders or at any time during the considerable period of time between dismissal and denial of his motion to reconsider. Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Peque\u00f1o\u2019s Rule 59(e) motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">Peque\u00f1o also argues for the first time on appeal that the original dismissal orders were issued without notice and an opportunity to cure. Other than citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 41, which is silent regarding notice prior to a <em>sua sponte </em>involuntary dismissal,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Peque\u00f1o provides no authority to support his argument that he was entitled to pre-dismissal notice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Peque\u00f1o\u2019s notice argument is therefore waived.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1029-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
