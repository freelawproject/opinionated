Battle alleged that he was beaten by Georgia prison guards while incarcerated at Macon State Prison. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to exhaust a claim under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997(e) <em>de novo. Brown v. Sikes, </em>212 F.3d 1205, 1207 (11th Cir.2000). Battle did not exhaust his claims by pursuing all administrative remedies before filing his lawsuit as required by PLRA. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). He only made an informal grievance and did not pursue the avenues available for an appeal under the Georgia prison procedures. The exhaustion requirement is mandatory, and therefore Battle\u2019s suit was properly dismissed by the district court. <em>See Alexander v. Hawk, </em>159 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
