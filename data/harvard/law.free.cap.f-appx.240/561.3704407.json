We affirmed Griffin\u2019s conviction but vacated his sentence and remanded for re-sentencing consistent with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Griffin, </em>175 Fed.Appx. 627 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">On remand, the district court conducted a re-sentencing hearing and determined that Griffin\u2019s total offense level remained at 32; with a criminal history category V, the resulting guideline range remained at 188 to 235 months on count one, five years to life on count two (consecutive), and 120 months on count three. The district court imposed a 186-month sentence as to count one, a consecutive 60-month sentence as to count two, and a concurrent 120-month sentence on count three, totaling 246 months.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> He noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Griffin argues on appeal that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable because the court did not adequately consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006), and because the court treated the advisory guidelines as if they were mandatory. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In a <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing, the district court must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a sentence. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). The district court\u2019s sentence is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). This court has held that \u201ca sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">We find that, in resentencing Griffin, the district court complied with the decisions in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes. </em>The court heard argument from both parties regarding an appropriate sentence. The court stated that it had \u201ccalculated the imprisonment range prescribed by the advisory sentencing guidelines .... and considered that range as well as other relevant factors set forth in the advisory sentencing guidelines and those set forth in [\u00a7 3553(a) ]\u201d. The court also stated that it had imposed a \u201csentence at the bottom of the range because all aggravating factors have been taken into consideration in determining the advisory guideline imprisonment range and because of the mandatory consecutive sentence required in count two.\u201d And, after hearing argument regarding Griffin\u2019s inability to pay the previously imposed $12,200 fine, the court struck the fine from the judgment. Contrary to Griffin\u2019s argument, the district court explicitly stated that it considered the guidelines as advisory. Although the district court did not recite facts to support each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, the court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>We therefore conclude that Griffin\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\"> The court departed slightly below the guidelines range, by two months, to account for time served in state custody. <em>See U.S. Sen-tenting Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5G1.3, comment. (n. 4), 5K2.23 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
