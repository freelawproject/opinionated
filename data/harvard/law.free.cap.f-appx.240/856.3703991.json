Cesar was convicted of assault, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.011. The BIA found that the victim of this assault was Cesar\u2019s niece, who was residing with him at the time of the offense, and that the niece was a person protected by the domestic violence laws of Florida, pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 741.28(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-19\">Cesar argues that, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), a conviction is not for a \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d as intended by the statute, unless the offense of conviction specifically penalizes violence against a family member. Therefore, Cesar asserts, the immigration judge could not merely rely on a police report to determine whether his assault conviction was for a \u201ccrime of domestic violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-20\">As an initial matter, we note that, as the parties agree, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C)-(D) does not limit our jurisdiction to consider Cesar\u2019s petition because he presents only an issue of statutory interpretation, which is a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-21\">We review the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo, </em>applying the two-step test articulated in <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694. <em>See Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number><em>Gen., </em>445 F.3d 1311, 1319 (11th Cir.2006). Where, as here, the BIA has issued its own opinion, we exclusively review that decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">An alien is removable if he commits a \u201ccrime of domestic violence.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)\u00ae. A \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d is a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, that is committed against a variety of particular victims, including \u201cany other individual person who is protected from [the alien\u2019s] acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the United States or any State....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Florida law protects \u201cpersons who are presently residing together as if a family or who have resided together in the past as if a family\u201d from domestic violence. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 741.28(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Under the limitations of <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), a court determining the nature of a conviction may look at only statutory elements, charging documents, jury instructions, written plea agreement, plea colloquy transcript, and any explicit factual findings of the trial court to which the defendant assented or otherwise adopted. <em>Obasohanv. United States Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>479 F.3d 785, 788-89 (llth Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Neither Cesar nor the government contests the BIA\u2019s rulings that (1) the determination of whether a conviction is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)\u00ae is limited to <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Shepard </em>materials; or (2) Cesar\u2019s conviction for assault under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.011 was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">Cesar does, however, contest the BIA\u2019s ruling that the determination of whether a particular crime of violence was a crime of <em>domestic </em>violence is not limited by the evidentiary requirements established in <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Shepard. </em>This is an issue of first impression in this circuit. Other circuits reaching this issue have split on the result. <em>Compare Flores v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 666, 668-71 (7th Cir.2003) (agreeing with the BIA\u2019s interpretation) <em>with Tokatly v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 613, 619-24 (9th Cir.2004) (disagreeing with the BIA\u2019s interpretation).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that we need not reach the question of statutory interpretation because Cesar admitted to the facts necessary to show that the victim of his assault conviction was a person protected under the domestic violence laws of the state of Florida. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832-34 (llth Cir.2006) (holding that, under the evidentiary strictures of <em>Shepard, </em>where a defendant admitted \u2014 by not objecting to the Presentence Investigation Report and by statements at his sentencing hearing \u2014 that his robbery convictions were for residential robberies, the sentencing court could rely on these admissions in determining whether the robberies were violent felonies). Here, Cesar admitted that (1) his victim was his niece; (2) she resided with him at the time; (3) he had legal custody of her; and (4) he treated her as if she was his own daughter. Therefore, she was a person protected by the domestic violence laws of the state of Florida. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 741.28(3). As such, the BIA\u2019s determination that Cesar\u2019s conviction was for a crime of domestic violence is fully supported, even if we only consider <em>Taylor/Shepard </em>materials. <em>See Bennett, </em>472 F.3d at 832-34. Accordingly, we deny Cesar\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
