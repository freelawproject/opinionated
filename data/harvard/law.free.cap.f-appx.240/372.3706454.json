The court also ordered Mantra to pay a fine of $1.6 million, an amount negotiated as part of Mantra\u2019s plea agreement with the Government. As one of the special conditions of Mantra\u2019s probation, the court ordered its CEO, Joseph R. Francis, to perform community service \u201cfor a total term of 30 consecutive months ... in the Panama City Division of the Northern District of Florida,\u201d the location in which the targeted footage was recorded. Francis filed this appeal to challenge the portion of Mantra\u2019s sentence that requires him to perform community service. The propriety of that portion of Mantra\u2019s sentence is the only issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Francis argues that because he was never personally named as a defendant in this case the district court violated his due process rights when it ordered him to travel to Florida to perform community service on behalf of the named defendant: Mantra, the corporation over which he exercises nearly complete control. The Government points out that Francis, who appeared in person before the district judge at Mantra\u2019s sentencing hearing and was given an opportunity to object to the sentence imposed by the court, made no objection to the community-service provision (or any other aspect of Mantra\u2019s sentence). Because Francis did not object below, the Government argues that we should review the district court\u2019s sentencing determination for plain error only. We agree. Finding no plain error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court explained to Mantra\u2019s lawyer, to Francis (who personally appeared on behalf of Mantra upon the district court\u2019s order), and to the AUSA that the following \u201cspecial condition[ ]\u201d would attach to Mantra\u2019s sentence of probation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-14\">THE COURT: Mantra Films, Incorporated, shall cause its chief executive officer [Francis] ... to perform, on Mantra\u2019s behalf ... community service ... each month, at the direction of the United States probation officer, for a total term of 30 consecutive months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-15\">Now let me explain the purpose of this. At the time of these offenses, it is clear that Mr. Francis exercised total control [over Mantra], and he set the tone. And I think it\u2019s appropriate that he perform this service on behalf of the corporation.... Now this community service shall be performed in the Panama City Division of the Northern District of Florida. It makes no sense for this service to be performed in California. The offenses occurred in this community and these offenses have had a profound effect on this community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-16\">After reiterating the terms of Mantra\u2019s sentence, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae8\">THE COURT: Again, Mr. Dyer,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are there any objections to either my ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>mate findings of fact or conclusions of law about this sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">MR. DYER: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">THE COURT: Counsel, are there any objections to the manner in which I pronounced sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">MS. MORROW:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">MR. DYER: Your Honor, can I have just a minute to confer with my clients?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">(Defendants and counsel conferring.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGp\">MR. DYER: Your Honor, we\u2019re ready to proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">THE COURT: Again, are there any objections to the manner in which I have pronounced sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">MR. DYER: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">THE COURT: Okay. Does anybody have any questions? Does anybody have anything further to bring up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFZ\">MR. DYER: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">It is clear from a review of the sentencing transcript that no objection was made to district court\u2019s imposition of community service. Plain-error review is appropriate where an issue could have been, but was not, raised in the district court and is instead raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Humphrey, </em>164 F.Bd 585, 587 (11th Cir.1999); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). \u201cNo procedural principle is more familiar ... than that a constitutional right, or a right of any other sort, may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-18\">\u201cFour requirements must be met before we can reverse a district court for plain error.... First, there must be an error. Second, the error must be plain. Third, the error must affect substantial rights of the defendant. Fourth the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d at 588 and n. 3. We will assume for the sake of argument that Francis has identified an error committed by the district court. His failure to establish the second requirement is fatal to his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-19\">\u201cA plain error is an error that is \u2018obvious\u2019 and is \u2018clear under current law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588. The \u201cclear under current law\u201d requirement means that \u201cat least where the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-20\">Francis\u2019s argument is this: a corporate officer\u2019s due process rights are violated when a district court requires the corporate officer (as an unnamed defendant in a criminal case) to perform community service on behalf of the officer\u2019s corporation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (the named defendant) as a condition of the corporation\u2019s sentence of probation. This argument is not clearly resolved by \u201cthe explicit language of a statute or rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And it is not clearly resolved by the language of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \u2014 the constitutional pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>vision upon which Francis relies. Thus, the alleged error committed by the district court can be \u201cplain\u201d only if \u201ca precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolv[es] it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Francis has not cited any case from the Supreme Court or from this Court specifically addressing the argument he presents in this appeal. So even assuming the district court committed an error in requiring Francis to perform community service as a condition of Mantra\u2019s sentence of probation \u2014 a proposition we do not address\u2014 any such error was not \u201cplain\u201d because it was not \u201cclear under existing law.\u201d <em>Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d at 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\">.
