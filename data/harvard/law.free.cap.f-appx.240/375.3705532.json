On appeal, Martinez-Quintero contends that the BIA erred in concluding that she failed to demonstrate her eligibility for asylum under section 208 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision, we DENY Martinez-Quintero\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b398-16\">Martinez-Quintero, a native and citizen of Colombia, was admitted to the United States on 23 October 2000, as a non-immigrant B-2 visitor with authorization to remain in the United States until 22 April 2001. Following expiration of her visa, in May of 2001 Martinez-Quintero filed an application with the former INS, seeking asylum and withholding of removal under the INA and relief under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-17\">Martinez-Quintero\u2019s application indicated that she was seeking asylum because she had suffered persecution by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) on account of her political opinion. Her application stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-18\">I am seeking asylum in the United States due to the fact that I fear I may be killed. My common law husband,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>whom I\u2019ve lived with since 1996, has been threaten[ed] along with his whole family. His sisters were brutally murdered by the F.A.R.C. guerillas. Due to the fact that he was actively involved with the police in the investigation of his sister\u2019s murder, his life was in constant danger as well as min[e] since I was known in our community as his wife, he was constantly being threaten[ed] and we received many threatening calls at our residence in which the callers would identify themselves as members of the F.A.R.C. guerillas. We are terrified for our lives, the guerillas usually take ou[t] their vengeance on those that are close to their target and kill them. My life is in just as much danger as my husband due to all the threats and the persecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">AR at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In March 2002 the former INS served Martinez-Quintero with a Notice to Appear, charging that she was removable pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), for remaining in the United States for a longer time than permitted. The IJ held a hearing on both Martinez-Quintero\u2019s and Clavijo\u2019s applications on 14 July 2005. At the hearing, Martinez-Quintero conceded removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Martinez-Quintero\u2019s testimony at the hearing was consistent with her asylum application, and the IJ found her testimony to be credible. She stated that, prior to coming to the United States, she had lived in Colombia with her \u201ccompanion,\u201d Clavijo. AR at 90. She testified that she and Clavijo had both belonged to the Liberal Party in Colombia, although she had not been an \u201cactive\u201d member in the Party. <em>Id. </em>at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Martinez-Quintero testified that Clavijo\u2019s three sisters had been killed in 1998 because they had received a large monetary inheritance and had refused to pay money to FARC guerillas operating in the area. She explained that such extortionary practices are frequently employed by FARC operatives, stating that \u201cthe people who have some wealth, who have some money, the [FARC] guerillas look for them because, well, the guerillas live from that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Martinez-Quintero testified that, after the murder of Clavijo\u2019s sisters, Clavijo had \u201cwork[ed] to find out who th[e]se people were\u201d who committed the killings, and, because he had assisted with the government\u2019s investigation, FARC operatives had \u201c[begun] to threaten him and ... call him at home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She also stated that FARC operatives had \u201c[begun] to persecute [her] because [she] was his wife.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94. In addition to threats to Clavijo and herself, Martinez-Quintero testified that her daughter had been threatened. She testified that she was fearful of returning to Colombia, because some of the individuals who had been suspected of committing the murders remained free in Colombia, and, therefore, Clavijo and his family remained in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">In response, the government argued that Martinez-Quintero\u2019s case had no \u201cnexus\u201d to any of the five statutorily enumerated grounds for establishing eligibility for asylum. Specifically, the government contended that \u201ceven though it\u2019s very sad [that] the three sisters ... were assassinated,\u201d and even though the threats from FARC were \u201cdirectly linked to her common-law husband\u2019s attempt to investigate who or why the sisters were killed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 100-101, Martinez-Quintero had not shown that the persecution she and Clavijo had suffered in Colombia was \u201con account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The IJ rendered an oral decision, denying Martinez-Quintero\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. The IJ found Martinez-Quintero\u2019s testimony to be credible, but found that her claimed persecution at the hands of FARC had not been on account of a statutorily protected ground. Put simply, the IJ stated that there was \u201cno evidence that the FARC guerilla members were interested in the respondent or the common-law husband because of his political opinion or membership in a particular social group, or any of the other grounds.\u201d AR at 60. Rather, the IJ found that the threats at the hands of FARC had occurred because Clavijo had attempted to find out who killed his sisters. While the IJ indicated that Martinez-Quintero\u2019s case was unfortunate, the IJ stated that she had \u201cfailed to establish a basis for asylum in the sense that there was no nexus between anything that happened to the common-law husband\u2019s sisters or family [and] any of the protected grounds, and also the threats that she received were not linked to any protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60-61.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Martinez-Quintero appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA in September 2005. In her appeal, she argued that the IJ had erred in denying her application for asylum, because the evidence showed that she had established persecution, both on account of her political opinion and her membership in a social group. As to the former, Martinez-Quintero defined her political opinion as being a general disagreement with the FARC guerillas. As to the latter, she argued that she had established that she was a member of a particular social group \u2014 which she defined as being those groups of the population who opposed the FARC and refused to collaborate with them \u2014 and, accordingly, that the IJ had erred in finding that there was no nexus between her persecution and a statutorily protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, without further opinion. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">\u201cThe appropriate standard of review is well-settled.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. Office of U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.Sd 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). We review legal issues <em>de novo, Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted), and \u201cadministrative fact findings under the highly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc) </em>(citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). Under that standard, we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (citation and internal quotations omitted). \u201cTo reverse a factual finding by the BIA, this Court must find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that it compels one.\u201d <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ted). Indeed, \u201cthe mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1027 (citation omitted). Instead, we will reverse a BIA\u2019s denial of asylum <em>\u201conly </em>if the evidence presented by the applicant is so powerful that a reasonable fact finder would <em>have </em>to conclude\u201d otherwise. <em>Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1323-24 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In reviewing the record on appeal, \u201c[w]e review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (citation omitted). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In Martinez-Quintero\u2019s case, the BIA expressly adopted the reasoning of the IJ\u2019s decision, without further comment. Therefore, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">B. <em>Martinez-Quintero\u2019s Eligibility For Asylum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Section 208 of the INA provides that \u201c[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United States ... irrespective of such alien\u2019s status, may apply for asylum.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General, in his discretion, may grant asylum to an alien if he \u201cdetermines that such alien is a refugee within the meaning of section 101(a)(42)(A) [of the INA].\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined in section 101 as one</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). To prove refugee status, \u201cthe alien must establish a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that his or her [statutorily listed ground] will cause harm or suffering that rises to the level of \u2018persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004) (citation and quotation omitted). Such a well-founded fear of persecution may be established by showing either: (1) past persecution; or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u2019 of future persecution. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230-31 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">Although the INA does not define \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have indicated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231 (quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted). \u201cNot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000). For example, we have made clear that threatening phone calls constitute mere harassment and intimidation, and that they fail to rise to the level of persecution. <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (stating that \u201cmenacing telephone calls and threats ... do not rise to the level of past persecution that would compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s decision\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">In this case, following the police investigation of the murder of Clavijo\u2019s sisters, Martinez-Quintero and Clavijo received \u201cmany threatening calls at [their] residence\u201d from people identifying themselves as FARC operatives. AR at 144; <em>see also id. </em>at 95 (stating that FARC operatives \u201cbegan to call [] at home\u201d). Martinez-Quintero\u2019s application and testimony do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>not mention any physical encounters with FARC guerillas; rather, her asylum application is limited to the threatening phone calls that she received prior to fleeing Colombia. Such evidence, standing alone, is insufficient to rise to the level of \u201cpersecution\u201d as our case law has construed that term. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231; <em>see also Bello Clavijo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx. -, 2007 WL 2302316 (11th Cir. Aug.13, 2007) <em>(per curiam) </em>(unpublished) (finding that the threatening phone calls complained of by MartinezQuintero\u2019s companion, Clavijo, failed to rise to the level of past persecution under our case law). Because Martinez-Quintero failed to demonstrate that she suffered \u201cpersecution\u201d under the INA, INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), we discern no error in the decision to deny Martinez-Quintero\u2019s petition for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Moreover, substantial evidence supports the decision to deny Martinez-Quintero\u2019s petition because she failed to establish a nexus between her claimed persecution and a statutorily protected ground. As the IJ noted, in order to be eligible for asylum, the asylum applicant must \u2014 in addition to demonstrating persecution \u2014 establish that such persecution is \u201con account of\u2019 one of the enumerated statutory grounds. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i) (\u201cTo establish that the applicant is a refugee ... the applicant must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant\u201d); <em>Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1323 (stating that the asylum applicant must provide evidence that \u201che was mistreated <em>because </em>o/his political opinion, or one of the other grounds, rather than for some other reason.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Here, the IJ concluded that MartinezQuintero had not established a nexus between her claimed persecution (past or future) and any of the five grounds necessary to establish asylum eligibility. Specifically, the IJ found \u201cno evidence that the FARC guerilla members were interested in the respondent ... because of [her common-law husband\u2019s] political opinion or membership in a particular social group or any of the other grounds specified for a grant of asylum.\u201d AR at 60. On appeal, Martinez-Quintero argues that this conclusion was in error. She contends that the record compels the opposite conclusion\u2014 namely, that she suffered persecution on account of both her political opinion and her membership in a social group. We address each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">1. <em>Political Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Persecution on account of political opinion requires that the claimed persecution be based upon the political opinion of the victim, not that of the persecutor. <em>See Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437-38 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(per </em>curiam) (citation omitted). The applicant must establish that his political opinion \u201cwill cause harm or suffering that rises to the level of \u2018persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818 (citation omitted). In contrast, \u201cEvidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006) <em>(per curiam) </em>(citation omitted); <em>see also Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438 (upholding denial of asylum because there was no \u201cnexus between [the petitioner]^ political opinion and the FARC\u2019s alleged persecution,\u201d but, rather, \u201cthe evidence was consistent with a finding that the FARC harassed [the petitioner] due to her refusal to cooperate with them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Here, the evidence suggests that the FARC threats against Martinez-Quintero and Clavijo were motivated by a desire to thwart the police investigation into the murders of Clavijo\u2019s sisters, rather any actual or imputed political opinion. The record demonstrates that FARC\u2019s threats against Martinez-Quintero were \u201cconsistent with acts of private violence\u201d or \u201cthe petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with the guerillas,\u201d rather than being based on a political opinion that Martinez-Quintero held or that may have been imputed to her. <em>See id. </em>In similar cases, where there was no evidence of a political motive and the record revealed only private, extortion-type threats by FARC guerillas, we have declined to find a nexus between the claimed persecution and a statutorily protected ground. For example, in <em>Rivera v. United States Attorney General, </em>an asylum petitioners\u2019 family members were murdered because they refused to pay a \u201cwar tax\u201d to the FARC. 487 F.3d 815, 818 (11th Cir.2007). After the murders, the petitioners received threats and demands that the war tax be paid. <em>Id. </em>at 819. We concluded that substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s finding that the FARC\u2019s motive for persecuting the petitioners\u2019 family was to raise funds for its guerilla war against the Colombian government, rather than the petitioners\u2019 actual or imputed political opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 822-823.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In Martinez-Quintero\u2019s case, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that she failed to establish a nexus between her claimed persecution and an actual or imputed political opinion. As the IJ observed, the evidence makes clear that the FARC threatened her because her common-law husband was participating in the investigation of his sisters\u2019 murders and refused to cooperate with them by withdrawing from the investigation, not because of any political opinion that she held or that was imputed to her. In fact, Martinez-Quintero acknowledged that she and her common-law husband were not active in the Liberal Party; and she presented no evidence that the threatening telephone calls ever mentioned her political opinion or targeted her because of her political opinion. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 822 (\u201cThe FARC never demanded that [the petitioner] cease any political activities, never accused [the petitioner] of being a government operative, and never demanded that his family cease involvement in the Liberal Party.\u201d); <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438 (upholding denial of asylum because there was \u201cno evidence establishing [the petitioner]^ actual or imputed political opinion, much less any nexus between [the petitioner]^ political opinion and the FARC\u2019s alleged persecution\u201d). Here, the evidence does not compel the conclusion that Martinez-Quintero suffered past persecution, or has a well-founded fear of future persecution, on account of an actual or imputed political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">2. <em>Membership in a Social Group</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Alternatively, Martinez-Quintero argues that she is a member of a \u201cspecial\u201d group, namely, those who have cooperated with the Colombian government\u2019s investigations against the FARC and who \u201coppose\u201d the FARC. AR at 18. Consequently, she claims that her case satisfies the threshold for persecution based upon \u201cmembership in a social group.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (stating that asylum may be granted if the alien can demonstrate \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... membership in a particular social group\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">We have stated that INA\u2019s \u201cparticular social group\u201d category \u201cshould not be a \u2018catch all\u2019 for all persons alleging persecution who do not fit elsewhere.\u201d <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1198 (11th Cir.2006). Rather, we have adhered to the BIA\u2019s interpretation that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>\u201cparticular social group\u201d category \u201crefers to persons who share a common, immutable characteristic,\u201d such as \u201csex, color, or kinship ties, or in some circumstances a shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1193 (citations, alterations, and internal quotations omitted). In assessing whether an asylum petitioner belongs to a particular social group, the BIA has focused on two things: (1) immutability; and (2) social visibility. <em>See id. </em>at 1194 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In this case, Martinez-Quintero seeks to construe her social group as being those who \u201cthe guerillas [have] targeted within the society\u201d for opposing them, including \u201clocal officials, civic leaders, business owners, cattlemen, farmers, and teachers.\u201d AR at 18. Elsewhere, Martinez-Quintero broadly describes her putative social group as being \u201canyone engaged in any kind of activity, especially in collaboration with the government.\u201d Br. of Pet\u2019r at 16. Were we to accept Martinez-Quintero\u2019s broad formulation of her social group as encompassing all of the people who \u201cthe guerillas [have] targeted within the society,\u201d AR at 18, the result would be to create a \u201ccatchall\u201d category \u201cfor all persons alleging persecution who do not fit elsewhere.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Castillo-A\u00f1as, </em>446 F.3d at 1198. This we decline to do. Accordingly, the evidence does not compel the conclusion that she suffered persecution, or has a well-founded fear of persecution, \u201con account of\u2019 her \u201cmembership in a particular social group,\u201d as that term has been construed by the BIA and in our case law. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">In summary, Martinez-Quintero has petitioned this court for review of the BIA\u2019s decision on her asylum application, which adopted, in full, the reasoning of the IJ. Upon review, we find that substantial evidence supports the determination that Martinez-Quintero failed to demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution <em>\u201con account of\u201d </em>a statutorily protected ground. INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). Because the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we affirm the BIA\u2019s decision denying Martinez-Quintero\u2019s application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"ACY\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-11\">. The petitioner is referred to in the BIA\u2019s final decision, and in the caption of this appeal, as \"Martinez Quintero,\u201d without a hyphen. However, a hyphen is included in other documents, including in her petition for review. Accordingly, throughout this opinion we refer to the petitioner as \"Martinez-Quintero.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-12\">. Martinez-Quintero\u2019s petition is limited to the issue of whether she was entitled to asylum under the INA. That is, her petition does not raise a challenge to the denial of withholding of removal or protection under CAT. Therefore, we do not address those claims. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(per curiam) </em>(stating that \"when an appellant fails to offer an argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b398-20\">. Martinez-Quintero\u2019s common-law husband, Santiago Bello Clavijo (\"Clavijo\"), applied for relief separately from Martinez-Quintero. The IJ initially consolidated the two cases, but the cases were later separated at the asylum hearing. Consequently, the IJ rendered a separate decision for each asylum applicant. <em>See Santiago Bello Clavijo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>- Fed.Appx. -, 2007 WL 2302316 (11th Cir. Aug.13, 2007) <em>(per curiam) </em>(unpublished) (addressing Clavijo's petition separately).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b400-5\">. The IJ also concluded that, since Martinez-Quintero had failed to satisfy the lower threshold for establishing eligibility for asylum, she had not satisfied the higher evidentiary threshold for withholding of removal under the INA. Nor, according to the IJ, had Martinez-Quintero demonstrated that it was \u201cmore likely than not that [] she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Accordingly, the IJ concluded that she had failed to establish her eligibility for protection under CAT. As noted previously, neither of these conclusions is before us on appeal, and, therefore, we do not address them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b404-5\">. Moreover, we cannot find that MartinezQuintero\u2019s purported social group shares common, immutable characteristics, other than the shared risk that they will be persecuted in the future by FARC. <em>See </em>AR at 18 (describing the social group as \u201clocal officials, civic leaders, business owners, cattlemen, farmers, and teachers,\u201d as well as other groups that oppose FARC). We have made clear that \u201c[t]he risk of persecution alone does not create a particular social group within the meaning of the INA, as virtually the entire population of Colombia is a potential subject of persecution.\u201d <em>See Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1198 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
