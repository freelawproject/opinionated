On appeal, Troupe challenges only the application of a four-level enhancement under section 2K2.1 of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-16\">Troupe agreed to a statement of facts, which described the events leading to his arrest as follows: On May 12, 2006, members of the Tallahassee Police Department (\u201cTPD\u201d) located a stolen Chevrolet Impala. After a few minutes, a Honda Accord parked next to the Impala, and two men exited the Accord. When TPD officers made their presence known, both men fled on foot. The driver, Troupe, was captured, but the passenger was not. Officers recovered a gun from Troupe\u2019s jacket pocket as well as a cell phone and $181. They also recovered a quarter \u201ccircle\u201d of crack cocaine and several pieces of crack cocaine from the passenger-side floorboard of the Accord and a partially smoked marijuana cigarette from the center console.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-17\">In the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), the probation officer applied a four-level enhancement for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense, as Troupe was found in possession of a firearm in connection with aiding and abetting grand theft of a motor vehicle and possession of cocaine with intent to sell. Troupe objected, arguing that he did not know that the vehicle was stolen and did not possess the cocaine. The probation officer responded that the enhancement was appropriate based upon the proximity of the firearm to the drugs in Troupe\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-18\">At the sentencing hearing, Troupe testified that he received a phone call from his brother because the car his brother was driving, the Impala, had run out of gas. Troupe drove his brother to the gas station to purchase gas, and then they returned to the Impala. Troupe denied knowing that the car was stolen until after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>he was arrested. When they arrived, his brother, who was sitting in the front passenger seat of the Accord, exited the vehicle first. Troupe popped the trunk to get the gas and noticed a pistol in the front passenger seat. He intended to give the gun back to his brother because he knew that he was not supposed to be around a gun. When his brother exited the car, Troupe did not see the crack cocaine. However, he admitted that he saw the crack cocaine in his brother\u2019s lap when they were returning from the gas station. Troupe initially stated that he had no idea whether his brother was possessing it with intent to sell, and he denied any involvement with the sale of crack cocaine. On cross-examination, Troupe admitted that, in the 1990\u2019s, he had four cocaine-related convictions, which generally involved his attempt to sell cocaine or crack cocaine. Troupe also admitted that: (1) he sold cocaine after 2000; (2) he occasionally obtained cocaine from his brother; (3) he knew that his brother was selling drugs; and (4) it was not a \u201cbig surprise\u201d to see the cocaine in his brother\u2019s lap. Troupe further admitted that he had heard that, in the past, his brother had rental cars that were not returned. He also stated that he assumed that his brother would sell the drugs and that his brother was not a user of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The district court overruled Troupe\u2019s objection to the four-level increase, finding that the enhancement should be applied \u201cin accordance with ... the treatment in the [PSI].\u201d The court rejected Troupe\u2019s testimony that he did not know about the gun until after his brother exited the car. Instead, the court found that, based on the greater weight of the evidence, it was more likely Troupe\u2019s gun. The court next found that the gun was not possessed in connection with the theft of the vehicle, rejecting Troupe\u2019s testimony that he was going to return the gun to his brother. Stating that the connection to the drugs was a close issue, the court found that it was more likely that Troupe\u2019s brother possessed the drugs and brought them into Troupe\u2019s vehicle for the trip to the gas station. The court rejected Troupe\u2019s testimony that he had no reason to know that his brother was engaged in drug sales until he saw the drugs in the vehicle, finding that Troupe had greater knowledge of his brother\u2019s activities and probably knew, when leaving the house to get gas, that drug activities were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The district court recognized that, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, an enhancement for possessing a firearm is applied if the weapon was present at the scene of the drug offense unless it was clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense. Noting that guidance from this Court would be helpful as to whether or not the \u00a7 2D1.1 standard was the same as the standard for possession of a firearm in connection with a felony offense under \u00a7 2K2.1, the court stated that this Court appears to equate the two standards. However, the court explained that, even if the clearly improbable standard did not apply, it would reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">On appeal, Troupe argues that the district court erroneously applied the application notes from \u00a7 2D1.1 instead of those in \u00a7 2K2.1, contending that this enhancement cannot be applied simply because a gun was present with drugs. As to the district court\u2019s specific findings, Troupe challenges the district court\u2019s failure to credit his testimony in its entirety as inconsistent with logic and the evidence presented. He also contends that, under either approach used by the district court, the enhancement was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines and its findings of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>for clear error. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cFor a factual finding to be \u2018clearly erroneous,\u2019 this court, \u2018after reviewing all of the evidence, must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">In calculating the guideline range for a firearm possession offense under \u00a7 922(g), a four-level increase to the base offense level is required \u201c[i]f the defendant ... possessed any firearm ... in connection with another felony offense.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) (2006) (previously codified at \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)). The phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d is not defined in the 2005 Guidelines Manual. <em>See generally </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (2005). Although the text of this provision has not changed, effective November 1, 2006, the guideline was amended to add the following commentary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-5\">14. <em>\u201cIn Connection </em>With\u201d.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-6\">(A) <em>In General. </em>\u2014 Subsection[ ](b)(6) ... applies] if the firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-7\">(B) <em>Application When Other Offense is Burglary or Drug Offense. </em>\u2014 Subsection[](b)(6) ... applies] ... in the case of a drug trafficking offense in which a firearm is found in close proximity to drugs, drug-manufacturing materials, or drug paraphernalia. In [this] case[], application of subsection[](b)(1) ... is warranted because the presence of the firearm has the potential of facilitating another felony offense....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n.14) (2006); U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 691.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">Interpreting the \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement under former \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), we \u201cheld that the term \u2018in connection with\u2019 in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) should be given its ordinary and natural meaning, and we have expressly rejected a more restrictive interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir.2007). According to the phrase\u2019s ordinary and natural meaning, the firearm does not have to facilitate the underlying offense. <em>Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695. Furthermore, \u201cpossession of a firearm with intent to use it to facilitate the commission of a felony offense, or with intent to use it should it become necessary to facilitate that crime, is possession \u2018in connection with\u2019 that offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1231, 1234-35 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cMoreover, in interpreting Guideline provisions that contain an \u2018in connection with\u2019 requirement identical to U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), we have held that, \u2018in certain circumstances, mere possession of a firearm can be enough to apply a sentencing enhancement.\u2019\u201d <em>Smith, </em>480 F.3d at 1280 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>276 F.3d at 1234).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">With regard to Troupe\u2019s contention that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard, under \u00a7 2D1.1, a drug offense guideline, a two-level increase is required if a firearm \u201cwas possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). The commentary provides that this \u201cadjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n.3). Under this provision, the government need only prove that the firearm was present during the drug trafficking offense. <em>United States v. Audain, </em>254 F.3d 1286, 1289-90 (11th Cir.2001). Once the government does so, the burden shifts to the defendant to establish that a connection between the weapon and the offense was clearly improbable. <em>Id. </em>at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">We need not decide whether the district court erred in applying the \u201cclearly improbable\u201d standard of \u00a7 2D1.1 comment. (n.3) to \u00a7 2K2.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cf. United States v. Drury, </em>396 F.3d 1303, 1314 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 336, 163 L.Ed.2d 48 (2005) (declining to decide whether a jury instruction was erroneous because the error was harmless). Because the district court also found that it would reach the same result even if it did not apply the \u00a7 2D1.1 standard, any error in its application of that standard would be harmless. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1360 (11th Cir.2006), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>(Oct. 19, 2006) (No. 06-7352) (holding that a guidelines miscalculation is harmless, and therefore does not warrant reversal, if the district court would have imposed the same sentence without the error); <em>see also United States v. Scott, </em>441 F.3d 1322, 1330 (11th Cir.2006) (commenting that we would have held that an error was harmless if the district court had stated that \u201cit would reach the same sentence regardless of how the disputed \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(1) issue was decided.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">Turning to the district court\u2019s findings of fact, we have held that \u201c[t]he credibility of a witness is in the province of the factfinder and this court will not ordinarily review the factfinder\u2019s determination of credibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994). Moreover, we have held that a jury can disbelieve a witness and infer that the opposite of his testimony is true, <em>United States v. Hasner, </em>340 F.3d 1261, 1272 (11th Cir.2003), and need not fully accept or fully reject a witnesses\u2019s testimony, <em>see United States v. McDonald, </em>620 F.2d 559, 565 (5th Cir.1980) (approving a jury instruction which stated, \u201cIf you believe that any witness has been so impeached, then it is your exclusive province to give the testimony of that witness such credibility or weight, if any, as you may think it deserves.\u201d). Therefore, we cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred in only partially crediting Troupe\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">In order to show that the district court clearly erred in its ultimate finding, Troupe relies upon his version of the facts, contending that neither the drugs nor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>firearm belonged to him, he only unlawfully possessed the firearm for a few moments, and he did not possess the drugs or commit the offense of drug possession. However, the district court rejected Troupe\u2019s testimony that the gun did not belong to him and that he only possessed the firearm for a few moments. Although the court agreed that Troupe\u2019s brother brought the drugs into Troupe\u2019s car, it found that Troupe had knowledge of his brother\u2019s activities before he saw the drugs. Thus, Troupe left the house to get gas, probably knowing that drug activities were involved, but in possession of a gun. The district court did not find that Troupe possessed the drugs, but found Troupe accountable based on aiding and abetting his brother\u2019s possession and the proximity of the gun to the drugs. Troupe does not, however, explain how, under the district court\u2019s facts, the district court clearly erred in finding that he possessed the gun in connection with the drug offense. Because Troupe has not established that these preliminary factual findings were clearly erroneous and he offers no argument as to how, based on these facts, the district court clearly erred in concluding that he possessed a firearm in connection with a drug offense, we hold that Troupe has failed to establish clear error. <em>See Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d at 1344 (holding that the defendant abandoned an issue on appeal by failing to offer any argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">In light of the foregoing, Troupe\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-8\">. Although the PSI\u2019s calculations were based on the 2005 Guidelines Manual, Troupe\u2019s sentencing hearing was held on November 3, 2006, two days after the November 1, 2006 amendments became effective. Therefore, the district court should have considered whether to apply this commentary. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.11(a), (b)(1) (requiring use of the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date of sentencing unless such an application would constitute an <em>ex post facto </em>violation); <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (\u201c[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Saunders, </em>318 F.3d 1257, 1262 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003) (\"Because '[t]he court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced,\u2019 \u00a7 1B1.11, we reference the Manual effective on 1 November 2001 throughout this opinion.\u201d) (alteration in original). The record suggests that the district court was not aware of this amendment, but instead applied the 2005 Manual. However, Troupe has not raised this argument on appeal and, therefore, has abandoned the issue. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that the defendant abandoned an issue on appeal by failing to offer any argument).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b875-7\"><em>. </em>While we question whether Troupe adequately preserved this issue before the district court, the government does not argue that our review is limited to plain error, and we need not decide the appropriate standard of review based on our conclusion that the error, if any, was harmless. <em>See United States v. Lynn, </em>608 F.2d 132, 135 (5th Cir.1979) (holding that it was unnecessary to decide whether evidentiary objections were preserved adequately based on its disposition of the issues); <em>see also United States v. Dobbs, </em>11 F.3d 152, 154 n. 4 (11th Cir.1994) (addressing an issue \"as if it had been properly preserved\u201d where there was a close question as to preservation of the issue for appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
