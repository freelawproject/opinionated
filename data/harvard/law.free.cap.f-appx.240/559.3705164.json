As a result, Burton was charged in a one count information with health care fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347 (2000). Pursuant to a plea agreement, Burton plead guilty to the sole count in the information on June 28, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">Burton appeared for sentencing on September 22, 2006. At the time of sentencing, Burton was in custody due to similar but unrelated charges from the State of Maryland. The district court sentenced Burton within the advisory guidelines to seventy months\u2019 imprisonment, consecutive to any sentence he was then serving. Burton timely noted his appeal. On appeal, Burton\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he raises two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-16\">First, Burton questions whether he waived his right to appeal his sentence and conviction. Although Burton\u2019s plea agreement contained a waiver provision and the district court found his plea knowing and voluntary, the Government has not filed a motion in this case seeking to invoke his waiver. Accordingly, the waiver provision does not bar Burton\u2019s appeal. <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005) (stating that where the government elects not to raise waiver, this Court may decline to consider it) (citing <em>United States v. Brock, </em>211 F.3d 88, 90 n. 1 (4th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-17\">Second, Burton asserts that the district court erred in not running his sentence concurrent with the sentence he was already serving. However, as the sentence he was already serving at the time of sentencing on his federal conviction was an unrelated state conviction, the district court was free to impose a concurrent, partially concurrent, or consecutive sentence on Burton. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 (2005). Accordingly, Burton\u2019s second contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-18\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Burton, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>ed States for further review. If Burton requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Burton.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
