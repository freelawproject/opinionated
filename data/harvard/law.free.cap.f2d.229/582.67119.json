The indictment was in four counts. Count 1 charged a violation of 18 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 371, count 2 charged a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2111, and counts 3 and 4 charged other offenses. On June 9, 1952, appellant and LaPlante pleaded not guilty to all counts of the indictment. On June 24, 1952, they withdrew their pleas of not guilty and pleaded guilty to counts 1 and 2, and counts 3 and 4 were dismissed. Thereupon, on June 24, 1952, the Rhode Island court entered a judgment sentencing each of them to be imprisoned for five years on count 1 and fifteen years on count 2, the sentences to run consecutively. Accordingly, appellant was and is imprisoned in the United States penitentiary at Alcatraz, California, in custody of the warden thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">On April 6, 1953, appellant and LaPlante filed in the Rhode Island court a motion entitled \u201cMotion to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Sentence\u201d \u2014 a motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. On May 20, 1953, the Rhode Island court entered an order denying the motion of April 6, 1953.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No appeal appears to have been taken from the order of May 20, 1953. On September 23, 1953, appellant and LaPlante filed with the Rhode Island court a motion entitled \u201cAmended Motion to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Sentence\u201d \u2014 a second motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. On February 12, 1954, the Rhode Island court entered an order denying the motion of September 23, 1953. On November 17, 1954, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the order of February 12, 1954.\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">On December 7, 1954, appellant applied by petition to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, hereafter called the California court, for a writ of habeas corpus. The stated ground of the petition was that appellant had been denied his constitutional right of trial by jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 10, 1954, the California court entered an order dismissing the petition,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which is to say, dismissing the application. This appeal is from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-16\">As indicated above, appellant, before applying to the California court for a writ of habeas corpus, had applied for relief by motions under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 and had been denied such relief. It did not and does not appear that the remedy by motion under \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of appellant\u2019s detention. Hence the California court had no jurisdiction to entertain appellant\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-17\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-10\">.
