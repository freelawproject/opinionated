The facts are fully and correctly set forth in the opinion of the Tax Court and need not be repeated here. See 24 T.C. -. We think that the decision of the Tax Court was correct for reasons adequately stated in its opinion and that nothing need be added thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-21\">Affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
