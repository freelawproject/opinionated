Two questions are raised: (1) Did the trial court err in refusing defendant\u2019s request to charge on the defendant\u2019s theory of bribery? (2) Did the trial court *err in admitting evidence of a subsequent \u201cblackmail\u201d attempt as relevant to defendant\u2019s intent to extort money?</p>\n<p id=\"AR9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>The facts are' in disput\u00e9 and the jury-resolved them against the defendant. The theory of the prosecution was that the defendant, an Army- sergeant, on returning from Japan in September 1951 c\u00e1lled the victim, Joseph Schalet, and informed him over long distance telephone from Pittsburgh, California to New York, N. Y., to send $4,000 if \u201c-&gt;: * * you would want to see your son back alive * * * \u201d since \u201c * * * there are a lot of accidents happening, there are a lot of casualties, they are not all war accidents or war casualties * * * \u201d The defense theory was that prior to leaving Japan, the victim\u2019s son, Victor Schalet, gave the defendant his father\u2019s name, address and telephone number and asked the defendant to call him and say that his son was all right. Appellant testified that he made the call as requested and that during the ensuing telephone conversation Joseph Schalet asked him if there was- any possibility of his son getting out of the service in any way. Appellant went on to testify that he then concocted a story that a fictitious \u201cMajor Snow,\u201d a medical officer, would get his son out for $4,000, that the money was subsequently sent as a bribe for \u201cMajor Snow,\u201d and that he received and retained the $4,000 which the victim .sent, but told the victim that he had delivered the money to .\u201cMajor Snow.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">At the conclusion of the trial the defendant requested the trial court to charge the jury on the distinctions between the crimes of extortion and bribery and to instruct the jury to find the defendant not guilty if it found that the alleged victim paid the money as a result of a scheme which did not include .threats. The court refused to define .crimes other than extortion but instructed that the communication of a threat of injury was a necessary element of guilt. In charging the jury on the crucial question of the defendant\u2019s intent in receiving the money, the court framed the question: \u201cWas this a loan? Was this a bribe? Was this extortion ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Thereafter during its deliberation, the jury sent out a note asking, \u201cCan we give a verdict of not guilty and direct that the defendant be retried for bribery ? * * * \u201d The court replied as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">\u201cThe answer to that question is no. The question, as I said dui'ing my charge, and I want to make it very clear, is this, and there is only one question before you, and that is, is this defendant guilty or not guilty of the crime charged in the indictment? That is, that on, as I recall it, on September 24, .1951, with intent to extort money, he communicated with Mr. Joseph Schalet, and that the communication contained a threat to injury [sic] Mr. Schalet\u2019s son. That is the only crime which you may consider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">\u201cI have explained the elements of that crime to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-11\">\u201cIt is very important, as a matter of fact, it is most important to everyone that you only consider that crime. If you start to speculate about other crimes, bribery or anything else, and what might be done or what might not be done, I mean, there are any number of technical and substantial problems which I have never tried to explain to you. I haven\u2019t told you anything about the crime of bribery. Whether there is bribery here or whether there isn\u2019t is no concern of you. The question is, is there extortion, in the sense that this indictment charges it? That is the question that you must consider.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqdG\"> The most the defendant was entitled to.:upon request .was a; charge as to his factual theory of the defense. Calderon v. United States, 5 Cir., 279 F. 556, 558; Hendrey v. United States, 6 Cir., 233 F. 5, 18; Cf. Marson v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>United States, 6 Cir., 203 F.2d 904, 912. Since the essence of the defendant\u2019s case was a factual theory that the money was paid not as a result of threats but as part of an abortive scheme to bribe \u201cMajor Snow,\u201d we think the charge as thus expanded was not inadequate. Especially is this so since the judge in his original charge had posed the question: \u201cWas this a loan? Was this a bribe ? Was this extortion ? \u201d We agree with the trial judge\u2019s statement that \u201c * * * my duty is to clearly define the crime of extortion, not to go in and start defining other crimes which might be drawn in by the defendant.\u201d For him to have given the legal definition of bribery, an offense not charged, would have tended to confuse the jury rather than to clarify. Of course, if the defendant\u2019s testimony had injected facts which, although consistent with the government\u2019s charge and proof of extortion, constituted a confession and avoidance, he would have been entitled to an appropriate charge as to the legal issues involved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But that is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\"> The second question raised by the appeal arose out of a subsequent attempt, in June of 1953, by the appellant to \u201cblackmail\u201d the victim. As to this the victim testified that the appellant called him from Pensacola, Florida,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and told him \u201c * * * I have to blackmail you this time for $5,000, and you\u2019re going to send that $5,000 in one hour.\u201d The trial court admitted this testimony over objection on the theory that it was a similar offense relevant to show defendant\u2019s intent in taking the money from the victim on the prior occasion. 2 Wigmore on Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 302, 316, 352(2) (3rd ed.1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-13\">The appellant contends that evidence of appellant\u2019s intent in June of 1953 is too remote to evidence his state of mind at the time of the alleged criminal act two years prior, and that the evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial since it related to a \u201cblackmail\u201d and not an extortion attempt. Whether the 1953 conversation was too remote was for the trial judge to say. Wigmore, \u00a7 316 (2). In the context here the ruling was made within the bounds of discretion. As to the objection that blackmail is not sufficiently similar to extortion to have probative value as to defendant\u2019s intent, the evidence was properly admitted under the cautionary instructions of the judge that, \u201cThere is a technical difference between blackmail and extortion, and unless that conversation referred to extortion in the same sense that I have defined it, with respect to what we will call the main transaction in 1951, disregard it. In other words, unless the word \u2018blackmail,\u2019 if it was used in that conversation, was used as a colloquial reference to extortion of the type which I have elaborated here with you, why, disregard it * * * \u201d While there is a technical distinction between the crimes of blackmail<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and extortion<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> both in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>volve the obtaining of property by means of threats. Since it was the appellant\u2019s testimony that he had obtained the money without any threats, we think the evidence was properly received for its probative effect on the issue of defendant\u2019s intent in taking the money.
