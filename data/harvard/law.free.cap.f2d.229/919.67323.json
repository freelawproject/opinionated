He brought this suit to avert his then impending discharge based up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>on such refusal, his theory being that the 1951 amendment to the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152 (11th), as applied to him is an unconstitutional interference with the free exercise of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">On a prior appeal, we affirmed an order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for the appointment of a three-judge court to pass on the constitutionality of the statute. Neither the trial which was subsequently had nor the briefs on the present appeal raise any questions that seem to us to require any amplification of our prior opinion, reported in 2 Cir., 205 F.2d 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
