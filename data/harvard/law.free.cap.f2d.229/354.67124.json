It will suffice to say that a careful examination of the record and the pertinent portions of the appendices of petitioner and respondent leads to the inescapable conclusion that the petitioner\u2019s question, \u201cAre the findings of the board with respect to questions of fact supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole?\u201d, should be answered in the affirmative, indeed can not be properly answered any other way. This is not to say that petitioner did not present evidence to the contrary of that offered by the general counsel or that if the examiner had discredited Wallace and some of the other witnesses he could not, and ought not, to have found differently. It is to say, though: that the record does not support petitioner\u2019s conclusion; and that its petition to set the order aside should be denied and the board\u2019s petition to enforce it should be granted and enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-16\">. Commanding petitioner: to cease and desist from engaging in surveillance and interrogation of, and threats against, its employees and from illegally discouraging or otherwise interfering with their right to join or form labor organizations; and to offer reinstatement to and make whole Price Dry, an illegally discharged employee. 112 N.L.R.B. 109.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b411-6\">CAMERON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AHj\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">I am unable to join my brethren in adopting the findings of the Board based upon the examiner\u2019s report because I find no believable evidence upon which they can be rested. In the argument before us both sides agreed that the General Counsel had no case unless the testimony of the witness Wallace was believable. I think his testimony is inherently incredible and must be rejected and that, with it, the whole case falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The General Counsel\u2019s case is built around the discharge, on June 1,1954, of Price Dry, an employee who had worked for petitioner about four years. It was undisputed that Dry was not active in the union organization, and the employer is assumed to have discharged him solely on what it learned from Wallace; and Wallace did not testify that he made any report at all with respect to Dry and there was no evidence that the petitioner had any information that Dry had engaged in union activity or even that he had applied for membership.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Wallace testified that he was engaged by the management to act as a spy and to keep Dry and two or three other employees under surveillance. Wallace had been with the Company at that time less than a month <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and his only prior contact with petitioner had been when he worked about a month in 1953 before being laid off. Nevertheless, according to his statement, he was selected over about fifty employees, some of many years\u2019 service, to perform this delicate and highly confidential work. In addition to the fact that he was little known to the management, it was undisputed that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>stated to them unequivocally that he had been a union officer and member constantly over a number of years. All of his work had been in West Virginia, and he was evidently a newcomer to Florida. Here is his statement of the circumstances attending the assignment of this important task to him:</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u201cQ. Now did Mr. Carswell on any occasion ask you to go with him to Mr. Cherington\u2019s office? A. Well, a few days after this conversation with Mr. Gray [covered in Note 2, supra], Mr. Carswell came to me and told me he wanted me to come in on the three to eleven shift with Mr. Howard on the grid machine, and when I came in on the three to eleven shift he asked me had I saw Mr. Cherington yet. I told him no. He said, \u2018He wants to see you up in the office.\u2019 And I went up to his office, and he told me he wanted a history of my past employment for ten years, and he said he realized it would be hard but do the best I could, and I told him where I had worked and what I had done and the places I had been. <em>And he asked me was any of those places union shops, and I told him yes, they all was. And then he told me that he wanted me to go back in the back end, and see what I could find out about the union men, </em>who was the ringleaders back there of the union; and I went back \u2014 \u201d [Emphasis added.] Later he explained that he had been an officer in several unions in West Virginia, both C.I.O. and A.F. of L.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The quoted story is simply unbelievable. It does violence to what everybody knows about human nature and runs counter to common knowledge and experience. No sensible man would have employed a stranger in such a capacity and upon such a showing as is set forth in the quoted statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Moreover, it is unbelievable that the Company would have selected Dry as an object of surveillance and would have fired him. He had been employed while in his fifties to work as a janitor, and had been raised to the work he was doing when discharged, \u2014 a higher type of work but still menial in nature. The whole record shows that he was a man without force or influence, and certainly was not the type of man management would suspect of having leadership qualities. He was the only man discharged, and that took place within ten days of the date the letter was sent out. Both Wallace and Dry were contradicted by all of the officers of the Company who testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">But we lay this conflict aside and base this opinion upon the statement that Wallace\u2019s evidence is inherently unbelievable. In a situation not unlike this one<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we characterized such a statement as \u201cmonstrous\u201d. And we have recently held that, \u201cCourts are not required to believe testimony which is inherently incredible or which is contrary to the laws of nature and of human experience, or which they judicially know to be unbelievable.\u201d Geigy Chemical Corp. v. Allen, 5 Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 110, 114. We further said, at page 114, note 5: \u201c-\u2018If there be any one thing in the administration of law upon which the decisions, the texts, and the general opinion of bench and bar \u00e1re in agreement, it is that evidence which is inherently unbelievable or incredible is in effect no evidence * * \u201cAn inherently incredible story is not made credible by being sworn to. * * * Courts are not required to believe that which is contrary to human experience and the laws of nature, or which they judicially know to be incredible * * * although there may be evidence tending to support it.\u201d \u2019 \u201d We have said much the same thing in Labor Board cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the Robbins case, supra, we adverted to the fact that, \u201cThis Court has many times pointed out the anomalous position of the Board, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>first, as accuser appearing before itself as judge, second, as judge judging its own accusations, and, third, as prosecutor before us insisting that its determinations as judge must be enforced * * * \u201d. Note 2, at page 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Nor am I tempted to succumb to a spirit of frustration based upon the idea that we cannot perform our full constitutional duty as a court when called upon to ascribe to Labor Board findings the respect to which they are justly due. Such an attitude does not comport with what the Supreme Court has said in one of its late cases reconciling the concept that Labor Board decisions should stand if supported by \"substantial evidence with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001 et seq., Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 1951, 340 U.S. 474, at pages 489-490, 71 S.Ct. 456, 465, 95 L.Ed. 456, from which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">\u201cSome scope for judicial discretion in applying the formula [for judicial review of administrative action] can be avoided only by falsifying the actual process of judging or by using the formula as an instrument of futile casuistry. It cannot be too often repeated that judges are not automata. The ultimate reliance for the fair operation of any standard is a judiciary of high competence and character and the constant play of an informed professional critique upon its work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">\u201c * * * We should fail in our duty to effectuate the will of Congress if we denied recognition to expressed Congressional disapproval of the finality accorded to Labor Board findings by some decisions of this and lower courts, or even of the atmosphere which may have favored those decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">\u201cWe conclude, therefore, that the Administrative Procedure Act [5 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 1001 et seq.] and the TaftHartley Act [29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 141 et seq.] direct that courts must now assume more responsibility for the reasonableness and fairness of Labor Board decisions than some courts have shown in the past. Reviewing courts must be influenced by a feeling that they are not to abdicate the conventional judicial function. * * * The Board\u2019s findings are entitled to respect; but they must nonetheless be set aside when the record before a Court of Appeals clearly precludes the Board\u2019s decision from being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony of witnesses or its informed judgment on matters within its special competence or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">That expressed attitude of the Supreme Court gives impressive stature to the concurring opinion of Judge Waller in N.L.R.B. v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co., supra, in which he decried the tendency of courts to abdicate in favor of administrative <em>functionaries, </em>\u2014 a reading of which opinion tends definitely to buoy up the spirits of those tempted to look with despair upon their encroachment upon the judicial prerogative. He quoted from Crowell v. Benson, 1931, 285 U.S. 22, 60, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598: \u201c \u2018In cases brought to enforce constitutional rights, the judicial power of the United States necessarily extends to the independent determination of all questions, both of fact and law, necessary to the performance of that supreme function\u2019 \u201d; and he concluded with a sentence with which this dissent is closed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">\u201cA finding by an examiner, whether arrived at carefully and skillfully, or through incredible credulity, or simple stultification, should be deemed prima facie correct but should never be substituted in place of the power which the people in their Constitution solemnly and surely committed to their courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\">. This Court has recently held that it was a settled principle that \u201csome legally justifiable inference of employer knowledge of a dischargee\u2019s union membership is an essential prerequisite to a valid finding of discriminatory discharge therefor.\u201d N.L.R.B. v. National Paper Co., 5 Cir., 1954, 216 F.2d 859, 862. And see also N.L.R.B. v. Ray Smith Transport Co., 5 Cir., 1951, 193 F.2d 142, 145, and Tampa Times Co. v.
