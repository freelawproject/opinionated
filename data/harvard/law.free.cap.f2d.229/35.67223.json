The complaint rested in part at least on the theory that the substance of the coverage given by plaintiff\u2019s policy, namely, insurance against loss from failure to record chattel mortgages and like instruments, cannot be provided by other persons or companies without infringing his copyright. That theory must fail: others remain free to compete by offering similar coverages. See Dorsey v. Old Surety Life Insurance Co., 10 Cir., 1938, 98 F.2d 872, 874, 119 A.L.R. 1250.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff also alleged that defendant\u2019s policy form is so closely parallel in its terms to plaintiff\u2019s as to constitute an infringement. As to this, the District Court held that \u201cthere is no similarity in the arrangement of words of plaintiff\u2019s policies and the arrangement of words in defendant\u2019s policy and that defendant has not appropriated in the exact form or substantially so plaintiff\u2019s copyright material.\u201d The court was not in error in so holding. It did not pass, and we find it unnecessary to pass, upon the validity of plaintiff\u2019s copyrights. The court correctly concluded \u201cthat assuming that plaintiff\u2019s copyrights are valid, there has been no infringement thereof by defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-22\">No genuine issue of material fact was raised.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The action of the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Court in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant-appellee will accordingly be</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-15\">. Cases cited by plaintiff, involving former employees and other persons in privity, are of course distinguishable. Smith v. Thompson, D.C.S.D.Cal.1941, 43 F. Supp. 848, and cases there cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-23\">. Plaintiff alleged, and defendant denied, that the latter had had knowledge of and access to plaintiffs policy form. But this seems an immaterial issue under all the circumstances of the instant case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>especially since there is no similarity in language.
