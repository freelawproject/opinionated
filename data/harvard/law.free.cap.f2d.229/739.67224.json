Appellant contends that the district court rendered its judgment upon an agreed statement of facts to which appellant was not a party. The proofs, however, justified the conclusion that the material facts, as set forth in the above mentioned statement of facts, were approved by counsel for appellant; that motions for summary judgment filed by both parties were pending at the time the judgment of the district court was entered; that both parties had presented all relevant evidence which they had desired prior to adjudication; and that no Constitutional question was presented for determination, as contended by appellant. Upon a review of the testimony and upon consideration of the briefs and arguments of counsel, it is ordered that the judgment of the district court be and is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
