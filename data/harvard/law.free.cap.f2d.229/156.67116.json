The only question in the case is whether one Bailey was operating the automobile with the express. or implied permission of the owner, Catlett, at the time of the accident out of which the claim arises. The jury so found, but the trial judge sustained a motion for judgment n. o. v. on the ground that there was no evidence to sustain the verdict. Catlett testified that he allowed Bailey to drive the automobile to <em>take one </em>Hannah to the office of a physician, but that he was to \u201ccome right back and be careful\u201d. There was no evidence that any other permission express or implied was given Bailey to drive the car on this occasion. The collision occurred some twelve miles from the physician\u2019s office at a place where Bailey had taken plaintiff in the car without any permission of Catlett express or implied. Under the law of Virginia this may not be held a use of the automobile with the permission of the owner even though the use in driving to the physician\u2019s office was with his permission.
