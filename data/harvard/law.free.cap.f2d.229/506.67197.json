The cases were consolidated for hearing in the District Court. The court awarded summary judgment to all the plaintiffs and permanently enjoined the Secretary from putting the determination into effect as to any of them, on the ground that the Secretary\u2019s authority under the Walsh-Healey Act is limited by the word \u201clocality\u201d and that, therefore, he may not determine a minimum wage on an industry-wide basis. The Secretary and the intervenors appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">The policy and purpose of the Act are plain. By statute and regulation, government contracts must go to the lowest responsible bidder. Until the WalshHealey Act was passed, it followed that the government, though it urged industry to maintain adequate wage standards, was often compelled to undermine them by contracting with low-wage concerns. The Walsh-Healey Act sought to support standards by withholding con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>tracts from such concerns. \u201cThis Act\u2019s purpose was to impose obligations upon those favored with Government business and to obviate the possibility that any part of our tremendous national expenditures would go to forces tending to depress wages and purchasing power and offending fair social standards of employment. As stated in the Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary * * *) \u2018The object of the bill is to require persons having contracts with the Government to conform to cex-tain labor conditions in the performance of the contracts and thus to eliminate the practice under which the Government is compelled to deal with sweat shops.\u2019 \u201d Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113, 128, 60 S.Ct. 869, 877, 84 L.Ed. 1108. The Act\u2019s \u201cpurpose is to use the leverage of the Government\u2019s immense purchasing power to raise labor standards.\u201d Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins, 317 U.S. 501, 507, 63 S.Ct. 339, 342, 87 L.Ed. 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The Secretary\u2019s findings of fact make it clear that in the textile industry, unlike some industries, only an industry-wide minimum will serve this purpose, because the competition is industry-wide. The District Court\u2019s construction of the Act would make it necessary for the Secretary to fix separate minima according to the wages that prevail in each separate textile community. This would freeze the competitive advantage of concerns that operate in low-wage communities and would in effect offer a reward for moving into such communities. Obviously this would defeat the purpose of the Act. It would also make the Act nearly meaningless as applied to a large part of the textile industry, since there is frequently only one textile concern in one neighbox*hood and it necessarily pays-the wages that prevail in its plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Because the Walsh-Healey Act uses the-word \u201clocality\u201d, the appellees say that, the plain meaning of the Act forbids the-Secretary to fix an industry-wide minimum. As to the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of an Act of Congress the Supreme Court has said: \u201cWhen that meaning has led to absurd or futile results * * * this Court has looked beyond the words to the purpose of the act. Frequently, however, even when the plain meaning did not produce absurd results but merely an unreasonable one \u2018plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole\u2019 this Court has followed that purpose, x\u2019ather than the literal words.\u201d United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc., 310 U.S. 534, 543, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1063, 84 L.Ed. 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">Moreover, it is not true that the plain meaning of the Walsh-Healey Act forbids the Secretary to fix an industry-wide minimum in this case. It is not plain that every minimum wage detei*mination under the Act must be limited to a \u201clocality\u201d. It is not even plain that a large group of States can never be a \u201clocality\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The word occurs only in the phrase \u201ccurrently operating in the locality\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The phrase is not plainly intended to qualify any other term than \u201cgroups of industries\u201d. It may or may not be intended to qualify \u201cthe particular or similar industries\u201d. It can hardly be intended to qualify \u201csimilar work\u201d, for \u201cwork * * * currently operating in the locality\u201d would be a strange expression. The Secretary found that a dollar an hour is the prevailing minimum on \u201csimilar work\u201d. He also found that it is the prevailing minimum in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>particular industry. In our opinion these findings were fully warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the Act as permitting industry-wide determinations of minimum wages is not new. In this industry and many others, during many years, the Secretary has made many such determinations. See, e. g., 41 C.F.R. Parts 202 et seq. His practice in this respect has repeatedly been called to the attention of committees of Congress. Attempts have been made to write his interpretation expressly into the Act. Attempts have also been made to write it expressly out of the Act. Both have failed. Congress has chosen to leave the interpretation of the Act to the Secretary and the courts. As the Supreme Court said in regard to a different but somewhat related statute, the Fair Labor Standards Act, [29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201 et seq.,] \u201cWe decline to repudiate an administrative interpretation of the Act which Congress refused to repudiate after being repeatedly urged to do so.\u201d Alstate Construction Co. v. Durkin, 345 U.S. 13, 17, 73 S.Ct. 565, 568, 97 L.Ed. 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Appellees point out that \u201cpurchases of such materials, supplies, articles, or equipment as may usually be bought in the open market\u201d are exempt from the statutory requirement of a stipulation that employees will be paid not less than the prevailing minimum determined by the Secretary. 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 43, 49 Stat. 2039, \u00a7 9. But this exemption has nothing to do with the only matter here in issue, which is the validity of the Secretary\u2019s determination. The Secretary determined nothing with regard to the exemption. He determined that \u201cThe minimum wage for persons employed in the manufacturing or furnishing of the products of the Cotton, Silk, and Synthetic Textile Branch of the Textile Industry under contracts subject to the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act shall be $1.00 an hour arrived at either on a time or piece-rate basis.\u201d He did not undertake to decide to what contracts the Walsh-Healey Act, and therefore the minimum wage determination, are applicable. The complaints in these suits do not ask the court to decide that question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">In our opinion the plaintiffs\u2019 other objections to the Secretary\u2019s determination are likewise invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">The District Court thought it need not rule on a motion of the Secretary to dismiss the complaints, on jurisdictional grounds, as to 144 of the 158 plaintiffs. But the fact that some of the plaintiffs clearly have standing, under the Fulbright Amendment, to seek review of the Secretary\u2019s determination, confers no standing on others. We think the District Court should decide, in the first instance, which plaintiffs have standing. Cf. B. F. Goodrich Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 50, 56, 208 F.2d 829, 834. The case is remanded with instructions to rule on the motion to dismiss, unless the government withdraws it or the plaintiffs concerned consent to it. As against plaintiffs who are not dismissed, judgment should be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"AJm\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-11\">. Before its effective date, the determination was stayed as to the plaintiffs and the Secretary was temporarily enjoined from putting it into effect as to them. While that order was in force, any plaintiff who entered into a contract otherwise subject to the determination was required to post a bond to pay the prescribed wage if the determination were upheld. We entered a somewhat similar order, requiring a bond of $2,000, ponding the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\">. In Lukens Steel Co. v. Perkins, 70 App.D.C. 354, 107 F.2d 627, this court expressed a different view. But the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of this court, and affirmed the judgment of the District Court dismissing the complaint, on the ground that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue. Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113, 60 S.Ct. 869, 84 L.Ed. 1108. This of course left the opinion, as well as the judgment, of this court without value as a precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b564-13\">. It has been suggested that the words \u201cin the locality\u201d are not necessarily tied to the words \u201ccurrently operating\u201d, and that \u201csimilar work * * * in the locality\u201d is a possible reading. But since it is by no moans the only possible reading it is not the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\">. It is therefore immaterial that the Fulbright Amendment to the Walsh-Healey Act provides that review of the \u201capplicability\u201d of a minimum wage determination may be had by any \u201cperson adversely affected or aggrieved\u201d. 66 Stat. 308, 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 43a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">The Fulbright Amendment also provides that \u201cNotwithstanding the inclusion of any stipulations required by any provision of sections 35-45 of this title in any contract subject to said sections, any interested person shall have the right of judicial review of any legal question which might otherwise be raised, including, but not limited to, wage determinations and the interpretation of the terms \u2018locality\u2019, \u2018regular dealer\u2019, \u2018manufacturer\u2019, and \u2018open market\u2019.\u201d 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 43a (c). That is, a contractor who has been required to include a minimum wage stipulation in a contract need not perform the stipulation if the requirement was not in accordance with law. This is irrelevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>DANAHER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">I concur in the entire opinion by Chief Judge EDGERTON.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">I feel impelled to say this: were it not for Textile Workers Union of America, CIO v. Allendale Company,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would dismiss 144 plaintiffs on the present record. Moreover, I believe the District Court should have denied intervention by defendants National Association of Cotton Manufacturers, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates, Inc., Fitchburg Yarn Company, Hathaway Manufacturing Company and the Textile Workers Union of America, CIO, who are now here as appellants on the side of the Secretary. The Supreme Court held<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in 1940 that determinations by the Secretary under the Walsh-Healey Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as it then was written, are not judicially reviewable. The Act \u201cwas not intended to be a bestowal of litigable rights upon those desirous of selling to the Government; it is a self-imposed restraint for violation of which the Government \u2014 but not private litigants \u2014 can complain.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The function of the Secretary, acting in behalf of the Government, is to find the facts,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and make his determination which shall be conclusive upon all agencies of the United States. The Act was designed to permit the Government to supply its needs without the delays necessarily incident to judicial supervision of administrative procedure. \u201cIf the general law permits prospective bidders to challenge each wage determination of the' Secretary in the courts, by a like token all employees affected could obtain judicial review.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have been advised that \u201cCourts should not, where Congress has not done so, subject purchasing agencies of the Government to the delays necessarily incident to judicial scrutiny at the instance of potential sellers, which would be contrary to traditional governmental practice and would create a new concept of judicial controversies.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Not only do such expressions by the Court correctly, in my opinion, reflect the understanding and purpose of the Congress, but this case illustrates peculiarly the situation which Congress sought to avoid. It is now nearly three years since the Secretary\u2019s determination was promulgated, and it is no more nearly effective now than when it was first made. Yet 144 plaintiffs and 5 defendants as \u201cparties\u201d in the District Court still, because of their status as parties, respectively have rights of appeal no matter which way our order goes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">It is said that these \u201cparties\u201d are thus able completely to frustrate the reasonable fulfillment of the Congressional objective because \u201crights\u201d have been conferred upon them by the Fulbright amendment,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> adopted in 1952. In terms it was provided that review \u201cmay be had within 90 days after such determination is made,\u201d and ten of the original plaintiffs sought review after the 90 day statutory period had expired. As to them the motion to dismiss should be granted. The Fulbright amendment further provided that review was to be had only \u201cby any person adversely affected or aggrieved\u201d by the determination. Only 14 plaintiffs have made a showing that the determination \u201cresults in direct and im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>mediate injury.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> So, I would dismiss as to 144 \u201cplaintiffs,\u201d leaving only the 14 in the Alabama case and none in the Covington case. The named intervening appellants by the Secretary\u2019s determination have not been subjected to or threatened with any legal wrong. They have shown no independent legal right. They are not \u201cprivate Attorney Generals,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the Secretary is ably represented here by the Attorney General. Even the Fulbright amendment confers no standing upon those who appear on the side of the Secretary. I believe their intervention never should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">This is not a case involving a determination of public convenience and necessity such as National Coal Ass\u2019n v. Federal Power Commission.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This is not a case like Columbia System v. United States,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> where \u201cthe regulations purport to operate to alter and affect adversely appellant\u2019s contractual rights and business relations with station owners whose applications for licenses the regulations will cause to be rejected and whose licenses the regulations may cause to be revoked.\u201d This is not a case like Associated Industries v. Ickes,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> where by administrative carder, the minimum prices at which coal could be sold were increased, thus affecting the very basis upon which transactions in the coal business could be conducted. Nor is the case like United States Cane Sugar Refiners\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. McNutt,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or Longshoremen\u2019s Union v. Boyd,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> where the suit was dismissed for want of a \u201c \u2018case or controversy.\u2019 \u201d This is a case, <em>sui generis, </em>where \u201cCongress, as incident to its power to authorize and enforce contracts for public works, may require that they shall be carried out only in a way consistent with its views of public policy . . ..\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> No one is forced to bid for Government contracts. Not foreign to our problem are the considerations reasoned by this court in Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> I believe the Congressional interest in the attainment of the objectives of the Walsh-Healey Act and the Government\u2019s undoubted right to lay down the conditions upon which its own business will be conducted compel a strict construction of the Fulbright amendment. Any other view makes a shambles of the WalshHealey Act, for the delays and confusion occasioned by the hordes of \u201cparties\u201d render a determination obsolete and ineffective. Thus those who properly may be parties are those, and only those, who can show themselves by direct and immediate injury to have been adversely affected or aggrieved by the Secretary\u2019s determination.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\">. 90 U.S.App.D.C. 401, 226 F.2d 765.

To my mind the language of the statute clearly establishes the latter standard. This court so held in a case decided shortly after the passage of the Act. Lukens Steel Co. v. Perkins, 1939, 70 App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>D.C. 354, 107 F.2d 627. The opinion\u2014 an exhaustive one \u2014 was written by Associate Justice Justin Miller, and was concurred in by Associate Justice Fred M. Vinson, who had become a member of this court after serving in Congress during the very period in which the W\u00e1lsh-Healey Act was passed. The reasoning of the opinion seems to me unanswerable. And the legislative history there recited shows with complete clarity what Congress intended: that bidders for Government contracts \u201cshall pay the prevailing wages in the community where the work is performed.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Our decision in Lukens was reversed by the Supreme Court on another ground \u2014that the complainants lacked standing to sue. Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 1940, 310 U.S. 113, 60 S.Ct. 869, 84 L.Ed. 1108. The obstacle has now been removed by the Fulbright Amendment, passed in 1952. 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 43a. Technically, in dealing with the present case, we are not \u201cbound\u201d by our decision in Lukens, even though the Supreme Court did not reach the merits of that case. But its reasoning remains sound, and has not been disturbed by anything which has happened since. As far as the argument based on continued administrative interpretation is concerned, I would suppose that we were not entitled to give much weight to action which was until a short time ago completely immune to judicial review. Nor, under the circumstances here, does congressional failure to amend an act already clear on its face seem to be in any sense declaratory of the correctness of the Secretary\u2019s interpretation. The latest pronouncement of Congress \u2014 the Fulbright Amendment \u2014 certainly makes no such declaration: its passage might suggest, indeed, that Congress was not content with the Secretary\u2019s action, and wished it to be reviewed by the courts. The relevant Committee Report specifically states that failure to amend the \u201clocality\u201d provision of the Act is to be without prejudice to a judicial determination of the meaning of that provision. S.Rep. No. 1599, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 31 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">It is argued that to give the \u201clocality\u201d provision its ordinary meaning would produce an undesirable result. Bub\u2014 whether or not that is so \u2014 our function is to determine what Congress thought desirable, rather than to give expression to our own views on social legislation. It is also said that the purpose of the Act would be defeated by such an interpretation. But I think the majority misconceives the purpose of the Act, as revealed in the light of conditions prevailing in 1936, when it was passed. At that time, and before, it was generally thought that the Federal Government lacked power to undertake broad regulation of wages and labor standards. Control of Government contracts was thought possible, however, and in 1931 the Bacon-Davis Act was passed, imposing certain wage regulations in the field of Government construction contracts, 40 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 276a et seq., 46 Stat. 1494. In 1935 that Act was substantially revised and strengthened, 49 Stat. 1011. The 1935 revision provided \u2014 in language derived from the earlier legislation \u2014 for wage determin\u00e1tions based on conditions prevailing in the \u201ccity, town, village, or other civil subdivision\u201d where the contract is to be performed. In 1936 the Walsh-Healey Act was passed to cover the field of supply contracts. Here Congress used the \u201clocality\u201d provision we have been discussing. Obviously both acts are based on the same philosophy and point to a standard limited to a fairly small area and to a restricted objective : that of preventing contractors from cutting wages below prevailing community levels in an effort to pare costs and thus be the lowest bidder. As the legislative history shows, there was no thought of raising wages, or of eliminating regional differentials. See Lukens at page 362 of 70 App.D.C., at page 635 of 107 F.2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">Later, of course, greater breadth of Federal power was recognized. The Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>preme Court\u2019s decision in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Co., 1937, 301 U.S. 1, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81 L.Ed. 893, opened the door to more sweeping congressional action. Problems such as that of the \u201crunaway industry,\u201d which were not intended to be dealt with by the Walsh-Healey Act, but which may underlie the Secretary of Labor\u2019s approach to that Act, may now be dealt with by explicit Federal legislation. Congress has gone far in this direction through the Fair <em>Labor </em>Standards Act and its amendments. Indeed, under an amendment shortly to come into effect, the minimum F.L.S.A. wage will be raised to a dollar an hour. Public Law 381, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 3 (1955), U. S. Code Congressional and Administrative News 1955, p. 814. That, of course, is the same as the Secretary\u2019s determination here. Surely it is better to reach decisions of that sort through congressional debate and action, rather than through strained administrative and judicial interpretation of a statute passed years ago for a different and more limited purpose.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-7\">.
