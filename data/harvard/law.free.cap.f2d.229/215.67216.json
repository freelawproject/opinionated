While there are many authorities upon the subject, beginning with Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543, and including, <em>inter alia, </em>the cases cited by United States District Judge Taylor in his memorandum opinion, D.C., 136 F.Supp. 926, denying the motion to suppress, namely: Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879; Bradford v. United States, 6 Cir., 194 F.2d 168; and Gilliam v. United States, 6 Cir., 189 F.2d 321; each individual case, as it arises, must be decided upon its own particular facts as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>to whether there was probable cause for a search or seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">We think that, for the reasons stated in the opinion of the district judge, he ruled correctly that there was sufficient evidence to constitute probable cause for search, without a warrant, of the green automobile being driven by appellant at the time of the search of the vehicle by federal officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the United States District Court is affirmed; and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
