The complaint alleged that the plaintiff had been employed as a \u201ctrainman\u201d of the Railway at a time when he was a member of the Union, from which he resigned in February, 1953, and in which other \u201ctrainmen,\u201d on whose behalf he sued, as \u201csimilarly situated,\u201d had allowed their membership to lapse. Shortly thereafter the plaintiff and the others, \u201csimilarly situated,\u201d joined another union, which it will be convenient to call U.R.O.C., and which they supposed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\u201cnational in scope.\u201d The Railway and the first union had executed a Union Shop Agreement under subdivisions Eleventh, (a) and Eleventh, (e), of \u00a7 152 of Title 45 U.S.C.A., which required employees to keep up their membership in the Union, or in another union, \u201cnational in scope,\u201d in order to be eligible as employees of the Railway. In execution of this contract the Union and the Railway had set up a \u201cSystem Board of Adjustment\u201d under \u00a7 153, Second, of Title 45, to appear before which the \u201cUnion\u201d cited the plaintiff, and which after a hearing decided that membership in \u201cU.R.O.C.\u201d was not a compliance with the Union Shop Agreement. This resulted in depriving the plaintiff and the others, \u201csimilarly situated,\u201d of employment by the Railway, and he brought this action to procure reinstatement in the Union and reemployment by the Railway.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The plaintiff assumes that the District Court has jurisdiction to issue a mandatory injunction compelling the defendants to accept the plaintiff as a member of the Union and as an employee of the Railway; but we need not decide more at this stage of the case than that in any event the action may stand as one for a declaratory judgment under \u00a7 2201, Title 28, U.S.Code. There is an \u201cactual controversy within its\u201d (the District Court\u2019s) \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d for the plaintiff claims the right to membership and employment by virtue of statutes of the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 2202 allows us to reserve our decision as to what \u201cnecessary or proper relief * * * may be granted,\u201d if he proves his case upon a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The plaintiff raises two objections to the award of the \u201cSystem Board\u201d: (1) it had no jurisdiction over disputes between a union and its members or past members; and (2) the particular board here involved was disqualified to decide the issues, because two of its four members were members of the Union which the plaintiff and his fellows had abandoned in order to join \u201cU.R.O.C.\u201d Our decision in United Railroad Operating Crafts v. Wyer, 2 Cir., 205 F.2d 153, affirming on his opinion Judge Conger\u2019s dismissal of the complaint \u2014 D.C., 115 F.Supp. 359, is an answer to the first point. It is true that the case involved the jurisdiction of the National Adjustment Board, and not that of a \u201cSystem Board,\u201d but subdivision \u00a7 153, Second, gives to such boards authority to adjust and decide \u201cdisputes of the character specified in this section\u201d : that is, in subdivision First, which defines the authority of the National Adjustment Board. Indeed, independently of that decision as a precedent, we should have no doubt that the dispute at bar was within \u00a7 153, First, (i), as a dispute \u201cbetween an employee or group of employees and a carrier growing out of * * * the interpretation or application of agreements concerning * * * working conditions.\u201d How far the award of the \u201cSystem Board,\u201d constituted as it was, is exempt from judicial review is indeed a different matter, upon which the courts do not appear to be in entire accord. All that we decided in United Railroad Operating Crafts v. Wyer, supra, was that an aggrieved union or employee must in any event first resort to the appropriate panel \u2014 in that case a panel of the National Adjustment Board \u2014 before it may apply to a court. Since, however, the text of \u00a7 153 applies without reserve to the occasion at bar, the award of the \u201cSystem Board\u201d will be final, unless either it is proper to imply an exception when half its members are members of the recognized union; or, if that be an unwarranted interpolation, then unless the section is <em>pro tanto </em>unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">The defendants rely upon the decisions of the Seventh and Sixth Circuits in United Railroad Operating Crafts v. Pennsylvania Railroad, 7 Cir., 212 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>938, and Pigott v. Detroit, T. <em>&amp; </em>I. R. R. Co., 6 Cir., 221 F.2d 736. In the first of these the only actual holding was that the \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d of such disputes as that at bar was in the \u201cSystem Board\u201d;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but the court went on to discuss the question whether a \u201ccompeting\u201d union, which the aggrieved employee asserted to be within \u00a7 152, Eleventh, (e), was \u201cnational in scope,\u201d might be decided in a proceeding under \u00a7 153, First, (f). The court did not indeed say that such a proceeding was an adequate remedy for any bias of the \u201cSystem Board\u201d; but we are in doubt as to what other significance the discussion was meant to have. At any rate the Sixth Circuit in the later case had before it an action brought after the employee had failed before the \u201cSystem Board,\u201d in which he and the \u201ccompeting\u201d union both protested against the ruling of the board because of its presumptive bias; and the court plainly held that a proceeding under \u00a7 153, First, (f) was an' adequate remedy. That decision is flatly in favor of the defendants at bar, and if the appeal is to succeed, we must interpret the Act differently, or declare it unconstitutional. Before discussing that question it will make our position plainer, if we say what we understand this supposed alternative remedy to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Subdivision (a) of \u00a7 153, First, prescribes as one among the qualifications of a union that is to be an elector of unions representing employees in panels of the National Adjustment Board, that it shall be \u201cnational in scope.\u201d In case a union\u2019s claim to be chosen as an elector is disputed, \u00a7 153, First, (f) declares that the Secretary of Labor shall first investigate the claim, and, if he decides it \u201chas merit,\u201d that he shall notify the Mediation Board. That board will then ask those unions already qualified as electors to select one of their members to serve upon a \u201cboard of three\u201d to pass upon the dispute, the applicant itself will select another member, and the Mediation Board will select the third. If the \u201cboard of three\u201d grants the application of the union, it will necessarily have found that it is \u201cnational in scope\u201d; and the argument appears to be that that is an adequate remedy for any bias of the \u201cSystem Board,\u201d apparently because the finding of the \u201cboard of three\u201d on that issue will be final.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">With deference we cannot agree with this reasoning. In the first place when a union applies to be chosen as an elector there are other conditions that it must satisfy besides being \u201cnational in scope\u201d: <em>i.e., </em>it must be \u201corganized in accordance with\u201d the Act, and it must be \u201cotherwise properly qualified to participate in the selection of the labor members\u201d of the National Board. \u00a7 153, First, (f). The \u201cboard of three\u201d may of course make a specific finding that the applicant union is not \u201cnational in scope,\u201d as the ground of refusing to admit it as an elector;' but if it fails to do so, it will be impossible to know whether this was in fact its ground for refusal; and a proceeding that may leave this issue undecided can hardly be intended as a remedy for any bias of the \u201cSystem Board.\u201d Moreover, in any event the decision of the \u201cboard of three\u201d would not be an adequate remedy to the employee. If for instance the \u201ccompeting\u201d union did not wish to be an elector, there is no reason why that should forfeit the employee\u2019s right to an impartial tribunal in deciding whether he should hold his job. Employees have no means of compelling the \u201ccompeting\u201d union to apply to be an elector; and, even if they had, we can see no justification for forcing them to accept that union as a surrogate to assert their right. As we read \u00a7 152, Eleventh, (c), their jobs are dependent only upon whether the \u201ccompeting\u201d union is in fact \u201cnational in scope\u201d; and the Act should be construed to grant them the personal privilege of proving their right before an impartial tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">If there is no alternative remedy open to the plaintiffs at bar, there must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>some kind of judicial review of the finding against them by the \u201cSystem Board.\u201d Nothing could more completely defeat the most elementary requirement of fair play; and nothing would more firmly entrench the recognized union in power; the temptation to fetch all jobs into that union would ordinarily be irresistible, especially when we remember that the union members of a \u201cSystem Board\u201d are likely to be persons of consequence in the union itself. Although it is true that Edwards v. Capital Airlines, 84 U.S. App.D.C. 346, 176 F.2d 755, arose under other sections of the Act, its <em>ratio decidendi </em>applies so exactly to the case at bar that we adopt it as a precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">If it be argued that the result of our decision is inevitably to interject the courts into the enforcement of the right granted by \u00a7 152, Eleventh, (a), we answer that that is not necessarily true. Section 153, Second, provides that if either party to an \u201carrangement\u201d setting up a \u201cSystem Board\u201d is dissatisfied, it may \u201celect to come under the jurisdiction of the Adjustment Board.\u201d Whether this implies that, if \u201cdissatisfied,\u201d the parties must altogether abandon a \u201cSystem Board\u201d \u201carrangement,\u201d after they have set it up; or whether it allows them to limit the scope of its jurisdiction, we need not say. If it means the second, it will be possible in the agreement setting up a \u201cSystem Board\u201d to refer disputes such as that at bar to a panel set up under the National Adjustment Act, which can presumably be made impartial. If it means the first, it would indeed result in making inevitable a court review when a \u201cSystem Board\u201d decides against an employee in situations like that at bar. We can only answer that in that event there is a public interest in the impartial protection of any rights granted by an Act of Congress that transcends the immunity of labor disputes from all surveillance by a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Judgment reversed; cause remanded for trial in accordance with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-12\">. \u00a7 1387, Title 28, U.S.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\">.
