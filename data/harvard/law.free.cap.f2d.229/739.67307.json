It appears that both direct and circumstantial evidence presented a question of fact for the jury. There was evidence from which the jury could conclude that the acts of appellants\u2019 agent were done by their authority, under their direction, and in concert with them. The verdict of appellants\u2019 guilt was sustained by the proofs; the claim of reversible error in the court\u2019s instructions is without merit; and, accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
