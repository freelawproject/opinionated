Accordingly, title passed to defendant. New York Personal Property Law, McK.Consol.Laws, c. 41, \u00a7 129. The evidence shows that it was customary, on a large job such as this, for a buyer to have a representative at seller\u2019s plant to check whether the ingredients accorded with the specifications; this was not done here. Defendant, however, under Section 130, had a right to damages for breach of warranty, if it gave reasonable notice of the breach. But such a right must be asserted by a cross-action as to which defendant, the buyer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>has the burden of proof. See 1 Williston, Sales, Section 255; Barber Mining &amp; Fertilizing Co. v. Brown Hoisting Mach. Co., 6 Cir., 258 F. 1, 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As defendant offered no proof whatever of such a breach, the district court properly decided against defendant. In the circumstances, the issue of reasonable notice by defendant of the alleged breach became irrelevant; consequently, we need not consider the court\u2019s alleged error in excluding a letter bearing on that issue alone.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant does not dispute plaintiff\u2019s claim for truck hire. Accordingly, on the merits, we must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">A year after this suit began, defendant moved to implead Palisades as a third-party defendant. The district court denied this motion. It also denied defendant\u2019s motion, made at the commencement of the trial, (a) to consolidate the trial with the trial of a suit, begun a year after the case at bar, by defendant against Palisades, or (b) for leave to withdraw defendant\u2019s counterclaim without prejudice to renewal or to sever the counterclaim and consolidate it for trial with the trial of the Palisades action. Defendant argues that, since it could not effectively prove its counterclaim until the completion of its litigation with Palisades, the denial of all or some of these motions was erroneous. We do not agree. Defendant\u2019s was a compulsory counterclaim under Fed. Bules Civ.Proc. rule 13, 28 U.S.C.A. All these denial orders were within the trial court\u2019s discretion; in the circumstances, we see no \u201cabuse\u201d of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-15\">. Frankel v. Foreman &amp; Clark, Inc., 2 Cir., 33 F.2d 83, is not in point, since there the buyer had not accepted the goods but had merely assented to delivery, so that title had not passed. Thomson Co., Inc., v. International Compositions Co., Inc., 191 App.Div. 553, 181 N.Y.S. 637, is inapposite since the defeet in the goods was latent and there was no showing that the buyer could have tested the goods before using.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ATc\">. There was no error in the exclusion of deposition testimony relating to defendant\u2019s contract with Palisades.,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A2\">. Defendant\u2019s alleged difficulties stem from its removal of this action from the City Court, for there defendant would not have been compelled to file its counterclaim but, having lost in plaintiff\u2019s suit, could later have sued plaintiff for the damages alleged in the counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
