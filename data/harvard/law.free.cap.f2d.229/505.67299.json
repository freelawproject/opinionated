The case was before the court on a motion based upon appellant\u2019s failure to pay alimony for the period from October 8, 1954, to December 3, 1954. The court denied that motion, but <em>sua sponte </em>held him in contempt for failure to make payments during a subsequent period. As to that issue notice was not given prior to the hearing and adequate opportunity to present evidence was not afforded. For this reason we reverse. See Kephart v. Kephart, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 373, 377, 193 F.2d 677, 680-681, certiorari denied 342 U.S. 944, 72 S.Ct. 557, 96 L.Ed. 702. Cf. Richardson v. Richardson, 92 U.S.App.D. C. 397, 201 F.2d 211; Id., 93 U.S.App.D.C. 76, 207 F.2d 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-20\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-13\">.
