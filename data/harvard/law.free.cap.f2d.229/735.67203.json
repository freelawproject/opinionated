The Deputy Commissioner had awarded Philip McDermott compensation for loss of hearing resulting from his employment for fifteen years as a boiler-maker. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that McDermott\u2019s impairment of hearing \u201cdid not result in any incapacity to earn the wages which he was receiving at the time of the injury.\u201d Defendant\u2019s answer did not deny this allegation. Plaintiff made a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and defendant made a cross-motion for summary judgment. The district judge denied plaintiff\u2019s motion, granted defendant\u2019s, and entered judgment for defendant. Plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-16\">We affirm. The judgment is clearly governed by our recent decision in Travelers Insurance Company v. Cardillo, 2 Cir., 225 F.2d 137. The loss of hearing is covered by Section 908(c) (13) and is thus one of the \u201cschedule losses\u201d set forth in Section 908. In Travelers we held that, as to any schedule loss, there is a conclusive presumption of loss or reduction of wage-earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-17\">Plaintiff relies on Iacone v. Cardillo, 2 Cir., 208 F.2d 696. But in the Travelers Insurance case, 225 F.2d at page 144, we distinguished Iacone, saying, \u201cIn that case, the use of the eye was lost long prior to the industrial accident upon which the claim was founded, and, consequently, we stated that \u2018Industrially, claimant lost nothing by the second injury.\u2019 In effect, we held that the Congress did not contemplate compensation for the loss of a previous sightless eye when it made provision for scheduled awards in 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 908(c) (5).\u201d In other words, in Iacone we held not, as the appellant here suggests, that a schedule loss is compensable only on proof of loss of earning capacity, but rather that the loss of a sightless eye was not a schedule loss under \u00a7 908(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
