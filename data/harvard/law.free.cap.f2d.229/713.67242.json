The issue as presented did not involve the contradiction or variance of a valid written instrument. The parties had proceeded to operate under the agreement between them before the contract was executed by the appellee sub-contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-25\">The finding of the district court that the oral contract under which the parties operated did not contemplate \u201cthe doing of footings\u201d by the sub-contractor is supported by substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous. The contract in controversy was signed by the sub-contractor at a time when it was on the verge of insolvency and under duress of appellant, which was withholding payment of amounts due the sub-contractor until the contract should be signed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-26\">Appellant\u2019s inequitable treatment of appellee in their contractual relationship, is manifest from positive and substantial evidence of record. It appears from the entire evidence in the case, as found by the district court, that equity does, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>not require the allowance of the set-off claimed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">An opinion reviewing in detail the \u2022evidence introduced at the trial and the various propositions raised is considered unnecessary for the reason that United States District Judge Taylor, in his well considered memorandum opinion, D.C., 137 F.Supp. 881, carefully and correctly analyzed and disposed of all issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the United States District Court is affirmed; and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
