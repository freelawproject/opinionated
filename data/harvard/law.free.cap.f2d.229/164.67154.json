The petition alleged that on a six year sentence the petitioner served, with excellent work and conduct reports, from February 1, 1950 to November 20, 1952, when he was released on pai\u2019ole under the provisions of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4203. On November 18, 1953, he was retaken as a parole violator under the provisions of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4205. He was given a hearing before a member of the Board of Parole under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4207. The Board revoked the order of parole for \u201cleaving the district of parole supervision without permission\u201d, and ordered that the prisoner be required to serve the remainder of the term for which he was sentenced. The question is whether in computing the remainder of such tei'm he is entitled to a deduction of the good time allowances under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4161 for the period from February 1, 1950 to November 20, 1952 served before parole. The law seems to be settled that \u201cthe credit is not a vested right, but only contingent until a time arrives such that its allowance will end imprisonment.\u201d Aderhold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>v. Perry, 5 Cir., 59 F.2d 379, 380. Upon revocation of his parole, appellant could be required to serve the entire remainder of his term without any credit for \u201cearned\u201d good time. Platek v.
