Defendants and appellees are. in a different business: the manufacture of outdoor barbecue equipment. After plaintiff established its use of the name of \u201cBig Boy\u201d and the \u201cHome of Big Boy\u201d defendants became the Big..Boy Manufacturing Company in Southern. California and the \u201cHome of Big Boy Manufacturing Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-21\">Plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint pleads two claims of trade-mark infringement and one of unfair competition. The complaint exhaustively pleads with exhibits the evidence of what defendants have done, .but states short conclusions as to the effect of defendants\u2019 acts. The district court granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-22\">On appeal a close question exists as to whether plaintiff has pleaded enough for any valid claim. Tentatively plaintiff\u2019s mark does not look like what is usually denominated in this class of litigation as a \u201cstrong\u201d one. There seems to be little likelihood of confusion of identity of products, but upon a trial there may be' some proof of confusion of source that entitles plaintiff to some relief. It may develop on the trial that plaintiff is entitled to no relief, some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>slight relief or even substantial relief. On that, this court expresses no opinion. At least, this court thinks the plaintiff, as a minimum, has succeeded in stating claims, and is entitled to a trial, costly though it may be to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">This is not a patent case and it was not decided on motions for summary judgment, but the underlying principle of Hycon Mfg. Co. v. H. Koch &amp; Sons, <em>9 </em>Cir., 219 F.2d 353, appears to be applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
