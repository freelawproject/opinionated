On January 23, 1956, appellant filed with our clerk a motion to recall our mandate and for leave to file a petition for rehearing. An affidavit of appellant was filed with the motion. However, no proposed petition for rehearing accompanied the motion, nor has any such proposed petition been presented to us; nor was any valid ground for such a petition stated in the motion or the affidavit. The motion is therefore .denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-23\">. Fisher v. United States, 9 Cir., 227 F.2d 930.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
