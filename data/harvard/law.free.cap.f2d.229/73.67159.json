Ward O\u2019Neill, New York City (Haight, Gardner, Poor &amp; Havens, New York City) (John C. Mundt, Jr., New York City, of counsel), for defendant.appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b130-11\">Before CLARK, Chief Judge, and MEDINA and WATERMAN, Circuit \u25a0Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b130-12\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s decedent, Philip G. Thurnau, a third mate of the S.S. Alcoa Pegasus, died as the result of injuries \u2022sustained while riding as a passenger in .an automobile driven by a fellow crewman, Wold;' Thurnau and his companion \u25a0were returning from shore leave to their duties aboard ship .at .the time, of the accident. There was sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that Thurnau\u2019s death was caused by the negligence of Wold in the operation of the car. The car had been rented and lent to Wold by a third member of the ship\u2019s crew, Kossman.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-15\">The sole question on this appeal \u2014 even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Thurnau was acting \u201cin the course of employment\u201d within the meaning of the Jones Act while returning to his ship from shore leave \u2014 is whether a shipowner is under a duty to provide a safe means of transportation between the ship and any place of amusement crew members desire to visit while on shore leave in the vessel\u2019s home port. We think it clear that the shipowner is under no such duty, and is therefore not liable under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 688, for the negligence, if any, of Wold and Kossman in renting and operating a car for their private pleasure while on shore leave. See Paul v. United States, 3 Cir., 1953, 205 F.2d 38; Lemon v. United States, D.C.Md.1946, 68 F. Supp. 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-16\">The absence, because of a bus strike, of bus transportation from the dock to the places of amusement frequented by these sailors does not make the shipowner responsible for the safety of the other readily available means of transportation, such as taxis or rented ears, that may happen to be chosen by the crew. The cases relied on by the plaintiff are all distinguishable. Some are maintenance and cure cases, Warren v. United States, 1951, 340 U.S. 523, 71 S.Ct. 432, 95 L.Ed. 503; Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., 1943, 318 U.S. 724, 63 S.Ct. 930, 87 L.Ed. 1107. Some are assault cases, which appear to be sat <em>generis, </em>Nowery v. Smith, D.C., 69 F. Supp. 755, affirmed 3 Cir., 1947, 161 F.2d 732; Kyriakos v. Goulandris, 2 Cir., 1945, 151 F.2d 132. And the remainder are cases involving negligence of the shipowner in creating or maintaining dangerous conditions adjacent to the ship, Marceau v. Great Lakes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Transit Corporation, 2 Cir., 1945, 146 F.2d 416; O\u2019Donnell v. Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co., 1943, 318 U.S. 36, 63 S.Ct. 488, 87 L.Ed. 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
