Circuit Judge Lumbard, who issued the injunction while sitting by designation as a district judge, sets forth in a thorough, but succinct, opinion the facts and reasoning which support his finding that these defendants have committed acts violative of SEC Rule X-14, 17 CFR \u00a7 240.14a, promulgated pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n. D.C.S.D.N.Y., 134 F.Supp. 247. The defendants were unsuccessful in their attempts to secure a stay from a judge of this court and the circuit justice; and the meeting was held on September 7, with results favorable to the old management.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\"> We accept the well-supported \u25a0findings and conclusions of Judge Lumbard as reported in the opinion below. Appellants argue that \u00a7 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a), and regulations'adopted thereunder are unconstitutional as unauthorized delegations of legislative power and otherwise; but these contentions have no merit. American Power &amp; Light Co. v. S. E. C., 329 U.S. 90, 67 S.Ct. 133, 91 L.Ed. 103; Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414,- 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834. Furthermore, the Commission\u2019s proxy rules as applied either to management or to insurgent stockholder groups are clearly authorized by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Appellants\u2019 fundamental complaint appears to be that stockholder disputes should be viewed in the eyes of the law just as are political contests, with each side free to hurl charges with comparative unrestraint, the assumption being that the opposing side is then at liberty to refute and thus effectively deflate the \u201ccampaign oratory\u201d of its adversary. Such, however, was not the policy of Congress as enacted in the Securities Exchange Act. There Congress has clearly entrusted to the Commission the duty of protecting the investing public against misleading statements made in the course of a struggle for corporate control.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
