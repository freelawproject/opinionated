The district court took the latter view, concluding that the petitioner\u2019s private law practice was his principal employment, and ruled that he was not subject to the act because of his membership in the Newark Housing Authority. The reasons for the district court\u2019s action are fully stated in the opinion filed by Judge Smith, 130 F.Supp. 15. We find ourselves in complete accord with the views therein stated and need add nothing thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-20\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
