An examination of the record convinces us that there was no error on the part of the trial court in overruling appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>government\u2019s testimony, which was renewed at the close of all of the evidence; and that the trial court, further, committed no reversible error in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars, in refusing any of the appellant\u2019s proposed requests to charge, in the admission of evidence during the course of the trial, or in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">In consideration of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
