It was alleged that after the repair was made defendant notified plaintiffs that it was working properly; that plaintiffs relied upon such representations. It was further alleged that the refrigerator was defective after such repairs, which fact was known to the defendant but unknown to the plaintiffs; that on the night or early morning of July 25,1954, a fire occurred which was started by the defective condition of the refrigerator and due to the negligence of the defendant in failing to properly repair the same, after undertaking so to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-18\">The complaint alleged that the fire took the lives of plaintiffs\u2019 two children, one aged two years and the other aged one. Damages were prayed for much in excess of the jurisdictional amount of $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-19\">No reason is assigned for the court\u2019s ruling. Appellee, however, rests its case on the contention that under Oklahoma law when a landlord fails to make repairs required of him or makes them in a negligent manner the only remedy available to the tenant is either to make the repairs himself and deduct the amount thereof from the rent or to vacate the premises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>At common law there was no obligation on the landlord to make repairs on the rented premises and no liability for failure to make repairs for injuries suffered because of the defective condition of the premises.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If, however, the landlord undertook to make repairs and did so negligently he became liable to the tenant for all loss proximately resulting therefrom.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is also the law of Oklahoma where the enactment set out in Footnote 1 is inapplicable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action was predicated upon the alleged negligent manner in which the landlord made repairs. Obviously under the common law as applicable in Oklahoma, the complaint would state a cause of action. The decision then turns on the question, does the Oklahoma statute set out in Footnote 1 remove the liability of the landlord, where he voluntarily undertook to make repairs but did so in a negligent manner?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Oklahoma has not passed on this precise question. A casual reading of the statute, however, would indicate that it was passed for the benefit of the tenant and not for that of the landlord. Nowhere can we find language indicating that it was the intent to relieve the landlord of his common-law liability where he makes repairs but does so in a negligent manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">North Dakota has statutory provisions nearly identical to those of the Oklahoma statute. In fact the Oklahoma statute was taken from the Dakota territorial laws.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Recently the <em>North </em>Dakota court had the question before it on a different factual situation. It did, however, construe the statute and held that while the sections \u201cgive the tenant new remedies against a landlord they do not otherwise alter the relationship of landlord and tenant under the rule of the common law\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> California has an identical statute. In three cases the California courts have held that the statute had no effect on the pre-existing common-law liability for <em>negligent repairs made by the landlord.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is our view that if and when the precise question comes before the Supreme Court of Oklahoma it will construe its statute as similar statutes have been construed by the courts of North Dakota and California.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">A further contention that in any event the allegations of the complaint are insufficient to state a cause of action because they state mere conclusions rather than ultimate facts is not well taken. The complaint states the allegations required by the liberalized rules of Federal Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.; it states that the landlord undertook to make the repairs; did so in a negligent and careless manner; and that this was the proximate cause- of the ultimate injuries and loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-12\">. 41 Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 31-32 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-13\">\u201c\u00a7 31.
