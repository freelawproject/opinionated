The contention is that such income is not taxable to Mary Brasier because of her status as a restricted Osage Indian.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-17\">Quite apart from the court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction of the United States and of the Commissioner, see Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628; United States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058; Caledonian Coal Co. ex rel. Territory of New Mexico v. Baker, 196 U.S. 432, 444, 25 S.Ct. 375, 49 L.Ed. 540, this action to enjoin the collection of income taxes is prohibited by Section 3653, Title 26 U.S.C., in the absence of extraordinary or unusual situations warranting the intervention of a court of equity. And, neither the validity nor the constitutionality of the tax sought to be collected constitute extraordinary circumstances within the meaning of the rule. See Voss v. Hinds, 10 Cir., 208 F.2d 912; Jones v. Taunah, 10 Cir., 186 F.2d 445; Sturgeon v. Schuster, 10 Cir., 158 F.2d 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-18\">Appellants also complain of the refusal of the court to allow an amendment to the pleadings after the appeal had been lodged, but the filing of the appeal deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to allow amendments to the pleadings, and the court therefore did not err in its refusal to do so. See Willoughby v. Sinclair Oil &amp; Gas Co., 10 Cir., 188 F. 2d 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-19\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
