Bk. </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>64 N. Y. 283; <em>Walther </em>v. <em>Wetmore, </em>1 E. D. Smith, 71.) The common law has been ameliorated as to its unfair protection of the rights of the owner of personal property at the expense of injustice to the honest purchaser or bailee in the enactment of what is known to the law merchant as the factor and agent acts. (4 Ga. 4 Ch. 83, 1823; 5 id. 94, 1825 ; 1 R. S. 762, tit. 5, \u00a7 3 [2d ed.] 1832, adopting statute of 1830.) Before the enactment of the Factor\u2019s Act, commonly called in 1830, no claim could have been predicated upon an hypothecation, notwithstanding the utmost good faith on the part of the pledgee. <em>(Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>5 Johns. Ch. 417.) When property passes from the agent to the bailee, and he knows the owner, the principal liabilities and rights attach to the relation of the ownership. <em>(Morrison </em>v. <em>Currie, </em>4 Duer. 82; Paley on Agency, 369; Smith\u2019s Mer. Law, 66, 78, 79; Story on Agency, 266.) The Factors\u2019 Act was intended for the protection of third parties, who, in good faith, and in ignorance of any defect of title advance money and incur obligations, upon the faith of merchandise and the apparent ownership thereof by factors or agents who have been entrusted by the owners with the possession of, or with the documentary evidence of the title to property. (Factors\u2019 Act, 2 R. S. 1168, \u00a7 2 [Banks\u2019 ed.]; <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>60 N. Y. 73; 66 id. 113; <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>6 id. 378; 3 Hun, 71.) Ignorance of the owner\u2019s title is an absolute element to protect the alleged purchaser or bailee. <em>(Howland </em>v. <em>Woodruff </em>60 N. Y. 73; <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>6 id. 374; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>3 Denio, 472; 6 Hill, 312.) In trover for conversion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>of goods shipped, the damage is the value of goods at time and place of conversion with interest, etc. <em>(Covell </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>6 N. Y. 374.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b225-6\">Danforth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG8\">The plaintiff, being the owner of certain corn, alleged and proved that the defendants had converted it to their own use, to his damage $2,829.60. The defendants at the time of the conversion, were warehousemen and bankers. They proved, in substance, that they received the corn from the firm of Littell <em>&amp; </em>Co., commission merchants, advanced money to them on account of it, and insisted that they were entitled to hold the corn until this advance was repaid. It appeared that the plaintiff had consigned the corn to Littell &amp; Co. for sale. They, therefore, had possession and were the apparent owners, and the trial judge charged the jury that the defendants could keep the corn as security for the money so advanced, provided they did not, at the time, know that the plaintiff was the owner of the corn; on the other hand, if they knew that Littell &amp; Co. were using the plaintiff\u2019s property to raise money for themselves, then the defendants could not hold the corn, and stood in Littell &amp; Co. 's place. To this part of the charge the defendants excepted. It presents the only point in the case, and, to sustain it, the appellant\u2019s rely upon the \u201c Factors\u2019 Act \u201d (Laws of 1830, chap. 179). That act was to protect persons dealing in good faith with the apparent owners of property, and has no possible application to a case where protection would secure to a wrong-doer the fruits of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Many other propositions have been argued for the appellants, but they are raised by no exception and are not warranted by any evidence to be found in the appeal book.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The trial judge in denying a new trial, and the General Term in affirming the judgment, properly disposed of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">The judgment and order appealed from should, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
