Co., </em>34 Hun, 366; affirmed, 103 N. Y. 645; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Home Savings Bank, </em>130 Mass. 443; <em>Krulevitz </em>v. <em>Eastern R. R. Co., </em>140 Mass. 575; <em>Western News Co. </em>v. <em>Wilmarch, </em>33 Kan. 510.) If actions can be maintained against corporations for malicious prosecution, libel, assult and battery and other torts, we can perceive no reason for holding that actions may not be maintained against them for conspiracy. It is well settled by the authorities cited, that the malice and wicked intent needful to sustain such actions may be imputed to corporations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-6\">\u201c A careful scrutiny of the complaint in each action has convinced us that sufficient facts are alleged to show that the appellant was a party to the conspiracy set forth, and that sufficient facts are therefore alleged in the complaint to show a cause of action against it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with leave to the appellant to withdraw its demurrer and answer the complaint, upon payment within twenty days of the plaintiff\u2019s costs subsequent to the interposition of the demurrer.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b690-8\"><em>George J.
