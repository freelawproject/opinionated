His right to receive that sum was strenuously disputed and resisted by the defendant. The jury gave the plaintiff a verdict of only $200.47; but that balance was reached, by applying in diminution of the $1,465.47, the undisputed counter-claim of the defendant, amounting to the sum of $1,265; but for the allowance by the jury of the $1,465.47, the defendant would have had judgment for his counter-claim. The matter in controversy, therefore, under section 191 of the Code, is more than $500, and the case is appealable to this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b678-6\">\u201c Motion denied, with $10 costs.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b678-7\"><em>Theodore F.
