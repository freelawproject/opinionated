It is always competent to inquire what relations exist between a party and his witness, for the purpose of showing the motive and influence under which the evidence is given, and the existence of any bias or prejudice on the part of the witness. Such evidence, however, affects the credibility of the witness only, and if his evidence is wholly immaterial upon all of the material issues of the case an erroneous ruling upon such question furnished no valid reason for reversing the judgment. That was the case here. No material question of fact was controverted on the trial, and the evidence of the witness' could have been wholly stricken from the minutes without affecting the result in the least degree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-4\">\u201c The defendant was not prejudiced by the ruling and the judgment should, therefore, be affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b672-5\"><em>William F.
