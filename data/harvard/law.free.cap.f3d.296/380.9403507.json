GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">On October 3, 1992, Appellant Stuart H. Smith, Jr., was serving as third officer aboard an oceangoing cargo vessel berthed in the Port of New Orleans. Smith was employed by Waterman Steamship Corporation (\u201cWaterman\u201d), the owner and operator of the vessel. On that day, the vessel was undocking when it collided with the dock. The collision caused damage to both the vessel and the dock. Holding Smith responsible, Waterman fired him the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">At the time, Smith was a member of Appellee International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots (\u201cthe Union\u201d), which was party to a collective bargaining agreement between Waterman, among other employers. The agreement contained a grievance mechanism for solving labor-management disputes. Under the agreement, the Union had the right to bring a grievance either on its own behalf or on behalf of a member. The agreement further authorized the Union to pursue arbitration should the grievance procedure provide an unsatisfactory resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">On October 7, 1992, Smith contacted the Union and asked it to initiate grievance procedures with respect to his October 4 discharge. He claimed that the discharge was without cause. Smith and the Union, each through counsel, exchanged correspondence regarding the grievance for over a year. During that time, the Coast Guard began an investigation of the October 3 collision. The Union would not pursue Smith\u2019s grievance until it had received a complete report of the Coast Guard\u2019s investigation, which was not available until the Coast Guard completed its investigation in July of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">In July of 1993, Smith filed a lawsuit against Waterman. On January 11, 1994, the Union sent a letter to Smith\u2019s attorney, informing Smith that the Union would not pursue his grievance. According to the Union, Smith had abandoned the grievance procedure by not providing the Union with the Coast Guard\u2019s investigation report and by bringing litigation against Waterman on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-16\">Smith\u2019s lawsuit against Waterman failed on summary judgment. Smith later sought to have the judgment set aside, claiming there had been a fraud upon the court. The district court denied Smith\u2019s motion. Smith then turned to the Union, suing it for failing to pursue his grievance. The Union filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing only that the six-month statute of limitations specified in section 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b), is applicable to this case. The district court ruled Smith\u2019s claim to be an action for breach of the Union\u2019s duty of fair representation and agreed on the six-month statute of limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>tions. The district court also ruled that the Union breached its duty of fair representation to Smith. However, because the six-month statute of limitations had long since passed, the district court granted the Union\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Smith appeals the district court\u2019s application of the six-month statute of limitations. On cross-appeal, the Union objects to the district court\u2019s finding that it breached its duty of fair representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>See Green v. CBS, </em>286 F.3d 281, 283 (5th Cir.2002). Smith filed this claim pursuant to section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, and the district court found Smith\u2019s claim to be one for breach of the Union\u2019s duty of fair representation. We agree. When a \u201cunion representing the employee in the grievance/arbitration procedure acts in ... a discriminatory, dishonest, arbitrary, or perfunctory fashion,\u201d that union breaches its duty of fair representation. <em>DelCostello v. Int\u2019l Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 164, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983). Smith alleges damages arising out of the Union\u2019s refusal to pursue the grievance mechanism with respect to his October 4 discharge. He is clearly stating a claim for breach of the Union\u2019s duty of fair representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">There is no federal statute of limitations expressly applicable to a \u00a7 301 claim against an employer or to a fair representation claim against a union. Where there is no federal statute of limitations, federal courts will normally \u201cborrow\u201d from the most closely analogous state statute. <em>See DelCostello, </em>462 U.S. at 158, 103 S.Ct. 2281. Sometimes, however, state limitation periods do not provide a satisfactory means of enforcing federal law. Where state rules would be at odds with the purpose and operation of federal law, courts will draw statutes of limitations from either related federal statutes or from the federal common law. <em>See id. </em>at 162, 103 S.Ct. 2281. This is the case with respect to an employee\u2019s suit against his employer and his union, to which the six-month limitations period in \u00a7 10(b) applies. <em>See DelCostello, </em>462 U.S. at 155, 103 S.Ct. 2281; <em>Thomas v. LTV Corp., </em>39 F.3d 611, 622 (1994). As a formal matter, these suits are considered \u201chybrid\u201d suits comprising two separate causes of action. First, the employee alleges that the employer has violated \u00a7 301. Second, the employee alleges that the union has breached its duty of fair representation, which the Supreme Court has inferred from the scheme of the NLRA. See <em>DelCostello, </em>462 U.S. at 164, 103 S.Ct. 2281.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Given the <em>DelCostello </em>decision, the question here is whether the six-month limitations period in \u00a7 10(b) should apply to an employee\u2019s duty of fair representation claim against a union standing alone. We hold that it should. Although <em>DelCostello </em>is limited to hybrid cases, the Supreme Court analyzed the two causes of action separately, comparing each to a state-law analog and dismissing each analog as an unsatisfactory means of enforcing federal law. First, the Court found a claim for legal malpractice to be the closest state analogy to a federal duty of fair representation claim. <em>See </em>462 U.S. at 167, 103 S.Ct. 2281. Nevertheless, the Court dismissed the legal malpractice analogy as inadequate because it \u201csuffers from objections peculiar to the realities of labor relations and litigation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">The Court found \u00a7 10(b) to be a more suitable source from which to borrow a statute of limitations. <em>DelCostello, </em>462 U.S. at 169, 103 S.Ct. 2281. Section 10(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>establishes a six-month period for bringing charges of unfair labor practices to the National Labor Relations Board pursuant to section 8 of the NLRA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158. According to <em>DelCostello, </em>unfair labor practices are more analogous to breaches of a union\u2019s duty of fair representation than any other state parallel. <em>See </em>462 U.S. at 169, 103 S.Ct. 2281. Athough the Court did not necessarily define all breaches of a union\u2019s duty of fair representation as unfair labor practices, it did note that \u201cthe family resemblance\u201d between the two types of wrongdoing \u201cis undeniable and that indeed there is a substantial overlap.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170, 103 S.Ct. 2281.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The district court did not err in applying \u00a7 10(b)\u2019s six-month limitations period to Smith\u2019s claim. Smith himself asserts that he brought this claim under \u00a7 301, to which \u00a7 10(b) certainly applies. <em>See Del-Costello, </em>462 U.S. at 158 n. 12, 103 S.Ct. 2281. Furthermore, the district court correctly characterized it as a duty of fair representation claim. Following the logic of <em>DelCostello, </em>such a claim is also subject to the six-month limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Smith argues that \u00a7 10(b) cannot be applied to him because he was a supervisory employee. Smith\u2019s status as a supervisory employee is entirely irrelevant here because Smith brought this duty of fair representation claim under \u00a7 301. If Smith were a supervisory employee, he would be excluded from the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d under section 2(3) of the NLRA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3) (\u201cThe term \u2018employee\u2019 ... shall not include ... any individual employed as a supervisor.\u201d). This would preclude him from bringing an action against the Union for violation of \u00a7 8 of the NLRA. <em>See NLRB v. Southern Plasma Corp., </em>626 F.2d 1287, 1294-95 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Nonetheless, as a statute of limitations, \u00a7 10(b) applies only to particular causes of action, not to particular types of people. By its express terms, it applies to \u00a7 8 causes of action. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b). It applies to \u00a7 301 and duty of fair representation claims by analogy. <em>See DelCostello, </em>462 U.S. at 167, 103 S.Ct. 2281. Section 10(b)\u2019s six-month period of limitations applies to Smith\u2019s suit against the Union whether or not he was a supervisor. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s application of the six-month statute of limitations and its grant of summary judgment in favor of the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">On cross-appeal, the Union\u2019s argues that the district court erred by finding that it breached its duty of fair representation to Smith. The Union argues that the district court made its findings <em>sua sponte </em>and without notice in violation of Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See In re Hailey, </em>621 F.2d 169, 171-72 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Powell v. United States, </em>849 F.2d 1576, 1578-79 (5th Cir.1988). By affirming the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Union, we render moot the Union\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
