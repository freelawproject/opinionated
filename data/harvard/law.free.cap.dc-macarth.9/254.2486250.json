In the course of the proceedings $20,000 of these certificates were deposited with the clerk of the court, and it was also stipulated by the counsel on both sides that the defendant should deposit the remaining $5,000 of certificates and pay $1,000 in money to the plaintiff or his solicitors within fifteen days thereafter. The stipulation concluded in the following words :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-12\">\u201cAnd the plaintiff agrees that, upon this being done, the case shall be entered \u2018 settled by agreement between the parties,\u2019 and, further, that the $25,000 of Venezuelan certificates shall be held by the court subject to any claim to be made upon them by the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of John Clark\u2019s estate, or the assignee or creditors of that estate, or Mrs. Miller; such claims to be presented within thirty days after such payment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-13\">After the certificates had been fully deposited, and more than thirty days having transpired, and no claims having been presented by the administrator or creditors of the Clark estate, or by Mrs. Miller, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved the court for an order directing the delivery of such certificates to his solicitor of record. The motion was overruled, from which this appeal was taken by the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>B.

The refusal to deliver the certificates is an intermediate proceeding, and its regularity can only come before us for review on an appeal from the final l'udgment or decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">The appeal must therefore be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
