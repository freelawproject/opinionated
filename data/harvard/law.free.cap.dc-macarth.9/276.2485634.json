This motion was heard on the third day of May, 1875, before Justice Wylie, and overruled. The case comes before the general term on an appeal from this decision. An application is now made to dismiss such appeal, for the reason that the order made at the special term does not involve the merits of the action or proceeding. The court were of that opinion, and the appeal was accordingly dismissed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
