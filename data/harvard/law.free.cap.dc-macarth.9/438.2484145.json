Jaunana, and her presence there was the subject of official correspondence between the United States consul and the Brazilian government, and the latter formally protested against any interference with the Florida. Notwithstanding this protest, the Wachusett steamed for the Florida, \u201c struck her starboard quarter, cutting down her bulwarks, and carrying away her mizzenmasts and her main yards.\u201d A few shots having been exchanged, she was captured and brought to Hampton Roads, where she sprang a leak, and accidentally sunk, on the 28th of November, 1864, off Newport News.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-13\">The Brazilian government immediately demanded restoration as well as satisfaction for the violation of its neutrality. In reply to that demand, the Secretary of State for the United States answered, on the 26th of December, 1864, among other things, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-14\">\u201c The President disavows and regrets the proceedings at Bahia. He will suspend Captain Collins and direct him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>appear before a court-martial. * * * The consul at Bahia will therefore be dismissed. The flag of Brazil will receive from the United States Navy the honors customary in the intercourse of friendly maritime powers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">This official apology and disavowal of the acts of Commander Collins stated the grounds upon which it was made, as follows: \u201c The answer now given rests exclusively upon the ground that the capture of the Florida was an unauthorized, unlawful, and indefensible exercise of the naval force of the United States within a foreign country, in defiance of its established and duly-recognized government.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">In their diplomatic correspondence this Government also declared that they would have promptly returned* the Florida to the harbor of Bahia had she not been accidentally sunk while lying at anchor in Hampton Boads a few days after her arrival there. The United States consul at Bahia, who was implicated, was recalled; and Commander Collins was suspended and sent before a court-martial; and a salute was made to the Brazilian flag by a United States war-vessel in the port of Bahia, where her neutrality had been violated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-8\">On the 18th of August, 1862, the Secretary of the Navy issued general instructions to commanders and others for their guidance in the then pending war, which contained the following orders : \u201c You will exercise strict vigilance to prevent supplies of arms, munitions, and contraband of war from being conveyed to the insurgents, <em>but under no circumstances will you seize any vessel within the waters of a friendly </em>nation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-9\">On the 24th of April, 1S71, the libelant, Napoleon Collins, \u25a0commodore in the Navy of the United States, on behalf of himself and the officers and crew of the Wachusett, filed his \u25a0 libel in the district court of the District of Columbia, in admiralty, praying that court \u201cto condemn the said rebel steamer Florida, her tackle, apparel, and armament, and the value thereof, as good and lawful prize.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-10\">On the 3d of June, 1873, the district attorney, on behalf of the United States, moved the court to dismiss the libel for several reasons not necessary to state, as the motion to \u25a0dismiss was overruled, and the district attorney of the United States then answered the libel and presented a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>objections to this procedure; as, for instance, that the Florida was not brought into the proper court for adjudication; that the evidence to acquit or condemn must, in the flrst instance,. come from the papers and crew of the captured vessel; and until that is done, or proper excuse for not doing it has been furnished, there is no proper showing for the introduction of secondary proof. That there is no <em>res, </em>the property having been totally lost before it was brought in for adjudication,, and that the explanation of the long delay and of the failure to comply with the law of prize is that it was well understood that there was no lawful prize.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-6\">But the conclusion reached by the court renders a. fuller statement of these objections unnecessary, as the case was disposed of on another ground, viz, that the capture was unlawful, having been made within the waters of Brazil,, a neutral and friendly power. It is proper also to state that the safe of the Florida, containing gold, was captured on board, and the proceeds, amounting- to $20,399.43, were distributed among the officers and crew of the Wachusett by virtue of the seventh section of the act of July 28, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-7\">On the 2d of June, 1875, the district court decreed \u201cthat the steamer Florida, her armament, tackle, and apparel, be, and hereby is, declared good and lawful prize to the United States of America; that the libelants are the captors, as set forth in the said libel, and entitled to participate in the proceeds as shall be hereafter ordered.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-8\">And from this an appeal has been taken to the genera! term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-9\"><em>B. F. Butler, </em>of Massachusetts, <em>William F. Chandler, </em>and <em>Frank W. Hackett </em>for libelants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-10\">The alleged violation of the neutrality of Brazil is no defense to this' libel. This is an objection which the neutral' nation alone can interpose. <em>The Lillie, 2 </em>Sprague, 177; <em>The Sir William Peel, </em>5 Wall., 517; <em>The Adela, </em>6 Wall., 266.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-11\">In <em>The Anna, 3 </em>Wheat., 435, it was held that even a consul, unless specially authorized by his government, cannot interpose a claim of violated sovereignty. <em>The Sancta Trinita, </em>cited in a note to <em>The Anna, </em>shows that the French law is like the English and American in this particular.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>During the Crimean war, English armed ships seized certain Russian merchantmen lying in the neutral port of Libau, Prussia. The prizes, not being fit to make the voyage to. England, were taken to Memel, where they remained to await the decision of the court. There were no papers and no prisoners. The Queen\u2019s advocate moved to condemn the vessels and decree their sale in Memel, stating that an intimation had been received from the Prussian government that no objection would be made, provided they were sold by private-contract, without being advertised or put up at auction. While expressly disclaiming to cr eate a precedent for the condemnation of a prize while lying in a neutral port, the court said the case was exceptional and pec uliar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-6\"><em>The </em>Polka, 1 Spink, 447.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-7\">But it is objected that the Florida was captured in direct violation of the orders of the Secretary of the Navy, and that her capture was therefore illegal and void. To distribute the proceeds of the sale of this vessel as prize would be to reward officers for disobedience of orders.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-8\">The orders of the Secretary are mere re gulations for the discipline of the Navy. Their violation subjects the offender to a court-martial. \u201c If the sovereign should, by a special order, authorize the capture of neutral property for a cause manifestly unfounded in the law of nations, it would afford a complete justification of the captors in all tribunals of prize.\u201d Story, J., in <em>Maisonnaire </em>vs. Keating, 2 Gall., 325. But the orders of the Secretary of the Navy can go no further than, international law itself in stamping the capture with illegality. Commander Collins was found guilty by a court-martial of disobeying the orders of the Secretary. The sentence of dismissal was not approved by the Secretary. So-long as Brazil was satisfied, the Navy Department and the country were glad the' capture was made. This alleged violation of the orders of the Department cannot be set ups therefore, except by the Brazilian government. It is only another form of insisting that neutral rights were invaded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-9\">This objection is completely removed by the action of Congress upon the 2Sth of July, 1868. By the seventh section of' the civil appropriation act of that date, it was enacted as. follows: That the Secretary of the Navy be, and he is hereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>authorized to dispose of the property saved from the rebel steamer Florida, aud distribute the proceeds thereof as other prize-money is required by law to be distributed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-6\"><em>H. H. Wells, </em>district attorney, for the United States:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-7\">This seizure was unauthorized and illegal, because, in the \u2022first instance, it was in violation of the law of nations, by which all belligerents are governed. All captures made by armed vessels stationed in a bay or river, or in the mouth of a river, or iu the harbor of a neutral state, for the purpose of \u2022exercising the right of war from this station, are absolutely illegal and void. Lawrence\u2019s Wheaton, 716, note 216. <em>The Vrow Anne Katherina, </em>5 Robinson\u2019s Admr,, 15 ; <em>The Anne, </em>3 <em>ib., </em>373; <em>The Two Gebroders, ib., </em>162; Halleck\u2019s Int. Law, 520; 1 Kent\u2019s Com., 120; 3 Philli. Int. Law, sec. 154; Manning\u2019s Law of Nations, 186, 386.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-8\">This seizure was illegal, in the next place, because it was not only in violation of the law of nations, but it was also forbidden by the general laws and regulations of the United States, and especially was it iu violation of the particular-orders and instructions, before referred to, given by! the Secretary of the Navy, on August IS, 1862, for the government of all officers and the crews of ships in the naval service of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-9\">\u201c You will exercise strict vigilance to prevent supplies of arms, munitions, and contraband of war from being conveyed to the insurgents, <em>but under no circumstances will you seise any vessel within the waters of a friendly nation]' </em>was the emphatic language and the authoritative order legally issued by the superior of the libelants in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-10\">It will not do, in reply, to say that this order of the Secretary of the Navy was a mere regulation for the discipline \u2022of the Navy, for there was no law of nations, nor any law of the United States, authorizing this capture, nor does the view presented by the libelant in the fourth subdivision of his brief find any support in the language used by Mr. Justice Story in <em>Maisonnaire </em>vs. <em>Keating, </em>2 Gall., 335; for while it is undoubtedly true that an order of the sovereign, manifestly unwarranted, would afford <em>protection </em>to the captors, here there was no order, direction, or authority given by the Gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ernment of the United States, or any authorized officer of it, to make this illegal and unauthorized seizure. There was, however, an unlawful seizure, made in <em>violation of </em>orders, \u2022and the wrong-doer is claiming bounty of his government for such violation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-6\">This claim receives no support whatever from section 7 of the act of July 28,1866. That section did not relate or in any way have reference to the maintenance of any action or suit for prize. It simply authorized the Secretary of the Navy to \u2022distribute the proceeds of the gold taken from the Florida as prize-money in a case of prize is lawfully distributed. In other words, it was an act of grace, a gratuity, and not a right which the captors could command at law; on the contrary, if a libel for prize could have been maintained, then the act was unnecessary.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b453-7\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The justices who heard this case are unanimously of'opinion that the steamer Florida cannot be condemned as lawful prize. It is admitted that she was captured within the jurisdiction of the government of Brazil, then a neutral and friendly power. The capture was-therefore illegal; and that government having demanded indemnity and restitution, and the authorities of the United States having acknowledged the wrong and made satisfactory reparation, that circumstance has concluded all rights of captors, and there the matter ought to rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The decree be\u00edow must be reversed and the libel dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
