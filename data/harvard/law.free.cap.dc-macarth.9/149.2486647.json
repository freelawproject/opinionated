Niedringhaus made the following application for a design patent:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-15\">\u201c <em>To all whom it may concern:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-16\">\u201cBe it known that we, Frederick G. Niedringhaus and William F. Niedringhaus, both of the city and county of Saint Louis, State of Missouri, have invented and produced a new and original design of ornament or pattern to be printed, painted, or otherwise placed on, or marked into, the various articles of enameled iron-ware made and sold by us.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-17\">\u201cThe nature and general characteristics, as to outline, are distinctly shown, and clearly appear in and by the photographic illustration hereto annexed, to which reference is hereby made. The article itself, however, when completed, presents to the eye a beautifully-mottled appearance, resembling granite in color, which the illustration fails to exhibit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\u201cIt is this peculiar mottled appearance-which constitutes the chief merit of our design, and it is on this we place most importance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">\u201c What we claim as our invention, and desire to secure by letters-patent, is\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-7\">\u201c The design for enameled iron-ware, substantially as shown and described.\u201d.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-8\">The application was rejected by the examiners-in-chief and the Commissioner of Patents for want of patentability, and the applicants took an appeal under the statute to this court, and assigned for reasons of appeal that the Commissioner erred in holding that the subject-matter of the application was not patentable, and that the design lacked novelty. The question presented is whether this is a new design within the statute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-9\">Charles D. Moody, of Saint Louis, for appellants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-10\">First. To the issue of novelty we reply:</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-11\"><em>(a.) </em>That the peculiar appearance presented by the exhibit <em>is </em>novel; that its ornamentation is unique; and that never before in \u201c'wall-paper,\u201d on \u201c wooden mantels,\u201d \u201coutside of houses,\u201dor elsewhere, has that unique ornamentation been anticipated. In passing on this point, it must be borne in mind that the ornamentation in question is produced by a high degree of heat; that in its production certain ingredients are fused; that the result is a peculiarly spotted enamel, having a darker spot on, or rather in, a lighter background, and all having a bright distinctive expression, which never has been produced in oil or water colors in connection with the articles cited, or even in the art of marbling slate or iron. For none of these arts, owing to the fact that in them the colors are oil colors, and are not fused into each other and upon each other, but are simply mixed, and then, (in the case of marbled slate,) set by a slight degree of heat, produce any ornamentation, which, if painted or placed on iron, would or does, produce a result which an ordinary observer would mistake for the exhibit. In other words, we contend that the peculiar pattern worked into exhibit has not been shown in \u201cwall-paper,\u201d and that, if an ordinary stew-pan were covered with paper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>having a mottled grey pattern thereon, an ordinary purchaser would not be misled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-6\">(&amp;.) We reply further, admitting \u201c wall-paper,\u201d &amp;c., to have been similarly ornamented, is this a sufficient answer, unless it is further shown that enameled iron-ware has been similarly ornamented.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-7\">We hold not; for in <em>Gorham Company </em>vs. <em>White, </em>14 Wall., 524, (the leading case on design-patents,) it is \u2022stated: \u201c They contemplate not so much utility as appearance ; and that <em>not </em>an abstract impression, but an aspect .given to those objects mentioned in the arts.\u201d Further, on page 525, * * * \u201cis that which gives a peculiar or distinctive appearance to the manufacture or article to which it may be applied.\u201d * <em>* * </em>\u201c That giving certain new and original appearances to a manufactured article may enhance \u2022its salable value, may enlarge the demand for it,\u201d &amp;c. * <em>* * </em>\u00ab Jt is the appearance itself) therefore, no matter by what agency caused,\u201d &amp;c. * * # # \u201c But in whatever way produced, it is the new thing or product which the patent law regards.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-8\">It will be observed that the court is careful to say that the \u25a0designas an \u201cabstract impression\u201d must not be \u201ccontem. plated,\u201d but the \u201c aspect \u201d given to the \u201cobject\u201d bearing the \u2022design. For this we also contend. A design shown on wallpaper must not be contemplated in the abstract. We must only contemplate the aspect given to the exhibit. In. other words, if enameled iron-ware, having this design upon it, can, by an ordinary purchaser, be distinguished from other enameled iron-ware, we are within the statute. It matters not if the design has been previously used; if now combined with an \u201cobject\u201d with which it has not been hitherto combined, and if, as a result of such association, a new and distinctive aspect is given to such object, the law is complied with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-9\">Second. But, admitting the novelty of the design, it has further been contended by the principal examiner and examiners-in-chief that no \u201cinvention\u201d is \u201cinvolved;\u201d that \u201c genius \u201d is wanting; and the case of Weinberg (Commissioner\u2019s Decisions, 1871) \u201c is in point.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-10\">The decision in this case was in answer to the question, \u25a0\u201c Can color, &amp;c., form the proper subject for a design-patent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>and how far, if at all ?\u201d After preliminary remarks touching the meaning of the words \u201c invented \u201d and \u201c produced,\u201d the Commissioner proceeds to state that while \u201cnot prepared to-say that no design-patent could be based on colors,\u201d (it apparently would be difficult to distinguish a carpet-design but for its colors,) \u201c a <em>mere </em>substitution of one color for another possesses no originality, and indicates no exercise of genius, and cannot, therefore, become the subject of a patent, neither can any blending or arrangement of colors, unless a new Eesthetieal effect is produced.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-6\">Produced how ? Produced upon what? Produced in the-abstract or in the concrete ? Produced upon things in general or upon the article particularly shown ? Produced as a <em>mere </em>color or blending or arrangement of colors; or as a design, applied so as to give a distinctive appearance to an object? Clearly the latter. The only question remaining,, then, is to inquire whether a new iesthetieal effect is now and here given to <em>enameled iron-ware. </em>If such be the fact, then, we submit, we are entitled to a patent.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-7\"><em>William H. Doolittle </em>for the Commissioner:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-8\">The object of the law in granting patents for designs is to foster and encourage the decorative arts. The same requirements, however, as to <em>novelty and originality </em>in the subject-matter and <em>the exercise of invention </em>in its production apply to design-patents as well as to what are known as mechanical or functional patents. Say the United States Supreme Court: \u201c Thelaw manifestly contemplates that giving certain new and original appearances to a manufactured article may enhance its salable value, may enlarge the demand for it,, and may be a meritorious service to the public. It therefore proposes to secure for a limited time to the <em>ingenious-producer </em>of those appearances the advantages flowing from them.\u201d <em>Gorham Manufacturing Company </em>vs. White, (14 Wall., 511.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-9\">The distinctive <em>appearance </em>which a design presents to the eye alone constitutes its patentable merit. On this point the court, in the case just cited, said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-10\">\u201cManifestly the mode in which those appearances are produced has very little, if anything, to do with giving increased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>salableness to the article. It is the appearance itself which attracts attention and calls out favor or dislike. It is the appearance itself, therefore, no matter by what agency caused, that constitutes mainly, if not entirely, the contribution to the public which the laws deem worthy of recompense. The appearance may be the result of peculiarity of configuration, or of ornament alone, or of both <em>conjointly} </em>but, in whatever way produced, it is the new thing, or product, which the patent law regards. To speak of the invention as a combination or process, or to treat it as such, is to overlook its peculiarities. As the acts of-Congress embrace only designs applied, or to be applied, they must refer <em>to finished products of invention </em>rather than to the process of finishing them, or to the agencies by which they are developed. A patent for a product is a distinct thing from a patent for the elements entering into it, or for the ingredients of which it is composed, or for the combination that causes it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-6\">The <em>appearance </em>which constitutes the present alleged invention consists, according to the description of the specification-of \u201ca beautifully-mottled appearance, resembling granite in color,\u201d applied to enameled iron-ware. This is solely in imita tion, and without the slightest exercise of invention evinced in the idea of its application. The mottled appearance resembling granite in color is a very old and well known device in the decorative arts. Enameled iron plates, made to imitate marble mantels for fire-places, tables, &amp;c., almost equal in beauty to the originals, have long been produced. The enameling of metals in various colors is an art of great antiquity, and reached its greatest perfection in Europe during the Middle Ages. The Venetians to this day supply other nations with the best kinds of enamel of every colored shade. Enameled iron-ware for domestic purposes is an art of later date, and patents for such processes were commenced to be granted in England about the close of the last century. (See Enameling, Ure\u2019s Dictionary of Arts, G45; Chambers\u2019s Encyclopedia, vol. 4.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-7\">The applicant may have discovered a new combination of ingredients or some new process of applying it, but, as already shown, new ingredients, combinations, or processes have nothing to do with the subject of a design-patent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Having been impressed upon innumerable articles before, to put this appearance for the first time upon the present article is a mere double use of an old device. The requirements of the law, that the impression \u201cinvented and produced\u201d should be a \u201cnew and original one,\u201d implies that the doctrine of double use, the mere application of an old device to a new purpose, is as pertinent an objection to an application for a design-patent, where such use is set forth, as to an application for a functional patent. And this provision is not \u201c inconsistent \u201d with others of the title relating to designs. The color or impression in question is now the common property of mankind, to be used in any way, or upon any article, their fancy may dictate. To give to any one person, then, its exclusive use upon an important class of manufactures would be to thwart the object of the patent laws, and establish a monopoly truly odious. <em>Smith </em>vs. Elliot, 5 Fish. Pat. Cas., 315.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b164-6\">Mr. Justice MacArthur</author>\n<p id=\"Aho\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">This is an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, refusing a design-patent in enameled iron-ware to Frederick G. Neidriughaus and William F. Neidringkaus. The statute in regard to design-patents reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">\u201c Any person who, by his own industry, genius, efforts, and expense, has <em>invented and produced </em>any <em>new and original </em>design for a manufacture, bust, statute, alto-relievo, or basrelief; any <em>new and original </em>design for the printing of woolen, silk, cotton, or other fabrics; any <em>new and original </em>impression, ornament, pattern, print, or picture to be printed, painted, cast, or otherwise placed on or worked into any article of manufacture; or any new, useful, and original shape or configuration of any article of manufacture, <em>the same not having been known or used by others before his invention or production thereof, or patented or described in any printed </em>publication, may, upon payment of the fee prescribed, and other due proceedings had the same as in cases of inventions or discoveries, obtain a patent therefor.\u201d Sec. 4929, U. S. Eevised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">In their specification the applicants claim to have invented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>and produced a new and original design of ornament or pattern, to be printed, painted, or otherwise placed on or marked into the various articles of enameled iron-ware which they make and sell. A photograph is annexed to illustrate the outline. They also say that \u201c the article itself, however, when completed, presents to the eye a beautifully-mottled appearance, resembliug granite in color, which the illustration fails to exhibit. It is this peculiar mottled appearance which constitutes the chief merit of our design, and it is on this we jfiace most importance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The primary examiner, the examiners-in-chief, and the Commissioner have all concurred in refusing the application for the patent. The Commissioner, in his decision, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\u201c I concur in the opinion of the examiners-in-chief, so far as want of patentability in the general subject-matter embraced by the application is concerned. The so-called design is effected by printing, painting, or in any other way placing upon iron-ware a peculiarly mixed color. The enameling of iron-ware in various colors is an art well known. If applicant has achieved anything new, it is to be found in the mixing of colors, by which he produces a mottled appearance having the effect of granite coloring. If he has, in this way, \u25a0obtained a new paint, it may or may not be patentable; but the application of such paint in an ordinary way does not constitute the subject-matter of a design-patent, even under the most liberal construction of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The court are unanimously of the opinion that the decison of the Commissioner ought to be affirmed. The art of enameling has been practiced for many centuries, and the different kinds of enamel have been produced in every variety of shade and color. The materials used for the purpose of coloring and the process by which they are fused have been known so long, that to change them requires only the taste and skill of one engaged in the business. The appellants, of course, do not mean to claim any exclusive title to what is so well known. But their specification certainly seems to suggest that the change of color \u201c resembling granite \u201d imparts great value to their invention. They say \u201c the mottled appearance, which constitutes the chief merit of our design, and it is on this we place the most importance.\u201d The specimen of enam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>eled iron ware exhibited by counsel on the argument was of a color resembling granite, and was marked by spots of different shades darker than granite. The enamel and coloring substances are manifestly liquefied by intense heat, such as enamelers use, until they are completely fused, and they are- laid upon the iron-ware while in this condition. The spots are then formed at random, in larger and smaller patches, without regard to regularity or design of any kind. No two of the articles are alike, except in color and general appearance. It is undoubtedly ornamental to the article,, and has a pleasing effect on the eye. This is equally true of the hundreds of objects upon which this art is employed. Ornamental work in great variety and paintings that never lose their freshness are executed in enamel. Indeed, the primary object of this art is to impart greater luster and beauty to every article of luxury or utility to which it is applied. A beautiful appearance is not in itself patentable. The design must be new and original, and the work of invention and genius. The ingenuity and taste of workers in enamel are quite wonderful to all but those employed in it; but no one would imagine that these exhibitions of skill in giving beautiful forms or colors to their productions was the kind of invention to be protected by the law. They are the common efforts of persons ordinarily skilled in the art. The appellants contend in their brief that \u201c it matters not if the design has been iDreviously used, if now combined with an \u2018 object\u2019 with which it has not been hitherto combined, and if, as a result of such association, a new and distinctive aspect is given to such object, the law is complied with,\u201d and refers to former decisions by the Commissioner of Patents as cases in point. We cannot concur in this view. The thing provided for in the law is in express language \u201c any new and original design for a manufacture,\u201d \u201cany new and original design for printing, \u201d \u201c any new and original impression, \u201d \u201c any new, useful, and original shape,\u201d \u201c the same not having been known or used by others before his invention or production thereof.\u201d The use of an old design upon an old object, is clearly excluded by the statute, and mere changes or \u201c double use \u201d cannot receive its protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Besides, it is now well understood that the same degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>originality is required in both design and functional patents. That is, the claim must not be for a copy or imitation of what is already in existence. If, for instance, the applicants should \u25a0manufacture their iron-ware with a figure of the statue of the Three Graces, it might improve the appearance of the article, but would scarcely entitle them to the benefits of a patent. To manufacture it with enamel is a change of the same kind; for the same thing has been performed on metals from time immemorial. To give the enamel any particular -color is a matter of ordinary skill and taste. The coloring substances have always been fused with the enamel in the heat of the furnace. We can therefore observe nothing in the present specifications to which the term invention can be .applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">I am aware that the Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>Gorham Company </em>vs. <em>White, </em>14 Wall., 524, have said, in regard to design-patents, that \u201cthey contemplate not so much utility as appearance, and that not an abstract impression, but an aspect given to those objects mentioned in the arts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">That was an action brought for the infringement of a design-patent for the handles of table spoons and forks. The design consisted in the configuration of the spoon and the ornamentation of the handle. The outline and all the details ofthedesignwerenewand,invariableinsuchspoon, alike. No question was discussed as to the originality of the patent, for it had never been known before; and the court decided that the article manufactured and sold by the defendant did not differ substantially from plaintiff\u2019s, and that it was therefore an infringement. But the whole tenor of the decision is to the effect that the appearance or aspect of the object must be of a design that is new and original. Indeed, no other view is admissible, for such is the express requirement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
