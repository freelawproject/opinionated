Ashford, esq., and R. K. Elliot, esq., who had been appointed trustees in chancery, cause No. 3509, pending in this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-12\">The answers of the garnishees admitted that they held a balance of $446 and upward, being part of the proceeds of the interest of the defendant in the ground and premises described in said cause 3509, and which they had sold under the decree therein, but they also state that the same was subject to the lien of defendant\u2019s solicitors in said cause. A reference to the proceedings in said equity cause 3509 discloses the facts relative to the creation of the fund in the hands of the garnishees and of its liability to attachment. The bill was filed therein December 10,1873, from which it appears that Lamon, the now defendant, became the purchaser of the real estate therein described at a confiscation sale, and consequently took a life-interest, <em>per autre vie, </em>in the property. But all the parties interested in the estate, for the purposes of paying off taxes and incumbrances, and dividing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the proceeds equitably between them, agreed that the property should be sold, and thereupon a decree to that end was passed, and the defendant, Lamon, was allowed, in lieu of his estate <em>per autre vie, </em>three-tenths of the gross proceeds of such sale; and on December 22,1874, a final decree was passed, making distribution of the proceeds of the sale on that basis. The property having been sold on the 8th day of January, the trustee reported the amount realized to be $6,500, and on the \u25a0same day, by consent, his report was ratified and confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">In the final decree there is no mention made of an attorney\u2019s lien, and no provision in relation thereto. The attachments above mentioned were laid upon the balance of the proceeds of sale, coming to Lamon, still in the hands of the trustees. Before these proceedings were instituted, Van Riswick\u2019s judgment had been recovered and had become a lien on the interestof Lamon in this property, and Messrs. Davidge and Wilson assert an attorney\u2019s lien upon the fund attached for professional services rendered Lamon in the above-mentioned equity suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">The present proceeding is a motion to quash the attachments ; and, in support thereof, affidavits are filed in regard to the lien of Davidge and Wilson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">The court below decided\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-9\">1. That the attachment was properly laid in the hands of the chancery trustee; but\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-10\">2. That the lien asserted by the attorneys was superior to the claim made by the attaching and judgment creditor, and: was entitled to priority in satisfaction. Both sides thereupon \u25a0appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-11\"><em>T. A. Lambert, </em>for plaintiff, presented a brief, from which we abstract\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-12\">1. <em>As to the attachable character of the fund.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-13\">This is dependent upon its predicament at the moment the writ was served. If, at that time, the money was still under the control of the court, and the trust unexecuted, its amenity to attachment might be a question of serious doubt. On the other hand, <em>if distribution had been finally made, </em>and the trustee, with the fund in his hand, and not brought into court, <em>was directed to apply the same according to such distribution, </em>its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>liability to attachment cannot be successfully controverted. <em>Cockney </em>vs. Leister, 12 Md., 129; <em>Langdon </em>vs. <em>Luckett, </em>6 Ala., 727; <em>McLaughlin </em>vs. <em>Swann, </em>18 How., 217.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-6\">2, As <em>to the lien asserted by the attorneys.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-7\">This was either <em>special </em>or <em>general.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-8\">If the former, possession of the fund by the attorneys was essential to its successful assertion. This possession, we have seen, they did not have at the time of attachment, nor, in fact, did they ever have it. <em>Wherefore their lien, if it exists at all, is general in character, and strictly subordinate to the pre-existing rights of the judgment-creditor. Hought </em>vs. <em>Edwards, </em>1 H. &amp; N., 171; <em>Walker </em>vs. <em>Sergeant, </em>14 Vt., 247.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-9\">The lien of an attorney, while it binds his client, <em>shall not be permitted to vary </em>or <em>affect </em>the <em>rights of third parties. Gager </em>vs. <em>Watson, </em>11 Conn., 173; <em>Ramsill </em>vs. <em>Huntington, 5 </em>Day, 163; <em>Andrews </em>vs. <em>Morse, </em>12 Conn., 446; <em>Forsyth </em>vs. <em>Beveridget 52 </em>Ill., 268; S. C., 4 Am. R., 612.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-10\">The judgment recovered by the attaching creditor in 1870 was doubtless a statutory lien upon defendant\u2019s interest in the property sold. The conversion of that interest into money, by the medium of sale, in nowise impaired the operation of this lien. In fact, the fund, in its present predicament, can be regarded no otherwise than as the land itself; liable, like it, to be applied in satisfaction of the earliest existing, valid incumbrance, and, like it, wholly insusceptible of being affected by the lien of an attorney. <em>Small </em>vs. <em>Clark, </em>22 Vt., 928; <em>Davidson </em>vs. <em>Clayland, </em>1 H. &amp; J., 550.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-11\">The claim for a lien of this nature grows out of the creation of a fund. Wherefore, such claims are usually made by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. The right of the defendant\u2019s attorneys bears no resemblance to the lien of the plaintiff\u2019s; <em>e. g., </em>the former has no such interest in the suit as to prevent parties-from compromising it without his consent. <em>Quested </em>vs. Col<em>lis, </em>10 M. &amp; W., 19.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-12\"><em>Walter D. Davidge </em>and <em>S. Wilson </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b184-13\">t Mr. Justice Wylie,</author>\n<p id=\"A5M\">after stating the case, announced the decision of the court to the effect following:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">The question arising upon a consideration of the facts is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>whether the plaintiff, who was a judgment-creditor of the defendant long before the proceedings for the sale of the property took place, has a preferable lien upon the proceeds of the sale, or whether that preference belongs to the attorney of Lamon, by whom the proceedings were instituted and conducted which resulted in such sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Although the circumstances surrounding the case are somewhat complicated, this is the main question: Van Eiswick had a lien, by virtue of his judgment, upon the defendant\u2019s interest in the real estate, which could not be divested by the sale without his consent. By the decree in the equity suit the proceeds of the sale-were to be distributed among those entitled, precisely according to the liens thereon as they existed upon the property before it was sold. The conclusion to which we have all come, therefore, is that Van Eiswick is entitled to the money, and that his claim must take priority over any claim of Lamon\u2019s solicitors for their professional services.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">We are also of opinion that as the money in the present case was a balance in the hands of the garnishees, due the defendant, the attachment was properly laid, for the trustee had performed the trust, with the exception of passing this balance to whom it belonged.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The decision of the court below, overruling the motion to quash, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
