Thomas, the son, is now deceased, and his surviving children are parties complainant. Margaret A., one of the daughters, intermarried with the defendant, Hollis Amidon. At the time of his death, George Milburn was seized of all of said square 464, and his widow and executrix had disposed of all of said square under the powers conferred in the will, except a part of lot 11 therein, which she conveyed to the defendant, Hollis Amidon and Margaret A. Amidon, his then wife, who was one of the daughters of the said testator. The deed was dated the 19th of November, 1866, and is in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-8\">This indenture, made this 19th day of November, 1866, between Margaret Milburn, widow of the late George Milburn, of the first part, and Hollis Amidon and Margaret, his wife, of the second part: Whereas the said George Milburn, by his will, did will and bequeath as follows: \u201cI will and bequeath,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-9\">\u201cAnd whereas, under and by virtue of the said authority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>the said party of the first part hath already made provision for all the children of the said George Milburn, excepting the party of the second part, who is one of the daughters of the said George Milburn, and intermarried with the said Hollis Amidon, and it is but just and right that a similar provision should be made for her, so as to place her upon a footing with the other children :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">\u201cAnd whereas, taking into consideration the improvements-which have been and are now being made by the parties of the second, part at their own expense upon the hereinafter-described premises, and the fact of their having contributed to the support of the party of the first part, and of their engagement to contribute the same during her life, the said premises would be about equal to that of each of the respective shares already conveyed to the other children:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\">\u201c Now, this indenture witnesseth that the said party of the first part, in consideration of the premises and of the sum of five dollars, paid by the parties of the second part, doth hereby grant, &amp;c., all that part of lot No. 11, (describing the premises in controversy:)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-8\">\u201c To have and to hold the said lot of land and premises, together with, &amp;c., unto the said Hollis Amidon and Margaret, his wife, their heirs and assigns, forever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-9\">Margaret A. Amidon died intestate and without issue in December, 1869, and the widow also departed this life in 1874. The complainants now claim that the lot of land pretended to have been conveyed to Amidon and wile descended to the heirs at law of the testator, and that, on the death of said Margaret A. Amidon intestate and without issue, that conveyance became null and inoperative; that, therefore, the complainants, as such heirs, are entitled to have the same canceled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-10\">The bill was demurred to, and the case is certified to the general term to be heard in the first instance.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-11\"><em>L.

The powers of Margaret Milburn, executrix, were derived from the will. She could, therefore, do no valid act beyond its authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-6\">3. The execution of the deed dated 19th of November, A. D. 1866, by Margaret Milburn, executrix, to defendant, Hollis Amidon and Margaret A. Amidon, his wife, so far as Hollis Amidon is concerned, was <em>eos </em>abundanti, and conferred no interest in the lan,d.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-7\">4. Upon the death of said Margaret A. Amidon, (3d December, 1869,) <em>intestate </em>and <em>without issue, </em>the real estate sought to have been conveyed by the deed aforesaid descended to the heirs at law of said testator, whose rights thereto cannot be divested or impaired by the unauthorized acts of the executrix.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-8\"><em>Edwin L.

This conveyance passed the fee under that clause of the .will which empowers the grantor <em>to do with the estate as she may think best for her interest and the interest of the </em>children. See 8 Vin. Ab., 235, 236; <em>Goodtitle </em>vs. <em>Otway, </em>2 Wilson, 6; 2 Powell on Devises, 410-12; 1 Sugden on Powers, chap. 4, sec. 1; <em>Cummings </em>vs. <em>Shaw, </em>108 Mass., 159; <em>Lambert\u2019s Lessee </em>vs. <em>Paine, </em>3 Cranch, 97; <em>King </em>vs. <em>Ackerman, </em>2 Black, 408; <em>Norcum </em>vs. <em>D\u2019Oench and Ringling, 17 </em>Mo., 98.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-11\">2. There are many cases in which an express estate for life has been held enlarged to a fee by words in a will having the same effect as those contained in this will. See, among other cases, <em>Hogan </em>vs. <em>Jackson, </em>1 Cowper, 299; <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Stenlake, </em>12 East, 515; <em>Helmer </em>vs. Shoemaker, 22 Wend., 137; <em>Jackson </em>vs. <em>Robbins, </em>16 Johns., 537, particularly p. 583, <em>et seq.; Doebler\u2019s Appeal, </em>64 Penn. St., 9; <em>Geyer </em>vs. <em>Wentzel, </em>68 Penn St., 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-12\">3. Moreover, the power to appoint to children is substantially complied with. <em>Bristow </em>vs. <em>Warde, </em>2 Ves. jr., 349.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b238-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The right of Margaret Milbnrn to convey the real estate described in the deed to Amidon may be derived from that clause of the will which authorizes and empowers her to do with the estate what she may think best for her interest and the interest of her children. There can be little doubt that it was the intention of the testator to give his wife an estate for life, with a power to convey the fee. The conveyance can also be regarded as the execution of a power contained in the will, or as a substantial fulfillment of the direction to convey to the children as they come of age or be married. The recital in the deed that the real estate it conveyed was only a just portion to one of the children of the testator and her hnsband, with the additional consideration that the grantees undertook to contribute to her future support, as they had done previously to the conveyance. This arrangement for her own support she was certainly able to make in the due exercise of the discretion conferred by the will, in her own interest as well as that of the daughter and her husband, to whom the real estate was conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">We think the demurrer ought to be sustained and the bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
