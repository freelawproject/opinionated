At the trial, the deposition of one Mansfield, offered by the defendant, was objected to on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>the taking of it was not duly notified to the plaintiff. It appeared that notice was given to Kilborn Whitman, esquire, as the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The action was removed to this Court by demurrer to the plea, with a reservation of the right to plead anew. The demurrer was signed by Whitman as attorney to the plaintiff, and the next day or next but one, and during the same term of the Court, the notice was served upon Whitman. There was no other evidence that he was the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. <em>Morton </em>J. overruled the objection. A verdict was returned for the defendant.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b151-10\"><em>Oct. </em>21st.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b151-12\">\n<em>Oct. 22d.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-3\"><em>K. </em>Whitman, in support of a motion for a new trial,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ac6l\">insisted that the deposition was taken without legal notice; that he could make affidavit that the plaintiff had never spoken to him concerning the action before he signed the demurrer, but that being acquainted with the plaintiff, he signed it as a mere formal thing, supposing there had been an agreement to bring the action up by demurrer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-4\"><em>L.
