A trial was had before <em>Parker </em>C. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFU\">The plaintiffs derived their title under a deed from G. Green and W. Sumner (who were owners of the whole water-course) to George Sumner, dated March 6, 1814, granting the \u201c privilege of taking the water from the flume that the said Green and Sumner may build for the use of a cotton factory, and when there is more water than is sufficient for said cotton factory, then said George S. to have the privilege of conveying the water from said flume in a penstock, and privilege of digging a ditch through the land of said Green and Sumner for the purpose of carrying water to the above granted tract of land sufficient for any works except a grist-mill or saw-mill.\u201d The residue of Green and Sumner\u2019s land and water privilege, together with a cotton factory which they erected, was after-wards conveyed to the defendant. The plaintiffs dug a trench by which they conducted the water from the flume of the factory to their mill. In dry seasons there was at times a deficiency of water for the factory, and on such occasions the occupants used to request the occupants of the fulling-mill to shut their gate ; which was always done. On the 13th of Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>ber, 1826, the defendant requested the plaintiffs to shut their gate, stating that there was not water enough to carry the works of the factory; which they refused to do, alleging that there was no deficiency of water ; whereupon the defendant closed up the end, of his flume so as to prevent the water from running through the plaintiffs\u2019 trench to their mill. The board used for this purpose was knocked away several times, but was immediately replaced ; and the water was thus stopped from the 26th of September to the 3d of November.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b43-13\">\n<em>Oct. 2d.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b43-14\">\n<em>Oct. 3d.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-3\">The jury were instructed, that as the defendant had undertaken to stop the water in its course to the plaintiff\u2019s mill, on the allegation that there was a deficiency of water for his works, it was his duty to open the passage whenever the necessity should cease ; and that if the jury believed there was no necessity at the time when the water was stopped, or that the necessity had ceased at any time during the continuance of the interruption, they should return a verdict for the plaintiffs. A verdict being found for the plaintiffs, the defendant excepted to the foregoing instruction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-4\"><em>Hoar, Newton </em>and Bottom,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9p\">in support of the exception, cited <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Battelle, </em>15 Mass.
