A sale was accordingly made to the plaintiff, as alleged in the declaration. The plaintiff had never demanded a deed of the defendant, nor had the defendant or his deputy made the requisite returns to the clerk of the District Court. The verdict was for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-5\"><em>Newton, </em>for the plaintiff, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGh\">that the 24th section of the Act of Congress above mentioned, which provides that the lax shall remain a lien on the land of the individual who may be assessed for the same, during two years after the time it shall become due and payable, was not intended to prevent a sale by the collector after that period, where the land had not been alienated by the owner ; that consequently a return should have been made to the clerk within three months after the sale to the plaintiff; and that such return not having been made, the plaintiff had lost his title to the land, and a demand of a deed, as it would have been futile, was unnecessary. He cited Acts of Cong. 13, <em>sess. </em>3, c. 21, \u00a7 24, 27 (Jan. 9, 1815) ; Cong. 15, <em>sess. </em>1, c 77, \u00a7 4, 5 (April 20, 1818).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-6\">Merrick, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoZ\">argued that the object of creating a lien for two years was in part to give the collector a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>sonable time in which he might enforce payment of the tax by a sale of land ; that the sale in this instance, having taken place after the two years had expired, was inoperative, and a deed would therefore have been void, had a return been made to the district clerk ; that the deputy, in thus overstepping his duty, could not be considered to have acted officially, and so the defendant was not responsible for his doings. He referred to the Act of 1815, \u00a7 24, 26, 29, 31, 33 ; <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Hosmer, </em>4 Mass. R. 60 ; <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>7 Mass. R. 127.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b26-6\"><em>Oct. 4th, </em>1828.</otherdate>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-9\">He objected likewise, that the declaration was insufficient, inasmuch as it contained no allegation that the tax of 1815 had been duly assessed. <em>Libby </em>v. Burnham, 15 Mass. R. 144 ; <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>1 Pick. 482; <em>Blossom v. </em>Cannon, 14 Mass. R. 177 ; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Holt\u2019s N. P. Cas. 589, and note.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b26-10\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aqg\">It appears by the Act of Congress, that the collector might enforce payment of the tax by distress on personal property, or by a sale of land. No limitation of time is provided for making the distress, and there seems to be no good reason why the collector should not sell real estate after the expiration of the two years, as well as personal. The design of the limitation was to prevent the alienation of real estate from being encumbered for an unreasonable period. We think then that the deputy was authorized to make the sale in question, after the two years had expired ;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and if so, it was an official act to which the defendant\u2019s responsibility attached. At the time of the sale, the officer receives the purchase money, but makes no conveyance; and the purchaser is noi entitled to a deed until the time for redemption has expired. No return having been made to the district clerk, a demand of a deed by the plaintiff was unnecessary. The collector was not authorized to give a deed, and the clerk could not make one for want of the proper return ; so that a demand would have been a useless ceremony.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">The declaration ought to allege that the tax was duly as sessed, and if it is defective in this respect, the plaintiff mar have leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">\n<em>Mew trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b26-13\"> See Revised Stat.. <em>c. </em>8, \u00a7 18; <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>8 Pick. 436; <em>Hayde</em>n <em>Foster, </em>13 Pick. 492.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
