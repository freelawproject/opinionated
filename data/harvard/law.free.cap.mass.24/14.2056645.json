Davis </em>and <em>Tufts, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyO\">remarked that the settlement of the administrator\u2019s second account was pending, and that this complaint was filed in order that the account might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>be settled truly. They cited <em>St. </em>1783, c. 32, \u00a7 11, 12 ; <em>St </em>1817, c. 190, \u00a7 14 ; <em>Stearns </em>v. Brown, 1 Pick. 535 ; Toller 489, 495.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b24-6\"><em>April term </em>1888.</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-8\">Newton, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeL\">cited <em>Selectmen of </em>Boston, v. Boylston, 4 Mass. R. 322. The appellee\u2019s objection to answering interrogatories was, that he would thereby lose the common law right of a trial by jury. In the case just referred to, the Court say that the authority of the judge of probate under <em>St. </em>1783, c 32, \u00a7 11, extends, at most, only to an examination of an administrator for the purpose of discovery. But there is no good reason for permitting an examination even for that purpose, as a discovery before the judge of probate could avail the appellants only as subsidiary to some other process before a different tribunal. He could pass no decree grounded on the discovery. The proper course for them would seem to be, to file a bill of discovery in this Court as a court of equity.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b24-9\">At the following term in April, the decree of the judge of probate was reversed, and he was commanded to proceed upon the complaint and in the examination of the administrator touching the estate of the deceased, according to law. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b24-15\"> See <em>Higbee </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>8 Pick. 484 ; <em>O\u2018Dee </em>v. <em>M\u2018Crate, </em>7 Greenl. 467 <em>Saxton </em>v. <em>Chamberlain </em>6 Pick. 422; <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>11 Pick. 113.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
