The yearly damage, as found by the sheriff\u2019s jury, was seven dollars and fifty cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-7\">The defendant pleads payment of the annual damage assessed, up to April 21, 1813; that the plaintiff was seised of a portion of the land flowed, called <em>wigwam </em>meadow, during the life of S. Badlam, who died March 1,1813, and that A. Jones and N. Dewing were seised of the reversion ; that they thereupon entered and have ever since continued in possession of this meadow; that the damage done to this meadow amounted to two thirds of the whole damage, and for this the defendant has paid Jones and Dewing five dollars a year ; and he traverses the seisin of the plaintiff in the thirty acres described in his writ, in manner and form as therein alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-8\">The plaintiff, in his replication, admits the payment as plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ed, and avers that he was seised and has continued to be seised of the land, in manner &amp;c, ; upon which issue is joined.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b232-7\">\n<em>Oct. 28th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-9\">At the trial, before <em>Morton </em>J., the plaintiff gave in evidence a copy of the judgment declared on. In his original com* plaint he alleged that he was seised and possessed of a tract of land, containing about two hundred acres, situate partly in Needham and partly in Dover, through which Charles river runs, and that the mill-dam flowed \u201c thirty acres of good and valuable land belonging to the plaintiff.\u201d It appeared that he was seised of a farm lying on both sides of the river, partly in Needham and partly in Dover, above the mill-dam, containing about two hundred acres, and that he had continued so seised from the date of the complaint to the present time ; that he was possessed of the wigwam meadow at the date of his complaint, and continued so possessed until April, 1813, and that this meadow lies upon Charles river below his farm and at least fifty rods, from any part of the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-10\">The defendant offered parol evidence to prove, that when the jury went upon the land for the purpose of assessing the annual damages, the plaintiff actually showed them this meadow as a part of his land which was flowed, and claimed damages for the injury to this meadow, and.that the jury viewed it, and allowed damage for the injury done to it, as well as to other land. This was objected to by the plaintiff as being inconsistent with the record, and was rejected. A verdict was thereupon rendered for the plaintiff; but if this evidence was admissible, a new trial was to be granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-11\"><em>Richardson </em>and <em>Harrington, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjF\">contended, that in the record produced, there was a latent ambiguity, it being doubtful whether the thirty acres were part, of the two hundred acres or were other land, and that therefore the parol evidence was admissible to remove the doubt.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcMT\">There is no such ambiguity in the complaint, as will let in parol evidence to prove that the damages were assessea for injury to land not within the premises described. The complainant averred that he was seised of two hundred acres of land through which Charles river runs, and that by means of the mill-dam thirty acres of good and valuable land belonging to him were flowed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This, after verdict and judgment, must be taken to be part of the land described, \u2014 part of the two hundred acres. The evidence offered went to show that another parcel of land, not part of, nor even adjoining the two hundred acres, was taken into consideration by the jury, and that a portion of the damages was assessed for the injury done to this land, in which the plaintiff has no title. But this evidence cannot be admitted, for it contradicts the record, and would introduce the greatest uncertainty, nearly twenty years having elapsed since the judgment was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The proper remedy for the defendant was to have applied for a reduction of the damages; and that is now the only mode of relief left for him.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-6\"> By the Revised Statutes it is enacted, that \u201c the complaint,\u201d in such case, \u2018 shall contain such a description of the land, alleged to be flowed or injured, and such a statement of the damage, that the record of the case shall show, with sufficient certainty, the matter that shall have been heard and determined therein \" <em>e. </em>116, \u00a7 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
