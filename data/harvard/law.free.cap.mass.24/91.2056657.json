He and two other persons as his sureties executed a guardianship bond to the judge of probate in the presence of witnesses, and R took it and kept it among his papers, where it \u00abas found at his death. His administrator filed the bond in the probate office, with a written declaration on it, that he did not intend to affect the legal rights of the parties by thus filing it. It was <em>held, </em>that no action could be maintained upon the bond by the judge of probate, as it had never been delivered.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-9\">This was an action on an instrument purporting to be a bond to the judge of probate for the county of Middlesex, made by William Richardson, as principal, and the defendants as sureties, conditioned for the faithful discharge of W. Rich<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ardson\u2019s duties as guardian of Julia Danforth, a minor. The case was submitted to the Court on a statement of facts, in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-4\">On March 4, 1823, Julia Danforth, a minor and unmarried, aged eighteen years, now the wife of J. Barrows, chose W Richardson to be her guardian; and on March 5, the judge of probate made a decree appointing him guardian, \u201c he giving bond as the law directs.\u201d A letter of guardianship was made out, but not delivered to him, on which the register indorsed, \u201c to be delivered when bond is filed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\">At the same court, Josiah Crosby, who had before been the guardian of the minor, settled his guardianship account, to which settlement Richardson gave his assent in writing, as \u201c Guardian,\u201d which assent was written thereon by the judge. Soon after the appointment, Richardson assumed to act as guardian, and continued to do so till his death, which took place June 15, 1826. On November 24, 1823, he received of Joseph Locke, who had been surety for Isaac Hurd junior, a former guardian of the minor, 339 dollars, and gave a discharge for the same under his hand and seal as guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AdY\">At the time of Richardson\u2019s death, the bond on which this action is brought had not been filed in the probate office, and the letter of guardianship still remained there. The administrator of Richardson found among the papers of the deceased a warrant of appraisal, together with the bond on which this suit is brought, filled up in the handwriting of the judge or register of probate, having the signatures and seals of Richardson as principal, and the defendants as sureties. The bond was executed by the principal and sureties in the presence of witnesses, and the bond was taken away by Richardson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-8\">Richardson\u2019s administrator, soon after finding the bond and before the commencement of this action, lodged it in the probate office, with the following endorsement: \u2014 \u201c The within bond was found by me among the papers of the within-named William Richardson after his decease, in the form in which it now exists. I file this bond in the registry of probate, not intending to withhold any right from any person interested in it, nor by any act of mine to give any rights to any person which he does not now possess. March 20,1827. Marshall Preston, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Administrator. Shortly before William Richardson\u2019s death he had assigned property to the defendant Francis Richardson, to indemnify him against his liabilities as surety for William, but the property assigned is not sufficient to indemnify Francis against his other liabilities, exclusive of the claim in this case.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ao0\">\n<em>Oct. 17th</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-4\">The bond in suit had the following endorsement on it: :\u00a3 March 5, 1823.

Hatch, 9 Mass. R. 310 ; <em>Goodright </em>v. <em>Straphan, </em>Cowp. 201 ; <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>1 Johns. Cas. 250. Where an instrument is delivered by the grantor as his deed, to a third person, to be delivered over by him to the grantee on some future event, it is the grantor\u2019s deed presently, and the third person is a trustee of it for the grantee, and if the grantee obtains the writing from the trustee before the event happens, it is the deed of the grantor, and he cannot avoid it by a plea of <em>non est factum, </em>whether generally or specially pleaded. <em>Wheelwright </em>v. <em>Wheelwright, </em>2 Mass. R. 454. Where a deed is delivered as an escrow, it is of no force until the condition is performed. But if either of the parties dies before the condition is performed, and afterward the condition is performed, the deed is good, and takes effect from the first delivery. 4 Cruise, 29, <em>tit. Deed, c. </em>2, \u00a7 55 ; Touch. 59. The official certificate of the acceptance of the bond by the judge cannot be contradicted by parol evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-10\">\n<em>Stearns, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH_\">The sureties cannot be answerable for the principal\u2019s intermeddling before the bond is filed. William Richardson, notwithstanding his acts, was, in fact, never guardian ; the letter of guardianship never having been delivered to him, the appointment was only inchoate. The bond in this case was never delivered ; and the circumstance of its coming into the possession of the obligee, without any delivery on the part of the obligors, cannot make it their deed. Perk. \u00a7 137 , Touch. 57 ; Vin. <em>Faits, </em>I. The bond never belonged to the judge of probate. Suppose the judge had called on Richardson for the bond, and he had refused to give it up to him, could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the judge have brought trover for it ? This case is not like that of an escrow ; an escrow is a complete deed delivered to a third person ; here the deed was incomplete. <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>10 Mass.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcN\">We have not been able to find any princl pie or authority to justify us in giving validity to the bond on which this suit is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab3\">A bond is a deed, and delivery is essential to a deed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There are cases of a constructive delivery, but there is no evidence here to bring this case to a resemblance of them. All that appears is, that the paper was signed and sealed by the principal and sureties and was left in the hands of the principal until his death. The act of his administrator cannot make a delivery, especially as the memorandum was intended to prevent his act being so considered. \u25a0 For aught we know, it was never in tended by the sureties that it should be delivered until sufficient indemnity was given to them by the principal. And it may be, that finding no bond in the probate office, they have on that account omitted to seek for security which they might otherwise have obtained. The certificate on the bond, of approbation by the judge, has no effect, it being manifest that it was made before the bond was signed; for the letter of guardianship remained on the files, with the minute that it was to be delivered when the bond should be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">It is certainly a very hard case for the ward, and shows tne importance of great care in the probate office ; but it would be equally hard on the sureties to hold them liable. At any rate, they insist upon the law, and we cannot withhold it. The in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>strument never became their bond by their definitive act of delivery, and it cannot be made so by any power of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-9\"> See <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>20 Pick. 28; <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>13 Pick. 75; <em>Nabb </em>v <em>Goodtitle, </em>1 Breese, 157; <em>Chadwick </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>3 Greenl. 141; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>4 Greenl. 20; <em>Woodman </em>v. <em>Coolbroth, </em>7 Greenl. 181; <em>Chess </em>v. <em>Chess, </em>1 Pennsylv.
