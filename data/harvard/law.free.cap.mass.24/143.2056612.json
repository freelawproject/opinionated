We know of no authority for the suggestion, that the dowress has a right to take fire-bote, &amp;c. without an assignment of her dower in the woodlot. This case is distinguished from those heretofore decided respecting dower. The Court have limited the dis-allowance of dower to wild land, which is not used with the homestead or with cultivated land.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-14\"> See Revised Stat. <em>c. </em>60, \u00a7 12; <em>Webb </em>v.
