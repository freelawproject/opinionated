On this writ of error the judgment was alleged to be erroneous, <em>first, </em>because Hathaway was under guardianship as a person <em>non compos </em>and no notice of the suit was given to the guardian ; \u2014 <em>secondly, </em>because Hathaway was an idiot. The plaintiff in error having had leave, at a former term of this Court, to strike out the second error assigned, now moved to have the assignment of it restored, and that the defendant in error should be required to plead thereto.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-12\"><em>Eddy </em>supported the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIE\">He said that a second writ of error could not be issued ; 2 Wms\u2019s Saund. 101 <em>a ; Burleigh </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>2 Str. 975 ; and that a writ of error is amendable. <em>Sword-Blade Company </em>v. <em>Dempsey, </em>2 Str. 892. <em>[Parker </em>C.J.
