About three months before it became due, it was indorsed in blank by the defendant. In 4 Pick. 385, the Court held that this was a collateral engagement, and that the plaintiff must show that it was fou\u00f1ded upon a legal consideration. For this purpose the plaintiff called a witness, who testified, that some time after the indorsement, he heard the plaintiff and defendant conversing about the payment of the note ; that the defendant said he was willing to pay it in land, and acknowledged, that after he had indorsed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>it Pierce secured him by putting real estate into his hands, which he was willing to transfer to the plaintiff. The witness also testitled, that at some time he heard the plaintiff or the defendant, but he could not tell which, say, that in consequence of the defendant\u2019s indorsement, the plaintiff had for a time forborne to sue the maker. <em>Wilde </em>J., who tried the cause, was of opinion, that the evidence was not sufficient to prove a consideration at the time of <em>the </em>indorsement, and the plaintiff agreed to become nonsuit, with liberty to move for a new trial; but the whole Court being now of the same opinion, the nonsuit was made absolute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
