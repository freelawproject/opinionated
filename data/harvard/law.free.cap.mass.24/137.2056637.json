Bank of North America, in Rhode Island. It was' objected that the similitude was not proved, as it appeared that the bank had never issued bills of that denomination. But the <em>Court </em>said, that as the bills had the external appearance of bills issued by the bank, and purported to be signed by the president and cashier, they had the similitude intended by the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-11\"><em>L.
