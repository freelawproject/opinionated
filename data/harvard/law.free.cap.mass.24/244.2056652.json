Trial before <em>Putnam </em>J., on the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-11\">The plaintiff proved that the defendants, before January 4, 1822, sent to him as a factor, to be sold on their account, divers goods, and that they received from him money exceeding in amount the cash proceeds of the goods ; to recover which \u2022difference this action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3sc\">On the 4th of January, 1822, the plaintiff sold some of the goods to one Ward, for 189 dollars 87 cents, part on a credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>o&lt; iour months and part on a credit of six months ; and he afterwards took Ward\u2019s note, dated January 10, 1822, payable to the plaintiff or order, for 338 dollars 62 cents, including the sum of 189 dollars 87 cents, and also the sum of 48 dollars 75 cents due for goods belonging to one Worthen, which he had sold to Ward. A short time before the note became due, Ward failed in business, and no part of the note has been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-4\">The defendants contended, that the plaintiff had released Ward from the payment of the note, and they produced in evidence an indenture, by which Ward made a general assignment of his property for the benefit of his creditors, to the plaintiff and one Whipple, which was executed by the plaintiff both as a creditor of Ward and as assignee. By this indenture the plaintiff released all his demands against Ward. At the time of the execution of tire indenture by the plaintiff, the note was in his possession and has so remained ever since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">It did not appear that Ward knew, or did not know, that any person, other than the plaintiff, had any interest in the note or the goods for which it was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">The plaintiff, to prove that it was not his intention, by the release contained in the indenture, to discharge Ward from the payment of this note, produced Whipple, who testified that the plaintiff had several other demands against Ward, and that after he had executed the indenture, he made a statement in writing of his demands against Ward, and showed it to Whipple for the purpose of having the demands allowed against Ward\u2019s estate, and that this note was not contained in the statement. The defendants objected to the admission of this testimony, but the objection was overruled. It did not appear that Ward knew of this statement\u2019s being made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">The jury were instructed, that it was competent for the plaintiff to explain and control the operation of the release m the indenture under the seal of the plaintiff, by parol evidence, in like manner as a receipt for money not under seal might be explained and controlled ; and that if it was not his intention to release Ward from the payment of the note in question, then Ward was not released from such payment, and in that case they ought to find a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-8\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>fendants moved for a new trial on account of the admission of the testimony of Whipple.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b260-6\">\n<em>Nov. 6th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b260-7\">Nov. <em>8th.</em></decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-9\"><em>Moseley, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8GM\">cited <em>Stackpole </em>v.

If it was the intention of the plaintiff to except this note from the release, it should have been so expressed in the indenture ; and if that had been done, possibly Ward would have refused to assign his property. Ward is discharged from the note, and that destroys the plaintiff\u2019s right of action against the defendants, unless he can show that they authorized him to give the discharge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">\n<em>Verdict set aside</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-16\"> As to the effect of a factor\u2019s taking a note payable to himself, see 2 Kent (3d ed.) 622; <em>Hosmer v.
