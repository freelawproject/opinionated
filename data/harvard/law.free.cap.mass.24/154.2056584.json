Plea, <em>non assumpsit </em>as to all of the demand, except six dollars and fifty cents, and a tender of that sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-3\">At the trial, before <em>Morton </em>J., it was admitted, that the pauper\u2019s settlement was in Attleborough. He was taken ill at Seekonk, September 11th, 1826. Notice was given to the overseers of Attleborough October 2d. Within thirty days after the receipt of this notice, they gave notice to the overseers of Seekonk, that they admitted the pauper\u2019s settlement to be in Attleborough, and they went to his residence for the purpose of removing him, and with suitable means to effect his removal; but in the opinion of his attending physician, and others who saw him, he could not be removed with safety. As soon as he could be removed with safety, but not within thirty days from the receipt of the notice, the overseers of Attleborough did remove him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-4\">The defendants contended, that inasmuch as they had done all in their power to remove the pauper within thirty days, and had actually removed him as soon as it could be done with safety, they had brought themselves within <em>St. </em>1821, <em>c. </em>94, \u00a7 3, which enacts that a town in which a pauper has a settlement, shall not be subjected to a greater expense than at the rate of one dollar per week, for supplies furnished to the pauper by another town, \u201c <em>provided </em>it shall cause such pauper to be removed within thirty days from the time of receiving legal notice, that such support has been furnished.\u201d But this objection to the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-5\">The defendants then offered evidence to prove, that at the time when they attempted to remove the pauper, they made a contract with the person who had before boarded and nursed him, and also with the physician who had attended him, to continue to do the same at a certain price, at the expense of Attleborough. The plaintiffs contended that this, if true, did not bring the case within the statute. But as there was con tradictory evidence on this point, the judge overruled the objection and submitted the question to the jury ; who found that such contracts were made by the defendants, and that they ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>dered an amount sufficient to cover the support of the pauper at one dollar a week up to the time of the contracts.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b170-7\"><em>Oct. </em>23d.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b170-8\">\n<em>Oct. 25th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-10\">The plaintiffs moved for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-11\"><em>W.

[Revised Stat. c. 46, \u00a7 15.] It does not follow that the plaintiffs are to be deprived of their legal rights because the defendants have done all in their power to comply with the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">\n<em>Mew trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
