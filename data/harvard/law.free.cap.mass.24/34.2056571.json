J., it appeared that the plaintiffs sent the bill for collection to S. Burt, who delivered it to J. Sawyer, with directions to call on the defendant and demand payment. Sawyer testified that in the early part of May he presented the bill for acceptance and payment; that the defendant said he did not think the money was due to tire government ; that the witness pressed him to pay the bill; that the defendant refused to pay then, but said he would answer it at the commencement of the next quarter, which would be in about sixty days. The witness did not agree to wait, but told the defendant he would return the bill to Burt, who would send it to Washington. The defendant was irritated, and intimated that he did not care if it was sent to Washington. The witness afterwards, in September, called again on the defendant, who again refused to pay, saying that if the witness had called at the commencement of the quarter next after the time of the first presentment, he should have paid it, but that he had accepted other drafts presented since, and he would not pay it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-8\">The plaintiffs offered to show that the defendant, at the time of the first presentment, was indebted to the United States m a larger sum than the amount of the bill; but the evidence was deemed irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-9\">A nonsuit was entered by consent; which was to be taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>off, if the above testimony was sufficient in law to authorize a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AgM\">\n<em>Oct. 2d.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-11\">\n<em>Oct. 3d.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-4\"><em>J.
