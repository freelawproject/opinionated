From this it follows that although we pass the application of the doctrine, that the refusal of <em>habeas corpus </em>is not the thing adjudged precluding a subsequent granting of such writ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>upon the same facts, nevertheless there is here no reason to grant the order prayed, since the previous order rested upon the right and duty to petition for relief, if <em>habeas corpus </em>was desired, to other and appropriate sources of judicial power.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">No reason, therefore, exists for granting the motion and to avoid any implication of a necessity which does not obtain, the motion is</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
