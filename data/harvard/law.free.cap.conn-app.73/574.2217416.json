App. 387, 390, 731 A.2d 323 (1999). Although we allow pro se litigants some latitude, the right of self-representation provides no attendant license not to comply with relevant rules of procedural and substantive law. <em>Zanoni </em>v. <em>Hudon, </em>42 Conn.

It is incumbent upon the appellant to take the necessary steps to sustain its burden of providing an adequate record for appellate review. Practice Book \u00a7 [60-5] .... It is not the function of this court to find facts. . . . Our role is . . . to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court. . . . Without the necessary factual and legal conclusions furnished by the trial court . . . any decision made by us respecting [the plaintiffs claims] would be entirely speculative. . . . We have, on occasion, reviewed claims of error in light of an unsigned transcript as long as the transcript contains a sufficiently detailed and concise statement of the trial court\u2019s findings.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The record contains no memorandum of decision. We, however, have reviewed the unsigned transcript of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>the hearing afforded the plaintiff. The court found that the plaintiff was not credible and therefore denied the plaintiffs request to enjoin the eviction. Where the trial court is the arbiter of credibility, this court does not disturb findings made on the basis of the credibility of witnesses. See <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Pizza Connection, Inc., </em>55 Conn.
