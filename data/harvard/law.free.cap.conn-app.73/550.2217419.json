The defendant, Michael A. Young, first appealed to this court from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of three counts of criminal violation of a protective order in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-110b, one count each of breach of the peace in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (2), disorderly conduct in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1), reckless endangerment in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-64 and criminal mischief in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-117 (a) (1) (A). In his first appeal, the defendant claimed that \u201cthe trial court improperly (1) instructed the jury that the defendant\u2019s failure to produce a certain witness permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the jury to infer that the witness\u2019 testimony would have been adverse to the defendant, (2) precluded evidence of the victim\u2019s prior misconduct, (3) admitted evidence of a telephone conversation without a proper evidentiary foundation, (4) precluded the defendant from impeaching the victim regarding an alleged act of fraud and (5) allowed the state to impeach the defendant\u2019s character with misconduct evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>57 Conn. App. 566, 568, 750 A.2d 482 (2000), rev\u2019d in part, 258 Conn. 79, 779 A.2d 112 (2001). In that decision, this court addressed all of the defendant\u2019s claims except the claim concerning the prior misconduct evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our Supreme Court granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and ultimately remanded the case to this court with direction to consider the unreviewed claim. Having considered that claim, we conclude that the trial court properly admitted the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The facts that the jury reasonably could have found are set forth in both <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 84-88, and State v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 57 Conn. App. 568-70. The following facts are necessary to resolve the defendant\u2019s remaining claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Before the trial commenced, the defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude the state from inquiring into his prior felony convictions. Regarding that motion, the court ruled to exclude the defendant\u2019s felony conviction for marijuana possession because it was more prejudicial than probative. At trial, the defendant testified in his defense about incidents that occurred on November 25 and 30, but invoked his privilege against self-incrimination regarding the charged offenses stemming from an August 4,1995 incident. On cross-examination, the defendant offered unsolicited testimony that he had been wrongly arrested and harassed by the police. Thereafter, the state questioned the defendant about his prior acts of misconduct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>counsel objected to the line of questioning, arguing that it was improper for the state to inquire into the underlying facts of the defendant\u2019s prior arrests. The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection, finding that the defendant had opened the door to the cross-examination regarding his prior arrests by mentioning them in his response to the state\u2019s question about why he had believed he would be arrested for the November, 1995 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>In his original brief to this court, the defendant claimed that the trial court improperly allowed the state to impeach him with prior acts of misconduct. He further claimed that the prosecutor\u2019s line of questioning with regard to those prior acts constituted prosecutorial misconduct requiring reversal of his convictions.* <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">At the outset, we set forth our standard of review and the applicable law. \u201cA trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is afforded great deference. . . . The trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination. Every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>70 Conn. App. 255, 263, 797 A.2d 616, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 919, 806 A.2d 1056 (2002). Moreover, we have previously recognized that \u201cif a party delves into a particular subject during examination, he is said to have \u2018opened the door\u2019 for further examination regarding that subject. <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 13, 509 A.2d 493 (1986). The doctrine of opening the door cannot, of course, be subverted into a rule for injection of prejudice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morascini, </em>62 Conn. App. 758, 766, 772 A.2d 703, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 921, 774 A.2d 141 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the court properly exercised its discretion in finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the defendant had opened the door to questions about his prior arrests and that the state was entitled to cross-examine him on the subject. Therefore, we conclude that the court properly permitted evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior acts of misconduct. Finally, we do not agree that the cross-examination so prejudiced the defendant as to warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\"> This court remanded the case to the trial court after reversing one judgment on the ground of the improper missing witness instruction and affirming the judgments pertaining to the defendant\u2019s two other convictions for criminal violation of a protective order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-8\"> The state sought certification to appeal on the issue of whether <em>State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>250 Conn. 722, 737 A.2d 442 (1999) (en banc), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1170, 120 S. Ct. 1195, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1099 (2000), should be applied retroactively. <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>253 Conn. 922, 754 A.2d 799 (2000). <em>Malave, </em>our Supreme Court abandoned the missing witness instruction in criminal cases, also known as the <em>Secondino </em>instruction. See <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 675, 165 A.2d 598 (1960). Our Supreme Court in <em>Young </em>did not reach the merits of the certified issue. It \u201cnevertheless conclude [d] that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the state\u2019s motion for a <em>Secondino </em>charge and, consequently, [that] the charge should not have been given.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 84.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b575-4\"> The trial transcript reveals that the following relevant colloquy concerning the state\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: So, why did you feel that you would get arrested in this [November 25, 1995] incident? If you did nothing wrong, why did you feel you were going to get arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Because the police harass me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201cQ. Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">\u201cA. The police harass me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">\u201cQ. The police harass you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-11\">\u201cQ. Which police harass you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-12\">\u201cA. Troop C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-13\">\u201cQ. Troop C. All the police officers at Troop C harass you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-14\">\u201cA. Most of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-15\">\u201cQ. And why do they do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-16\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-17\">\u201cQ. Maybe because they don\u2019t do that, Mr. Young, maybe you just think they do. Could that be it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-18\">\u201cA. Well, they arrest me for things I don\u2019t do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-19\">\u201cQ. They arrest you for things you don\u2019t do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-20\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-21\">\u201cQ. In fact, you are totally innocent of everything and they go around arresting you. Is that what you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-22\">\u201cA. Most of the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-23\">\u201cQ. Most of the time? How many times have they arrested you for things that you haven\u2019t done, Mr. Young?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-24\">At that point, defense counsel objected on the ground that prior arrests are not indicative of guilt. The court overruled the objection, finding that the defendant had opened the door to the question, and the court allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the prosecutor to continue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: How many times, Mr. Young, have they arrested you for no reason whatsoever? Mr. Young? Are you counting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">\u201c[The Defendant]: A lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">\u201cQ. And each and every one of those times, you did nothing wrong, is that what you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">\u201cA. Two of the times I was sleeping in my house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-11\">\u201cQ. And they burst in and arrested you? Is that what you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-12\">\u201cA. Once, I lived in a condemned building. I was told to stay there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-13\">\u201cQ. I\u2019m sorry, once you lived in a condemned building?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-14\">\u201cA. I lived in a condemned building. I lived in this building and they condemned it, and then I was told by my attorney to stay there, not to move out, and they arrested me there for living in a condemned building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-15\">\u201cQ. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-16\">\u201cA. And then the time when Brandy said I hit her head against the wall. I was sleeping when the police officer came in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-17\">\u201cQ. Okay, all the other times when you weren\u2019t in your house or sleeping, all those other times, you were arrested for things that you didn\u2019t do, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-18\">* ** *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-19\">\u201cQ. About how many times, Mr. Young, other than the two incidents when you say you were at home sleeping or \u2014 how many times were you arrested for no reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-20\">\u201cA. Off the top of my head, two more times, anyway. Once for interfering and once for reckless driving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-21\">\u201cQ. And each one of those times, you did nothing wrong in those cases. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-22\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-23\">\u201cQ. Yes, no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-24\">\u201cA. Well, I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-25\">\u201cQ. Did you do anything wrong in those cases or did you not deserve to be arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-26\">\u201cA. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-27\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-28\">\u201cA. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>\u201cQ. In fact, you never do anything wrong, do you, Mr. Young?\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b577-9\"> With respect to the defendant\u2019s argument that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning constituted misconduct that deprived him of his right to a fair trial, the defendant does not adequately support that claim. We therefore conclude that any argument that the prosecutor\u2019s questions constituted prosecutorial misconduct and deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial has been waived. Nevertheless, our review of the evidence convinces us that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning does not rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
