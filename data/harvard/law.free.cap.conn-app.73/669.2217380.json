Lemoine, Jr., appeals from the judgment of the habeas court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court improperly found that his trial counsel and appellate counsel provided effective assistance. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the petitioner\u2019s appeal. In June, 1992, a jury convicted the petitioner of sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (1) (B), risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 and two counts of assault of a peace officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioner was acquitted of five addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>tional charges. He was sentenced to a total effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>term of fourteen years in prison. Thereafter, the petitioner appealed, and this court reversed the judgment of conviction and ordered a new trial. State v. <em>Lemoine, </em>33 Conn. App. 743, 641 A.2d 131 (1994). Our Supreme Court granted the state certification to appeal, reversed this court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case for consideration of the petitioner\u2019s remaining appellate claim. <em>State v. Lemoine, </em>233 Conn. 502, 659 A.2d 1194 (1995). This court thereafter affirmed the petitioner\u2019s conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>39 Conn. App. 657, 666 A.2d 825 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">On November 4, 1998, the petitioner filed a second amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel, ineffective assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>tance of appellate counsel and actual innocence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following an evidentiary hearing, at which the court reviewed the trial transcripts and records, and heard from the petitioner\u2019s previous attorneys, the court rendered a thorough memorandum of decision denying the petition. The petitioner thereafter requested certification to appeal, which the court granted. The petitioner then filed the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">The petitioner asserts that the court improperly determined that his trial counsel and appellate counsel provided effective assistance. The petitioner asserts that trial counsel neglected (1) to request a contemporaneous limiting instruction regarding constancy of accusation testimony, (2) to challenge the constancy of accusation testimony, (3) to challenge the court\u2019s jury instructions regarding constancy of accusation evidence, (4) to contest the court\u2019s jury instructions regarding the charge of sexual assault in the third degree and (5) to object to certain allegedly inappropriate statements made by the prosecutor during closing argument to the juiy. In addition, the petitioner contends that appellate counsel failed to challenge (1) the unpreserved jury instructions regarding the charge of sexual assault in the third degree and (2) the unpreserved prosecutorial misconduct claims, which purportedly occurred during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Before addressing each of the petitioner\u2019s claims, we begin our analysis with the appropriate standard of review. A court \u201cis afforded broad discretion in making its factual findings, and those findings will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. . . . The application of the habeas court\u2019s factual findings to the pertinent legal standard, however, presents a mixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>question of law and fact, which is subject to plenary review.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>261 Conn. 309, 335, 803 A.2d 287 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">\u201cA criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to adequate and effective assistance of counsel at all critical stages of criminal proceedings. . . . This right arises under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crump </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>61 Conn. App. 55, 58-59, 762 A.2d 491 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The standard to be applied by habeas courts in determining whether an attorney effectively represented a criminal defendant is set forth in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), in which \u201cthe United States Supreme Court established that for a petitioner to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must show that counsel\u2019s assistance was so defective as to require reversal of [the] conviction .... That requires the petitioner to show (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. . . . Unless a [petitioner] makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction . . . resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\u201cThe first component of the <em>Strickland </em>test, generally referred to as the performance prong, requires that the petitioner show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. ... In <em>Strickland, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that [j]udicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. It is all too tempting for a [petitioner] to second-guess counsel's assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>examining counsel\u2019s defense, after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. ... A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the [petitioner] must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. . . .[C]ounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">\u201cEven if a petitioner shows that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, the second prong, or prejudice prong, requires that the petitioner show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. . . . Therefore, [a] habeas court deciding an ineffective assistance of counsel claim need not address the question of counsel\u2019s performance, if the claim may be disposed of on the ground of an insufficient showing of prejudice.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doehrer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>68 Conn. App. 774, 777-79, 795 A.2d 548, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 924, 797 A.2d 520 (2002); <em>Crump </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>68 Conn. App. 334, 337-38, 791 A.2d 628 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Furthermore, \u201c[w]e have [also] adopted the two-part <em>Strickland </em>analysis in the context of a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crump </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 337; see <em>Holloway </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number><em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>72 Conn. App. 244, 249, 804 A.2d 995, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 944, 808 A.2d 1136 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The petitioner claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in violation of his federal and state constitutional rights. In its memorandum of decision, the court focused largely on the deficient performance element of the <em>Strickland </em>test and concluded that it had not been satisfied. Regardless, the petitioner would not have prevailed because he could not have satisfied the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The petitioner first asserts that his trial counsel should have requested a contemporaneous limiting instruction regarding the constancy of accusation testimony. As the habeas court correctly stated, although it is acceptable for a trial court, in its discretion, to give a contemporaneous limiting instruction to the jury, there is no rule of practice or statutory requirement that the court must give such an instruction contemporaneously with the introduction of such testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>24 Conn. App. 13, 21, 585 A.2d 1235, cert. denied, 218 Conn. 901, 588 A.2d 1076 (1991). Thus, it was not improper for trial counsel not to request a different charge and not to object to the charge given by the trial court. Furthermore, the habeas court found that the trial court had charged the jury properly by instructing that the constancy of accusation evidence was to be admitted solely to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony. We agree with the habeas court\u2019s findings. See id.; see generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Wild, </em>43 Conn. App. 458, 465, 684 A.2d 720, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 954, 688 A.2d 326 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Second, the petitioner asserts that trial counsel was ineffective in challenging the constancy of accusation evidence and jury instructions regarding the same. The habeas court noted that trial counsel had objected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>each constancy of accusation witness who was presented and took exception to each witness\u2019 testimony. The court held that there was adequate evidence in the record to demonstrate that those witnesses remembered speaking with the victim and that the trial court had charged the jury properly on how that evidence should be considered. The habeas court found that although the trial court in its charge had used the term \u201cthey,\u201d \u201c[i]t [was] clear in reading the charge that \u2018they\u2019 refers to the statement of the victim as given to the constancy witnesses as concerns whether each of these several out-of-court statements, (\u2018they\u2019), were consistent with the victim\u2019s recollection of what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">\u201cThe test of a charge is whether it is correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 510. This court is satisfied that the evidence supports the habeas court\u2019s conclusion that there is no indication that the jury was misled or confused by the instructions. Therefore, we agree with the habeas court that both the admission of the testimony and the jury charge were proper. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 677 A.2d 917 (1996) (enbanc); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>65 Conn. App. 449, 463-65, 783 A.2d 53, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 927, 783 A.2d 1032 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Nonetheless, even if this court had found that trial counsel should have objected to the jury charge, the petitioner would still fail to satisfy the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. The habeas court found, and we agree, that the petitioner did not establish a reasonable probability that, absent counsel\u2019s allegedly unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different. <em>See Bunkley v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 444, 454-55, 610 A.2d 598 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The petitioner further argues that both his trial counsel and appellate counsel should have challenged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>jury charge regarding sexual assault in the third degree, \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (1) (B),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and insisted that the court define the term \u201ccompels.\u201d The petitioner felt disadvantaged by the charge that was given because he believed it unfairly deemphasized the element of compulsion. Taking into consideration that a trial court must instruct a jury on every essential element of a criminal charge, that does not imply that the court must define those words that have an ordinary meaning in the English language. See <em>State </em>v. <em>George B., </em>258 Conn. 779, 800, 785 A.2d 573 (2001). The trial court charged the jury, without objection, in accordance with the clear language of the statute. Furthermore, the habeas court found that the jury was read the statute two additional times and that it never asked for any further definition of the word \u201ccompelled\u201d or seemed confused by the instructions. That is significant because the jury asked for clarifications of other portions of the charge. \u201cThe jury is presumed to [have followed] the court\u2019s directions in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Austin, 244 Conn. 226, 242, 710 A.2d 732 (1998). We agree with the habeas court that trial counsel did not act improperly by not objecting to or requesting a new charge, and appellate counsel did not act improperly by not raising those claims on appeal. Again, even if this court had found that \u201ccompels\u201d should have been defined, the petitioner failed to establish a reasonable probability that absent counsel\u2019s allegedly unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different. In short, the petitioner has not shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>the prejudice, arising out of his attorneys\u2019 performances, that <em>Strickland </em>requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Finally, the petitioner also faults his trial counsel and appellate counsel for not objecting to and challenging the state\u2019s improper closing arguments. The petitioner claims that the prosecutor argued matters that were outside the evidence, improperly argued matters pertaining to psychology and psychological traits that were for the jury to consider objectively from the evidence, and referred to constancy of accusation testimony as substantive evidence. We recognize, as did the habeas court, that the petitioner must establish that \u201cas a whole\u201d the trial was unfair and that the misconduct \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness\u201d that the conviction denied him due process. See <em>State </em>v. Alexander, 254 Conn. 290, 303, 755 A.2d 868 (2000). Although the habeas court held that there were specific instances of prosecutorial misconduct, that court further reasoned that there was no substantial prejudice and no reasonable probability that the outcome of the case would have been any different. This court agrees that even if some of the challenged statements were improper, the incidents were cured by the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wickes, </em>72 Conn. App. 380, 399-400, 805 A.2d 142 (2002). Furthermore, the strength of the state\u2019s case was significant, and this court would have to agree that the fairness of the trial, as a whole, is apparent. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In the present case, the habeas court, in a well reasoned memorandum of decision, found that the petitioner had failed to meet his burden of satisfying either prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. This court cannot conclude that those factual findings are clearly erroneous. After a thorough review of the record and briefs, we conclude that the petitioner has failed to overcome the presumption that the performance of his trial counsel and appellate counsel fell within the wide range of reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>professional assistance or that, but for their performance, the result would have been different. The habeas court, therefore, properly determined that the petitioner had failed to satisfy his burden of establishing that either trial counsel or appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-11\"> The details of the incident that led to the petitioner\u2019s conviction are set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>33 Conn. App. 743, 641 A.2d 131 (1994), rev'd, 233 Conn. 502, 659 A.2d 1194, on appeal after remand, 39 Conn. App. 657, 666 A.2d 825 (1995), as follows. \u201cOn June 20, 1991, the victim, his mother, the [petitioner], Barbara Tirado and her daughter went to a lake. The victim was eight years old at the time. After staying at the lake, they drove to the home of the [petitioner\u2019s] mother, then to the home of his sister and then to Tirado\u2019s home located on Maple Street in Meriden. The victim\u2019s father later joined the group and the adults all began drinking. The victim fell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>asleep on tlie couch in Tirado\u2019s home wearing his pants, shirt and underpants. The victim\u2019s father was asleep on a chair near the couch and the victim\u2019s mother was asleep in another room. The victim awoke to find the [petitioner] placing his hands between the victim\u2019s legs on the outside of the victim\u2019s pants. The [petitioner] was attempting to pull down the victim\u2019s pants. The [petitioner] was behind the victim on the couch and the victim was facing away from the defendant. The [petitioner] told him to be quiet. The victim took off his pants while the [petitioner] continued to touch the outside of the underpants between the legs and then the [petitioner] cut the victim\u2019s underpants. The victim was scared and ran to his mother\u2019s room and told her what had just occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">\u201cThe victim\u2019s mother ran into the living room to wake the victim\u2019s father. In the meantime, the [petitioner], who was wearing only a tee shirt, ran down the stairs and out the backdoor. Tirado caught the [petitioner] outside and asked him \u2018why he did it\u2019 and the [petitioner] responded that he was sorry and the drugs made him do it. Tirado brought the [petitioner] back upstairs. The victim\u2019s father and the [petitioner] then fought while the victim\u2019s mother took off the victim\u2019s underpants and dressed him. The victim then went downstairs with his parents and got into a van. The victim\u2019s father began to drive on Main Street in Meriden to the police station when he observed the [petitioner] driving a truck with Tirado as a passenger on Maple Street. The victim\u2019s father blocked the [petitioner\u2019s] vehicle and the two vehicles collided. The victim and his mother exited the van and proceeded to the side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">\u201cOfficers Michael Merrigan, Mark Masse and Grant Treiber of the Meriden police department arrived at the scene in uniform shortly thereafter. Merrigan approached the father and was informed by him about the events that occurred at Tirado\u2019s home. Masse and Treiber approached the [petitioner\u2019s] vehicle and asked him to exit it. As they attempted to open the door of the [petitioner\u2019s] vehicle and take the keys, the [petitioner] hit Treiber in the face and drove the vehicle in reverse. The officers at that point were hanging onto the doors of the vehicle. The truck veered to the right and almost hit a building on Maple Street. Treiber fell off the side of the truck and Masse hit a door attached to the building with sufficient force to break a hole in the door. Masse sustained lacerations to his right hand, right forearm, shoulder and back. Treiber sustained bruises and injured his right hand. Treiber then placed the [petitioner] under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">\u201cAt the crime scene, Robert Pocobello, a Meriden police detective, seized a pair of scissors and underpants. He discovered the scissors on a coffee table near the couch and the underpants on the couch. Pocobello processed the scissors for fingerprints. The processing revealed the presence of fingerprints that were not clear enough to be identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">\u201cTed Standish, another Meriden police detective, employed by the department\u2019s sexual assault unit, interviewed the victim on June 21, 1991. The victim stated that after arriving at Tirado\u2019s home, she told him to sleep on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>the couch, where the [petitioner] was already sleeping. The victim further told Standish that he awoke when the [petitioner] placed his hands on the victim\u2019s \u2018dinky\u2019 and that the [petitioner] pulled at the victim\u2019s pants. The victim also told Standish that the [petitioner] told the victim to take off his pants and keep quiet. The victim then told Standish that the [petitioner] tried to make him take off his underpants and when he refused, the [petitioner] cut the underpants with scissors.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">\u201cThe [petitioner] disputed the facts. He testified on his own behalf that he, the victim, Tirado and the victim\u2019s mother arrived at Tirado\u2019s home after they had spent the day at the lake. The [petitioner] also testified that he left Tirado\u2019s at 11 p.m., just after the victim\u2019s father arrived, returned at around 4:30 or 5 a.m., and found Tirado and the victim\u2019s father drinking and the victim asleep on the couch. The [petitioner] also stated that he fell asleep on the couch, \u2018opposite the victim\u2019 and awoke to find the victim\u2019s father with his hand in the pocket of the [petitioner\u2019s] pants, which the [petitioner] had on, and thought that the victim\u2019s father was attempting to steal money. The [petitioner] then testified that he tried to get up and that the victim\u2019s father jumped on him and hit him in the face. The [petitioner] then testified that Tirado offered to drive him to the hospital and that he accepted Tirado\u2019s offer. He further testified that as Tirado drove him to the hospital, the victim\u2019s father forced their vehicle to a stop on Maple Street. The [petitioner] then testified that he moved into the driver\u2019s seat, placed the truck in reverse and police officers tried to grab him, causing the truck to move in reverse.\u201d Id., 744-47. In addition, \u201c[t]he victim testified that his underwear was left in Tirado\u2019s bedroom. The victim\u2019s mother testified that she did not remember where the underwear was left.\u201d Id., 745 n.5. Furthermore, \u201cStandish testified that the victim pointed to his penis when he used the word \u2018dinky.\u2019 \u201d Id., 747 n.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b695-6\"> In his appeal to this court, the petitioner has abandoned his claim of actual innocence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b700-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-72a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the third degree when such person (1) compels another person to submit to sexual contact (A) by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or (B) by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person, which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
