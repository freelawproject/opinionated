We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On July 22,1999, the defendant stabbed the victim, her nine year old son, Erik Gilbert (Erik), in the back with a pair of opened scissors. The stabbing resulted in two superficial puncture wounds to Erik\u2019s lower back. Following the stabbing, the defendant cleaned and dressed the wound. Within the next day or two, Erik went swimming and reported the incident to his day care provider and then to his father, Wayne Gilbert (Wayne).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A police investigation followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In a long form information, the defendant was charged with risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (1) and assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2). The trial com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>menced on March 15, 2000, at which Erik testified that he was wounded while playing on a slide at a local McDonald\u2019s restaurant. The jury returned a verdict of guilty as to the first count and a verdict of guilty of the lesser included offense of assault in the third degree on the second count. The defendant was sentenced to three years imprisonment, execution suspended, and three years probation with special conditions. On March 28, 2000, the defendant renewed her previous oral motion for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial. On June 9, 2000, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. The trial court issued its memorandum of decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on December 7, 2000. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The defendant first argues that the court unfairly restricted her right to confront and to cross-examine witnesses. Specifically, she claims that the denial of her efforts to explore the matter of the influence that her ex-husband exerted on Erik and the investigation constituted a deprivation of the right to confront and to cross-examine witnesses under the constitution of Connecticut and the United States constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, she argues that the court improperly denied her the right to present a defense by prohibiting evidence concerning Wayne\u2019s statements and efforts to deprive her of custody of her son. Because both claims implicate the defendant\u2019s rights under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution, we will address them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The defendant concedes that she did not argue before the court that her sixth amendment rights were violated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>She now seeks review under the doctrine set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the record is adequate for review and the issues raised involve a fundamental right, we will review the defendant\u2019s claim under <em>Golding. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wegman, </em>70 Conn. App. 171, 190, 798 A.2d 454, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 918, 806 A.2d 1058 (2002). The defendant, however, cannot prevail under the third prong of <em>Golding </em>because she has failed to establish that a constitutional violation clearly exists and that it clearly deprived her of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u201cThe sixth amendment to the United States constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>255 Conn. 61, 70, 762 A.2d 1278 (2000). \u201cThe primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination . . . and an important function of cross-examination is the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>66 Conn. App. 740, 753, 786 A.2d 466 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 906, 789 A.2d 996 (2002). \u201cCross-examination to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted. . . . However, [t]he [confrontation [cjlause guarantees only an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>defense might wish.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Price, </em>61 Conn. App. 417, 428, 767 A.2d 107, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 947, 769 A.2d 64 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u201c[T]o comport with the constitutional standards embodied in the confrontation clause, the trial court must allow a defendant to expose to the jury facts from which [the] jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness. ... In determining whether a defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination has been unduly restricted, we consider the nature of the excluded inquiry, whether the field of inquiry was adequately covered by other questions that were allowed, and the overall quality of the cross-examination viewed in relation to the issues actually litigated at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wegman, </em>supra, 70 Conn. App. 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Again, the confrontation clause does not guarantee a defendant\u2019s right to engage in unfettered cross-examination. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 71. Only relevant evidence may be elicited through cross-examination. See id. \u201cThe trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination. Every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion. . . . Furthermore, [t]o establish an abuse of discretion, [the defendant] must show that the restrictions imposed upon [the] cross-examination were clearly prejudicial. . . . The proffering party bears the burden of establishing the relevance of the offered testimony. Unless such a proper foundation is established, the evidence ... is irrelevant.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 69-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>. . . [E]vidence need not exclude all other possibilities [to be relevant]; it is sufficient if it tends to support the conclusion [for which it is offered], even to a slight degree.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>67 Conn. App. 299, 305-306, 786 A.2d 1269 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 918, 791 A.2d 566 (2002). \u201cIt is not logical relevance alone, however, that secures the admission of evidence. Logically relevant evidence must also be legally relevant . . . that is, not subject to exclusion for any one of the following prejudicial effects: (1) where the facts offered may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy, (2) <em>where the proof and answering evidence it provokes may create a side issue that will unduly distract the jury from the main issues, </em>(3) where the evidence offered and the counterproof will consume an undue amount of time, and (4) where the defendant, having no reasonable ground to anticipate the evidence, is unfairly surprised and unprepared to meet it.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Joly, </em>219 Conn. 234, 260-61, 593 A.2d 96 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">We first address whether the defendant has successfully established that a constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived her of a fair trial with regard to her cross-examination of Erik. Defense counsel posited, inter alia, to Erik: \u201cDid your father encourage you to pursue this complaint against your mother?\u201d The prosecutor objected to this line of questioning, and the court sustained the objection. The defendant now argues that because \u201cthe entire case against the defendant was dependent upon Erik\u2019s out-of-court statements, in the face of [her and Erik\u2019s] categorical denials in court, the need to demonstrate [Wayne\u2019s] motives and influence were paramount. Instead, the court precluded the only evidence showing that Erik was influenced and encouraged to make false allegations against his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>mother by her hostile and vindictive ex-husband.\u201d This argument is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">During her cross-examination of <em>Erik, </em>the defendant attempted to show <em>Wayne\u2019s </em>motives and influence. Neither Wayne\u2019s motives, nor his influences, were at issue in this case. Thus, such testimony and evidence, if admitted, would have created a side issue that would have distracted the jury from the issue of whether the defendant stabbed her son with apair of scissors. Therefore, the court properly excluded the testimony as irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">In addition, the defendant fully delved into Erik\u2019s motives and credibility during cross-examination. After categorically denying that his mother had stabbed him, Erik admitted to having changed his story several times. For example, Erik testified that he went to day care the next day, and \u201cshe saw the scab and I was really mad at my mom then for ripping [a flag he had made for her], and I said that my mom stabbed me because I was mad.\u201d At one point, he told his physician that he had walked three miles to his day care that day. Erik also testified that he told the police that his mother had stabbed him twice with the open scissors, yet there were only two puncture wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Because the proffered cross-examination was irrelevant and Erik\u2019s motives were explored thoroughly through proper questioning, the defendant\u2019s right to cross-examination was not unduly hampered. We conclude that the court\u2019s exclusion of the line of questioning regarding Wayne\u2019s motives was proper and did not unfairly restrict the defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against her. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s claim fails to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">We now turn to whether the court\u2019s preclusion of any testimony regarding Wayne\u2019s hostility toward the defendant denied her the right to present a defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The defendant argues that \u201c[i]t is clear in this case that the court determined that the only defense that would be permitted was limited to events surrounding the manner in which Erik received his injury, and the court would permit no evidence demonstrating that her ex-husband was a vindictive and manipulative man who would use his mentally ill son to make false accusations against her.\u201d At trial, the defendant proffered evidence that Wayne was the president of the union that represented the Hamden police department, and was contesting custody and child support payments to the defendant. The line of questioning was either precluded or stricken from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">As we have previously stated, the court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy and scope of cross-examination, and we will not disturb the court\u2019s ruling absent a clear abuse of that discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 69-70. In addition, the proffering party must establish the relevancy of the proffered testimony. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The court precluded the defendant\u2019s testimony regarding her relationship with Wayne and the attendant divorce. The court ruled: \u201cWe\u2019re not trying any divorce, however contentious it may or may not have been, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s not relevant.\u201d We reiterate that the admission of such testimony would create a side issue that would unduly distract the jury from deciding whether the defendant had stabbed her son and was, therefore, irrelevant. Because neither the divorce nor Wayne\u2019s hostility toward the defendant had any bearing on whether the defendant stabbed her son, the court properly precluded the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Whether Wayne manipulated Erik into concocting the story that his mother had stabbed him relates directly to Erik\u2019s credibility, not to whether the defendant stabbed him. Credibility is within the sole province of the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>finder. The jury found that Erik\u2019s testimony at trial was not credible and found that the defendant, indeed, had stabbed her son in the back with a pair of scissors. It is not for this court to second-guess that determination. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s first two claims fail to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly allowed the prosecutor to engage in misconduct during closing argument. Specifically, she argues that the prosecutor improperly vouched for or attacked the credibility of witnesses, injected unproven facts and made personal attacks on defense counsel. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The defendant concedes that she did not properly preserve her claim for appeal. Once again, she seeks review under State v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cIt is well established that [w]e will not afford <em>Golding </em>review to [unpreserved] claims of prosecutorial misconduct where the record does not disclose a pattern of misconduct pervasive throughout the trial or conduct that was so blatantly egregious that it infringed on the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>58 Conn. App. 65, 69, 751 A.2d 843, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 914, 759 A.2d 508 (2000). We now review the closing arguments to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>determine if a pattern of misconduct existed or if the conduct was so egregious as to infringe on the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u201c[P]rosecutorial misconduct can occur in the course of closing argument. . . . When presenting closing arguments, as in all facets of a criminal trial, the prosecutor, as a representative of the state, has a duty of fairness that exceeds that of other advocates.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Copas, </em>252 Conn. 318, 336, 746 A.2d 761 (2000). \u201cNevertheless, [i]n addressing the jury, [c]ounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . Thus, the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered .... Ultimately, therefore, the proper scope of closing ar gument lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u201cWe do not scrutinize each individual comment in a vacuum, but rather we must review the comments complained of in the context of the entire trial. ... It is in that context that the burden [falls] on the defendant to demonstrate that the remarks were so prejudicial that he was deprived of a fair trial and the entire proceedings were tainted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>64 Conn. App. 80, 90-91, 778 A.2d 253, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 911, 782 A.2d 1249 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u201cA prosecutor is not only an officer of the court, like every other attorney, but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the State, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent. . . . By reason of his [or her] office, [the prosecutor] usually exercises great influence upon jurors. [The prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>tor\u2019s] conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty are at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he [or she] represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice or resentment. If the accused be guilty, he [or she] should none the less be convicted only after a fair trial, conducted strictly according to the sound and well-established rules which the laws prescribe. While the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury has no right to consider.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 701-702, 793 A.2d 226 (2002). Our review of the transcripts in this case reveals that the defendant has failed to carry her burden in establishing a violation that would satisfy the requirements of <em>Golding </em>or plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The defendant first argues that the \u201cprosecutor commented directly on the credibility of the state\u2019s chief witness and offered his personal opinion about the lack of merit to the defendant\u2019s theory of defense.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>agree with the defendant that the prosecutor improperly stated his opinion regarding the credibility of the witnesses when, directly after discussing the credibility of the testimony, he stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d This clearly improper remark was, however, made only twice during the entire trial. Because it was fairly isolated, and was not part of an egregious pattern of misconduct, the defendant falls short of meeting her burden. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>supra, 58 Conn. App. 70-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The defendant next argues that the prosecutor included in his summation facts not in evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\u201cA prosecutor, in fulfilling his duties, must confine himself to the evidence in the record. ... [A] lawyer shall not . . . [a]ssert his personal knowledge of the facts in issue, except when testifying as a witness. . . . Statements as to facts that have not been proven amount to unsworn testimony, which is not the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>of proper closing argument.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 717. \u201cOur case law reflects the expectation that jurors will not only weigh conflicting evidence and resolve issues of credibility as they resolve factual issues, but also that they will consider evidence on the basis of their common sense. Jurors are not expected to lay aside matters of common knowledge or their own observation and experience of the affairs of life, but, on the contrary, to apply them to the evidence or facts in hand, to the end that their action may be intelligent and their conclusions correct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Guadalupe, </em>66 Conn. App. 819, 826, 786 A.2d 494 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 907, 789 A.2d 996 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding divorce were merely an appeal to the jury\u2019s common sense and life experiences. Therefore, the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding divorce were not improper.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The defendant\u2019s next contention regarding the prosecutor\u2019s summation is that the prosecutor waged a personal attack against defense counsel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>argues that the prosecutor \u201cindirectly called [counsel] a liar and coward, and the state dismissed his admonishment not to feel sorry for his client as \u2018bunk\u2019 while simultaneously suggesting that defense counsel\u2019s motives were improper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u201cThe parameters of the term zealous advocacy are also well settled. The prosecutor may not express his own opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Nor should a prosecutor express his opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the guilt of the defendant. . . . Such expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony, and are particularly difficult for the jury to ignore because of the prosecutor\u2019s special position. . . . Moreover, because the jury is aware that the prosecutor has prepared and presented the case and consequently, may have access to matters not in evidence ... it is likely to infer that such matters precipitated the personal opinions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u201c[T]he prosecutor is expected to refrain from impugning, directly or through implication, the integrity or institutional role of defense counsel.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Chasse, </em>51 Conn. App. 345, 358, 721 A.2d 1212 (1998), cert. denied, 247 Conn. 960, 723 A.2d 816 (1999). \u201cIt does not follow [however] that every use of rhetorical language or device is improper. . . . The occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>256 Conn. 291, 310, 772 A.2d 1107, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1068, 122 S. Ct. 670, 151 L. Ed. 2d 584 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Although we do not condone the prosecutor\u2019s comments directed at defense counsel, we cannot conclude that the comments rose to a level such that they deprived the defendant of a fair trial. We, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>decline to review the defendant\u2019s claims pursuant to <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The defendant\u2019s final argument is that the prosecutor, while referring to Erik\u2019s written and signed statement to the police, improperly commented that \u201cits based upon [the fact that] the court has found the reliability of such a statement.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree. The statement was admitted pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 753, a prior inconsistent statement is admissible for substantive purposes, rather than only for impeachment purposes, if the following four requirements are met: \u201c(1) the statement must be in writing; (2) the statement must be signed by the declarant; (3) the declarant must possess personal knowledge of the facts contained therein; and (4) the declarant must testify at trial and be subject to cross-examination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>260 Conn. 372, 376 n.6, 796 A.2d 1191 (2002). \u201cAlthough the requirement that prior statements be written and signed by the declarant is not an absolute guaranty of reliability, it does provide significant assurance of an accurate rendition of the statement and that the declarant realized it would be relied upon.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 754. Viewing the prosecutor\u2019s remark in its entirety, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>is clear that he was merely stating why the statement was admissible and why the jury could use it for substantive purposes. Such argument is not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">As a final matter, we review whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct caused substantial prejudice to the defendant. In determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, we consider several factors. \u201cIncluded among those factors are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>258 Conn. 229, 262-63, 780 A.2d 53 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Our review of the record does not disclose a pattern of misconduct pervasive throughout the trial or conduct that was so egregious that it infringed on the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. The improper comments made by the prosecutor were infrequent and were not severe in nature. In addition, some of the prosecutor\u2019s comments were in direct response to the defendant\u2019s closing argument. Furthermore, the state presented overwhelming evidence against the defendant. On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that she was deprived of a fair trial, and, therefore, her claim fails to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court abused its discretion when it refused to consider her motion for a new trial. Specifically, she argues that the court improperly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because she failed to bring a separate action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-270. We conclude, albeit on ground different from those on which the trial court relied, that the court properly dismissed the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">This court has previously noted that failure to properly bring a petition for anew trial implicates the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Servello, </em>14 Conn. App. 88, 101-102, 540 A.2d 378, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 811, 545 A.2d 1107 (1988). Our Supreme Court has since clarified the distinction between a trial court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d and its \u201cauthority to act\u201d in <em>Amodio </em>v. Amodio, 247 Conn. 724, 727-29, 724 A.2d 1084 (1999) (explaining distinction between \u201cjurisdiction\u201d and \u201cauthority to act\u201d), <em>Kim </em>v. <em>Magnotta, </em>249 Conn. 94, 101-102, 733 A.2d 809 (1999) (statutory limitation on motions to open judgments contained in General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a not jurisdictional), and <em>Cantoni </em>v. <em>Xerox Corp., </em>251 Conn. 153, 161-62, 740 A.2d 796 (1999) (challenge alleging tribunal's action misconstrues its statutory authority is claim of statutory construction not jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of a court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. ... A court does not truly lack subject matter jurisdiction if it has competence to entertain the action before it. . . . Jurisdiction involves the power in a court to hear and determine the cause of action presented to it and its source is the constitutional and statutory provisions by which it is created.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Carey, 222 Conn. 299, 304-305, 610 A.2d 1147 (1992), on appeal after remand, 228 Conn. 487, 636 A.2d 840 (1994). \u201cOnce it is determined that a tribunal has authority or competence to decide the class of cases to which the action belongs, the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is resolved in favor of entertaining the action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>O\u2019Bryan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Bryan, </em>67 Conn. App. 51, 53, 787 A.2d 15 (2001), cert. granted on other grounds, 259 Conn. 911, 789 A.2d 995 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u201cAlthough related, the court\u2019s authority to act pursuant to a statute is different from its subject matter jurisdiction. The power of the court to hear and determine, which is implicit in jurisdiction, is not to be confused with the way in which that power must be exercised in order to comply with the terms of the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 54. Furthermore, this court indulges every presumption in favor of jurisdiction. See id., 53-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Section 52-270 confers jurisdiction on the Superior Court to hear a defendant\u2019s claim for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. Practice Book \u00a7 42-55 implements the statutory right conferred on the defendant by General Statutes \u00a7 52-270. \u201cPractice Book rules do not ordinarily define subject matter jurisdiction. General Statutes \u00a7 51-14 (a) authorizes the judges of the Superior Court to promulgate rules regulating pleading, practice and procedure in judicial proceedings .... Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right <em>nor the jurisdiction of any of the courts.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Our Supreme Court has observed that there may not be any examples of rules of practice governing criminal matters that affect subject matter jurisdiction. Id. \u201cEven if a . . . Practice Book rule must be strictly construed and is mandatory, compliance with its requirements does not necessarily become a prerequisite to a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Id., 310; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>242 Conn. 125, 139 n.17, 698 A.2d 823 (1997); <em>LoSacco </em>v. <em>Young, </em>210 Conn. 503, 508, 555 A.2d 986 (1989) (rule of practice not being constitutional or statutory mandate cannot be jurisdictional); <em>Blakeney </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>Commissioner of </em>Correction, 47 Conn. App. 568, 581, 706 A.2d 989 (prosecutor\u2019s failure to sign information, as required by rule of practice, not jurisdictional), cert. denied, 244 Conn. 913, 713 A.2d 830 (1998). Moreover, our rules of practice \u201creflect the courts\u2019 authority to prescribe rules to regulate their proceedings and facilitate the administration of justice as they deem necessary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>249 Conn. 482, 495, 733 A.2d 835 (1999). Therefore, our role is to determine whether the court properly exercised its authority to act. See <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u201cIt is well established that to obtain a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence, a defendant must bring a petition under Practice Book \u00a7 42-55 . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Legrande, </em>60 Conn. App. 408, 419, 759 A.2d 1027 (2000), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 925, 767 A.2d 99 (2001). Practice Book \u00a7 42-55 provides that \u201c[a] request for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence shall be called a petition for a new trial and shall be brought in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-270. The judicial authority may grant the petition even though an appeal is pending.\u201d A petition for a new trial properly is \u201cinstituted by a writ and complaint served on the adverse party; although such an action is collateral to the action in which a new trial is sought, it is by its nature a distinct proceeding.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>180 Conn. 141, 144, 429 A.2d 810 (1980). \u201c[A] different standard of review applies in these two separate procedures for seeking a new trial. To obtain a new trial through a [Practice Book \u00a7 42-55] petition, a defendant must overcome a \u2018strict standard\u2019 including a requirement that the newly discovered evidence be likely to produce a different result in a new trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>205 Conn. 723, 729, 535 A.2d 808 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">In the present <em>case, </em>the defendant filed a supplemental motion for new trial on November 16, 2000. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>defendant neglected to serve a writ of summons and complaint in accordance with \u00a7 52-270, but merely filed the motion in the criminal case, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 42-53 and 42-55 and General Statutes \u00a7 52-270. In its detailed memorandum of decision dated December 7, 2000, the court dismissed the motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the defendant did not institute a separate action in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 42-55 and General Statutes \u00a7 52-270. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s failure to bring her claim in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 42-55 did not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction. We further conclude that the court properly dismissed the defendant\u2019s improper motion because it lacked authority to consider it under our rules of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberson, </em>62 Conn. App. 422, 771 A.2d 224 (2001), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 135, the defendant argues that \u201cthe state waived any objection by acquiescing in the procedure, and the trial court never suggested until its ruling that the procedure was inadequate to preserve the record.\u201d In <em>Myers, </em>the defendant filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 902, now \u00a7 42-53. The state argued that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s claim of juror bias was initiated through a procedurally defective petition for a new trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>supra, 134. Our Supreme Court noted that the motion \u201cclearly [did] not meet the requirements of a <em>petition </em>for a new trial because <em>it too was filed within the confines of the criminal case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 135. The court further held that \u201cthe issue of juror bias was properly before the trial court in the motion for a new trial brought prior to judgment and pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 902 [now \u00a7 42-53].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>supra, 139. In the present case, the defendant based her motion solely on newly discovered evidence, a claim that must be brought by means of a <em>petition for a new trial </em>pursuant to Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u00a7 42-55. Therefore, <em>Myers </em>offers no support for the proposition for which it is offered by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In <em>Roberson, </em>the defendant filed a motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberson, </em>supra, 62 Conn. App. 425. The trial court conducted a hearing and decided the motion on the merits. Id. This court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and recognized, in a footnote, that the \u201ctrial court noted in its memorandum of decision that \u2018[t]he state has waived any objection to the trial court deciding this motion for a new trial under the applicable tests regarding newly discovered evidence.\u2019 \u201d Id., 424 n.4. The defendant relies on this footnote to support her argument that the state waived any objection when it acquiesced in the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s interpretation of <em>Roberson. </em>In <em>Roberson, </em>the issue of whether the motion was properly before the trial court was not before this court. It was not a part of the statement of the issues, nor was it argued or briefed on appeal. This court does not generally review such issues; see <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Liberty Bank, </em>46 Conn. App. 559, 563 &amp;n.3, 699 A.2d 305 (1997); because it would deprive the parties of an opportunity to present argument regarding those issues. See also <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Granby Holdings, Inc., </em>230 Conn. 95, 99, 644 A.2d 325 (1994). Although we can review a claim when it rises to the level of plain error, this type of review is \u201creserved for extraordinary circumstances and situations in which the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Liberty Bank, </em>supra, 562 n.2. In <em>Roberson, </em>the result would have been the same whether this court dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Therefore, it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>not undermine the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">As a final matter, we clarify our previous decisions characterizing the failure to bring a petition for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence as depriving the court of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In accordance <em>w'\u00fahAmodio </em>and its progeny, we recognize that a party\u2019s failure to comply with our rules of practice implicates the courts\u2019 authority to act. Furthermore, we express our opinion that the trial court should not exercise its authority in cases such as this where a party fails properly to serve a writ of summons and complaint on the adverse party in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 42-55.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53-21 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who (1) wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that the life or limb of such child is endangered, the health of such child is likely to be injured or the morals of such child are likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child . . . shall be guilty of a class C felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b41-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the third degree when: (1) With intent to cause physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person; or (2) he recklessly causes serious physical injury to another; or (3) with criminal negligence, he causes physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon, a dangerous instrument or an electronic defense weapon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b41-10\"> Shortly before the incident, the defendant and Wayne finalized a contentious divorce.
