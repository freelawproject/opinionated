We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">On April 7, 1995, a jury returned a verdict finding the defendant guilty of murder, possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent and possession of narcotics. The court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict and sentenced the defendant to an effective prison term of sixty years. This court, on direct appeal, affirmed the judgment of conviction. <em>State </em>v. Hilton, 45 Conn. App. 207, 694 A.2d 830, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 925, 701 A.2d 659 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1134, 118 S. Ct. 1091, 140 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">In the previous appeal, we noted that a discrepancy existed between the original information charging the defendant and the subsequent trial court documents. \u201cWhile the original information charged a violation of <em>General Statutes \u00a7 53a,-54a, </em>the state\u2019s substitute information and bill of particulars charged a violation of <em>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b, </em>the statutory provision for capital felony. The judgment file also shows a conviction under \u00a7 53a-54b. The state\u2019s brief cites \u00a7 53a-54b, but the defendant\u2019s brief cites \u00a7 53a-54a. The case, however, was tried pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54a and the trial court instructed [the jury] pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54a. <em>We conclude that this inconsistency is a result of a scrivener\u2019s error. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. Hilton, supra, 45 Conn. App. 208 n.2. That discrepancy was nothing more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>than a clerical error; therefore, it could be corrected at any time. See <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>211 Conn. 485, 494, 560 A.2d 396 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>199 Conn. 417, 436-37, 513 A.2d 620 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The defendant filed a motion for the correction of the illegal sentence on March 30, 2000, alleging that the discrepancy was not a scrivener\u2019s error and that his due process rights were violated. In a memorandum of decision filed May 26,2000, the court denied the motion. The court noted that it was bound by our decision that the numerous references<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the incorrect statute, \u00a7 53a-54b, were the result of scrivener\u2019s errors. On May 30, 2000, a corrected judgment mittimus was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">It is well established that \u201c[i]n carrying out a mandate of this court, the trial court is limited to the specific direction of the mandate as interpreted <em>in light of the opinion. . . . </em>This is the guiding principle that the trial court must observe. . . . Compliance means that the direction is not deviated from. ... It is the duty of the trial court on remand to comply strictly with the mandate of the appellate court .... No judgment other than that directed or permitted by the reviewing court may be rendered .... The trial court should examine the mandate and <em>the opinion of the reviewing court and proceed in conformity with the views expressed </em>therein.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>West Haven Sound Development Corp. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>207 Conn. 308, 312, 541 A.2d 858 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>63 Conn. App. 697, 700, 778 A.2d 987 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>45 Conn. App. 12, 16, 692 A.2d 1306, cert. denied, 241 Conn. 923, 697 A.2d 360 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">This court specifically determined that the discrepancy between the original information and the subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>quent documents was a result of a scrivener\u2019s error. The trial court lacked the authority to grant the defendant\u2019s motion because to do so would expressly contradict the opinion set forth by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\"> The office of the chief public defender initially represented the defendant in this matter, but subsequently filed a motion to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 18 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1967). That motion was granted on September 27, 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-9\"> In addition to the substitute information and bill of particulars, the judgment file and the judgment mittimus all cite General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
