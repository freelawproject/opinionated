The trial court found that the defendant, who was the tenant under the lease, had breached its duty to pay \u201cadditional rent,\u201d over and above a base level of rent, to cover certain variable \u201cexcess expenses.\u201d The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) refused to hold that the plaintiffs allegations in its complaint were insufficient to sustain the judgment, (2) found that the plaintiff had provided statements to the defendant detailing the additional rent due within the time frame required in the lease and (3) found that the statements provided were certified in accordance with the provisions of the lease. The plaintiff cross appeals from that part of the court\u2019s judgment that denied the plaintiffs request for interest, late charges and attorney\u2019s fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>and costs. The plaintiff claims that (1) the court\u2019s denial of interest and late charges was clearly erroneous, and (2) the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the plaintiff\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We affirm that part of the judgment awarding damages for the defendant\u2019s breach of the additional rent terms of the lease. We reverse that part of the judgment denying the plaintiffs request for interest, late charges and attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of these appeals. The defendant is a corporation that leased the second floor of a commercial building from the plaintiff for a five year term from November 25, 1987, through November 24, 1992. Pursuant to the written lease agreement for a Wethersfield office building, the defendant agreed to pay the lessor, the plaintiff, as additional rent its proportional share of the cost of certain real estate property taxes to the town of Wethersfield and certain other operating expenses, all as more particularly set forth in the rider to the lease agreement, which states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">\u201c(d) (i) On or before March 1 of each calendar year (or as soon thereafter as is practical), Landlord shall deliver to Tenant a statement, certified by a partner of Landlord, of Tenant\u2019s proportionate share of Excess Expenses for the preceding year. If Tenant\u2019s proportionate share of the actual Excess Expenses for the preceding year exceeds the aggregate of the estimated monthly payments made by Tenant during such year, Tenant shall within ten (10) days of the receipt of such statement, tender to Landlord an amount equal to such excess as Additional Rent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">This dispute arises because the plaintiff did not bill the defendant until September of 1994 for the additional rent for the years 1990, 1991 and 1992. The five year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>lease between the parties had expired by its terms in November of 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">In count one of its two count complaint, the plaintiff claimed that for a period of three years, the defendant breached its contractual duty to pay \u201cadditional rent\u201d to the plaintiff to cover variable \u201cexcess expenses,\u201d which included a share of the real estate taxes and operating expenses of the real property subject to the lease. The plaintiffs second count sounded in quantum meruit and was not addressed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">In its answer, the defendant denied any current obligation to furnish the plaintiff with additional rent under the lease. The defendant advanced several special defenses. First, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff failed to follow the procedures described in the lease for obtaining additional rent. Specifically, paragraph (d) (i) of the rider to the lease stated: \u201cOn or before March 1 of each calendar year (or as soon thereafter as is practical), [the plaintiff] Landlord shall deliver to [the defendant] Tenant a statement, certified by a partner of Landlord, of Tenant\u2019s proportionate share of Excess Expenses for the preceding year.\u201d The defendant alleged that those procedures constituted a condition precedent to recovering additional rent. The defendant also claimed that the plaintiff waived its right to collect additional rent and that it was barred from recovering additional rent by the applicable statute of limitations and the doctrine of laches. The defendant also claimed that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover damages under its second count, which sounded in quantum meruit. Finally, the defendant alleged that it had surrendered the leased premises in 1992 and that any obligation to furnish additional rent terminated at that time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The court found that the plaintiffs procedures for billing additional rent did not constitute the failure of a condition precedent to recovering additional rent. Although the plaintiff did not provide statements detailing the amount of additional rent due for the calendar years 1990,1991 and 1992 until September 12,1994, the court found that this delay was \u201ccommercially understandable.\u201d In its memorandum of decision, the court found that the litigants had established \u201can atmosphere in which late statements would be tolerated\u201d through the course of the parties\u2019 performance. For the years 1989 and 1990, the defendant paid without objection invoices for additional rent that were sent to the defendant after the time permitted in the additional rent provisions of the lease. The plaintiff alerted the defendant that it had been embroiled in a dispute with its mortgagee concerning the proper amount of additional rent, which explained the delay in providing the statements. The court also noted that the lease provisions governing the procedure for obtaining additional rent contained flexible language and that the lease did not indicate that \u201ctime was of the essence.\u201d Paragraph (d) (i) of the rider to the lease stated: \u201cOn or before March 1 of each calendar year <em>(or as soon thereafter as is practical), </em>[the plaintiff] Landlord shall deliver to [the defendant] Tenant a statement . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court found that the plaintiff had sufficiently performed its duty to provide certified statements because a partner of the plaintiff, P. Christopher Henney, had \u201cwritten and signed\u201d the letter accompanying the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The court awar ded damages of $31,413.27, reflecting the amount of additional rent originally invoiced to the defendant for 1990, 1991 and 1992. The court did not award any damages for interest, late charges or attorney\u2019s fees and costs because it found that the defendant had raised and proven equitable claims, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>laches, that should bar recovery of such damages. The present appeal and cross appeal followed. Further facts and procedural history will be set forth where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment because it did not plead in its complaint that it complied with the terms of the lease. The defendant claims that alease is like any other contract and that to succeed in a breach of contract claim, a plaintiff must plead in his complaint that he has performed his obligations under the terms of the agreement. The defendant cited <em>Sortito </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>108 Conn. 163, 167, 142 A. 808 (1928), and <em>New Haven Metal &amp; Heating Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>6 Conn. Sup. 488, 490 (1938), as purportedly supporting this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">The trial court never decided the pleading issue in its memorandum of decision. It did not do so because when it inquired of the defendant\u2019s counsel during post-trial argument whether he was requesting the court to decide the case on that technical basis after a full trial, the defendant\u2019s counsel answered, \u201cNo.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant never moved for an articulation or rectification from the trial judge. Appellants bear the burden of furnishing this court with an adequate record to review their claims. Practice Book \u00a7 61-10; 1 B. Holden &amp; J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Daly, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 60i, p. 386. Absent a clear record of the factual and legal basis underlying the trial court\u2019s resolution of an issue, we are unable to afford review. Accordingly, where the appellant claims that the trial court\u2019s decision is ambiguous, unclear or incomplete, an appellant must seek an articulation or rectification; Practice Book \u00a7 66-5; or this court will not review the claim. See <em>CB Commercial/Hampshire, LLC </em>v. <em>Security Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>61 Conn. App. 144, 149-50, 763 A.2d 32 (2000), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 940, 767 A.2d 1211 (2001). That is the case with regard to this claim. See <em>Hunter\u2019s Ambulance Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shernow, </em>70 Conn. App. 96, 113, 798 A.2d 991 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Further, the defendant has not cited any authority standing for the proposition that an issue not decided by the trial judge may be reviewed on appeal, where that issue was not decided at trial because the defendant conceded to the trial judge that it need not be decided. We therefore decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">The defendant next claims that the 1990, 1991 and 1992 statements billing additional rent under the lease were delivered in breach of paragraph (d) (i) of the lease rider requiring that these statements be delivered on or before March 1 of each calendar year or as soon thereafter as is practical. The court found that \u201ca statement sufficient to meet the terms of paragraph (d) (i) was presented to the defendant as soon after the March 1 date as \u2018practical.\u2019 \u201d It based this finding on several other subordinate findings. First, the parties were \u201csophisticated in dealing with leases and additional rent clauses of the kind involved in this case.\u201d Second, there had been a course of performance by the parties of late statements for the additional rent for years 1989 and 1990 and in which the additional rent was paid without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>question, and this course of performance established an atmosphere in which the court found \u201clate statements would be tolerated.\u201d Third, time was not specified to be of the essence in the agreement. Finally, the court noted that the defendant had been aware of ongoing disputes that the plaintiff had with its mortgage lenders. These disputes arose out of an assignment of rentals. The court found that the credibility of the plaintiffs explanation was unchallenged and was commercially understandable. It also found that the defendant was not prejudiced in any way and that the billings made were made as soon as practical.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u201c[0]ur resolution of the [plaintiffs] claim is guided by the general principles governing the construction of contracts. A contract must be construed to effectuate the intent of the parties, which is determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction. . . . [T]he intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms. . . . <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Whitey\u2019s Frame Shop, </em>241 Conn. 678, 686, 697 A.2d 1137 (1997). Although ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact . . . [w]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law. . . . <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>232 Conn. 272, [277-78], 654 A.2d 737 (1995); see <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 716, 740, 643 A.2d 1226 (1994), on appeal after remand, 38 Conn.

Practice Book \u00a7 4061 [now\u00a7 60-5]; <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 752, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992); <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>207 Conn. 683, 689, 542 A.2d 1145 <em>(1988); Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>222 Conn. 49, 53, 607 A.2d 424 (1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Issler </em>v. <em>Issler, </em>250 Conn. 226, 236, 737 A.2d 383 (1999). Under the circumstances of this case, because the trial court did not rely solely on the written agreement but took into account the surrounding circumstances, we apply the clearly erroneous standard to the court\u2019s fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The defendant argues that the phrase \u201cas soon as is practical\u201d should mean \u201cfeasible,\u201d citing the Alabama case of <em>Occidental Life Ins. Co. of Calif. </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>43 Ala. App. 61, 63, 179 So. 2d 771 (1965), or, in the alternative, \u201cthat which is possible of reasonable performance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Valdese, </em>306 N.C. 79, 84, 291 S.E.2d 630 (1982). It cites <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Roger Smith Hotels Corp., </em>143 Conn. 1, 6, 118 A.2d 463 (1955), for its agreement with the proposition that \u201c[i]n construing [a lease] . . . [t]he intention of the parties is controlling and must be gathered from the language of the lease in the light of the circumstances surrounding the parties at the execution of the instrument . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>We first examine the pertinent lease language. The lease states that \u201c[o]n or before March 1 of each calendar year (or as soon thereafter as is practical) Landlord shall deliver to Tenant a statement, certified by a partner of Landlord, of Tenant\u2019s proportionate share of Excess Expenses for the preceding year.\u201d Clearly, the language itself does not set out March 1 of each year as a termination date for performance since it provides in the disjunctive that billing may occur on another date if the March 1 date was not practical. Nor does the lease language fix an outside date for performance of the billing notification as to excess rent, stating only that it is to occur as soon as practical.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The court found that one of the surrounding circumstances was that the defendant had tolerated late billings for additional rent for the years 1988 and 1989.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant asks us to categorize this as a waiver rather than a course of performance. The court did not do so in its judgment, nor will we. The course of performance the parties followed over the years is strong evidence that the parties did not interpret the lease language \u201cas soon as is practical\u201d in the draconian manner the defendant now urges. See 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 202 (4) (1981) (\u201c[w]here an agreement involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other, any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection is given great weight in the interpretation of the agreement\u201d); see also 11 S. Williston, Contracts (4th Ed. Lord 1999) \u00a7 32:14, pp. 491-501 (\u201cPractical Intexpretation or Construction\u2014 Given that the purpose of judicial interpretation is to ascertain the parties\u2019 intentions, the parties\u2019 own practical interpretation of the contract \u2014 how they actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>acted, thereby giving meaning to their contract during the course of performing it \u2014 can be an important aid to the court. . . . Courts . . . give great weight to the parties\u2019 . . . practical interpretation . . . unless it is contrary to the plain meaning of the contract . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Just as the term \u201creasonable time\u201d for performance of a contract is ordinarily a question of fact for the trier of fact, so too it was a question of fact for the trial court to determine whether the plaintiff delivered the statements in question \u201cas soon as is practical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u201cWhere no time for the performance of a contract is contained within its terms, the law presumes that it is to be performed within a reasonable time. <em>Texas Co. </em>v. <em>Crown Petroleum Corporation, </em>137 Conn. 217, 227, 75 A.2d 499 [1950]; <em>Santoro </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>108 Conn. 683, [689-90], 145 A. 273 <em>[1929]. </em>Benassi v.Harris, 147 Conn. 451, 458, 162 A.2d 521 (1960); see also <em>Central New Haven Development Corporation </em>v. <em>La Crepe, Inc., </em>177 Conn. 212, 216, 413 A.2d 840 (1979).

App. 80, 86, 752 A.2d 517 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\u201cThe standard of review with respect to a court\u2019s findings of fact is the clearly erroneous standard. The trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. . . . We cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed . . . .\u201d <em>United Components, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wdowiak, </em>239 Conn. 259, 263, 684 A.2d 693 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schlicher </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>supra, 58 Conn. App. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The court, in addition to the way the parties acted on billing and payment of the 1988 and 1989 additional rental payments, had other evidence of surrounding circumstances supporting its conclusion that the 1990, 1991 and 1992 payments had been made as soon as practical.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">First, the plaintiff had made an assignment of rentals to its mortgagee. Where income producing property is financed by a first mortgage, a typical lender will demand that as part of the required documentation for the loan that the borrower assign the rentals to it as additional security for repayment of the principal and interest due. The court found that the defendant had notice of that dispute about whether additional rent had to be remitted to the mortgagee or could be retained by the plaintiffs. The court found that the negotiations between the mortgagee and the plaintiff were commercially understandable and that because of the delay caused by this dispute, the unchallenged reasons given by the plaintiff for the delay were circumstances that made the billing \u201cas soon as [was] practical.\u201d Had the plaintiffs mortgagee declared a default in the mortgage note and deed and then accelerated payment of principal or commenced foreclosure by virtue of the plaintiff having earlier billed the 1990, 1991 and 1992 additional expenses but then failed to remit all of them to the mortgagee, the practical consequences to the plaintiff, if not to the defendant and any other tenants, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>have been enormous. We therefore do not find the court\u2019s factual findings clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and pleadings of record. There is evidence to support all of the court\u2019s findings and, after review, we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. We therefore conclude that this argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to comply with its obligation to deliver \u201ccertified statements\u201d to the plaintiff. The operative lease language provided in pertinent part that: \u201cLandlord shall deliver to Tenant a statement, certified by a partner of Landlord, of Tenant\u2019s proportionate share of Excess Expenses for the preceding year.\u201d Acting by P. Christopher Henney, general partner, on September 12, 1994, the plaintiff sent to the defendant at its 110 Wall Street, New York, office the following signed communication for each of the invoices for the three years in question, which the defendant maintains satisfies the certification requirement. \u201cPursuant to your lease with Putnam Park Associates for office space in Wethersfield, Connecticut, enclosed please find invoices for the \u2018Additional Rent\u2019 due. We apologize for the delay, but because of lengthy litigation with our first mortgagee, a defunct and government-entangled savings and loan, it has been impossible for us to issue these invoices until now. Under the terms of the lease payment is to be made within 10 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">\u201cShould you have any questions about that which is enclosed, please do not hesitate calling us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">We note that both parties, which the court found were \u201csophisticated,\u201d chose not to further define the term \u201ccertified\u201d in their lease agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">On appeal, the defendant claims that Henney\u2019s signed communication did not suffice to meet contractual cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>tification requirements. It points out that the three pages of attached invoices for the additional rent were not signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The amounts of additional rent billed to the defendant were $10,685.85 for the year 1990, $10,879.57 for the year 1991 and $9847.85 for the year 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The court found that \u201c[t]he statements, accompanied by letters from Mr. Henney, a partner of the plaintiff, were sufficient to meet the \u2018certified\u2019 requirement of paragraph (d) (i) because even though the exhibits of the letters introduced into evidence were unsigned filed copies, Mr. Henney clearly testified that he had written and signed these letters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The court found that Henney was a partner, as the contract required, and that the letter enclosing the certifications had been signed. The question before us on appeal is whether the court properly determined that the signed communication that was sent satisfied the \u201ccertified\u201d requirement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">The plaintiff did not simply send a bill. The invoices were accompanied by a signed letter. It identified invoices for \u201cAdditional Rent\u201d due. It explained the delay. It demanded that \u201cunder the terms of the lease payment is to be made within 10 days,\u201d which is an unequivocal statement by the plaintiff that the respective billings were what the defendant owed under the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">One of the dictionary definitions of certify which the defendant briefs is \u201cto present in formal communication, esp. in a document under hand or seal as . . . being as represented.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We cannot say that the court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous under those definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The defendant also cites the case of <em>Lake </em>v. <em>Motor Vehicles Division, </em>133 Or. App. 550, 554, 892 P.2d 1025, review denied, 321 Or. 246 (1995), as authority for its contention that \u201cto certify\u201d has been defined as the equivalent of \u201cto warrant\u201d and that an allegation of a certification asserts that more than a mere representation was made. Here the signed letter is more than a mere representation; it states that payment of the invoices is due \u201c[ujnder terms of the lease.\u201d This can only mean that the writer claimed a contractual right to the moneys billed since the lease obligated the tenant to pay and gave the landlord the right to receive only the tenant\u2019s aliquot portion of excess expense sums incurred. It identifies the \u201cinvoices.\u201d The invoice documents themselves detail all of the common expenses and how the plaintiff arrived at the defendant\u2019s 1.72 percent share of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Under all of these circumstances, we do not conclude that the court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">The plaintiff has cross appealed, claiming that (1) the trial court\u2019s decision to deny the plaintiffs request for interest and late charges was clearly erroneous and (2) that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the plaintiffs request for attorney\u2019s fees and late charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">At the time of trial, the amount of interest claimed was $13,570.53, and the total of late charges was $1570.66.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that court\u2019s failure to award interest and penalties provided for in the lease was contrary to \u00a7\u00a7 33b and 5 of the lease and that therefore the court\u2019s decision is clearly erroneous. It seeks reversal of that decision and a remand to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>trial court for further proceedings to determine the proper allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The court held that \u201cthe defendant has raised several equitable defenses, including laches, which is sufficient, in view of all the circumstances, to negate the claims of the plaintiff for interest, late charges and legal fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The plaintiff in its cross appeal cites <em>Pacelli Bros. Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pacelli, </em>189 Conn. 401, 415, 456 A.2d 325 (1983). In <em>Pacelli, </em>the trial court gave no reason for not awarding attorney\u2019s fees provided in a note which was being collected by litigation, whereas here the court did give reasons. We nonetheless conclude that the reasoning in <em>Pacelli </em>is both persuasive and pertinent because it rests on the concept of the legal instrument\u2019s provisions being a whole of which the interest and collection portions are an integral part. In <em>Pacelli, </em>our Supreme Court stated: \u201cWe know of no principle whereby the amount due upon a note which has been found to be valid may be reduced because of conduct of the holder which has been found to be reprehensible but not violative of the legal rights of the maker. The provision for a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee was an integral part of the note and, like any other clause determining the amount due, could not be disregarded. Having decided that the note was valid, the [trial] court had no choice but to allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the debt.\u201d Id. We agree with the plaintiff that in light of the clear terms of the agreement, once the court found that the plaintiff was entitled to payment of the additional rent under the lease and that the defendant had not been prejudiced in any way by delay, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, late charges running from the date ten days after the September 12, 1994 date of the invoice and interest from that date were due. As with the note in <em>Pacelli, </em>the phrases describing the plaintiffs right to interest, attorney\u2019s fees and late <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>charges were an integral part of the lease instrument.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If no award to reflect these liquidated damages were made, the plaintiff would not be made whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">On the defendant\u2019s appeal, the judgment is affirmed. On the plaintiffs cross appeal, the judgment is reversed as to the refusal to award interest, attorney\u2019s fees and late charges and the case is remanded for further proceedings to determine the proper amount of interest, attorney\u2019s fees and late charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b26-8\"> Neither the special defense regarding quantum meruit, which the court did not decide, nor the claim that by surrender the obligation to furnish additional rent terminated are subjects of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b28-9\"> The full colloquy between the court and defense counsel was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-10\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: ... A plaintiff is required to both plead and prove when he sues under a lease that he performed his obligations under the lease. That\u2019s not pleaded anywhere in this complaint. It\u2019s not pleaded in the specific terms. It\u2019s not pleaded in the general terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-11\">\u201cThe Court: You don\u2019t want me to dispose of the case on such a technicality, do you, counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-12\">\u201c[Defandant\u2019s Counsel]: No. I\u2019m just saying \u2014 I\u2019m going to get into the proof now. But it\u2019s both a requirement of pleading and proof, and at least cases in the history of the state of Connecticut had disposed of a case on that ground, so I give them to Your Honor for what they\u2019re worth.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b32-7\"> We note that although the court referenced 1999, it clearly meant 1989 in the context in which this date appears.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b36-11\"><em> </em>The defendant quoted from Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b39-13\"> Section 33b of the lease agreement states: \u201cAny costs or expenses incurred by Landlord, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, involved in collecting or endeavoring to collect the Rent or any part thereof or enforcing or endeavoring to enforce any rights against Tenant, including the rights set forth in this Section 33, or curing or endeavoring to cure any default of tenant, under or in connection with this Lease, or pursuant to law, including any such cost, expense or disbursement involved in instituting and prosecuting summary proceedings, shall bear interest at the highest rate permitted by law from the date such cost or expense is incurred or disbursement made, until reimbursement to Landlord by Tenant, and shall be due and payable within ten (10) days of Landlord\u2019s demand therefore, as Additional Rent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
