It presents the question of whether the commissioner of labor, who has the authority to collect unpaid wages on behalf of employees pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-72 (wage collection statute), is permitted to sue the general contractor and its surety to enforce payment on a labor and materials bond pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-41 (public works statute) and 49-42 (bond enforcement statute). The trial court answered this question in the negative. We disagree and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">This appeal arises out of an action commenced by the plaintiff, the commissioner of labor (commissioner), on December 18, 1998, to collect unpaid prevailing and overtime wages<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that were owed to eighty employees of Big Bell Development Corporation (subcontractor). They had performed work on a public works project for removal of asbestos from certain Hartford public schools. The commissioner sought recovery from the general contractor, C.J.M. Services, Inc. (general contractor), and from the Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania (ICSP) on the payment bond for the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">In his amended complaint,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the commissioner alleged, inter alia: (1) ICSP was liable, as surety on the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>bond, for tbe payment of labor performed on the project (count one); (2) the general contractor was liable, as a matter of statutory law, as an \u201cemployer,\u201d as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a (l),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for payment of wages under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-53<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (prevailing wage stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ute) and 31-76c* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (overtime wage statute) (count two); and (3) the general contractor, as a matter of contract law, was liable for payment of wages pursuant to its contract for the project (count three). In each count, the commissioner relied on his authority to bring an action pursuant to the wage collection statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">On July 23, 1999, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> motion to strike each count of the amended complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court did so on two grounds. First, the court concluded that the commissioner had no authority to bring suit, on behalf of a subcontractor\u2019s employees, against the general contractor or its bonding company. Second, the court concluded that the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>contractor was not an \u201cemployer\u201d as statutorily defined and, therefore, was not liable as alleged by the commissioner. Because the general contractor was not liable, its surety, ICSP, also was not hable.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">On September 7, 1999, without waiving his appellate rights to challenge the court\u2019s striking of the counts in the earlier complaint, the commissioner filed a second amended complaint. In that complaint, count one (amended count one) was brought against only the general contractor and alleged that, as was previously alleged against ICSP, the general contractor was hable pursuant to the payment bond. It also alleged that the general contractor was an \u201cemployer\u201d as statutorily defined. On January 31, 2000, the court granted the general contractor\u2019s motion to strike amended count one.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">On appeal to this court, the commissioner claims that each of the stricken counts was legally sufficient to survive the defendants\u2019 motions to strike. Specifically, he argues that: (1) he has authority under the wage collection statute to collect unpaid wages on behalf of the subcontractor\u2019s employees; (2) ICSP, as a surety on the labor and materials bond, is hable for payment of wages to the subcontractor\u2019s employees; (3) the general contractor is hable for payment of wages to the subcontractor\u2019s employees;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (4) there were disputed factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>issues about the general contractor\u2019s alleged liability as a de facto direct employer of the subcontractor\u2019s employees; and (5) the amended prayer for relief, which included a request for injunctive relief, made all the stricken counts legally sufficient to withstand a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The standard applicable to our review of a trial court\u2019s granting of a motion to strike is well established. \u201cA motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading, and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court. As a result, our review of the court\u2019s ruling is plenary. . . . We take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and we construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency. . . . Thus, [i]f facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vacco </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp., </em>260 Conn. 59, 64-65, 793 A.2d 1048 (2002); <em>Jewish Home for the Elderly of Fairfield County, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cantore, </em>257 Conn. 531, 537-38, 778 A.2d 93 (2001); <em>Donar </em>v. <em>King Associates, Inc., </em>67 Conn. App. 346, 349, 786 A.2d 1256 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Due to the multiplicity of counts and allegations in this case, we will start with a road map to the discussion to follow. Each of the stricken counts alleges a different theory of liability and a different basis for the commissioner\u2019s authority to bring suit. The legal sufficiency of each count must therefore be addressed separately. With respect to count one, we will address jointly the liability of the surety and the general contractor both as originally pleaded and as amended. Thereafter, we will address the merits of counts two and three. Finally, we will address the merits of the commissioner\u2019s claim for equitable relief as stated in the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">COUNT ONE AND AMENDED COUNT ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Count one and amended count one alleged, respectively, that ICSP and the general contractor were liable to the subcontractor\u2019s employees pursuant to the payment bond secured for the public works project.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The commissioner claims that the allegations contained in these counts were legally sufficient to withstand a motion to strike. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Commissioner as Claimant under Count One</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Because it is a jurisdictional issue, we first address whether the commissioner has the authority to enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>payment on the bond. The trial court concluded that he did not. Resolution of the issue requires statutory construction and our review is therefore plenary. <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, 63 Conn. App. 815, 819, 779 A.2d 186, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 905, 782 A.2d 136 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The commissioner\u2019s claim is entirely statutory. His right to sue depends upon three remedial statutes that intersect under the circumstances of this case. These are the wage collection statute, \u00a7 31-72, the public works statute, \u00a7 49-41, and the bond enforcement statute, \u00a7 49-42. Each of them was designed to help unpaid employees to be made whole. As remedial statutes, each of them must be construed broadly in favor of employees whom the legislature intended to benefit. See <em>Mytych </em>v. <em>May Dept. Stores Co., </em>260 Conn. 152, 160-61, 793 A.2d 1068 (2002); <em>Butler v. Hartford Technical Institute, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 454, 463, 704 A.2d 222 (1997); <em>Tianti </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>231 Conn. 690, 696, 651 A.2d 1286 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The principles of statutory construction by which this court is guided are well settled. \u201cOur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); <em>Coregis Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fleet National Bank, </em>68 Conn. App. 716, 720, 793 A.2d 254 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>The legislative history of these statutes confirms their remedial purpose. With respect to the wage collection statute, our legislature has stated clearly that its purpose is to protect employees. See 32 S. Proc., Pt. 6,1989 Sess., p. 1925, remarks of Senator James H. Maloney (stating that amendment to \u00a7 31-72 was \u201ca bill in support of our working men and women in the State of Connecticut\u201d). Since its inception, the legislature has amended this statute to increase the power of the commissioner to initiate the collection of unpaid wages. In 1989, our General Assembly eliminated the requirement that each employee assign his or her claim to unpaid wages to the commissioner. See 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 15, 1989 Sess., pp. 5200-5204, remarks of Representative Joseph A. Adamo; 32 S. Proc., supra, pp. 1924-25. That amendment, in effect, empowered the commissioner to proceed with the collection of unpaid wages absent assignment from employees. See 32 S. Proc., supra, p. 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The public works statute and the bond enforcement statute were modeled after remedial federal legislation known as the Miller Act. See 40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 270a through 270d. Our courts have often relied on federal interpretations of the Miller Act for guidance as to the scope of our own legislation. <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>EI Constructors, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 708, 716, 687 A.2d 506 (1997); <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F.W. Brown Co., 174 </em>Conn. 219, 223-24, 384 A.2d 378 (1978). Federal courts construe the statutory requirements of the Miller Act broadly. The United States Supreme Court has stated that the federal Miller Act is \u201chighly remedial in nature . . . [and] entitled to a liberal construction and application in order properly to effectuate the [legislative] intent to protect those whose labor and materials go into public projects.\u201d <em>Clifford F. MacEvoy Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>322 U.S. 102, 107, 64 S. Ct. 890, 88 L. Ed. 1163 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Bearing in mind the dictates of the principle of broad construction, we turn to an examination of our own statutes for the protection of employees. The wage collection statute, \u00a7 31-72,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> authorizes the commissioner of labor to bring a civil action to recover twice the amount of wages due and empowers him to take \u201cany legal action necessary\u201d to recover unpaid wages on behalf of employees. The public works statute, \u00a7 49-41, requires general contractors on public works projects to obtain a bond to ensure payment to all employees working on the projects.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The bond enforcement stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ute, \u00a7 49-42,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> authorizes employees on a public works <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>project to bring suit on a payment bond to collect unpaid wages. Our Supreme Court has observed that the bond related statutes were enacted for the protection of employees and material suppliers who cannot avail themselves of otherwise available remedies, such as liens. <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>EI Construc</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>tors, </em>Inc., supra, 239 Conn. 714; <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P.C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 757, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996); <em>KMK Insulation, Inc. </em>v. <em>A. Prete &amp; Son Construction Co., </em>49 Conn. App. 522, 527, 715 A.2d 799 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">It is undisputed that the subcontractor\u2019s employees themselves would have been entitled to enforce payment on the bond against both the general contractor, as principal, and ICSP, as surety on the bond.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F.W. Brown Co., </em>supra, 174 Conn. 226-27 (holding that persons supplying labor or materials to a subcontractor on a public works project may seek reimbursement under a statutory payment bond provided by the general contractor). The question before us is whether the commissioner has statutory authority to bring such an action on their behalf. This is an issue of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Textually, the wage collection statute provides that \u201c[w]hen any employer fails to pay an employee wages . . . [t]he Labor Commissioner may collect the full amount of any such unpaid wages ... as well as interest. ... In addition, the Labor Commissioner may bring <em>any legal action necessary </em>to recover twice the full amount of unpaid wages . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-72. All of the parties maintain that the literal language of the statute supports their respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The commissioner construes the language allowing the commissioner to pursue \u201cany legal action neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>sary\u201d as a broad grant of authority that necessarily includes the enforcement of a payment bond pursuant to the bond enforcement statute. The defendants argue, however, that the commissioner\u2019s authority under the wage collection statute is limited to initiating civil actions against the direct employer of the unpaid employees. We agree with the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The defendants emphasize that the wage collection statute commences with the language, \u201c[w]hen any employer fails to pay an employee wages in accordance with the provisions of sections 31-71a to 31-71i . . .\u201d and further states that \u201cthe employer shall be required to pay the costs and such reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as may be allowed by the court. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-72. At best, the opening phrase is ambiguous. \u201cAny\u201d may denote breadth rather than limitation. The reference to \u201can employee\u201d may well reflect a deliberate choice not to use \u201cits employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We are persuaded that a broader construction of the statutory language is appropriate. Ambiguities in a remedial statute must be resolved in favor of the persons whom the statute is intended to protect. The statute as a whole is more coherent if the dispute about the meaning of the disputed language is resolved in favor of the commissioner. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>237 Conn. 501, 514-15, 680 A.2d 956 (1996). In light of this interpretation, the further statutory reference to the liability of \u201cthe employer\u201d for costs and attorney\u2019s fees, in our view, does not limit the scope of \u201cany employer.\u201d Furthermore, even if we were to interpret the opening phrase to refer to situations in which an employer has failed to pay its direct employee, we are not persuaded that that phrase restricts the latter part of the section that grants authority to the commissioner to bring \u201cany legal action necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The defendants\u2019 argument for a narrower construction of the wage collection statute is unavailing because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>it is unsupported by applicable legal authorities. It is true that other cases in which the commissioner has initiated legal action pursuant to the wage collection statute have involved civil actions brought against employers for unpaid wages for which the employers were directly liable. See, e.g., <em>Butler v. Hartford Technical Institute, Inc., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 454; <em>Tianti </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>supra, 231 Conn. 690; <em>Petronella v. Venture Partners, Ltd., </em>60 Conn. App. 205, 758 A.2d 869 (2000), appeal dismissed, 258 Conn. 453, 782 A.2d 97 (2001). These cases, however, concerned employees on private worksites. We see no reason to draw a negative inference from their holdings. They do not govern the enforcement of a payment bond on a public works project pursuant to a remedial statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">We therefore construe the wage collection statute to empower the commissioner to initiate any necessary legal action. In our view, this construction is consistent with the purpose that our legislature intended to implement.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Even if the defendants\u2019 construction of the text of the wage collection statute is not persuasive, they question the propriety of any reliance on the public works and bond enforcement statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 49-41 and 49-42. They claim that our Supreme Court, in <em>Dysart Corp. </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co., </em>240 Conn. 10, 688 A.2d 306 (1997), held that these statutes do not apply to the employees of a subcontractor. We disagree with this interpretation of <em>Dysart.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In <em>Dysart, </em>our Supreme Court disallowed a claim by an endorsee of the wage checks of the employees of a subcontractor. The court did so, however, not on general principles, but on the ground that the claimant failed to prove an assignment of the employees\u2019 rights to payment. The court expressly declined to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>whether assignees, as a class, were disqualified from enforcing payment on a bond. Id., 16.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\"><em>Dysart </em>recognized \u201cthe need of every general contractor to protect itself against excessively remote and, from its perspective, undetermined claims.\u201d Id., 19. In this case, unlike the third party claimant in <em>Dysart, </em>the commissioner initiated the present action on behalf of the subcontractor\u2019s employees, rather than on his own behalf. A case brought on behalf of persons who fall within the scope of statutory protection is not a case in which a claim for relief is \u201cexcessively remote\u201d or \u201cundetermined.\u201d <em>Dysart </em>does not govern this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Finally, we consider the combined guidance that all three statutes provide for determining the commissioner\u2019s authority to proceed with his cause of action. \u201cBecause the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law, the proper construction of any statute must take into account the mandates of related statutes governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Common Fund </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>228 Conn. 375, 381, 636 A.2d 795 (1994); <em>Felia </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>214 Conn. 181, 187, 571 A.2d 89 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">We are persuaded that the statutory scheme created by our legislature was intended to ensure that employees on public works projects are paid the wages to which they are entitled. To limit the commissioner to a direct claim against the subcontractor would be inconsistent with the requirement that a payment bond be posted for the protection of these employees. Indeed, it is only realistic to recognize that individual unpaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>employees may not have the wherewithal, or the legal assistance, to bring effective recovery actions on their own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">In conclusion, we find persuasive the commissioner\u2019s argument that the plain language of the wage collection statute permitting the commissioner to bring \u201cany legal action necessary,\u201d and the legislative intent that remedial statutes relating to public works projects be construed broadly, sustain his authority to proceed. The commissioner was a proper claimant to enforce payment on the bond on behalf of the subcontractor\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The trial court\u2019s ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion to strike was not limited to a determination of the commissioner\u2019s authority to bring a cause of action. The court also determined that the commissioner had alleged no substantive basis for imposing liability on any of the named defendants. We now turn, therefore, to the questions of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Liability of ICSP under Count One</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Count one alleges that ICSP, as surety, was hable pursuant to the payment bond that it had issued with respect to the asbestos removal project. The commissioner argues that ICSP is hable to the subcontractor\u2019s employees for payment of wages pursuant to the pubhc works statute and the bond enforcement statute. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court characterized count one as asserting a claim only under \u201c[the prevailing wage statute] and the provisions of the contract.\u201d The court reasoned that because the general contractor was not the \u201cemployer\u201d of the subcontractor\u2019s employees, the general contractor could not be held hable as alleged. The commissioner did not appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>from the court\u2019s ruling in favor of the general contractor, but rather amended count one as to that defendant in his second amended complaint. We address those allegations as modified in part I C of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The court failed to acknowledge that count one also alleged liability of ICSP pursuant to the payment bond. Paragraph five of count one expressly states that \u201c[t]he Defendant ICSP is liable for the payment of labor performed on the above-mentioned project pursuant to the Bond . . . .\u201d Paragraph six then states that written notice was sent to the defendants pursuant to the bond enforcement statute. We therefore consider the legal sufficiency of the commissioner\u2019s claim against ICSP under the payment bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The language of the public works statute and the bond enforcement statute establishes the liability of a surety on a bond. First, the public works statute requires that all such projects be bonded in the amount of the contract and that the surety or sureties on the bond must be approved by the officer awarding the contract. Second, the bond enforcement statute sets out a procedure that requires a claimant to serve notice of claim on both the principal and the surety that issued the bond. General Statutes \u00a7 49-42. Once notice has been properly served, if the surety refuses to pay, then the claimant may bring an action on the payment bond in the Superior Court. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Our Supreme Court repeatedly has recognized the liability of a surety pursuant to a payment bond under the public works statute and the bond enforcement statute.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>EI </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Constructors, Inc., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 714\u201417; <em>American Masons</em>\u2019 <em>Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>supra, 174 Conn. 220-21. In <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc., </em>the court specifically stated that coverage of a payment bond by a surety could not fall below the statutory requirements. Furthermore, the court stated that \u201cif there is any ambiguity, it must be interpreted most strongly against [the surety].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>EI Constructors, Inc., </em>supra, 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Count one alleged that ICSP was the surety on the payment bond <em>for the </em>public works project. The bond, a copy of which was attached to the complaint, specifically stated that it was \u201cexecuted pursuant to the provisions of: [public works statute]. . . [bond enforcement statute] . . . and the rights and liabilities hereunder shall be determined and limited by said sections . . . .\u201d Count one further alleged that ICSP was liable \u201cpursuant to the Bond,\u201d that employees of a subcontractor had not been paid, that written notice of claim had been sent to ICSP pursuant to the bond enforcement statute, and that \u201cboth the principal and the surety [had] refused and/or neglected to tender payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">We conclude that the claim against ICSP, as surety on the payment bond, was legally sufficient. The commissioner had a right to seek payment for the employees of the subcontractor from ICSP. The court\u2019s ruling to the contrary was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Liability of General Contractor under Count One</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Amended count one alleged that the general contractor was hable pursuant to the payment bond.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>commissioner claims that this claim, too, was legally sufficient. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Amended count one alleged that the general contractor was the principal on the payment bond for the public works project for asbestos removal. It then alleged that the general contractor was liable for the payment of labor performed on that project pursuant to the bond. As previously noted, the bond, a copy of which was attached to the complaint, was executed pursuant to the public works statute and the bond enforcement statute. Amended count one further stated that wages were due to employees of the subcontractor, that the commissioner, on behalf of the subcontractor\u2019s employees, served the general contractor with notice of the claim pursuant to the bond enforcement statute and that the general contractor had refused or neglected to tender payment on its bond to the subcontractor\u2019s employees or to the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">As with the liability of ICSP, the general contractor\u2019s liability as principal on the bond is established by the language of the public works statute and the bond enforcement statute. The public works statute expressly states that the bond \u201cshall have as principal the name of the person awarded the contract.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 49-41 (a). The procedure for enforcement set out in the bond enforcement statute includes the principal on the bond, as well as the surety. A claimant must first serve notice of the claim on both the surety that issued the bond <em>and </em>the general contractor named as principal on the bond. General Statutes \u00a7 49-42 (a). If the surety refuses to pay, then the claimant may bring an action on the payment bond in the Superior Court. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Our Supreme Court has recognized a general contractor\u2019s liability as principal on a payment bond to those supplying labor or materials to a subcontractor. In <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F.W. Brown Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>supra, 174 Conn. 226-27, the court held that a plaintiff, who had supplied materials used by a subcontractor on a public works project, had a right of action under the bond enforcement statute against the general contractor as principal on the bond. The court reasoned that, as long as the entity to whom the plaintiff had supplied materials was a subcontractor, the plaintiffs relationship to the project was not too remote to bring a claim against the prime contractor and its surety. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In the present case, it is undisputed that the entity for whom the employees supplied labor was a subcontractor. With respect to their relationship to the general contractors, we see no substantive distinction between the material suppliers in <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>and the subcontractor\u2019s employees here. The subcontractor\u2019s employees were not too remote for the general contractor to be hable for payment of their wages pursuant to the bond enforcement statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The defendants argue, nonetheless, that the general contractor cannot be held hable for the unpaid wages of a subcontractor\u2019s employees because the general contractor was not their direct employer. They note that the commissioner\u2019s complaint does not allege that the general contractor was the \u201cemployer\u201d of the subcontractor\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The defendants rely on <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Hartford Technical Institute, Inc., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 463, and <em>Tianti </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>supra, 231 Conn. 696,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> for the proposition that the term \u201cemployer,\u201d even in the context of a remedial statute, is hmited to a person \u201cwho possesses the ultimate authority and control . . . to set the hours of employment and pay wages . . . .\u201d <em>Butler v. Hartford Technical Institute, Inc., </em>supra, 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>Butler </em>is distinguishable for several reasons. First, the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion was designed to avoid an unduly narrow interpretation of \u00a7 31-72. Id., 462-63. Its decision imposed liability for unpaid wages not only on a corporate <em>employer </em>but also on a high ranking corporate <em>employee. </em>Second, the court\u2019s discussion of personal liability arose in a context other than liability under a payment bond. The court\u2019s decision is, therefore, not relevant under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We are persuaded that a claimant seeking recovery from a general contractor on a payment bond need not show a direct employer-employee relationship between the employee and the general contractor. None of the cases in which our Supreme Court held that a general contractor, or its surety, was liable pursuant to a payment bond required a showing of an employee-employer relationship.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>EI Constructors, Inc., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 708; <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F.W. Brown Co., </em>supra, 174 Conn. 226-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">We conclude that a general contractor can be held liable, as principal on a payment bond for a public works contract, to a subcontractor\u2019s employees. We are, therefore, persuaded that the commissioner\u2019s allegations against the general contractor in amended count one were legally sufficient to survive a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">COUNT TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Count two of the commissioner\u2019s complaint alleged that the general contractor, as an employer in Connecticut and as general contractor on the asbestos removal project, was liable to the subcontractor\u2019s employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>for payment of wages pursuant to the prevailing wage statute, \u00a7 31-53.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The prevailing wage statute requires all employees on a public works project to be paid prevailing wages, as determined by the commissioner of labor, and sets out penalties for any person who knowingly violates that requirement.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The commissioner argues that the court improperly struck this count on the theory that the statutory requirement that employees be paid prevailing wages imposes liability on the general contractor for payment of those wages. The defendants claim, however, that the only remedies under the prevailing wage statute are those expressly set out in the statute. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Although the prevailing wage statute specifically authorizes an action by the commissioner, the statute provides only limited remedies. It does not authorize the recovery of unpaid wages. Rather, it sets out the following specific sanctions: a monetary fine; a period of disqualification from further bidding on public contracts; the termination of a contract before the completion of the project and the withholding of payment to the contractor or subcontractor. On its face, the statute does not give the commissioner the relief that he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The commissioner argues, nonetheless, that \u00a7 31-53a (b) provides a remedy because it states that employees \u201cshall have the right of action and of intervention against the contractor and his sureties\u201d for unpaid wages.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This argument is unavailing for two reasons. First, the commissioner made no reference to \u00a7 31-53a in count two of his complaint and therefore cannot now rely on that section to support the legal sufficiency of his pleading. See <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Pringle, </em>255 Conn. 330, 337-38, 766 A.2d 400 (2001). Second, even if we were to consider the prevailing wage statute, \u00a7 31-53, to encompass \u00a7 31-53a, the commissioner could not prevail. An action under \u00a7 31-53a (b) is triggered by the termination of a contract pursuant to subsection (b) of the prevailing wage statute and provides recovery for employee underpayments associated with the termination. That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">As previously noted, the trial court did not strike count ten of the complaint, which alleged that the general contractor was independently liable under the prevailing wage statute.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In that count, the commissioner alleged that the general contractor was an \u201cemployer\u201d as statutorily defined and requested the enforcement of previously assessed civil penalties pursuant to the prevailing wage statute. Unlike count two, count ten sought to enforce the sanctions specifically set out in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Even remedial statutes are not limitless. We agree with the trial court that the allegations contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>count two were not legally sufficient to survive a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">COUNT THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Count three of the commissioner\u2019s complaint alleged that the general contractor had contractual liability for the payment of wages to employees of the subcontractor. The commissioner argues that the trial court improperly failed to accept as true the commissioner\u2019s allegation that the general contractor had a contractual obligation. The commissioner maintains that that allegation was legally sufficient to withstand a motion to strike. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The trial court stated in its memorandum that \u201c[n]othing has been pointed to in the general contract specifically creating such liability on the general contractor.\u201d In count three, the commissioner alleged only that \u201c[the general contractor] was required to pay prevailing wages to all mechanics, laborers, and workmen on said project pursuant to the contract for said public works projects . . . .\u201d The court accurately noted that the commissioner provided no support for this assertion. The commissioner failed to elaborate, in any way, on the parties, the terms or the specific provisions of that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Although a trial court, in ruling on a motion to strike, must take as true all facts alleged; <em>Vacco </em>v. <em>Microsoft Corp., </em>supra, 260 Conn. 65; the commissioner must still plead sufficient facts that, if proven, would support his legal claim. <em>Donar </em>v. <em>King Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 67 Conn. App. 349-50. A bald assertion that the defendant has a contractual obligation, without more, is insufficient to survive a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">AMENDED PRAYER FOR RELIEF</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The commissioner further claims, on remedial grounds, that the trial court improperly held that each of the stricken counts was legally insufficient. He reminds us that, in his second amended complaint, he sought equitable relief that included a prayer for affirmative injunction to enforce the state wage laws pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-2 (d) (enforcement statute).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">It is dispositive that the amended prayer for relief is relevant only to amended count one. At the time when amended count one was filed, all the other counts had been stricken. These counts were expressly not repleaded in the commissioner\u2019s second amended complaint. We have already concluded that amended count one, which alleged the general contractor\u2019s liability pursuant to the bond, was legally sufficient to survive a motion to strike. We, therefore, need not address this claim for additional relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">In sum, we conclude that the commissioner is authorized by the wage collection statute to collect unpaid wages on behalf of a subcontractor\u2019s employees and, in the case of a public works project, may do so by enforcing payment on the bond against a general contractor and its surety. We are, therefore, persuaded that the commissioner\u2019s allegations in count one and amended count one relevant to enforcement of the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>ment bond were legally sufficient to survive a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The judgment on the defendants\u2019 motion to strike counts two and three of the commissioner\u2019s amended complaint is affirmed. The judgment as to count one of the commissioner\u2019s amended complaint and count one of the commissioner\u2019s second amended complaint is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the defendants\u2019 motions to strike those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-10\"> The total amount of unpaid wages was $160,974.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-11\"> The plaintiff filed the original complaint on June 15, 1998, but subsequently withdrew several counts in that complaint.

We do not consider, however, the legal sufficiency of the allegations in count two that relate to overtime wages. In its brief, the commissioner\u2019s argument in support of the legal sufficiency of count two focuses solely on the prevailing wage statute, \u00a7 31-53, and the commissioner\u2019s authority to enforce the payment of such prevailing wages. Neither the prevailing wage statute, nor its enforcement statute, \u00a7 31-53a, includes overtime wages. <em>Electrical Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tianti, </em>223 Conn. 573, 583-84, 613 A.2d 281 (1992). The plaintiffs brief provides no support for the legal sufficiency of its allegations pursuant to the overtime wage statute and we, therefore, deem that claim abandoned.
