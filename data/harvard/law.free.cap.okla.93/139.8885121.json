The cause was tried to a jury and upon verdict rendered and judgment entered for defendant, plaintiff brought this cause here regularly for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-20\">The plaintiff filed his brief under the rules of this court, but the defendant Cantrell has failed to file a brief as required by Rule 7 of this court, and has not asked for or been granted an extension of time, and no reason has been assigned for the failure of defendant to file briefs as required by the rule, and for such failure the court may reverse or confirm the judgment at its discretion, and is not required to search the record with a view of ascertaining some theory on which the judgment may be affirmed.
