Section 5255, Rev. Laws 19|10, as amended by chapter 19 of 1910-11 , Sess. Laws, being section 798 Comp. Stat: 1921, provides that proceedings for reversing, vacating, or modifying judgments shall be commenced in this court within six months from the date of such judgment. Therefore, since this appeal was not lodged in this court until more than six months after the judgment complained of was rendered, this court has no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of said.action, and the motion of the defendants in error to dismiss the same is sustained.
