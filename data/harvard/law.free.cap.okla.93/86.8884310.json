Robinson, 66 Okla. 57, 166 Pac. 1042, the judgment appealed from should be reversed in accordance with' the prayer of the petition in error, and the cause remanded for a new trial; and we recommend that this be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">By the Court: It ia so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
