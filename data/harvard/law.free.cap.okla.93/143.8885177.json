Petition in error was filed in this court April 8, 1921, having attached thereto a purported case-made. An examination of the ease-made, so filed with the petition in error, .shows that the same was never filed as a part of the record in the ease iu the trial court nor was it settled or signed as a case-made by the trial judge, nor was it certified as a transcript by the court clerk. Under such circumstances it has been often held by this court that such' purported .case-made is a nullity and confers no jurisdiction upon this court to review the proceedings of the trial court. Quoting from the case of Hall et al. v. Phoenix Insurance Co., 82 Okla. 158, 198 Pac. 999, this court* said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-23\">\u201cA purported case-made which has not been settled and signed by the judge who tried the case and attested by the clerk and filed with the papers of the case in the trial court, is ineffective as a case-made and confers no jurisdiction upon this court to review any of the proceedings of the trial court. Oil Fields &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Wheeler, 75 Okla. 9, 180 Pac 868; Helms v. Faulkner, 79 Okla. 308, 193 Pac. 621; Canfield v. Bell, 47 Okla. 622, 149 Pac. 1088; Landis v.

American Trust Co., 31 Okla. 456, 122 Pac. 159..\u201d'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-24\">\u201cWhere the proceedings in error are by transcript of the record, the transcript must be certified as such by the clerk of the trial court.\u201d Buell v. American Indemnity Co., 72 Oklahoma, 178 Pac. 884.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-25\">For the reasons herein stated, this appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-26\">' By the Court: It is. so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
