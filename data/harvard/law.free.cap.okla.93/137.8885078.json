O. 0. Newton filed his petition in the nature of a plea of intervention and upon a trial to the court evidence was introduced by both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>state and the intervener, and upon conclusion of all the evidence the court rendered judgment confiscating the car and \u25a0 ordering it sold according to law. The inter--vener attempts to bring error and have the cause reviewed by this court and flies his caise-made and brief. The state has not seen At to favor us with a brief in this case, but under Bule 7 of this court, the court may affirm or reverse the judgment of the trial court. Russell &amp; Washington v. Robertson, 82 Okla. 283, 200 Pac. 150; Incorporated Town of Kusa v. Bouggous, 82 Okla. 204, 200 Pac. 154, and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u201cThe question of jurisdiction is primary and fundamental in every case, and cannot be waived by the parties or overlooked by the court. It is the bounden duty of the court to examine into its jurisdiction, whether raised by any party or not,. and sui sponte, to determine its own jurisdiction.\u201d Howard v. Arkansaw, 59 Okla. 206, 158 Pac. 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The record in- this ease discloses that after both plaintiff and defendant rested, the court rendered judgment, and intervener gave notice of appeal to the Supreme Court. The 'record does not disclose that any motion for a new trial was filed, and the petition in error fails to assign as error the overruling of a motion for a new trial by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Por the reasons above stated, this appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">By the Court: It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
