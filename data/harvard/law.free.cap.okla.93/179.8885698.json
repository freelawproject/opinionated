Motion for new trial was filed and overruled, from which judgment the plaintiff in error appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The plaintiff alleges that he was driving his car at a reasonable rate of speed and in accordance with the traffic rules and regulations as provided by the city ordinance of that city, and the defendant likewise avers that he was driving his car at a very low rate of speed and clearly within his rights, and further alleges that he is a practicing physician and was traveling in response to a call from his patient, and that under the law he was entitled to and had the right of way, and that the car he was driving was damaged in the sum of $223, for which he asks judgment, and avers th\u00e1t the plaintiff\u2019s car was injured as' a result of plaintiff\u2019s own negligence. Plaintiff in error sets forth numerous assignments of \u25a0 error, but we shall only consider those we think essential to the rights of the parties in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The seventh assignment of error complained of, instruction No. 18, given by the court, which was duly excepted to at the time by plaintiff in error, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">\u201cYou are instructed that the law contemplates that in any given case a normal adult person shall take due care of his own safety and protection which is such care as an ordinary prudent person would exercise under the circumstances and if you find that plaintiff failed to exercise such care, then the plaintiff is guilty of contributory negligence and is not entitled to recover herein, unless you should find by a preponderance of the evidence .that defendant was guilty of gross negligence, and that the damage was the proximate result of such negligence on the part of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">We think this instruction clearly constitutes reversible error and is an instruction, the effect of which has heretofore been condemned by this court. In the case of Hailey-Ola Coal Co. v. Morgan, 39 Okla. 71, 134 Pac. 29, the court passes on the question. This instruction submits the doctrine of comparative negligence to the jury, which the court evidently had in mind when giving the instruction complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">The above case says the doctrine of comparative negligence does not obtain in this state and in discussing that question they quote from the ease of Templeton v. Lynchburg Tract. Co., 110 Va. 853, 67 S. E. 351, wherein it was said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">\"The law will not weigh or apportion the concurring negligence of a plaintiff and defendant. There can be no recovery by a plaintiff who has been guilty of contributory negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">And the same rule was announced in the case of St. Louis &amp; S. F. R. R. Co. v. Elsing, 37 Okla. 333, 132 Pac. 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">AVe think these authorities are decisive of the question raised in this case, and feel that is is unnecessary to make further mention of the other assignments of error, and recommend that the case be reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">By the Court: It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
