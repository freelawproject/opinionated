Sloss did not ask Jay his age or whether he had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>driver\u2019s license. Jay paid $75 of the $100 down payment, and Sloss allowed him to take the car home. On Saturday afternoon, Jay returned with the car and the $25 balance of the down payment. While filling out the sales contract, Sloss discovered that Jay was a minor and refused to complete the contract unless Jay\u2019s father signed it. Jay left the lot about 5 o\u2019clock with the car and a contract form for his father to sign. The father refused to sign. He testified that \u201cwhen I looked at the car and seen it was nothing but a wreck I called up Sloss and told him to come and get the car; that the kid had no business with it; that he had no driver\u2019s license and no experience, and that it was nothing but a wreck, but he wouldn\u2019t pick it up.\u201d The father then told Jay to return the car. Jay drove it to the lot Saturday night and again Sunday morning, but Sloss was not there at either time.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">After leaving the car lot on Sunday morning, Jay met two minor girl friends, Beatrice Benton and Marlie Alden, plaintiffs in this action, and a boy friend (Richard Kasitz, and took them for a ride in the country. They were accompanied by another car driven by Elden Earnest. The two drivers were racing and alternately passing each other on a two-lane highway at about 45 miles per hour. As Jay was passing Elden\u2019s car, another car suddenly emerged from a dip in the road. To avoid a head-on collision, Jay swerved to the right, and passed in front of Elden\u2019s car and behind a car immediately ahead of Elden travelling in the same direction. Since the Chevrolet did not have a horn, Jay could not warn Elden to pull over or slow down. To avoid hitting the car in front of Elden, Jay applied his brakes. The right rear wheel locked and the left wheel brakes failed to operate. His car skidded across the highway, leaving black skid marks on the right side only. Jay attempted to drive onto the shoulder of the highway, but the ear slid into a telephone pole by the highway. Plaintiffs were injured by the collision of the car with the telephone pole.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Plaintiffs filed this action against Sloss, Jay, and Jay\u2019s father. The case was tried without a jury, and each plaintiff recovered judgment against Jay and Sloss. Judgment was returned in favor of Jay\u2019s father. Defendant Sloss alone has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Sloss first contends that he is absolved from liability under section 403 of the Vehicle Code.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This statute protects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the driver and all persons legally liable for his conduct from liability to guests for ordinary negligence. The driver is liable, however, for injuries to his guests caused by his intoxication or wilful misconduct.  There is no evidence of intoxication in the present case, but the trial court found that Jay was guilty of wilful misconduct in operating a defective car, operating it without experience, and racing it on the highway against another ear. Sloss, however, cannot be held under section 403 for Jay\u2019s wilful misconduct, since there was no showing that Jay was Sloss\u2019 agent. <em>(Stober </em>v. <em>Halsey, </em>88 Cal.App.2d 660, 665 [199 P.2d 318].)  For the same reason Sloss cannot be held under Vehicle Code, section 402, imputing to the owner of a vehicle liability for negligent operation, for, in the absence of a principal-agent relationship between the owner and the driver, the owner is not liable for the driver\u2019s wilful misconduct. <em>(Weber </em>v. <em>Pinyan, </em>9 Cal.2d 226, 238 [70 P.2d 183, 112 A.L.R. 407].)</p>\n<p id=\"Abq\">In the present case, however, plaintiffs seek to hold Sloss for his own negligence, and not as a person legally responsible for the driver\u2019s acts under section 403, or as an owner under section 402. (See <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Pinyan, supra, </em>9 Cal.2d 226, 237.)  Section 403 bars actions against the \u201cdriver\u201d of a vehicle or against \u20181 any other person legally liable for the conduct of such driver.\u201d The phrase \u201cperson legally liable\u201d for the driver\u2019s conduct is clearly intended to cover cases in which the owner is vicariously liable for the driver\u2019s conduct because of the relationship of the parties, as principal-agent, or because of imputed negligence under section 402. <em>(Stober </em>v. <em>Halsey, supra; Stephen </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>32 Cal.App.2d 326 [89 P.2d 683].)  Section 403 does not limit the common-law liability of the owner of a vehicle for his own negligence as owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Sloss contends that since the owner of an automobile would be guilty of ordinary negligence in failing to make proper repairs, and would be protected by section 403 if he were driving the car at the time of the accident <em>(Rhoads </em>v. <em>Studley, </em>15 Cal.App.2d 726 [59 P.2d 1082]; <em>Ohlson </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>2 Cal.App.2d 708 [39 P.2d 429]), the purpose of the section would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>be defeated if he were held liable for the same act of negligence merely because he was not driving at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Section 403, however, nowhere refers to owners of vehicles. The only persons absolved from liability are the driver and those legally responsible for his acts. Sloss was not the driver and the action against him is not based on any responsibility he might have for the driver\u2019s conduct. Sloss would bring himself within the section by construing \u201cdriver\u201d to include \u201cowner,\u201d but the section does not admit of that construction. Moreover, plaintiffs were Jay\u2019s guests, not Sloss\u2019, and are in the same position as anyone else who was injured because Sloss failed to maintain his vehicle in proper mechanical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The controlling question, therefore, is whether Sloss was negligent and if so whether his negligence was a contributing cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Although a used ear dealer does not insure the safety of a car he sells, and is under no duty to disassemble the car to examine its parts, he must make a reasonable inspection for defects that would make the ear a menace on the highways. <em>(Supera </em>v. <em>Moreland Sales Corp., </em>13 Cal.App.2d 186, 191 [56 P.2d 595]; <em>Egan Chevrolet Co. </em>v. <em>Bruner, </em>102 F.2d 373, 375; <em>Flies </em>v. <em>Fox Bros. Buick Co., </em>196 Wis. 196, 210 [218 N.W. 855, 60 A.L.R. 357] ; see Prosser, Torts, p. 680; 122 A.L.R. 997; 99 A.L.R. 240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Section 660 of the Vehicle Code provides: \u201cNo dealer shall sell a used motor vehicle without first testing and if necessary adjusting the lights and brakes on such vehicle to conform with the provisions of this code. \u2019 \u2019 The standards for adequate brakes are set forth in section 670 of the Vehicle Code. Thus, a motor vehicle must be equipped with brakes adequate to bring it to a complete stop within 188 feet, when it is operated at a speed of 45 miles per hour on a dry asphalt or concrete pavement where the grade does not exceed 1 per cent.  Although Sloss testified that he had given the car a road test about five days before the proposed sale to Jay and that the brakes had then operated satisfactorily, there is no evidence that he made any test of the brakes to determine whether they met the standards prescribed by this section. Sloss\u2019 mechanics did not inspect or do any work on the brakes. The failure of the brakes shortly after delivery of the car to Jay indicates that the defect was present and discernible at the time of the proposed sale. Sloss\u2019 testimony at best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>created a conflict in the evidence, which the trial court resolved in plaintiffs\u2019 favor. The trial court could reasonably conclude that a reasonable inspection would have disclosed the defective brakes. <em>(Egan Chevrolet Co. </em>v. <em>Bruner, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">We are also of the opinion that the trial court could reasonably conclude that Sloss\u2019 negligence'was a contributing cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Jay\u2019s testimony, corroborated by the testimony of his guests and by the skid marks on the pavement, established that the right rear wheel of the car locked when Jay attempted to apply the brakes. At the most critical part of the operation, the brakes locked. Jay described the situation: \u201cElden put on his brakes and I tried to get in between them [the two cars], and I hit my brakes and the back wheel locked and it [Jay\u2019s car] flsh-tailed, and I didn\u2019t want to hit the fellow in front of me, and so I went clear over to hit the shoulder and cramped the wheels and it slid right into the pole.\u201d The shoulder had a gravel surface and once the car skidded off the pavement, Jay was unable to get it back on the highway. One of Jay\u2019s guests, Richard Kasitz, testified that the car swung to the right when Jay applied the brakes, although Jay kept turning the steering wheel to the left.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Jay\u2019s negligent driving was unquestionably a cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Sloss\u2019 negligence was also a cause of those injuries, if it was a substantial factor in bringing them about. <em>(McEvoy </em>v. <em>American Pool Corp., </em>32 Cal.2d 295, 298 [195 P.2d 783]; Rest., Torts, \u00a7 431.) This question of fact the trial court resolved in plaintiffs\u2019 favor. In the light of the evidence it could reasonably conclude that because of the defective brakes Jay could not avoid the collision. Since we cannot say that the issue is so clear that reasonable men cannot differ, the trial court\u2019s finding must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">The question remains whether the injury falls within the limits of Sloss\u2019 legal responsibility for the consequences of his conduct. Sloss could reasonably foresee that the brakes would be used in emergency conditions arising under ordinary highway speeds. (See <em>Nebelung </em>v. <em>Norman, </em>14 Cal.2d 647, 652 [96 P.2d 327].) The negligent conduct of Jay did not relieve Sloss from liability, for the likelihood of negligent operation of the vehicle was one of the hazards that Sloss could reasonably foresee. <em>(Mosley </em>v. <em>Arden Farms Co., </em>26 Cal.2d 213, 219, 220 [157 P.2d 372, 158 A.L.R. 872]; <em>McEvoy </em>v. <em>American Pool Corp., supra, </em>32 Cal.2d 295, 298; <em>Lacy </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>220 Cal. 97 [29 P.3d 781]; <em>Opple v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number><em>Ray, </em>208 Ind. 450, 456 [195 N.E. 81]; see Rest., Torts, \u00a7 447.)  The possibility of a driver\u2019s negligently placing himself in a position from which he could not extricate himself without adequate brakes imposed on Sloss a duty to test and adjust the brakes of the car, and thus prevent it from endangering the lives of occupants, pedestrians, and other users of the highway. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 660; <em>Flies </em>v. <em>Fox Bros. Buick Co., supra; Forman </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>183 Wash. 333, 341 [48 P.2d 599].)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Sloss \u2019 duty extended not only to the prospective buyer, but to third persons who could reasonably be expected to be in the vicinity of the probable use of the automobile. <em>(Flies </em>v. <em>Fox Buick Co., supra </em>(pedestrian); see Prosser, Torts, p. 680; Rest., Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 388, 392.) The injury to Jay\u2019s guests was therefore within the limits of the risk created by Sloss\u2019 negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Sloss contends that Jay was given permission only to take the automobile to his father\u2019s home to induce him to sign the contract. Therefore, he argues, the use of the car for a pleasure trip on the following day was without his implied or express permission. The evidence shows that Sloss allowed Jay to take the car home on Saturday afternoon about 5 o\u2019clock, knowing that he was only 19 years old. Sloss could reasonably expect, and indeed anticipate with a sale in mind, that Jay would not only test the performance of the car but drive it for pleasure pending the negotiation of the contract. Sloss\u2019 own absence from the lot precluded Jay\u2019s returning the car. He closed his lot about 7 o\u2019clock Saturday night and went to a ball game, although Jay\u2019s father had telephoned earlier and asked Sloss to come for the car. The lot was likewise closed on Sunday morning. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that Jay\u2019s operation of the car on Sunday was a risk beyond that created when Sloss allowed Jay to take the ear from the lot on Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Edmonds, J., Carter, J., and Spence, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\"No person who as a guest accepts a ride in any vehicle upon a highway without giving compensation for such ride, nor any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>person, has any right of action for civil damages against the driver of such vehicle or against any other person legally liable for the conduct of such driver on account of personal injury to or the death of such guest during such ride, unless the plaintiff in any such action establishes that such injury or death proximately resulted from the intoxication or wilful misconduct of said driver. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b430-9\">SCHAUER, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Avy\">I do not view the evidence as sufficient to sustain a finding that Sloss was guilty of negligence proximately contributing to the accident; neither do I find the judgment against Sloss sustainable, upon the record, on any tenable theory of law. Accordingly, I should reverse the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
