Officer Bryant stated that while on an off-duty detail at a Kroger\u2019s store in the Corryville section of Cincinnati, he observed Johnson and two other juveniles conceal cigars, alcohol and condoms and attempt to leave the store. At that point, Officer Bryant arrested Johnson. The value of the items totaled $18.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Johnson maintained that he had not participated in a theft, but instead had been injured when he fell on his head and, while dazed, had followed his friends into the store only to be arrested upon leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Johnson brings six assignments of error, arguing that the juvenile proceedings violated his procedural due process rights. For the reasons set out below, we reverse and remand for a new trial with instructions to follow the procedural due process requirements set out in Juv.R. 29(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In his first assignment, Johnson argues that the trial court accepted his waiver of counsel without proper assurance that the waiver was knowing, intelligent and voluntary. Juveniles must be afforded representation by legal counsel at all stages of the proceedings in juvenile court. R.C. 2151.352; Juv.R. 29(B); <em>In re Gault </em>(1967), 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527. When a defendant waives his or her right to counsel, the court must make sufficient inquiry to determine whether the defendant has done so knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. <em>State v. Gibson </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 74 O.O.2d 525, 345 N.E.2d 399, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Grimes </em>(1984), 17 Ohio App.3d 71, 17 OBR 126, 477 N.E.2d 1219. The court\u2019s inquiry must encompass the totality of the circumstances before the court can be satisfied that the waiver was given knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. <em>United States v. Weninger </em>(C.A.10, 1980), 624 F.2d 163, 164, certiorari denied (1980), 449 U.S. 1012, 101 S.Ct. 568, 66 L.Ed.2d 470; <em>State v. Gibson, supra. </em>In applying the totality-of-the-circumstances test to juveniles, courts must give close scrutiny to factors such as a juvenile\u2019s age, emotional stability, mental capacity, and prior criminal experience. See <em>In re Watson </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 86, 548 N.E.2d 210; <em>State v. Bell </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 270, 2 O.O.3d 427, 358 N.E.2d 556; <em>In re Gault, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In this case, Johnson appeared for three separate hearings: an initial hearing, an adjudicatory hearing, and a dispositional hearing. At the initial hearing, the referee asked Johnson, \u201cDo you want a lawyer?\u201d Johnson responded, \u201cNo.\u201d Then the referee told Johnson to sign the waiver and Johnson complied. This was the extent of the inquiry, and clearly failed to take into account all of the circumstances necessary to determine whether Johnson waived his right to counsel knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. Within the totality-of-the-circumstances test, the court was required to take special care given Johnson\u2019s age (thirteen). Instead, the referee did not even explain to Johnson his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">At the adjudicatory hearing, a different referee said to Johnson, \u201cAntonio, you understand that you do have the right to have an attorney. If you want an attorney, I\u2019d give you that opportunity. You understand that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Johnson responded, \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The referee continued, \u201cAnd that if you can\u2019t afford to hire a private attorney, you can get a public defender?\u201d Johnson did not respond. The referee continued, \u201cDo you want to talk to an attorney, or do you want to go today without an attorney?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Johnson responded, \u201cI don\u2019t want one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The referee then stated, \u201cI need you to sign another waiver then.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In this case, the referee gave a basic explanation to Johnson, but failed to inquire into any circumstances that would demonstrate that Johnson knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel as required by <em>In re Gault, supra, In re Watson, supra, </em>and <em>State v. Bell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">At the dispositional hearing, the judge did not even broach the subject of the right to counsel, despite the clear right to legal counsel at <em>all </em>stages of the proceedings in juvenile court under R.C. 2151.352.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Therefore, this assignment of error is well taken. As Johnson\u2019s counsel on appeal points out, most of the errors in the record could have easily been avoided if Johnson had had an attorney appointed to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">In his second assignment, Johnson argues that the juvenile court erred by failing to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>who would effectively advance Johnson\u2019s interests. R.C. 2151.281(A) requires the court to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>to protect the interest of the juvenile in a delinquency proceeding when the court finds that there is a conflict of interest between the juvenile and his parent or guardian. R.C. 2151.281(D) requires the court to discharge a guardian <em>ad litem </em>when the guardian <em>ad litem </em>fails \u201cto faithfully discharge his duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">R.C. 2151.281(1) states that the guardian <em>ad litem </em>\u201cshall perform whatever functions are necessary to protect the best interest of the child, including, but not limited to, investigation, mediation, guardian, monitoring court proceedings, and monitoring the services agency or private child placing agency that has temporary or permanent custody of the child, and shall file any motions and other court papers that are in the best interest of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">The court is not required to appoint an attorney, but rather can appoint any \u201cqualified volunteer.\u201d R.C. 2151.281(J). However, if the court finds that the juvenile\u2019s wishes conflict with the guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>representation, the court is required to appoint a separate attorney to represent the juvenile\u2019s wishes. R.C. 2151.281(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">Virtually all of the case law regarding the performance of a guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>duties concerns the best interest of the child in custody cases. However, it is clear that the guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>role in proceedings is to assist the court by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ensuring that the juvenile\u2019s statutory rights are protected. <em>Lovejoy v. Cuyahoga Cty. Dept. of Human Serv. </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 514, 602 N.E.2d 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In the case at bar, the referee appointed Johnson\u2019s grandmother, Beatrice Hayden, as guardian <em>ad litem </em>at the initial hearing. Referee Melvin asked Hayden if she was Johnson\u2019s legal guardian, and she said, \u201cNo. His father is over in Christ Hospital in intensive care.\u201d The referee then asked for her name and appointed her guardian <em>ad litem. </em>She responded, \u201cHis father wants custody of him. I\u2019m just here to represent him today.\u201d The referee responded, \u201cYeah. And that\u2019s basically what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m -writing in here that you\u2019re standing in today as guardian.\u201d From this record, one could assume that Hayden was to serve only for that day. The prosecutor argues that Hayden was appointed for the entire proceeding. In either event, the appointment was ambiguous, and there was no indication that Hayden even understood her role as guardian <em>ad litem. </em>Her only action at the initial hearing was to sign the waiver of counsel for Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">At the adjudicatory hearing, the referee did not reinstall Hayden as guardian <em>ad litem, </em>presumably because he assumed that she was acting on Johnson\u2019s behalf as guardian <em>ad litem </em>from the previous ambiguous appointment. As guardian <em>ad litem, </em>Hayden cross-examined the police officer, asking only one question, and then accused Johnson of lying when questioning him about what occurred. At that point, the referee cut her off to prevent further damage. However, later, she advised the court that confinement was the best solution for him. It seems clear that Hayden did not protect Johnson\u2019s interests as required by R.C. 2151.281(A) because she damaged Johnson\u2019s credibility and recommended a stiff penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">By failing to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>capable of assisting the court in ensuring that the child\u2019s statutory rights are protected, the court failed to discharge its duty under R.C. 2151.281(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">We find this assignment of error is well taken, especially in light of the fact that Johnson had no representation by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">In his third assignment, Johnson asserts that the juvenile court erred by allowing the prosecutor to prove elements of the state\u2019s case by questioning Johnson (an unrepresented minor held in custody) without informing him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights against self-incrimination. The <em>Miranda </em>requirement is clear. A defendant must voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive his right to remain silent when in custody and unrepresented by counsel. R.C. 2901.01(K)(8); <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694; <em>In re Gault, supra; State v. Gibson, supra; State v. Grimes supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>The court did not apprise Johnson of his Fifth Amendment rights at any time during the proceedings, either at the initial hearing, at the adjudicatory hearing, or at the dispositional hearing. Johnson\u2019s testimony was unnecessary to set out the elements of the theft offense, because Officer Bryant testified to each element.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">However, Johnson was asked to stipulate to a prior theft offense. The prosecution needed the stipulation under R.C. 2151.355(A)(4) for the disposition chosen: confinement at the Ohio Department of Youth Services from six months until Johnson reached the age of emancipation (five years). Johnson cannot be considered to have waived his rights without a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Therefore, we find this assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">In his fourth assignment, Johnson argues that the juvenile court erred by adjudicating Johnson a delinquent child without proof of every element of the charge supported by sufficient, competent, credible evidence. Johnson argues that as an unrepresented juvenile, he was not competent to stipulate either to his age or to the prior offense, even had he received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">With regard to Johnson\u2019s age, parties are not permitted to confer subject-matter jurisdiction on a court solely by stipulation of parties. <em>Fox v. Eaton Corp. </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 236, 2 O.O.3d 408, 358 N.E.2d 536. The court must actually have subject-matter jurisdiction. In this case, it seems clear that the juvenile court held subject-matter jurisdiction in this matter because Johnson was thirteen years old at the time he was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">With regard to Johnson\u2019s stipulation to a prior offense, there is no case law that holds a minor incompetent to stipulate or admit to facts. Therefore, this issue turns on whether the court afforded Johnson his Fifth Amendment rights as argued in Johnson\u2019s third assignment of error. Johnson cannot be held to his stipulations without having received and understood a <em>Miranda </em>warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Therefore, this assignment of error is not well taken with respect to subject-matter jurisdiction because it is clear from the record that the juvenile court has subject-matter jurisdiction over Johnson. This assignment of error is well taken with respect to the prior-offense stipulation for the reasons we discussed in examining the third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">In his fifth assignment, Johnson argues that the juvenile court erred by failing to comply with Juv.R. 29(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">Juv.R. 29(B) gives five statutory duties to the juvenile court to ensure that juveniles are afforded the minimum protection under the Constitution. First, the juvenile court must ascertain whether notice requirements have been met. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Second, the juvenile court must inform the parties of the substance of the complaint, the purpose of the hearing, and the possible consequences of the hearing. Third, the juvenile court must inform unrepresented parties of their right to counsel and determine whether those parties waive their right to counsel. Fourth, the juvenile court must appoint counsel for any party that does not waive the right to counsel. Finally, the juvenile court must inform any unrepresented party who waives the right to counsel of the right to obtain counsel at any time in the proceedings, the right to remain silent, the right to offer evidence, the right to cross-examine witnesses, and the right to have a record of all proceedings made.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The referees and the judge failed under each element of Juv.R. 29(B) at each hearing. At the initial hearing, the clerk read the complaint in the record, but the referee failed to ascertain whether notice requirements were met, failed to disclose either the purpose of the hearing or the possible penalties, failed to determine whether Johnson waived his right to counsel voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently, and failed to inform Johnson of his rights to obtain counsel at any time, remain silent, offer evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and have a record made of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">At the adjudicatory hearing, the referee failed to ascertain whether notice requirements were met, failed to disclose either the purpose of the hearing or the possible penalties, and failed to inform Johnson of his right to obtain counsel at any time, remain silent, and have a record made of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">At the dispositional hearing, the judge failed to inform Johnson of any of his rights, and even engaged Johnson in a guessing game regarding what penalties Johnson could incur, demonstrating that Johnson was still unaware of the possible five years of confinement at the Ohio Youth Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The court must comply with Juv.R. 29(B). This rule protects juveniles from the type of violations of right that occurred in this case, and protects the court from second-guessing by the parties after adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">We find this assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">Finally, Johnson argues in his sixth assignment that the juvenile court erred by conducting a dispositional hearing with a judge after a referee conducted the adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">Juv.R. 34(B) states that the judge or referee who presided at the adjudicatory hearing shall, if possible, preside at the dispositional hearing. See R.C. 2151.35(B)(2)(a). The obvious advantage of this rule is that the referee or judge hearing the facts can best determine how to handle juveniles presented in light of those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>However, at times, it is not possible for the referee at the adjudicatory hearing also to preside over the dispositional hearing. For this reason, the legislature uses the language \u201cif possible\u201d to allow dispositional hearings to continue under those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In this case, the record does not show how Johnson has been prejudiced by having a different individual preside over his dispositional hearing than over his adjudicatory hearing. The record does not reflect that it was possible for the referee to preside over both hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Absent such showings, this assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In sum, we find the first, second, third, fifth and part of the fourth assignments of error are well taken, and overrule the sixth and part of the fourth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for new hearings with instructions to follow due process requirements both under Juv.R. 29(B) and consistent with this decision to ensure that Johnson receives the full protection of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b80-10\">Doan, P.J., M.B.
