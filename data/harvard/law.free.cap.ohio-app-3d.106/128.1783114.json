The agreement contained a term providing for periodic wage increases. Since the agreement was to expire on April 30, 1993, prior to that date the parties entered negotiations concerning it. During these negotiations, the city was represented by the then named law firm of Duvin, Cahn <em>&amp; </em>Barnard.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">On March 15, 1993, the record reflects the parties met and discussed the wage increase provision contained in the agreement. At this meeting, the Council was represented by its executive secretary, Carl F. Gauntner. The city was represented by Marc J. Bloch, an attorney for the law firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Ultimately, the parties were unable to agree on the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement. The parties therefore submitted the matter to the Board for mediation upon the expiration of the.old agreement. On June 17, 1993, Gauntner and Bloch notified the mediator that the parties were \u201cstill engaged in negotiations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">On June 28, 1993, Gauntner wrote a letter to Daniel Hauenstein, the city\u2019s Manager of Labor Relations. Therein, Gauntner informed Hauenstein that the council desired the city to put wage increases into effect retroactive to May 1, 1993; he also noted that \u201cthe existing agreement * * * has been extended by mutual agreement of both parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">On July 13, 1993, the city responded through counsel that since the previous collective bargaining contract had expired, the city had \u201cabsolutely no obligation to implement any wage increases\u201d after that date. The city defended its position with the observation that it was \u201ccompletely consistent with the one taken by the * * * Council on health insurance co-payments when [the Council] insisted that such employee payments be deferred until the conclusion of negotiations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">On July 14, 1993, the council filed with the board an unfair labor practice charge against the city. In its statement of the facts constituting the charge, the council averred that although the collective bargaining agreement had expired, \u201cthe parties agreed to extend it through July 31, 1993.\u201d The council further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>stated that \u201c[n]ot only is the city obligated to continue to abide by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement because the parties agreed to extend its terms,\u201d but the city was attempting to implement a unilateral change. The council also accused the city of \u201cbad faith bargaining.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">On April 7, 1994, the board notified the city it had found probable cause to believe the city had violated R.C. 4117.11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It attached the council\u2019s complaint to the notification. The complaint stated in paragraph 8 that the parties had agreed to extend the terms of the collective bargaining agreement on \u201cMarch 15, 1993.\u201d The board set the cause for an evidentiary hearing on May 9,1994; a prehearing conference was set for April 27,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">On April 18, 1994, the city filed an answer to the complaint. Therein, the city admitted that it met with the council on March 15, 1993 \u201cto discuss the negotiations,\u201d but denied it agreed to extend the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">On April 25, 1994, the council filed a motion to intervene, which was subsequently granted, in order to present evidence at the hearing. That same day, the state of Ohio filed its prehearing statement which indicated that the only fact in dispute was whether on March 15, 1993, the parties had agreed to extend the terms of the collective bargaining agreement beyond April 30, 1993. Gauntner was listed as the sole witness to be called.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">On April 25, 1994, the city also filed a prehearing statement. Therein, the city stated that it would establish it was not obligated to pay any wage increase a,nd indicated that it would introduce as exhibits \u201cnotes of Marc J. Bloch, Esq. regarding March 15,1993 meeting with Mr. Carl F. Gauntner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">On April 27, 1994, at the prehearing conference, the city revealed that it planned to call Marc J. Bloch as a witness to testify about the matters discussed \u2022 at the March 15, 1993 meeting. At that point, both the state of Ohio and the council moved that the law firm be disqualified from representing the city. The hearing officer issued a show cause order and set- the motion for hearing; however, by consent of the parties, the hearing was cancelled and the issue of the disqualification of the law firm was to be considered only on briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">Both the state of Ohio and the council argued in their briefs that under the circumstances, the law firm\u2019s representation of the city would constitute a violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (\u201cCPR\u201d), specifically, Disci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>plinary Rule (\u201cDR\u201d) 5-102(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They contended that since the board had authority \u201cto establish standards of persons who practice before it\u201d pursuant to R.C. 4117.02(H)(7), it also had authority to prevent such a violation. They therefore urged the board to disqualify the law firm and order the city to retain new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The city responded by arguing that it became aware of the significance of Bloch\u2019s testimony \u201conly shortly before\u201d the prehearing conference; thus, the motion to disqualify was merely a \u201ctactic\u201d and disqualification would \u201cwork serious and prejudicial hardship on the city.\u201d The city also contended the provisions of the CPR did not apply in board proceedings, the board had no authority to regulate attorneys, and to apply the provisions would violate the city\u2019s constitutional rights as a party to the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Eventually, the hearing officer transmitted all the documents received on the issue to the board for determination. On October 26, 1994, the board issued its order and opinion granting the motion to disqualify the law firm. The board made the following findings in its order: (1) DR 5-101 and 5-102 apply to attorneys appearing before it; (2) continued representation of the city by the law firm would violate DR 5-102; and (3) none of the exceptions listed in DR 5-101(B)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were present, and, further, disqualification would not constitute a substantial hardship for the city. The board also found the matter an appropriate one for appellate review; thus, it was certified to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The city presents the following as its sole assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">\u201cThe State Employment Relations Board erred in disqualifying the law firm that had been representing the city of Cleveland throughout the proceedings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>this matter, having lacked the constitutional authority to regulate the practice of law, where the representation of a party before SERB is not the practice of law and where SERB unconstitutionally sought to regulate attorneys while not regulating nonattorneys who appear before SERB as representatives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The city argues that in view of the explicit directive permitting nonattorneys to represent a party in board proceedings,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the merely quasijudicial nature of board proceedings, and\u2019 the lack of any specific board regulation on the subject, the board overreached its authority in this case. Each of the city\u2019s points has been considered and must ultimately be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">R.C. 4117.02 establishes the powers and duties of the board, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">\u201c(A) There is hereby created the state employment relations board * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">\u201c(E) The board shall appoint an executive director and <em>attorneys, attorney-trial examiners, </em>mediators, arbitrators, members of fact-finding panels, directors for local areas, and other employees as it finds necessary for the proper performance of its duties and may prescribe their duties. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">\u201c(F) The board shall select and assign examiners and other agents whose functions are to conduct hearings with due regard to their impartiality, <em>judicial temperament, </em>and knowledge. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">if; # if;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-12\">\u201c(H) In addition to the powers and functions provided in other sections of this chapter, the board shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-13\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-14\">\u201c(3) Hold hearings pursuant to this chapter and, for the purpose of the hearing and inquiries, <em>administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses and documents, take testimony and receive evidence, compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents by the issuance of subpoenas, and delegate these powers to </em>any members of the board or <em>any attorney-trial examiner </em>appointed by the board for the performance of its functions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-15\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-16\">\u201c(7) Notwithstanding section 119.13 of the Revised Code, <em>establish standards of persons who practice before it;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-17\">\u201c(8) <em>Adopt, </em>amend, and rescind <em>rules and procedures and exercise other powers appropriate to carry out this chapter. </em>* * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Moreover, the Ohio Supreme Court has also recognized the authority granted to the board pursuant to R.C. 4417.02(H) in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\">\u201cWe have consistently held that the decision whether to proceed by rule making or adjudication to resolve a dispute lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">\u201cAn administrative board has the authority <em>to use either quasi-legislative promulgation </em>of general rules designed to address a general issue <em>or to use a quasi-judicial proceeding when a specific dispute arises as a case before the board. Id. [NLRB v. Beech-Nut Life Savers, Inc., </em>406 F.2d 253] at 257. \u201cTo insist upon one form of action to the exclusion of the other is to exalt form over necessity.\u201d <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Comm. v.

Professionals Guild of Ohio </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 147, 151, 545 N.E.2d 1260, 1265.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The board\u2019s decision in such a matter is entitled to deference by a reviewing court. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the board has explicitly promulgated a rule which grants hearing officers the authority to \u201cexclude any person for improper conduct.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4117-1-11(A)(9). The board has previously exercised this authority to ensure the integrity of quasijudicial proceedings. <em>In re Cuyahoga Cty. Sheriffs Dept. </em>(May 15, 1985), SERB Case No. 85-021.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">In this case, the board essentially determined that lawyers representing parties in proceedings before it are bound by the CPR. By implication, the board has indicated that an attorney or law firm refusing to comply with the CPR is engaging in \u201cimproper conduct.\u201d <em>In re Cuyahoga Cty. Sheriffs Dept., supra. </em>In view of the purpose behind the CPR, the board\u2019s action was entirely appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">According to the Preface of the CPR:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">\u201cThe Canons of this Code are statements of axiomatic norms, expressing in general terms <em>the standards of professional conduct expected of lawyers in their relationships with the public, </em>with the legal system, <em>and with the legal profession. </em>They embody the general concepts from which the Ethical Considerations and the Disciplinary Rules are derived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\"><em>\u201cThe Ethical Considerations </em>are aspirational in character and represent the objectives toward which every member of the profession should strive. They <em>constitute a body of principles </em>upon which the lawyer can rely for guidance in many specific situations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\"><em>\u201cThe Disciplinary Rules, </em>unlike the Ethical Considerations, <em>are mandatory </em>in character. The Disciplinary Rules state <em>the minimum level of conduct below which no laivyer can fall </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>In <em>Mentor Lagoons, Inc. v. Rubin </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 256, 257, 31 OBR 459, 460, 510 N.E.2d 379, 380, the Supreme Court stated the general rule that \u201cit is inappropriate for an attorney to testify on behalf of a client as in so doing he may breach ethical requirements,\u201d <em>viz., </em>DR 5-102(A). The Supreme Court acknowledged that it is not a \u201cflat prohibition,\u201d however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">\u201c[W]hen the issue arises, any \u2018doubts should be resolved in favor of the lawyer[\u2019s] testifying and against his * * * continuing as an advocate.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">U \u00ab * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">\u201cThe Code of Professional Responsibility \u2018does not delineate rules of evidence but only sets forth strictures on attorney conduct.\u2019 <em>Universal Athletic Sales Co. v. American Gym, Recreational &amp; Athletic Equip. Corp. </em>(C.A.3 1976), 546 F.2d 530] <em>supra, </em>at 539. Consequently, in most jurisdictions, the rule barring an attorney from serving as a witness for his client <em>is a rule of ethics and not of law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 258, 31 OBR at 461, 510 N.E.2d at 381.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">When the issue arises in a proceeding, the Supreme Court left the resolution of this matter to the sound discretion of the trier of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">\u201cA trial court has the \u2018inherent power to regulate the practice before it and <em>protect the integrity of its proceedings </em>* * * \u2019 including the \u2018 \u201cauthority and duty to see to the ethical conduct of attorneys * * \u2019 <em>Royal Indemnity Co. v. J.C. Penney Co. </em>(1986), 27 Ohio St.3d 31, 33-34, 27 OBR 447, 449, 501 N.E.2d 617, 620; see, also, <em>D.H. Overmyer Co., Inc. v. Robson </em>(C.A.6, 1984), 750 F.2d 31, 33; Canon 3A(2) of the Code of Judicial Conduct. <em>This includes the inherent authority of dismissal or disqualification from a case if an attorney cannot, or will not, comply with the Code of Professional Responsibility when representing a client. Id. This power is distinct from the exclusive authority of the Supreme Court of Ohio over attorney disciplinary proceedings, and does not conflict with such power. Id. </em>See, also, Section 5(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution and Gov. Bar R. V; <em>Smith v. Kates </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 263, 75 O.O.2d 318, 348 N.E.2d 320; <em>Brotherhood of Ry. Carmen of the United States &amp; Canada v. Delpro Co. </em>(D.Del.1982), 549 F.Supp. 780. Indeed we hasten to approve and encourage courts throughout this state in their efforts <em>to halt unprofessional conduct </em>* * (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 259-260, 31 OBR at 462, 510 N.E.2d at 382.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">Thus, the trier of fact\u2019s decision to disqualify an attorney on the basis of a probable violation of the CPR is part of its \u201cinherent authority.\u201d It is merely a protective action to ensure the integrity of its proceedings rather than a usurpation of the Supreme Court\u2019s authority to regulate the practice of law. Hence, it is not improper. <em>Brown v. Dist. of Columbia Bd. of Zoning Adjustment </em>(D.C.App.1980), 413 A.2d 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The city attempts to overcome the language of <em>Mentor Lagoons </em>by contending that because proceedings before the board are merely quasijudicial in nature, the CPR and its Disciplinary Rules have no application. This contention is disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Initially, it must be noted that the Supreme Court has interpreted the board\u2019s role in determining an unfair labor practice charge as equivalent to that of any other trier of fact such as a trial court. <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 260, 533 N.E.2d 264, 266. Other appellate districts have conformed to this characterization. See, <em>e.g., Ray v. Ohio Unemp. Comp. Bd. of Rev. </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 103, 619 N.E.2d 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Secondly, in view of the specific language of the Preface to the CPR, the type of proceeding in which an attorney takes part is irrelevant to the ethical considerations he must make. In a similar situation as that presented in this case, the court in <em>State Emp. Relations Bd. v. Springfield Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(June 7, 1995), Summit App. No. 17012, unreported, 1995 WL 338506, stated that the attorneys \u201cdid not shed their lawyer\u2019s clothes simply by representing the Board before SERB. There is no dispute that [the law firm] was representing the Board <em>in its professional legal capacity </em>before SERB. As such, their <em>representation was governed by the Disciplinary Rules. </em>Presumably, [the law firm] was aware of this. To prohibit SERB, therefore, from enforcing the Disciplinary Rules <em>would allow any attorney practicing law before SERB to circumvent his or her ethical obligations.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">It is thus axiomatic that simply by virtue of his license an attorney becomes subject to the CPR and its accompanying rules of conduct in any professional setting, regardless of its nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The city makes the further argument that the board\u2019s action in disqualifying its law firm violated its constitutional right to equal protection of the law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The city contends that since the board\u2019s own regulations permit nonattorneys to practice before it, and, the CPR applies only to attorneys, the board\u2019s enforcement of the CPR constitutes an unfairly disparate treatment of parties. This court does not find the city\u2019s argument persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u201cThe guarantee of equal protection does not prohibit states from ever treating different people differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\u201c \u2018The equal protection clause guarantees that similar individuals will be dealt with in a similar manner by the government. It does not reject the government\u2019s ability to classify persons or \u201cdraw lines\u201d in the creation and application of laws, but it does guarantee that those classifications will not be based upon impermissible criteria or arbitrarily used to burden a group of individuals. If the government classification relates to a proper governmental purpose, then the classification will be upheld. <em>Such a classification does not violate the guarantee when it distinguishes persons as \u201cdissimilar\u201d upon some permissible basis in order to advance the legitimate interests of society. Those who are treated less favorably by the legislation are not denied equal protection of the law because they are not similarly situated to those who receive the benefit of the legislative classification.\u2019 </em>Nowak &amp; Rotunda, Constitutional Law (4 Ed.1991), 570, Section 14.2.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Clark v. Joseph </em>(1994), 95 Ohio App.3d 207, 211, 642 N.E.2d 36, 38-39.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Since there is neither a suspect class nor a fundamental right involved in this case, the board\u2019s \u201cclassification\u201d of representatives in proceedings before it need- only \u201cbear a rational relationship to the achievement of a legitimate state interest * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212, 642 N.E.2d at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Clearly, as the Ohio Supreme Court has declared, Ohio has a legitimate interest in insuring that attorneys comply with ethical considerations so that the integrity of state-sponsored adjudicatory proceedings may be maintained. <em>Mentor Lagoons, Inc. v. Rubin, supra; </em>see, also, <em>In re Cuyahoga Cty. Sheriffs Dept., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Finally, although the city contends disqualification of its counsel in this case would be \u201cunduly prejudicial\u201d and would serve to condone \u201ctactics\u201d of the council, the record fails to support these contentions. Rather, there is ample evidence to support the board\u2019s conclusion that when the council filed the charge the city was on notice of the potential ethical problem involved and that substitution of counsel would not pose a substantial hardship. This court is required to give deference to the board\u2019s findings. R.C. 4117.02(L); <em>155 N. High, Ltd. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 423, 650 N.E.2d 869; <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd., supra. </em>See, also, <em>Mentor Lagoons, Inc. v.
