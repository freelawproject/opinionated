His sentence was enhanced pursuant to R.C. 2907.02(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-17\">Appellant was indicted on August 12, 1994 for engaging in sexual conduct by force with his four-month-old granddaughter, Autumn. Autumn\u2019s mother, Angela, is appellant\u2019s daughter. Briefly, the incident occurred when appellant was watching Autumn while Angela went to a neighbor\u2019s home. Upon her return, Angela heard Autumn screaming. When she entered the trailer, Angela discovered Autumn face down on appellant\u2019s lap. Angela grabbed Autumn and observed appellant\u2019s erect penis. On April 25, 1995, a jury found appellant guilty of rape by force. The trial court\u2019s judgment entry of conviction and imposition of sentencing was filed on April 25,1995.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>It is from this judgment entry that appellant presents four assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Assignment of Error No. 3</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">\u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error when it instructed the jury that fellatio is any stimulation of the penis by the mouth of another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Since appellant is challenging the jury instruction regarding the definition of \u201cfellatio,\u201d we address his third assignment of error prior to determining whether there was sufficient evidence to support a finding of fellatio. Appellant asserts that the common meaning of fellatio requires \u201cthat there be some penetration into the mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) states that \u201c[n]o person shall engage in sexual conduct\u201d with an individual under the age of thirteen. Pursuant to R.C. 2907.01(A), sexual conduct includes fellatio. However, there is no definition of \u201cfellatio\u201d in the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">In defining \u201cfellatio,\u201d the Supreme Court of Ohio was guided by the common usage of the word and cited the following dictionary meaning \u201c \u2018the practice of obtaining sexual satisfaction by oral stimulation of the penis.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re M.D. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 149, 152, 527 N.E.2d 286, 289, quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 836. In <em>State v. Long </em>(1989), 64 Ohio App.3d 615, 618, 582 N.E.2d 626, 628, an appellate court found no error in the trial court\u2019s charge to \u201cthe jury that fellatio is committed by touching the male sex organ with any part of the mouth.\u201d Thus, the court found that no penetration was required. <em>Id. </em>See, also, <em>State v. Turvey </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 724, 748, 618 N.E.2d 214, 230 (holding that fellatio requires no penetration); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 616 (defining \u201cfellatio\u201d as \u201c[a] sexual act in which the mouth or lips come into contact with the penis\u201d); American Heritage Dictionary (1985) 496 (defining fellatio as \u201c[o]ral stimulation of the penis\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Furthermore, \u201cfellatio\u201d is defined in 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (1994) 165, Section 507.02, as \u201ca sexual act committed with the male sexual organ and the mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">In the instant case, the record shows that the trial court provided the jury with the instruction set forth in Ohio Jury Instructions. The jury requested additional instructions. Specifically, the jury asked, \u201c[m]ay we be given a more detailed explanation of fellatio? \u201d and \u201c[d]oes fellatio must have <em>[sic] </em>penetration of the penis into the mouth?\u201d In response, the trial court instructed as follows: \u201cYou have already been given instructions concerning fellatio, and you should follow them. Fellatio is any stimulation of the penis by the mouth of another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Upon our review, we conclude that there is no requirement of penetration to commit fellatio.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court, therefore, committed no error in its instruction and appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\u201cThe conviction must be reversed because there was insufficient evidence of fellatio, and thus the conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">In view of the above analysis, we next examine appellant\u2019s first assignment of error. Appellant contends that \u201caside from [a]ppellant\u2019s statement to the police, the <em>only </em>evidence in support of the conviction came from Angelica\u2019s<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> statement that the baby\u2019s face was <em>by </em>[ajppellant\u2019s \u2018private areas,\u2019 and that [a]ppellant\u2019s penis was erect and exposed.\u201d Thus, appellant argues that his statement alone is insufficient to support a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">When reviewing the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must inquire \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus. The reviewing court must remember that the jury heard the evidence and has the primary responsibility to consider the evidence and credibility of the witnesses. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Again, the offense of rape results when a person engages in sexual conduct with an individual under the age of thirteen. R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">The trial transcript reveals the following testimony from Angela. Angela left Autumn with appellant while she walked to the neighbors. After a brief time, she returned to the trailer. As she was walking up the steps, she heard Autumn screaming. When questioned about the screaming, Angela stated it was different from a cry Autumn would make when she was hungry or needed to be changed. When she entered, she saw Autumn on appellant\u2019s \u201clap with her face down by his private areas.\u201d Appellant was reluctant to hand Autumn to Angela, but when he did, Angela observed appellant\u2019s erect penis. Angela then ran out of the house with the baby, screaming that \u201che did it.\u201d In a later conversation with Angela, appellant apologized and stated that he was getting help.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>A detective testified that appellant, after changing his story, told him he had an urge to put his penis in Autumn\u2019s mouth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the detective asked if he put his penis in Autumn\u2019s mouth, appellant responded \u201che didn\u2019t think so but maybe a little bit, and that it mostly brushed up against the outside.\u201d Towards the conclusion of the interview, appellant also signed a statement, written by the detective, regarding the incident. In his statement, appellant admitted that he had an urge to unzip his pants and see what Autumn would do with his penis. Again, appellant conceded that his penis may have gone into Autumn\u2019s mouth \u201ca little, but mostly on the outside.\u201d In the statement, appellant, however, maintained that his penis was not erect during the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Based upon the foregoing evidence, as well as the rest of the record, we find that there was evidence, if believed, by the jury to establish the elements of rape beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, therefore, is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">\u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error in admitting appellant\u2019s confession because the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the offense had not been established before the statement was admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Appellant submits that \u201cthere was <em>no </em>evidence, apart from [ajppellant\u2019s statement, to support the finding that there was \u2018sexual conduct.\u2019 \u201d He further maintains that his confession, although violating no constitutional rights, was suggestive enough to apply the <em>corpus delicti </em>rule. Although some issues were raised regarding appellant\u2019s statement, there appears to be no specific <em>corpus delicti </em>issue raised at the trial level. We will, however, address his assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The <em>corpus delicti </em>of a crime is composed of \u201cthe act and the criminal agency of the act.\u201d <em>State v. Van Hook </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 256, 261, 530 N.E.2d 883, 888. The <em>corpus delicti </em>rule requires that the state present \u201c \u2018some evidence outside of the confession that tends to prove <em>some </em>material element of the crime charged\u2019 \u201d in order to admit a confession. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>State v. Maranda </em>(1916), 94 Ohio St. 364, 114 N.E. 1038, paragraph two of the syllabus. Such evidence may be circumstantial. <em>State v. Nicely </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 147, 154-155, 529 N.E.2d 1236, 1242-1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Upon a review <em>of </em>the record, we find sufficient evidence dehors appellant\u2019s confession to meet the <em>corpus delicti </em>requirement. As indicated by the previous references to the transcript, Angela heard Autumn screaming and upon entering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the trailer saw Autumn face down on appellant\u2019s lap. Appellant was reluctant to give Autumn to Angela and when he did Angela observed his erect penis. Angela\u2019s testimony, as well as appellant\u2019s apology, claim of seeking help, and demeanor during the interview with the detective, meet the some evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">For the above stated reasons, appellant\u2019s second assignment of. error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Assignment of Error No. 4</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">\u201cThe conviction must be reversed because there was insufficient evidence that appellant used \u2018force\u2019 in committing the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Appellant argues that there was no force used in committing the act. Furthermore, he contends that \u201cplacing the baby on his lap is too attenuated from the rape itself to allow a finding that there was force.\u201d In analyzing appellant\u2019s assertions, we again apply the standard set for in <em>State v. Jenks, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">R.C. 2907.02(B) enhances the penalty for individuals convicted of raping a child under the age of thirteen by force or threat of force to life imprisonment. Force is defined in R.C. 2901.01(A) as \u201cany violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">The Supreme Court of Ohio found that force \u201cdepends upon the age, size and strength of the parties and their relation to each other.\u201d <em>State v. Eskridge </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 56, 526 N.E.2d 304, paragraph one of the syllabus. <em>State v. Eskridge </em>involved a four-year-old child and was primarily based upon the inherent control a parent or other authority figure has upon a child. <em>Id. </em>at 58-59, 526 N.E.2d at 306. Obviously, this particular factor is not present when the victim is a four-month-old infant.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Nonetheless, in view of the above analysis and the statutory definition of \u201cforce,\u201d we find sufficient evidence to establish the use of force. In doing so, we conclude that an infant, because of its age, has no power to resist any adult actions. Simply, an adult\u2019s control is absolute. Thus, the compulsion or constraint necessary to establish force when the victim is an infant is logically lessened.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">Consequently, holding a four-month-old baby facedown on the lap of an adult and subjecting it to an erect adult penis is clearly a physical compulsion or constraint. Based on this, as well as the rest of the record, we overrule appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Having found no error prejudicial to appellant, the judgment of the Auglaize County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b467-6\">Thomas F.
