For the reasons that follow, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The undisputed facts, taken in a light most favorable to the appellant, follow. On October 22,1990, Rondal R. Childers, appellant\u2019s decedent, arrived at work at the Whirlpool Corporation, appellee, approximately one-half hour before his shift commenced and reported to the plant dispensary complaining of pain in his shoulder and neck. At the dispensary, the decedent requested that the nurse on duty, Linda Hill, R.N., check his blood pressure. The decedent also told Nurse Hill that he felt pain in his throat or neck. When Hill asked the decedent to lie down on an examining table, he declined, indicating that it hurt to lie down.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">According to Hill\u2019s deposition testimony and her affidavit submitted in support of the appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, she asked the decedent whether he was aware that his symptoms \u201cwere a warning sign.\u201d According to Hill, the decedent did not respond to her question. Hill then asked the decedent if she should call for equipment to better diagnose his condition. He refused this suggestion. Hill\u2019s deposition testimony and affidavit indicate that the decedent\u2019s blood pressure, pulse, and skin color were normal. The decedent left the dispensary, completed his shift and went home.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">While at home, he collapsed and died from an acute myocardial infarction. On October 20, 1992, the appellant filed her C-2 application for workers\u2019 compensation death benefits. The appellee, a self-insured employer, declined to certify her claim. The appellant exhausted her administrative remedies and, pursuant to R.C. 4123.519, timely filed her complaint and notice of appeal with the Court of Common Pleas of Marion County.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">On November 9, 1994, the appellee moved for summary judgment. The appellee contended that an alleged failure to diagnose the decedent\u2019s heart attack was not a compensable injury under R.C. 4123.01. The appellee also argued that the appellant\u2019s failure to produce any evidence that an alleged failure to diagnose was causally connected to the decedent\u2019s heart attack precluded compensability. In its motion package for summary judgment, the appellee attached the affidavit of Nurse Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">Hill\u2019s affidavit attested to her qualifications, stated that the treatment and advice given to the decedent was in accordance with all accepted medical or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>nursing standards, stated that at no time did her conduct deviate from accepted medical or nursing standards, and further stated that she did not hasten the decedent\u2019s heart attack or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In her brief in opposition to summary judgment, the appellant asserted that Hill\u2019s failure to render proper treatment for the decedent \u201csignificantly contributed to his death by placing him in a position which increased the dangerous effects of his condition and placed him at greater risk than he or anyone else in the same circumstances would have encountered elsewhere.\u201d In support of this proposition, the appellant included the affidavit of Ronald A. Landefeld, M.D. After reviewing Nurse Hill\u2019s deposition testimony, the decedent\u2019s medical records, the appellant\u2019s affidavit, and the death certificate, Dr. Landefeld concluded with reasonable medical certainty that the care given by Hill was medically inappropriate and significantly contributed to the death of Rondal Childers.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In granting summary judgment in favor of the appellee, the trial court ruled that the appellant had not suffered a compensable injury within the meaning of R.C. 4123.01. Furthermore, the trial court determined that the appellant had failed to submit admissible evidence on the issue of medical causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">From this judgment the appellant brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The appellant asserts two assignments of error for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Assignment of Error No. One</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred in its determination that Appellant\u2019s decedent suffered no injury upon which a claim under the workers\u2019 compensation act could be predicated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">Assignment of Error No. Two</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-13\">\u201cThe court erred in [its] finding that Appellant failed to submit admissible evidence on medical causation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">Pursuant to App.R. 3(C)(2) the appellee asserts the following two cross-assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b89-15\">Cross-Assignment of Error No. One</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-16\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the extent it failed to exclude Dr. Landefeld\u2019s affidavit pursuant to Evidence Rule 703.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Cross-Assignment of Error No. Two</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the extent it failed to hold that Dr. Landefeld is incompetent to testify as a medical witness under R.C. 2743.43.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Summary judgment may be properly granted where \u201c(1) no genuine issue as to any material fact exists; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion; and (4) viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party.\u201d <em>Bellian v. Bicron Corp. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 517, 520, 634 N.E.2d 608, 610-611, citing <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274. A motion for summary judgment forces the nonmoving party to produce evidence on any issue for which that party bears the burden of production at trial. <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095, paragraph three of the syllabus. This court reviews the evidence <em>de novo. Smiddy v. Wedding Party, Inc. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 35, 36, 30 OBR 78, 78-79, 506 N.E.2d 212, 214-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The appellant\u2019s first assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that the decedent did not suffer an \u201cinjury\u201d within the meaning of the workers\u2019 compensation statute. The trial court concluded that Hill\u2019s alleged \u201cfailure to provide medically appropriate treatment\u201d did not result in a compensable injury as a matter of law. For somewhat different reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">It is undisputed that the decedent\u2019s heart attack was unrelated to his employment and would not, therefore, be compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation statute. The appellant argues, however, that although the heart attack itself is not a compensable injury, the subsequent medical treatment alleged to have been negligently provided by the decedent\u2019s employer for the decedent\u2019s noncompensable injury resulted in an injury compensable pursuant to the workers\u2019 compensation statute. We disagree with appellant\u2019s assertion, and find the argument not well taken.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">For purposes of workers\u2019 compensation, \u201c ![i]njury\u2019 includes any injury, whether caused by external accidental means or accidental in character and result, received in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d R.C. 4123.01(C). Under R.C. 4123.01(C)(2), \u201cinjury\u201d does not include \u201cinjury or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>disability caused primarily by the natural deterioration of tissue, an organ, or part of the body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">The requirement of R.C. 4123.01(C) that the injury be received \u201cin the course of\u2019 and \u201carising out of\u2019 employment is phrased in the conjunctive and \u201ceach prong of the formula must be * * * satisfied before compensability mil be allowed.\u201d <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 275, 277, 551 N.E.2d 1271, 1274. \u201cThe \u2018in the course of prong is construed to relate to the time, place, and circumstances of the injury, while the \u2018arising out of prong is interpreted as referring to a causal connection between the employment and the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Since there was a complete failure of proof on the second prong, the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The appellant does not allege that any condition of her husband\u2019s employment caused his heart attack. In the absence of any allegation or evidence that the decedent\u2019s heart attack was caused or accelerated by physical or mental stresses brought on by his employment, we must conclude that the decedent\u2019s actual heart attack would not be compensable, as it was unrelated to his employment. See R.C. 4123.01(C)(2). We therefore reject the appellant\u2019s contention that an injury caused by Hill\u2019s allegedly negligent treatment of a noncompensable injury is compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In <em>Evans v. Mihm </em>(Sept. 4, 1992), Trumbull App. No. 92-T-4644, unreported, 1992 WL 213125, the Court of Appeals for Trumbull County addressed facts identical to those currently before us and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cAppellant\u2019s failure to allege that decedent\u2019s employment caused his heart attack, and the subsequent failure to introduce evidence thereof in response to appellee\u2019s properly raised motion for summary judgment, justify the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. A contrary result would effectively elide from the statute any requirements that the employment be causally connected to the employee\u2019s injury; this is not a proper judicial activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">\u201cFurther, a contrary result would circumvent R.C. 4123.01(C)(2), which states that injuries or disabilities which are caused primarily by the natural deterioration of tissue, an organ or part of the body are not compensable. If compensation were payable for the negligent treatment of an injury which would otherwise not be compensable, a worker would be entitled to benefits not otherwise available simply because the injury manifested itself at the workplace. The compensation for an injury should not be determined by the fortuity of its manifestation at the worksite. A noncompensable injury is unfortunate; compensating a noncompensable injury is unlawful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">We find the reasoning of the <em>Evans </em>court persuasive. The issue in this case is whether compensation is payable for an employer\u2019s alleged negligent treatment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>a noncompensable injury. The appellant submits that a non-work-related injury is compensable if the care which is given to the employee and provided by his employer is the causal factor in his death and the care is \u201creceived in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u2022 Because the appellant does not allege that her husband\u2019s employment caused his heart attack, we conclude that summary judgment was appropriate due to the appellant\u2019s failure to demonstrate a causal connection between her husband\u2019s employment and his heart attack. See <em>Shively v. Jeep Corp. </em>(July 24, 1987), Lucas App. No. L-86-212, unreported, 1987 WL 14415 (delay in obtaining aid for heart attack victim is not within the definition of an \u201cinjury\u201d under R.C. 4123.01[C]). Cf. <em>Nadolny v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. </em>(Apr. 29, 1994), Wood App. No. 93WD055, unreported, 1994 WL 159770. The appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Given our disposition of the appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, the appellant\u2019s second assignment of error and the appellee\u2019s two cross-assignments of error are rendered moot. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein, in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b92-10\">Hadley, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b92-11\">Shaw, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-9\">. This opinion should not be construed to mean that negligent medical treatment, delivered subsequent to a heart attack which is other than work-related, is not compensable. We merely hold in this case that injury resulting from a non-employment-related heart attack is not compensable under R.C. Chapter 4123.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b92-12\">Shaw, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AN\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">I agree with the trial court that the medical evidence submitted by appellant is insufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to Nurse Hill\u2019s role in the causation of death in this case. For this reason alone, I concur in the judgment of this court affirming the granting of summary judgment in favor of the appellee. There would seem to be no reason to go further in deciding this case and I have some difficulty with the posture the majority has taken in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">In particular, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that negligent medical treatment offered by an employer for certain injuries or conditions could never constitute a compensable injury under the workers\u2019 compensation statute as a matter of law. Nor do I join the majority in subscribing to the rationale of the Trumbull County Court of Appeals in the <em>Evans </em>decision, which, in my view, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>establishes a separate (and lower) standard of employee medical care for medical conditions which might later be determined to be outside the workers\u2019 compensation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Finally, if the majority must address this case in terms of defining a \u201ccompensable injury\u201d under the workers\u2019 compensation system, I believe the approach followed by the Sixth District Court of Appeals in <em>Nadolny v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. </em>is the better one to be adopted by this court. Under that' decision, if employer-provided medical treatment significantly contributes to the employee\u2019s death by placing him in a position which increased the dangerous effects of even an idiopathic medical condition or injury and places him at a greater risk than he or anyone else in the same circumstances would have encountered elsewhere, then that treatment would constitute a condition or hazard of employment rendering the condition or injury compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
