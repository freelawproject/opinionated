Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Daoud Investments, Inc. (\u201cDII\u201d), an Ohio corporation, was a partner in an Ohio partnership that owned and operated a Gold Star Chili restaurant at the Beechmont Mall in 1991. Between March 25, 1991, and May 8, 1991, Jami Comello worked at Dll\u2019s Gold Star restaurant, as did Shirko Miro. Miro made \u201crepugnant\u201d sexual remarks to Comello, on one occasion grabbed her breast, and on one occasion exposed his penis to her. Comello denied any physical injury as a result of the incidents. Comello\u2019s suit against DII was tried separately. At that trial, Comello testified that she suffered emotional distress and received counseling from a psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">In this declaratory judgment action, DII sought to have Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cNationwide\u201d) pay for Dll\u2019s defense and for any judgment entered as a result of Miro\u2019s conduct, pursuant to a commercial general liability policy issued to DII and Mwafag Gammoh Partnership, d.b.a. Gold Star Chili. Nationwide refused to defend DII or to pay any judgment under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">Judgment was awarded to Comello for her harassment claim. Fahad S. David, a.k.a. Daoud, and Gold Star Chili were dismissed in the underlying action and are not part of this appeal. In the declaratory judgment action, the trial court held that Nationwide had a duty to defend DII, but no obligation to pay the judgment entered against it. Nationwide appealed and DII cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">In its sole assignment of error, Nationwide argues that the trial court erred in declaring that Nationwide owed a defense to DII in the <em>Comello </em>action. In its first assignment of error on cross-appeal, DII asserts that the trial court erred in ruling that Nationwide owed no defense or coverage to DII under the \u201cpersonal injury\u201d claim provisions. In its second assignment of error, DII asserts that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>trial court erred in holding that Nationwide had no duty to pay the judgment entered in the <em>Comello </em>action.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">III. Whether Nation-wide Owed a Defense to DII in <em>Comello</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In <em>Willoughby Hills v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 177, 9 OBR 463, 459 N.E.2d 555, the Ohio Supreme Court held that an insurer owes a duty to defend an insured any time the allegations in an action against the insured fall \u201carguably\u201d -within the coverage of the insurance policy in question. Therefore, to sustain Nationwide\u2019s assignment of error and to hold that Nationwide did not owe a defense to DII in the <em>Comello </em>action, we must be convinced that her allegations do not even arguably fall under the Nationwide policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Nationwide makes four arguments that it did not owe a defense to DII in the <em>Comello </em>action: (1) that Comello suffered no \u201cbodily injury\u201d and therefore her claims are not covered by the policy, (2) that Comello\u2019s action did not stem from an \u201coccurrence\u201d and therefore her claims are not covered by the policy, (3) that because Comello\u2019s injuries arose out of her employment at Gold Star Chili, policy exclusion provisions preclude Comello\u2019s claims, and (4) that Comello\u2019s claims are not \u201cpersonal injury\u201d claims and, therefore, are not covered by the policy. If Nationwide prevails on any one of these issues, then there is no coverage. We hold that Nationwide prevails on all four.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Comello stated at trial that she sustained emotional distress, but not physical injuries. Section V of the policy defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death resulting from any of these at any time.\u201d Therefore, we must determine whether the policy definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d arguably covers emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">DII contends that emotional distress arguably falls under Nationwide\u2019s definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d because either emotional distress is included in the definition, or the modifier \u201cbodily\u201d does not apply to \u201csickness\u201d or \u201cdisease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201cbodily injury\u201d usually indicates an injury brought on by external violence. <em>Tomlinson v. Skolnik </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 11, 540 N.E.2d 716. A number of Ohio appellate courts have interpreted this holding to exclude emotional distress from insurance policy claims for \u201cbodily injury\u201d where the definition in the policy is \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease.\u201d <em>Vance v. Sang Chong, Inc. </em>(Nov. 9, 1990), Lake App. No. 88-L-13-188, unreported, 1990 WL 174121; <em>Bowman v. Holcomb </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 216, 614 N.E.2d 838; <em>Reichard v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(Dec. 10, 1992), Montgomery App. No. 91-755, unreported, 1992 WL 361829; <em>Heinze v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(June 7, 1993), Butler App. No. CA92-10-205, unreported, 1993 WL 192909. See, also, <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Hiermer </em>(S.D.Ohio 1988), 720 F.Supp. 1310. The view expressed by these cases follows the national judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>trend conclusively excluding emotional distress from the insurance definition \u201cbodily injury, sickness or disease.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In our view, whether the word \u201cbodily\u201d modifies \u201csickness\u201d or \u201cdisease\u201d is irrelevant. Neither sickness nor disease arguably includes emotional distress. <em>Bowman, supra; Reichard, supra. </em>We are persuaded by these cases that emotional distress, in the absence of some physical harm, does not even arguably constitute a \u201cbodily injury\u201d as contemplated by this insurance definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Even if it is assumed that the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the policy arguably would cover emotional distress, Nationwide argues that Comello\u2019s action did not stem from an \u201coccurrence\u201d and therefore her claims are not covered by the policy. Section V of the policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same harmful conditions.\u201d Therefore, we must determine whether the policy definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d arguably covers Miro\u2019s actions and DII\u2019s inaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Comello alleged that DII acted negligently, and therefore \u201caccidentally.\u201d However, in <em>Randolf v. Grange Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 25, 11 O.O.3d 110, 385 N.E.2d 1305, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that an intentional act by the agent of an insured was not an \u201caccident\u201d within the terms of the insurance policy for purposes of liability coverage. The court determined that the nature of whether an act was accidental or whether an act was intentional must be taken from the agent/actor\u2019s viewpoint, and not from the principal\u2019s viewpoint. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 11 O.O.3d at 112, 385 N.E.2d at 1307. See <em>Rothman v. Metro. Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 241, 12 O.O. 50, 16 N.E.2d 417. Therefore, we must look to whether Miro acted accidentally, not whether DII acted accidentally in allowing Miro\u2019s acts to occur. Clearly, Miro acted intentionally when exposing himself, grabbing Comello and uttering vulgarities. Therefore, his acts are not even arguably contemplated by the policy definition of \u201coccurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Even if it is assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the policy arguably covers emotional distress and Comello\u2019s action did stem from an \u201coccurrence,\u201d Nationwide argues that the policy exclusion provisions preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Comello\u2019s claims because Comello\u2019s injuries arose out of her employment at Gold Star Chili.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Under Section I, paragraph 2, the policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">\u201cThis insurance does not apply to: * * * e. \u2018Bodily injury\u2019 to: (1) An employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of employment by the insured * * *. This exclusion applies whether the insured may be liable as an employer or in any other capacity * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">We must decide whether the exclusion arguably does not apply to Comello\u2019s injuries. If emotional distress is a bodily injury, the insurance does not apply to bodily injury to an employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of employment by the insured. The trial court evaluated Miro\u2019s conduct and determined that <em>his conduct </em>did not arise out of the course of his employment with DII. No artful twisting of the exclusion provision can make the words \u201cbodily injury to ah employee of the insured\u201d mean Miro\u2019s conduct. See, <em>e.g., Natl. Ben Franklin Ins. Co. v. Harris </em>(1987), 161 Mich.App. 86, 409 N.W.2d 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">When read as written, the exclusion unambiguously states that the insurance does not apply to <em>Comello\u2019s emotional distress (i.e., </em>\u201cbodily injury to an employee of the insured\u201d) arising out of and in the course of employment by DII. Comello\u2019s emotional distress clearly arose out of and in the course of her employment with DII. Therefore, the exclusion applies directly and unambiguously to exclude Comello\u2019s injuries from coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Fourth, if each of Nationwide\u2019s first three issues were to fail, Nationwide asserts that Comello\u2019s claims are not \u201cpersonal injury\u201d claims and, therefore, are not covered by Coverage B of the policy. Under Coverage B, the policy covers \u201cpersonal injury caused by an offense arising out of [Dll\u2019s] business, excluding advertising, publishing, broadcasting, or telecasting done by or for [DII].\u201d Section V defines \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as \u201cinjury other than bodily injury arising out of one of the following offenses: * * * e. <em>oral or urritten publication </em>of material that violates a person\u2019s right to privacy.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">DII asserts that Miro\u2019s conduct constituted an invasion of Comello\u2019s privacy, citing <em>Housh v. Peth </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 35, 59 O.O. 60, 133 N.E.2d 340, paragraph two of the syllabus, in which the Ohio Supreme Court held that the tort of invasion of privacy includes \u201cthe wrongful intrusion into one\u2019s private activities in such a manner as to outrage or cause mental suffering, shame or humiliation to a person of ordinary sensibilities.\u201d However, to be covered <em>under this policy, </em>the right to privacy must be violated by \u201coral or written publication.\u201d While there is some controversy over the extent of the \u201cpublicity\u201d requirement in the invasion-of-privacy tort, this case does not present any problem because Miro\u2019s vulgar comments to Comello do not even arguably fall within any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>definition of either \u201cpublication\u201d or \u201cpublicity\u201d of private facts. <em>Greenwood v. Taft, Stettinius &amp; Hollister </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 295, 663 N.E.2d 1030, discretionary appeal denied (1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 1204, 662 N.E.2d 22. Comello had no expectation of privacy in Miro\u2019s comments to her. See <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Akron </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 605, 640 N.E.2d 164. Therefore, we conclude that there was no \u201cpersonal injury\u201d even arguably covered under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">We hold that Comello did not arguably allege a \u201cbodily injury\u201d as defined in the policy, that Comello did not arguably allege an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined in the policy, that Comello was unarguably excluded by the employee exclusion, and that Comello did not arguably allege a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as defined in the policy. Any one of these grounds would excuse Nationwide from the assumption of Dll\u2019s defense. Therefore, Nationwide\u2019s assignment of error is well taken, and the trial court\u2019s judgment' holding Nationwide responsible for Dll\u2019s defense costs and expenses must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">IV. Issues on Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">On cross-appeal, DII raises the issues whether Nationwide owed coverage or a defense to DII under the personal injury provisions of the insurance policy and whether Nationwide owed a duty to pay the <em>Comello </em>judgment. The trial court held that Nationwide did not owe DII coverage under the personal injury provisions in \u201cCoverage B.\u201d We agree for the reasons stated above. Therefore, we overrule the first assignment of error on cross-appeal. The trial court held that Nationwide did not have to pay the judgment entered against DII. For the reasons stated above, we agree. Nationwide did not even owe a duty to defend DII under the policy. Therefore, we overrule the second assignment of error on cross-appeal as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">V. Conclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">For the reasons stated above, the part of the trial court\u2019s judgment holding Nationwide liable for DII\u2019s defense costs and expenses is reversed in appeal No. C-940697, and the cause is remanded for the entry of judgment in Nationwide\u2019s favor in accordance with the terms of this opinion. The trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed as cross-appealed in appeal No. C-940729.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b338-11\">Gorman, P.J., and Marianna Brown Bettman, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-9\">.
