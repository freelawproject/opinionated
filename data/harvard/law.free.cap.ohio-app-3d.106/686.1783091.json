Because the trial court failed to credit James\u2019s sentence for time served in the juvenile detention facility, we reverse that aspect of his sentence. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">Because James has appealed only sentencing issues, and has transmitted to us only a transcript of the sentencing hearing, we have a limited record of the underlying facts. James was charged with attempted murder with a firearm specification after allegedly shooting Brad Stinnet in the head. At the time of the alleged incident, James was seventeen years old. Pursuant to Juv.R. 30, the juvenile court relinquished jurisdiction to the court of common pleas. Following a jury trial, James was convicted of the lesser included offense of assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">The trial court sentenced James to the statutory maximum of one hundred eighty days, and imposed the maximum fine of $1,000. At his sentencing hearing, James sought to receive credit for the time he had already served in the county jail and the juvenile detention facility. James further sought credit toward his fine at a rate of $30 per day for each day he had served in excess of his sentence. He made no claim as to his ability or willingness to pay the $1,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-13\">The trial court ordered that James be given credit for the thirty-one days he had served in the county jail. The trial court did not specify in James\u2019s record of conviction, however, that he had served one hundred seventy-nine days in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>juvenile detention pending disposition of the state\u2019s Juv.R. BO motion to transfer jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">James appeals and raises two assignments of error relating to this aspect of his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Assignment of Error I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">\u201cThe trial court committed error in failing and refusing to include in the appellant\u2019s record of conviction the number of days he was confined in the juvenile detention center contrary to R.C. \u00a7 2949.08 and in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">James contends that, pursuant to R.C. 2949.08, the trial court should have specified in his record of conviction that he had served one hundred seventy-nine days in the juvenile detention facility, so that he could receive credit against his sentence. R.C. 2949.08 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-9\">\u201c(B) The record of the person\u2019s conviction shall specify the total number of days, if any, that the person was confined for any reason arising out of the offense for which he was convicted and sentenced prior to delivery to the jailer or keeper under this section. The record shall be used to determine any reduction of sentence under division (C) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-10\">\u201c(C) The jailer, administrator, or keeper in charge of a jail or workhouse shall reduce the sentence of a person delivered into his custody pursuant to division (A) of this section by the total number of days the prisoner was confined for any reason arising out of the offense for which the prisoner was convicted and sentenced * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">It is undisputed that the one hundred seventy-nine days James spent in the juvenile detention facility arose out of the offense for which he was convicted and sentenced. The only question is whether confinement in a juvenile detention facility constitutes \u201cconfinement\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2949.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">The state argues that R.C. 2949.08 applies only to time served in a jail, not to time served in a juvenile detention facility. We disagree. Such a narrow construction of R.C. 2949.08 is contrary to its plain language. The statute does not confine its operation to particular facilities such as jails, prisons or workhouses. The focus of the statute is on \u201cconfinement,\u201d which is followed by the broad modifier \u201cfor any reason.\u201d The statute was obviously intended to encompass a wide range of situations and facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">R.C. 2949.08(C) enumerates some examples of \u201cconfinement\u201d: \u201cconfinement in lieu of bail while awaiting trial, confinement for examination to determine his competence to stand trial or to determine sanity, and confinement while awaiting transportation to the place where he is to serve his sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The Supreme Court of Ohio has concluded from these examples that \u201cconfinement\u201d requires such a restraint on the offender\u2019s freedom of movement that he cannot leave official custody of his own volition. See <em>State v. Nagle </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 185, 186-187, 23 OBR 348, 349, 492 N.E.2d 158, 159-160. As James was unable to leave juvenile detention of his own volition, he was confined within the meaning of R.C. 2949.08, and he should have received credit for the one hundred seventy-nine days he served in that facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The trial court committed reversible error by failing to specify this confinement in James\u2019s record of conviction or to order that James\u2019s sentence be reduced accordingly. The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Assignment of Error II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">\u201cThe trial court committed error in failing and refusing to give appellant credit at the rate of thirty dollars ($30.00) per day for each day he has served over the maximum sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">James contends that he is entitled, pursuant to R.C. 2947.14, to credit at a rate of $30 per day for each day he served in excess of one hundred eighty days. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">R.C.'2947.14 and its predecessor, R.C. 2947.20, were enacted to provide the courts with a mechanism for collecting fines from offenders who refuse to pay. <em>Alliance v. Kelly </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 133, 134, 548 N.E.2d 952, 953. The statute basically provides that if a fine is imposed as part of a sentence and if the court determines that the offender is able to pay but refuses to do so, the court may order the offender confined until the fine is paid. The statute explicitly contemplates that imprisonment will follow a refusal to pay the fin\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">R.C. 2947.14(D) mandates credit toward the offender\u2019s fine, at a rate of $30 per day, only if he has been imprisoned \u201cpursuant to this section.\u201d No person will be considered held in custody in satisfaction of a fine \u201cexcept as provided in this section.\u201d Therefore, unless James was explicitly imprisoned for the purpose of satisfying his fine, he is not entitled to the corresponding credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">The time James served in the juvenile detention facility was prior to sentencing, so he obviously was not ordered to serve this time in satisfaction of his fine. In fact, even at the time of sentencing, there was no issue raised as to James\u2019s ability or willingness to pay the $1,000 fine. As James was not confined pursuant to R.C. 2947.14, he is not entitled to credit toward his fine. The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded to the extent that the court failed to order that James\u2019s sentence be reduced by the time served in juvenile detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b725-6\">Baird, P.J., and Dickinson, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
