Farmers raises three assignments of error. We find merit in the second assignment of error and, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">On December 29,1992, James Makary fatally shot his wife, Barbara Makary, at their apartment. As a result of the shooting, Barbara\u2019s estate brought a wrongful death suit against James. At the time of the shooting, Barbara and James were the named insureds on a renters\u2019 insurance policy issued by Farmers. Barbara\u2019s estate and James each claimed that the shooting was accidental and, therefore, an \u201coccurrence\u201d covered by the renters\u2019 policy. Farmers denied coverage, and a declaratory judgment action was instituted to determine whether Farmers had a duty to indemnify and defend James in the estate\u2019s wrongful death suit. The trial court determined that Farmers had a duty to indemnify and defend. Farmers appeals from that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-15\">In the second assignment of error, Farmers claims that, pursuant to the resident exclusion in the personal liability coverage, it does not have a duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>indemnify and defend James in the wrongful death suit because Barbara was a resident of the insured premises. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">With regard to personal liability claims brought against an insured, the renters\u2019 policy states that Farmers does not cover an insured\u2019s liability for bodily injury \u201cto any resident of the residence premises[.]\u201d As defined in the policy, James and Barbara\u2019s apartment was the \u201cresidence premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Unlike the term \u201cresidence premises,\u201d the term \u201cresident\u201d is not defined in the policy. In the absence of a policy definition, the term must be given its plain and ordinary meaning. A \u201cresident\u201d is a person who lives in a place \u201cfor a period of some duration or regularity, although not necessarily there permanently, but excludes a temporary or transient visitor.\u201d <em>Farmers Ins. of Columbus, Inc. v. Taylor </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App.3d 68, 70, 528 N.E.2d 968, 969. See, also, <em>Brooks v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co. </em>(July 20, 1994), Summit App. No. 16639, unreported, at 8, 1994 WL 376768.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The parties stipulated that Barbara lived with James at their apartment \u201ccontinuously\u201d from the date of their marriage (October 31, 1992) to the date of the shooting (December 29, 1992). In light of this stipulation, Barbara was a resident of the residence premises. Since the estate\u2019s wrongful death claim seeks recovery for bodily injury to a resident of the residence premises, there is no possibility of coverage pursuant to the resident exclusion, and Farmers does not have a duty to indemnify and defend James as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Despite the clear and unambiguous language in the resident exclusion, the trial court read an ambiguity into the policy. First, the trial court acknowledged that \u201cat the time of the \u25a0 occurrence, [Barbara\u2019s] occupancy would satisfy the ordinary meaning of the word resident.\u201d Nevertheless, the trial court determined that the term \u201cresident\u201d in the personal liability exclusion, when considered with other provisions in the policy, required \u201ca more narrow definition\u201d than the plain and ordinary meaning of the word. The trial court reached this conclusion based on an unrelated resident exclusion found in a separate part of the policy, the medical payments coverage. Because the resident exclusion in the medical payments coverage contained additional and varied language, the trial court concluded that the resident exclusion in the personal liability coverage was \u201csubject to more than one interpretation.\u201d As a result, the trial court adopted an interpretation that favored the insured and found that Farmers had a duty to indemnify and defend.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The cardinal rule for applying the terms in an insurance policy is well settled: if the terms in the policy are clear and unambiguous, those terms must be applied to the facts without engaging in any construction. <em>Santana v. Auto Owners Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 490, 494, 632 N.E.2d 1308, 1311. Therefore, when the policy terms have a plain and ordinary meaning, it is not necessary or permissible for a court to construe a different meaning. <em>Ambrose v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 797, 800, 592 N.E.2d 868, 870. Stated another way, \u201cthe plain meaning of unambiguous language will be enforced as written.\u201d <em>Mehl v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 550, 554, 607 N.E.2d 897, 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The terms in the personal liability resident exclusion are clear and unambiguous. Furthermore, the word \u201cresident\u201d has a plain and ordinary meaning, and, as the trial court noted, \u201c[Barbara\u2019s] occupancy would satisfy the ordinary meaning of the word resident.\u201d Having found that Barbara\u2019s occupancy would satisfy the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cresident,\u201d the trial court should not have given the word a more restrictive meaning. The trial court gave the word \u201cresident\u201d a more restrictive meaning because it read the personal liability exclusion in conjunction with the medical payments exclusion and construed an ambiguity. Such a reading of the policy was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">As a general rule, insurance policies must be examined in their entirety. See <em>Zanco v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 114, 115-116, 464 N.E.2d 513, 514-515. Accordingly, a proper reading of an insurance policy generally cannot be accomplished by relying on one provision to the exclusion of others. <em>Natl. Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Shane &amp; Shane Co., L.P.A. </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 765, 769, 605 N.E.2d 1325, 1327. See, also, <em>Wurth v. Ideal Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio App.3d 325, 329, 518 N.E.2d 607, 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\"> Despite the general rule, this court has recognized that the structure and punctuation used by the insurer in drafting the policy must be considered along with the words. <em>Mandat v. Reinecker\u2019s Bakery </em>(Dec. 15, 1993), Summit App. No. 16241, unreported, at 5, 1993 WL 526653, citing <em>Reeder v. Cetnarowski </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 90, 92, 547 N.E.2d 376, 378. Furthermore, the titles the insurer has chosen for its policy sections and subsections should also be considered when reading the policy. See <em>Wurth, </em>34 Ohio App.3d at 330, 518 N.E.2d at 612. Finally, an insurance policy, like any other contract, must be given a reasonable reading consistent with the structure of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>The policy terms at issue in this appeal are found in the \u201cExclusions\u201d section of the policy. The \u201cExclusions\u201d section is divided into separate and distinct subsections. The personal liability resident exclusion is found in a self-contained subsection entitled \u201cApplying To Coverage E \u2014 Personal Liability.\u201d The title of the subsection is clear and unambiguous, and it is conspicuously printed in bold print. From the title of the subsection and the structure of the policy, a reasonable insured would expect that the exclusions in the personal liability subsection applied only to the personal liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The medical payments resident exclusion is located in a separate and unrelated subsection entitled \u201cApplying To Coverage F \u2014 Medical Payments to Others.\u201d The title of the subsection is clear and unambiguous, and it is conspicuously printed in bold print. From the title of the subsection and the structure of the policy, a reasonable insured would expect that the exclusions in the medical payments subsection applied only to the medical payments coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Because the personal liability resident exclusion is clear and unambiguous and located in a self-contained subsection of the policy, the trial court erred in reading the personal liability exclusion in conjunction with the medical payments exclusion, which is located in a separate and <em>unrelated </em>subsection of the policy. By reading the two separate and unrelated exclusions in conjunction, the trial court ignored the obvious structure of the policy and did not give the policy a reasonable reading consistent with that structure. Furthermore, the trial court engaged in construction of clear and unambiguous policy language. Again, if policy language is clear and unambiguous, \u201cthere is no occasion for construction, and courts may not indulge themselves in enlarging the contract.\u201d <em>Longpre v. Midwest Optical Supply, Inc. </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 198, 200, 587 N.E.2d 948, 949. Since there was no reason for construction, the trial court should not have indulged in construing the two unrelated exclusions. Rather, the trial court should have simply applied the personal liability resident exclusion to the facts without engaging in any construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">As discussed previously, the stipulated facts establish that Barbara Makary was a resident of the insured premises when she was fatally shot by her husband James. Applying the clear and unambiguous language in the personal liability resident exclusion to these facts, we conclude that Farmers does not have a duty to indemnify and defend James as a matter of law. The second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Because of our disposition of the second assignment of error, we do not need to address the remaining assignments of error. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded to' the trial court to enter judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Slaby and Wise, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b185-5\">John W.

The medical payments resident exclusion states that Farmers does not cover medical expenses that result from bodily injury \"[t]o you or any resident of your residence premises[J\u201d As defined in the policy, \"you\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d mean \"the \u2018named insured\u2019 * * * and spouse if a resident of the same household.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The personal liability resident exclusion does not contain the terms \u201cyou\u201d and \"your.\u201d The trial court found that the omission of these terms indicated \"an intention to treat the named insured different from a mere resident.\u201d Thus, the trial court concluded that the word \"resident\u201d in the personal liability exclusion was to be read narrowly and did not apply to residents, like Barbara, who were also named insureds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
