The court determined that defendant had flushed cat litter down the toilet, that the litter had caused a blockage in the building\u2019s sewer line and that the blockage and resulting flood had caused the damage. The court also determined that the damage was the result of defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">The lease provided for additional rent in paragraph 8, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">Tenant shall at his own cost and expense take good care of the premises and shall repair to the satisfaction of the Landlord all damage and injury thereto, resulting from misuse or neglect and at the end or other expiration of the term deliver up the premises in good order and condition. All injury caused by moving any property into, in or out of the building and all damage caused by overflow or escape of water, gas, steam, electricity or other substance due to the negligence of the Tenant or his family, agents, servants or visitors, shall be repaired by the Landlord at the Tenant\u2019s expense. <em>The cost thereof shall be determined on statements rendered by Landlord to Tenant and the sum so determined shall be payable to Landlord upon delivery of such statement, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>and if not paid within 10 days thereafter, the same shall become so much additional rent for the succeeding month, payable with the installment of rent next becoming due, and collectable as such.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Defendant\u2019s base rent was $302.39 per month. The additional $1,640 in damages escalated defendant\u2019s rent to $1,942.39 for the month after defendant had become ten days in arrears of her obligation to pay damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Defendant now appeals from a judgment for possession, contending that the finding that she had been negligent was contrary to the weight of the evidence and that the additional rent was not lawfully \u201cdue and owing\u201d because it was imposed in violation of the rent control ordinance of the City of Newark.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Defendant\u2019s contention that the finding of negligence is not supported by the evidence is clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(A). We conclude, however, that the additional rent was not authorized in the rent control ordinance and, therefore, it was not due and owing as rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">The ordinance provides in \u00a7 15:9B-15:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">No landlord shall after the effective date of this chapter charge any rent in excess of what he was receiving from the effective date of this chapter <em>except for increases authorized by the chapter. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">The ordinance defines rent in \u00a7 15:9B-2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-12\">Rent means the consideration, including any bonus, benefits or gratuity demanded or received for or, in connection with, the use or occupancy of housing space or the transfer of a lease of such housing space, including but not limited to monies demanded or paid for parking, pets, the use of furniture, subletting, security deposits and damage and cleaning deposits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">Section 15:9B-3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-14\">The establishment of rents between a landlord and tenant in all housing spaces shall hereafter be determined by the provisions of this chapter. At the expiration of a lease or at the termination of the lease of a periodic tenant, no landlord may request or receive a percentage increase in rent which is greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>than <em>5% </em>for dwellings of 49 units or less, or 4% for dwellings of 50 units or more, without first petitioning the rent control board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">The rents for any housing space shall not be increased more than the percentages seated above in any consecutive 12-month period irrespective of the number of different tenants occupying said housing space during said 12-month period, any change of ownership of the landlord or vacancy of the housing space.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The ordinance also provides that it \u201cshall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes thereof\u201d Section 15:9B-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">We begin with the uncontroverted fact that plaintiff, the landlord, has defined damages as \u201cadditional rent\u201d in its lease and has characterized the damages as rent under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1a. We are reluctant to permit plaintiff to establish jurisdiction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1a by characterizing certain damages as rent and in the same proceeding to deny that the charge sought to be enforced is rent under the rent control ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">We also note that the ordinance\u2019s definition of rent, liberally construed, is broad enough to include plaintiff\u2019s damages claim. Among other things, rent is defined as \u201cthe consideration ... demanded ... for, or in connection with, the use or occupancy of housing space.\u201d Rent also includes \u201cmonies demanded ... for ... damage and cleaning deposits.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s characterization, in its lease, of its entitlement to damages as \u201cso much additional rent for the succeeding months ... and collectable as such\u201d seemingly qualifies under the ordinance as money demanded for the \u201cuse or occupancy of housing space.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Other sections of the ordinance are instructive regarding probable legislative intent. Section 15:9B-5 authorizes the landlord to impose a tax surcharge occasioned by increased property taxes, but only after an orderly procedure and approval by the rent control board. Payment of the surcharge is in \u201cequal monthly payments\u201d over a twelve-month period. Tax decreases are to be passed on to the tenant, but control board approval is not required. Section 15:9B-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Similarly, \u00a7 15:9B-16 authorizes surcharges, subject to the approval of the rent control board, when certain utility expenses have increased more than 10% over the previous twelvemonth period. However, this surcharge shall not exceed 15% for apartments containing 30 or fewer units, 5% for apartments with between 31 and 200 units and 3% for apartments with 201 units or more. The ordinance also authorizes rental increases for capital improvements, \u00a7 15:9B-7, and for \u201clandlord hardships,\u201d \u00a7 15:9B-8. The ordinance does not authorize rent increases based on damages caused by a tenant. However, there is an absolute prohibition against rental increases \u201cexceeding 25% in any one year for any tenant.\u201d Section 15:9B-21. The limit was imposed because the municipal legislature recognized that \u201can immediate rent increase of more than 25% above the prior monthly rent may be considered unconscionable and impose a hardship on a tenant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Newark\u2019s ordinance creates a comprehensive scheme for the control of consideration demanded for the use and occupancy of housing space. In those circumstances in which increased rents are permitted, the ordinance resorts to caps and oversight by the rent control board. Moreover, the ordinance recognizes that immediate increases in the amounts tenants are required to pay exceeding 25% are \u201cunconscionable and impose a hardship.\u201d In the present case, the landlord has imposed an increase from one month to another of approximately 600%, in default of which the tenant has been dispossessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Liberally construing the ordinance, we conclude that collection of the damages in this case as rent under the lease violates the rent control ordinance and, therefore, the court lacked jurisdiction to enter a judgment of possession under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1a. <em>See Chau v. Cardillo, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>378, 384, 594 <em>A.</em>2d 1334 (App.Div.1991); <em>Housing Auth. of Passaic v. Torres, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>231, 236, 362 A.2d 1254 (App.Div.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Plaintiff also had sought a judgment for possession based on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1c, which authorizes dispossession when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>tenant \u201chas wilfully or by reason of gross negligence caused or allowed destruction, damage or injury to the premises.\u201d Plaintiff has also appealed from the judgment dismissing this complaint contending that the trial court erred in \u201cholding that the acceptance of November and December rents ... constituted a waiver of Ivy Hill\u2019s rights to obtain a judgment for possession.\u201d We conclude that the issue is moot because the trial court also determined that defendant had not acted willfully or committed an act of gross negligence, a ruling not challenged by plaintiff on its cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The judgment for possession is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-15\">Defendant does not contend that damages cannot constitute rent within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1a. <em>See Fargo Realty, Inc. v. Harris, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>262, 265-267, 414 A.2d 256 (App.Div.1980) (tenant\u2019s failure to pay damages defined as rent in lease entitles landlord to judgment for possession).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
