This error requires reversal and remand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b76-17\">The case arose out of defendant\u2019s admitted stabbing of Angela Gaines on April 28, 1988. During the Spring of 1988, Angela Gaines was living with defendant in an apartment at 46-D Spruce Street in Newark. Three children were also living with them at the time: Lateefah, then age nine; Aja, then age five; and six-week old Charissa. Defendant was Aja\u2019s father; Lateefah characterized him as her \u201cstepfather.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Lateefah testified to an incident which occurred about two months prior to Angela\u2019s death when Angela was eight or nine months pregnant with Charissa. At approximately ten or eleven o\u2019clock in the evening, defendant and Angela were in their bedroom. Angela was on the bed and defendant was asleep on the floor. Angela, Lateefah and Aja began \u201cpulling\u201d defendant in order to wake him up to watch television with them. Defendant became angry and started \u201cpushing\u201d Angela. At this point, Cynthia Skelton, Angela\u2019s sister, arrived at the house to speak to defendant. Skelton and Angela tried to awaken defendant to no avail. The doorbell rang and Skelton went downstairs to answer it. As she went back upstairs, she \u201cheard them fighting.\u201d Defendant was hitting Angela and she was fighting back. Lateefah testified that defendant pushed Angela causing her to fall over a bicycle. Skelton tried to break up the fight and defendant started swinging at both of them. Skelton went downstairs to get a frying pan and when she returned, Angela \u201cwas down on the floor and [defendant] was kicking and punching her\u201d on her torso. While she was trying to break up the fight, defendant hit Skelton in the mouth, loosening her tooth. Skelton struck defendant with the frying pan on the back of the head, and defendant stopped hitting Angela. At that point, as defendant was leaving the bedroom, Skelton asked him why he fought with Angela when she was pregnant with his child. Defendant responded that \u201cthe little son-of-a-bitch wasn\u2019t his anyway.\u201d Lateefah testified that she saw defendant hit Skelton in the mouth and that she saw Skelton hit him with the frying pan. Skelton testified that Aja was in bed when this occurred and, at some point, Lateefah ran and locked herself in the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Lateefah, along with Lorraine Baker (who lives in an apartment at 50-A Spruce Street in Newark), also testified concerning an incident which occurred on April 14, 1988, two weeks before Angela was stabbed. Shortly before 7:00 a.m., an argument erupted between defendant and Angela after she accused him of stealing two $500 money orders which she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>kept in a dictionary. Lateefah testified that the two came downstairs and were \u201cpushing and punching and hitting each other and pushing each other on the floor.\u201d Defendant then punched Angela in the head and she fell to the floor. As Angela lay on the floor crying and bleeding, defendant sat her up and told her not to go to sleep but did not help her with the cut on her head and did not call the doctor. Rather, Angela told Lateefah to go to Baker\u2019s house to call an ambulance. Baker testified that Lateefah came to her apartment at approximately 7:00 a.m. and said that she wanted to use the phone to call an ambulance for her mother who had been hit in the head. Baker called the ambulance and then returned with Lateefah to the apartment. When Baker and Lateefah returned to the apartment, Lateefah observed that \u201cstuff was all out and the table was turned upside down ... and [Angela] was sitting there and there was a big patch of blood on the floor.\u201d Baker testified that when she arrived, defendant was sitting on the couch with Charissa in his arms and was not trying to help in any way. Baker testified that as Angela was laying on the floor with blood \u201cgushing out of her head,\u201d she called out to her. When Baker asked her \u201cwhat was the matter,\u201d Angela told her that defendant had hit her. Baker then told defendant to leave because she thought that the police would be arriving soon. The ambulance came and took Angela to the hospital where she received stitches to close a laceration. Baker stayed with the children until Angela\u2019s mother arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Baker testified that she spoke to defendant on the telephone a couple of hours later when he called to ask how Angela was doing. Defendant explained to her what had happened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">\"He told me that Angie had the table in front of the door and she asked him for her money. She accused him of [stealing] the money and all of a sudden, he told me that she picked up something, what, and then he just snapped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Baker testified on cross-examination that she saw Angela and defendant the following night in the apartment together and that they were \u201cgetting high.\u201d Lateefah testified on cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>examination that at the time of both of these incidents, her mother had been drinking \"a little bit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Catherine Gaines, Angela\u2019s mother, testified that on April 27, 1988, Angela had called her at work to ask her to bring her some money which she needed to pay her bills. Catherine Gaines brought $500 to her daughter at her apartment and that was the last time that she saw Angela alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">On the same date, Lorraine Baker and Angela went food shopping together. When they returned, Angela gave Baker either $300 or $500 to hold for her. Baker put the money under the rug in her bedroom. The next time Baker saw Angela was at approximately 3:00 a.m. on April 28, 1988 when she came over to get some of the money that she had earlier given to Baker. Angela went up to Baker\u2019s bedroom, woke her up and told her that she needed some money. Angela took some of the money and left. On cross-examination, Baker testified that Angela appeared to be high and possibly drunk when she came over to get the money that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Lateefah and Aja were awakened sometime between 5:00 and 6:00 a.m. when they heard defendant and Angela arguing in their bedroom. Defendant and Angela then proceeded downstairs to the living room where Lateefah and Aja followed them and observed them pushing and punching each other. Lateefah picked up Charissa, who was already downstairs. Lateefah testified on cross-examination that she took Charissa from Angela during the fight. Defendant pushed Angela to the floor and dragged her into the kitchen. Lateefah and Aja began crying and tried to pull Angela back but defendant told them to \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cget off.\u201d The children stood by the kitchen door while defendant sat on top of Angela, \u201creached up and got two knives in each hand ... [fjrom a wooden thing sitting on top of the cabinet\u201d At this point, Lateefah was not looking because she was \u201cscared\u201d and \u201ccried over [her] little baby sister.\u201d A \u201ccouple of seconds\u201d after she saw him grab the knife, she heard Aja scream that \u201che stabbed her.\u201d Aja testified that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>saw defendant stab Angela once in the right side of the stomach area and then she screamed and cried. Defendant then turned off the light, told the children to go upstairs, and laid on the floor saying, \u201cI\u2019m blind, \u201cI\u2019m blind.\u201d Lateefah asked defendant five times to call the hospital and although he told her that he would, he never did. Lateefah stated that she came downstairs again after 15 minutes and her mother\u2019s body was still lying on the kitchen floor and defendant was \u201casleep on the floor.\u201d Lateefah testified on cross-examination that both Angela and defendant had been drinking earlier that day. She stated that her mother was drinking \u201csome malt liquor and some MD 500.\u201d Terry Kern, who lives at 46-A Spruce Street, testified that at approximately 3:35 a.m., on April 28, he \u201cheard Angela or someone saying don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t do it. Shortly thereafter [he] heard a short scream and then the scream was over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Lateefah and Aja did not go to school for three or four days and defendant told them to stay upstairs. Lateefah left the house once to get some butter from Lorraine Baker. Angela\u2019s body remained on the kitchen floor for approximately two days until Cynthia Skelton\u2019s daughter, Sadequa (aged 16 at the time of trial) came over to visit. Just before Sadequa arrived, defendant \u201cstuffed\u201d Angela\u2019s body in the downstairs closet. Aja watched as defendant put her mother\u2019s body in the closet. Defendant told Lateefah what he had done. When Sadequa arrived, defendant took Aja to the store and told Lateefah and Sadequa to go upstairs. He told Lateefah not to say anything to Sadequa.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Lorraine Baker testified that on April 28,1988 (the day of the stabbing) she was supposed to meet Angela at 9:00 a.m., and when Angela didn\u2019t arrive, she attempted to ring the doorbell throughout the day, but there was no answer. The next day, at approximately 3:00 p.m., defendant arrived at Baker\u2019s apartment. Baker asked where Angela had been and defendant responded that he and the children had gone to the movies and that Angela had gone to the clinic. Defendant then asked if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Angela was at Baker\u2019s apartment and Baker said no. At this point, Sadequa (who was already at Baker\u2019s apartment) and Baker tried calling Angela\u2019s mother to see if she was at her house. Sadequa then left with defendant. Baker made repeated attempts to see if Angela was home but on each occasion defendant came to the door and said she was not home. One time, Baker saw defendant standing between the buildings. Defendant asked Baker to tell Angela that they were home, if she called. Baker did not see Lateefah and Aja until the morning of April 30, 1988 when she borrowed Angela\u2019s car to go food shopping. That afternoon, defendant asked Baker to borrow some butter. Before she had a chance to bring it over, defendant sent Lateefah to the house to get it. When Lateefah got there, she showed Baker her arm and said she had ringworm and that that was why she was out of school.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">At approximately 2:00 a.m. on Sunday, May 1, 1988, Baker went to Angela\u2019s apartment because Angela\u2019s mother, Cynthia Skelton, her husband, and Sadequa had come by looking for Angela. Angela\u2019s mother testified that she had been trying to get in touch with Angela since she last saw her. After a couple of days, Skelton called her to say that Angela was missing. When they arrived, defendant answered the door, putting his clothes on as he did so. When Angela\u2019s mother asked him where Angela was, he first said that she went to the doctor and hadn\u2019t returned; next he stated that she was at her girlfriend\u2019s; and when the mother didn\u2019t believe him, he stated that he didn\u2019t know where she was. Angela\u2019s mother threatened to call the police. Skelton told Sadequa to go upstairs and get the children because she was taking them with her. Angela\u2019s mother began to search the apartment while defendant continued to get dressed. She also asked Lateefah and Aja where their mother was and they responded that they did not know. She found Angela\u2019s coat, handbag and shoes behind the sofa in the living room and then went upstairs and asked Aja again where her mother was. Aja told her that Angela was in the downstairs closet. She started to search the closet and defendant ran out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>of the apartment. She found Angela\u2019s body piled under things in the closet. Baker\u2019s father-in-law, Jerome Baker, called the police. Lateefah and Aja were taken to stay with Cynthia Skelton and her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Officer Howard Adams was the desk officer at the Franklin Street police station on May 1, 1988. He testified that at approximately 3:00 a.m., defendant entered the police station and stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">[H]e was walking past [46-D] Spruce Street when he found at that location, he found a door slightly opened. He went inside and he discovered a Miss Angela Gaines lying down on the kitchen floor with blood coming from the mouth area. He further stated that there were some kids inside crying so he removed the kids to a Lorraine\u2019s house____ He stated that Miss Gaines was an old friend of his and he just stopped by for a visit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">Officer Adams dispatched a radio car to the location, made a report of the conversation and asked a detective, Detective Blue, to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">Detective William Thomas of the Newark Police Homicide Squad responded to 46-D Spruce Street at approximately 3:30 a.m. When he arrived, he found the family of Angela Gaines in the apartment and Angela\u2019s body in the closet. He also observed blood on the floor and walls of the apartment and seized a butcher block that contained five utensils.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">Meanwhile, defendant spoke to Detective Curtis A. Blue in the Newark Police Department Night Detective Bureau. Detective Blue testified that he spoke first and asked defendant, \u201cwhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cI want to get this off my conscience. I killed my wife.\u201d Detective Blue advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and then, according to Detective Blue, defendant \u201cfurther stated he knew his rights and that he wanted to clear his conscience and that he killed his wife.\u201d Defendant told the detective that he killed his wife on April 28,1988 and that her body could be found at 46-D Spruce Street in the closet. He told the detective that her name was Angela Gaines and that he had stabbed her to death. Detective Blue read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights again and once he verified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>that a homicide had taken place at 46-D Spruce Street, placed defendant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">When Detective Thomas returned to the police station, he read defendant his rights; defendant waived his rights and gave a formal statement. When asked what happened to Angela Gaines, defendant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">I had laid down and went to sleep and she came upstairs and started screaming at me about her car. I told her it was in the back. I was drunk at the time, I had drunk a half of a fifth of Mad Dog 20/20 and a six-pack of beer. Then she started scratching me on the side of my face. While I was asleep, she had thrown beer across the bed on me. I told her to calm down, the car was in the back. Then she started getting really frantic and grabbed up the baby, Charisa, and started towards the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">She had her coat on. When she comes drunk, she always grabs Charisa. I told her to put Charisa down and I called my oldest daughter and told her to take Charisa. She wouldn\u2019t let my daughter go, so I grabbed her wrist and took the baby from her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">I held her arms up and my daughter, Lateefah, took the baby and went upstairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Further, he stated to the detective:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-11\">It was Thursday morning, April 28th, 1988. She was already drunk from about ten p.m. that night. After Lateefah took the baby from her, I told her I was tired of this. Ever since the baby was bom, all we do is argue. Then something just snapped in my head. She was already on the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-12\">I don\u2019t know if she had slipped or not, but there was some knives on the floor. Then I went into the living room and laid on the floor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">He added that, \u201csince March 16th, she would always come in the house drunk and argue everyday.\u201d When asked if the statement was the truth, defendant responded, \u201cYes, it wasn\u2019t intentional. Something just snapped in my head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">An autopsy revealed that the cause of Angela\u2019s death was a stab wound to the right anterior chest with hemorrhage. Dr. Karabi Sinha, the pathologist who performed an autopsy on Angela, testified that he observed two other slits in Angela\u2019s sweater and jacket which did not \u201cmatch\u201d the body wound. The autopsy also revealed that Angela had no defense wounds on her hands or forearms. The toxicology report revealed that Angela Gaines had a blood alcohol content of .22 at the time of death and that there was \u201csome amount of cocaine in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>blood.\u201d (.02 milligram per liter). Based on the foregoing evidence, the jury found defendant guilty on all counts of the indictment. Defendant made a motion for a new trial which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The State made a pretrial motion to allow Aja and Lateefah to testify by way of closed circuit television. The motion was made pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-32.4 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">a. In prosecutions for aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, criminal sexual contact, or child abuse, or in any action alleging an abused or neglected child under P.L.1974, <em>c. </em>119 <em>(C. </em>9:6-8.21 <em>et seq.), </em>the court may, on motion and after conducting a hearing in camera, order the taking of the testimony of a witness on closed circuit television at the trial, out of the view of the jury, defendant, or spectators upon making findings as provided in subsection b. of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">b. An order under this section may be made only if the court finds that the witness is 16 years of age or younger and that there is a substantial likelihood that the witness would suffer severe emotional or mental distress if required to testify in open court. The order shall be specific as to whether the witness will testify outside the presence of spectators, the defendant, the jury, or all of them and shall be based on specific findings relating to the impact of the presence of each.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">c. A motion seeking closed circuit testimony under subsection a. of this section may be filed by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">(1) The victim or witness or the victim\u2019s or witness\u2019s attorney, parent or legal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">guardian;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">(2) The prosecutor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-13\">(3) The defendant or the defendant\u2019s counsel; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-14\">(4) The trial judge on the judge\u2019s own motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-15\">d. The defendant\u2019s counsel shall be present at the taking of testimony in camera. If the defendant is not present, he and his attorney shall be able to confer privately with each other during the testimony by a separate audio system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-16\">e. If testimony is taken on closed circuit television pursuant to the provisions of this act, a stenographic recording of that testimony shall also be required. A typewritten transcript of that testimony shall be included in the record on appeal. The closed circuit testimony itself shall not constitute part of the record on appeal except on motion for good cause shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-17\">The trial judge held a hearing at which the State offered the testimony of Susan Esquilin, Ph.D who was received by the court as an expert in the field of child psychology. Dr. Esquilin opined that the children would suffer severe emotional or mental distress if required to testify in open court. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>judge ruled that defendant\u2019s right to confrontation under the United States and New Jersey constitutions would not be violated by permitting the prospective child witnesses to testify by way of closed circuit television; that the statute, \u201cas a rule of evidence, [did] not supplant preexisting decisional law concerning the protection of children in the court atmosphere;\u201d and that the children fell within the protection of the statute. The judge also concluded that based on the expert testimony, \u201cthe State ... met its burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that there is a substantial likelihood that\u201d Aja and Lateefah \u201cwould suffer either severe emotional or mental distress if required to testify in the presence of the defendant in open court concerning\u201d the death of Angela Gaines.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Pursuant to this ruling, Lateefah and Aja were permitted to testify on closed circuit television in the judge\u2019s chambers with both counsel present. The live testimony was simultaneously transmitted orally and visually to both the jury and defendant. Defendant was located in another judge\u2019s cell block with a monitor and a second attorney to assist in securing the right of cross-examination. The jury was given the impression that defendant was in chambers with the witnesses during the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The right of an accused to be confronted by the witnesses against him is protected by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and by the Constitution of New Jersey. <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend VI; <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, \u00b610; <em>see also, State in the Interest of B.F., </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>153, 158, 553 A.2d 40 (App.Div.1989); <em>State v. Washington, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187, 191, 494 A.2d 335 (App.Div.1985). The Sixth Amendment provides two types of protection for a criminal defendant: \u201c \u2018the right physically to face those who testify against him, and the right to conduct cross-examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coy v. Iowa, </em>487 <em>U.S. </em>1012, 1017, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>2798, 2801, 101 L.Ed.2d 857, 864 (1988) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>39, 51, <em>107 S.Ct. </em>989, 998, 94 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 40, 53 (1987)). \u201c[T]here is something deep in human nature that regards face-to-face confrontation between accused and accuser as \u2018essential to a fair trial in a criminal prosecution.\u2019\u201d <em>Coy v. Iowa, </em>487 <em>U.S. </em>at 1017, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2801, 101 L.Ed.2d at 865 (quoting <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>400, 404, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1065, 1068, 13 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>923, 926 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In <em>Coy, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation was violated where, in a prosecution for two counts of lascivious acts with a child, the trial court approved the use of a large screen to be placed between defendant and the witness stand during the victims\u2019 testimony. (The screen enabled the defendant to see the witnesses but the witnesses could not see him at all.) 487 <em>U.S. </em>at 1020-22, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2803, 101 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 866-67. The Court rejected the State\u2019s argument that the procedure was sanctioned by a statute which created a presumption of trauma to the child and held that defendant\u2019s right to confrontation was violated where there had been no individualized findings that the particular victims needed special protection. <em>Id. </em>at 1021, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2803,101 L.Ed.2d at 867. Noting that \u201ca literal meaning of the [Confrontation] Clause\u201d yields \u201ca right to <em>meet face to face </em>all those who appear and give evidence <em>at trial,\" id., </em>at 1021, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2803,101 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 867 (quoting <em>California v. Green, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>149, 175, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1930, 1943-44, 26 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>489, 506 (1970) (emphasis in original)), Justice Scalia specifically stated: \u201cWe leave for another day, however, the question whether any exceptions exist. Whatever they may be, they would surely be allowed only when necessary to further an important public policy.\u201d 487 <em>U.S. </em>at 1021, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2803, 101 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">That day came in 1990 when the Supreme Court had an opportunity to face the question of exceptions in <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>836, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>3157, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990). There, the Court rejected a Sixth Amendment challenge to a Maryland statute which permitted an alleged victim of child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>abuse to testify at trial out of the presence of the judge, jury, and defendant, via one-way closed-circuit television. Similar to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-32.4, the Maryland statute required that the trial judge first make particularized findings that the child would suffer \u201cserious emotional distress such that the child cannot reasonably communicate\u201d if compelled to testify in front of the defendant. 497 <em>U.S. </em>at \u2014 , 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3161, 111 L.Ed.2d at 675. In upholding the constitutionality of the Maryland statute, the Court identified face-to-face confrontation as \u201c \u2018the core of the values furthered by the Confrontation Clause,\u2019\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u2014, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3164, 111 L.Ed.2d at 679 (quoting <em>California v. Green, supra, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>at 157, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1934, 26 L.Ed.2d at 496), but recognized nonetheless an exception to the face-to-face requirement in certain limited circumstances: \u201ca defendant\u2019s right to confront accusatory witnesses may be satisfied absent a physical, face-to-face confrontation at trial only where denial of such confrontation is necessary to further an important public policy and only where the reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>at \u2014, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3166, 111 L.Ed.2d at 682 (citations omitted). Thus, Maryland\u2019s statutorily enunciated interest in safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of child abuse victims was viewed as outweighing defendant\u2019s right to face-to-face confrontation where a finding of necessity was made by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3168-69, 111 L.Ed.2d at 684-85. Such a procedure \u201censures the accuracy of the testimony and preserves the adversary nature of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3169, 111 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 686. Based on <em>Craig, </em>the constitutionality of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-32.4 was affirmed in <em>State v. Crandall, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>649, 577 A.2d 483 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\"> In this case, the trial judge determined that the facts brought the witnesses within the intendment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-32.4 which prescribes that: \u201cIn prosecutions for aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, criminal sexual contact, or child abuse, or in any action alleging an abused or neglected child ...,\u201d the court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>permit the taking of testimony from child witnesses via closed circuit television. Defendant argues that this holding contravenes the statute. We agree. When a statute is unambiguous on its face, a court need not look beyond its terms to divine the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>State v. Churchdale Leasing, Inc., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>83, 101, 557 A.2d 277 (1989); <em>State v. Butler, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>220, 226, 445 A.2d 399 (1982). To be sure, there are cases in which something in the character or context of the legislation justifies according it a different meaning than would result from a literal reading. <em>Swiney v. Dept. of Treasury, Div. of Pensions, </em>84 <em>N.J.Super. </em>186, 192, 201 A.2d 392 (App.Div.1964). Here, however, there is nothing to suggest that a literal reading of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-32.4 would not be \u201cresponsive to the essential principle[s] of the law.\u201d <em>Alexander v. New Jersey Power &amp; Light Co., </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>373, 378, 122 A.2d 339 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The trial judge\u2019s conclusion as to the applicability of the statute is unwarranted because none of the enumerated offenses was involved; the children were not victims, and this was a murder prosecution not an action alleging abuse or neglect. Moreover, the legislative history of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-32.4 indicates that its purpose is \u201cto spare a youthful witness the ordeal of repeatedly discussing details of sexual assault or abuse,\u201d no more and no less. <em>Senate Judiciary Committee Statement </em>to L.1985, c. 126. <em>See also State v. Crandall, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 651, 577 A.2d 483 (\u201c[a] stated purpose of the statute is to protect young victims of criminal abuse from the effects of testifying in open court in the presence of the accused.\u201d). Thus, the Legislature clearly identified those cases in which a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation would give way to the need to protect child victims. If the Legislature had intended to include within the statute\u2019s protection to all cases involving potential trauma to child witnesses, it could easily have done so. Its omission speaks eloquently to the scope of the statutory coverage which plainly does not extend to this case. \u201c[W]hen all the world can see what sensible legislators in such a contingency would wish that we should do, we are not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>close our eyes as judges to what we must perceive as men.\u201d <em>N.J. Turnpike Employees Union v. N.J. Turnpike Auth., </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>48, 53, 490 A.2d 338 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>People v. Knapp, </em>230 <em>N.Y. </em>48, 63, 129 <em>N.E. </em>202, 208 (1920) (Cardozo, J.), <em>cert. denied, </em>256 <em>US. </em>702, 41 <em>S.Ct. </em>624, 65 <em>L.Ed. </em>1179 (1921)), <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>294, 501 A.2d 954 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The trial judge ruled alternatively that the statute \u201cdoes not supplant pre-existing decisional law concerning the protection of children in the court atmosphere.\u201d In like vein, the State here urges that notwithstanding the statutory limits, the trial judge\u2019s particularized findings that the denial of confrontation was necessary to further an important public policy met the standard of <em>Maryland v. Craig, supra. </em>Like the State, we agree that theoretically a policy interest sufficient to outweigh the right to physical confrontation may exist without the formality of statutory codification. However, when the Legislature has considered the issue of the protection of child witnesses and has delineated with precision those limited circumstances which, upon appropriate findings, will prevail over a defendant\u2019s right to face-to-face confrontation, that <em>is </em>the expression of the public policy of this state. We are not free to engraft onto it our own vision of what our public policy is, or should be. As the United States Supreme Court in <em>Craig </em>noted: \u201cwe will not second-guess the considered judgment of the [Maryland] Legislature regarding the importance of its interest in protecting child abuse victims from the emotional trauma of testifying.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Craig, supra, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>at \u2014, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3169, 111 L.Ed.2d at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Nothing in <em>State v. Bass, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>466, 535 A.2d 1 (App.Div.1987), <em>certif. denied, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>186, 540 A.2d 182 (1988) which reviewed proceedings prior to the enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-32.4 suggests an opposite result. There we were not constrained by any statute. Nevertheless, we took pains to explain that the facts of that case which involved allegations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>child abuse against the murder victim would fall within the provisions of the later enacted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-32.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Further, we take our direction from the Supreme Court decision in <em>State v. D.R., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>348, 537 A.2d 667 (1988) where the Court refused to sanction our creation of a new exception to the hearsay rule under <em>Evid.R. </em>5 which \u201cwould allow into evidence, under certain conditions, testimony of out-of-court statements made by a young child relating acts of sexual abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 537 A.2d 667. Although the Court approved of the \u201ctender years exception,\u201d it reversed on the grounds that the adoption of such a rule by judicial fiat is inappropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 375-76, 537 A.2d 667. Like the Supreme Court in <em>D.R., </em>we might well prefer a rule granting protection to child-witnesses in a more expansive class of cases, but we recognize that it is not for us to amend by judicial fiat the Legislature\u2019s statement of public policy on the subject. We thus reverse and remand this case for retrial at which Aja and Lateefah will, if called to testify, be present in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">This ruling makes it unnecessary for us to address the other issues raised by defendant. Nevertheless, we add these brief comments. On the remand, the trial judge should carefully assess the evidence adduced in light of defendant\u2019s claimed entitlement to an instruction on aggravated and reckless manslaughter and intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">It is well-settled that where the facts \u201cclearly indicate\u201d a rational basis on which to support a conviction of a lesser-included offense of the crime of murder, a trial court is obliged to instruct the jury as to the lesser-included offense even where not requested. <em>State v. Choice, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>295, 299, 486 A.2d 833 (1985) (quoting <em>State v. Powell, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>305, 318, 419 A.2d 406 (1980)). \u201c[Ejven very slight evidence on that theory will compel the instruction on a lesser offense.\u201d <em>State v. Bohannan, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>646, 649, 503 A.2d 396 (App.Div.1986) (citing <em>State v. Powell, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 317, 419 A.2d 406). As recently as</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>State v. Purnell, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>518, 601 A.2d 175 (1992), the Supreme Court reiterated the trial court\u2019s duty to instruct the jury as to the lesser-included offense of manslaughter where the facts \u201c \u2018clearly indicate\u2019 the appropriateness of that charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541, 601 A.2d 175 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">When the lesser-included offense charge is requested by a defendant, as in this case, the trial court is obligated, in view of defendant\u2019s interest, to examine the record thoroughly to determine if the rational-basis standard has been satisfied. [State <em>v. Crisantos (Arriagas), </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>265, 278, 508 A2d 167 (1986) (citing <em>State v. Powell, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 318-19, 419 A.2d 406; <em>State v. Choice, supra, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>at 298-99, 486 A.2d 833) ].</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\"> We think the evidence, as presented, which included a fight fueled by alcohol, no indication of pre-planning, a single stab wound and an allegation by defendant that he \u201csnapped\u201d was adequate to provide a rational basis for the lesser included aggravated and reckless charges. Likewise, there was evidence of significant alcohol use by defendant from Lateefah and from defendant himself (he said he drank one-half of a fifth of Mad Dog 20-20 and a sixpack of beer), of bizarre actions (\u201cI am blind,\u201d \u201csleeping\u201d next to the dead body) and of memory loss to present a jury question as to whether defendant\u2019s faculties were so prostrated that he was incapable of forming an intent to commit the crime of murder. <em>State v. Mauricio, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>402, 418, 568 A.2d 879 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">We also note that, on this record, defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of a knife for an unlawful purpose should have merged with his conviction for murder. There is simply nothing in this case to support the conclusion that defendant possessed the knife other than to stab Angela or that his unlawful purpose was anything broader than Angela\u2019s murder. Nor did the jury so find. <em>State v. Williams, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>30, 36-37, 516 A.2d 265 (App.Div.1986), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>104, 526 A.2d 177 (1987). We caution that the foregoing comments arise solely out of this record and that at a different trial a different result may be appropriate on some or all of these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">We note as well that the trial judge here mistakenly failed to instruct the jury on its duty to determine if defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>dant\u2019s statement to the police was credible. <em>Evid.R. </em>8(3); <em>State v. Hampton, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>250, 294 A.2d 23 (1972). Nothing in the charge, taken as a whole, can be viewed as ameliorating this error which is conceded by the state and which could have affected the outcome here. Because the case is to be retried, we need not comment further.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The trial judge also erred in refusing to allow defendant the opportunity to exercise peremptory challenges when, after 14 jurors were chosen and accepted by both sides but not sworn, one juror announced that he could not be impartial. The excusal of that juror and his replacement essentially changed the complexion of the jury and warranted reopening of <em>voir dire </em>to the extent that either side had peremptory challenges available and for so long as either side was in a position to exercise a challenge for cause. This is an important point. The trial judge\u2019s action here could well have led us to the conclusion that defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury was compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
