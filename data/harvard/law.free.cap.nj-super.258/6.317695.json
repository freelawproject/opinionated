Plaintiff Terrance Lovenguth\u2019s auto was struck in the rear by defendant Ruth D\u2019Angelo. Her negligence in causing the accident was conceded. Plaintiff\u2019s already bad back became very painful after the accident. Herniated discs were ultimately diagnosed. Surgery was performed, but did not resolve plaintiffs back problems. He has not worked since the accident. A fact finder accepting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the testimony of plaintiff, his medical experts, his employment expert, and his economist could conclude that plaintiff was permanently disabled and unable to work. He had a work expectancy of 13.5 years, and an annual wage loss of some $40,000. Defendants\u2019 witnesses\u2019 testimony tended to show that plaintiff\u2019s injury was less severe and less disabling than plaintiff said.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The jury awarded plaintiff some $951,000 and his wife $100,-000 on her <em>per quod </em>claim. Plaintiff\u2019s award was broken down by the jury in answer to special interrogatories:</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">for medical expenses $ 43,507</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">for pain and suffering 500,000</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">for past lost income 80,886</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">for future lost income 326,766</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">On appeal, defendants do not directly attack the amount of the verdicts as excessive. Instead, they seek a new trial on the basis of five alleged trial errors. Our consideration of defendants\u2019 arguments convinces us that there is no justification for a new trial. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">Defendants\u2019 first point is that plaintiff\u2019s summation violated the rule of <em>Tenore v. Nu Car Carriers, Inc., </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>466, 341 A.2d 613 (1975). Dr. Richard Ruth had testified that plaintiff had a life expectancy of 24 years and a work expectancy of 13.5 years. He said plaintiff\u2019s current annual wages were $40,280 and the annual value of his household services was $4650. He explained discounting to present value, and the effect of predictable wage increases and inflationary trends. He recommended they all be ignored in the jury\u2019s deliberations because they offset one another, and that a \u201csimple multiplication\u201d of current wages or value of services by a number of years would be accurate. Dr. Ruth did not make the ultimate calculations of wage losses or determine the value of services- lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">In his summation, plaintiff\u2019s attorney summarized Dr. Ruth\u2019s testimony and multiplied 13.5 (years of work expectancy) by $40,280 (current wages), and came up with a total discounted future wage loss of $543,780. He also apparently wrote that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>figure on a writing board. He did a similar calculation for the value of lost services performed by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">After plaintiff\u2019s summation, defendants\u2019 counsel objected to the \u201cbottom line\u201d figures and sought a mistrial. The judge denied the application but immediately instructed the jury that attorneys\u2019 arguments were not evidence. During the formal charge, the judge pointed out that Dr. Ruth did not testify as to plaintiff\u2019s total future income loss and that counsel\u2019s figure was just argument. The jury awarded $326,766 for future lost income. It made no separate award for the value of lost services.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\"><em>Tenore </em>stands for the proposition that evidence \u201cpurporting to show an injured plaintiff\u2019s aggregate damages\u201d is improper for two reasons. 67 <em>N.J. </em>at 482, 341 A.2d 613. The first is that the evidence assumes fact findings not within the expertise of the economic expert, such as whether, absent the litigated injury, there would have been a change in a plaintiff\u2019s earning capacity for other reasons. There is also the uncertainty of the level of wage increases, the uncertainty of economic conditions, and the effects of inflation. <em>Id. </em>at 482-83, 341 A.2d 613. The second impropriety is that \u201cthe projection of a gross figure ... by an expert tends to exert an undue psychological impact leading to the danger of its uncritical acceptance by the jury in the place of its own function in evaluating the proofs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\"><em>Tenore </em>remains the law. <em>See Curtis v. Finneran, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>563, 417 A.2d 15 (1980). It bars \u201cbottom line\u201d evidence of future wage losses in wrongful death cases, like <em>Tenore, </em>and also in non-fatal personal injury cases, because in them, also, future income loss is as uncertain and incapable of precise prediction as in death cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Genovese v. New Jersey Transit </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>Operations, Inc., </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>375, 560 <em>A.</em>2d 1272 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>195, 196, 570 A2d 960 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\"><em>Tenore </em>does not, however, bar an attorney\u2019s argument in summation which includes the bottom line income loss calculation which the expert witness is forbidden to make. The reason is that the jury knows that the attorney is not an economist whose superior knowledge carries some legitimate weight. The judge instructs the jury that the attorneys\u2019 arguments are not evidence. Jurors are not surprised to hear hyperbolic claims and contentions in summation they would not expect from sworn witnesses. And lawyers are not surprised when jurors deeply discount their summation arguments. In the present case, the jury gave plaintiff only 60 percent of the lost income claim he made, and plaintiff does not complain about it. <em>Cf. Genovese, supra, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 379, 560 A.2d 1272 (curative instructions insufficient to overcome strong psychological impact on the jury of the court-invited expert testimony of gross numbers).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Our point is not that a \u201cbottom line\u201d income loss summation is acceptable only if the verdict demonstrates its ineffectiveness, but rather that a lawyer\u2019s summation argument does not carry with it the dangers identified in <em>Tenore </em>of false precision and undue impact that result from expert testimony to the same effect. Any such dangers are averted when the trial judge does a proper job of instructing the jury, as was done here more than once, that a lawyer's argument is not to be taken as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">We hasten to add that we deal here only with a future income loss summation argument that completes the arithmetic prohibited to the expert witness. We intend no inroad on the remaining viable portions of <em>Botta v. Brunner, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>82, 138 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>713 (1958), or to offer an interpretation of <em>R. </em>l:7-l(b), regarding closing statements. We also do not intend to comment on Part 111(b) of this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Gilborges v. Wallace, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 136-38, 379 A.2d 269 (App.Div.1977), <em>affd, in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>342, 396 A.2d 338 (1978), to the extent it deals with \u201cbottom line\u201d testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\"><em>Botta v. Brunner, supra, </em>is not directly relevant. It prohibits an attorney from suggesting in summation a belief as to the pecuniary value or price of pain or suffering per hour, day or week, and from asking that the figure be used as part of a mathematical formula for calculating the damages to be awarded. 26 <em>N.J. </em>at 94, 138 A.2d 713. The Court reasoned that pain and suffering \u201chave no known dimensions, mathematical or financial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 95, 138 A.2d 713, and the purpose of suggesting time-unit valuations \u201cis to instill in the minds of the jurors impressions, figures and amounts not founded or appearing in the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99, 138 A.2d 713.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such statements \u201chave no foundation in the evidence. They import into the trial elements of sheer speculation on a matter which by universal understanding is not susceptible of evaluation on any basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 138 A.2d 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Here, on the other hand, we deal with an attorney\u2019s summation on legitimate expert testimony regarding future income loss. Unlike pain and suffering, future income loss is capable of calculation once the jury decides the extent to which lost future earnings are likely and should be compensated. Thus, <em>Botta v. Brunner, </em>does not bar the economist\u2019s testimony and should not bar summation which merely adds the arithmetic involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Defendants\u2019 second argument is that plaintiff\u2019s attorney improperly attacked defendant Ruth D\u2019Angelo in cross-examination and summation. The gist of the attack was that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>she refused to answer interrogatories and to appear for depositions and thus her trial testimony was less worthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">As a general proposition, defendant is correct that discovery delays and deficiencies which are not demonstrably attributable to the litigant are not a proper subject for an attack on the litigant\u2019s credibility as a trial witness. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney should therefore not have pursued the course he did. <em>Cf. Henker v. Preybylowski, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 518, 524 A.2d 455 (App.Div.1987) (new trial on damages ordered where otherwise inflammatory closing statement included baseless accusation that defendant acted in bad faith to defeat plaintiffs\u2019 liability and damage claims). The trial judge might well have avoided any possibility of prejudice by an instruction to the jury to disregard any inaccurate and prejudicial implication created by plaintiff\u2019s counsel. <em>See Tomeo v. Northern Valley Swim Club, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>416, 421, 493 A.2d 544 (App.Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">There are, however, mitigating circumstances. Plaintiff unsuccessfully pursued discovery of defendant Ruth D\u2019Angelo for a long time. His dealings, of course, were with D\u2019Angelo\u2019s attorney. Finally, D\u2019Angelo\u2019s attorney wrote a letter that admitted liability and suggested that the admission obviated the need for his client\u2019s depositions or answers to interrogatories. The clear implicit message was that Mrs. D\u2019Angelo did not dispute liability and had no personal knowledge or other evidence, other than her identified experts, to offer on the subject of plaintiff\u2019s damages. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney reasonably took that meaning and, as his adversary suggested, terminated his efforts to gain discovery of defendant herself, except as to insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Without prior notice or warning of any kind, defendant introduced into evidence post-accident photographs of the rear of plaintiffs auto, ostensibly showing no damage. Defendant herself was called to the stand on surrebuttal, and described her speed as minimal and the accident impact as slight. Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>tiffs objections to the photographs and to defendant\u2019s testimony were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorney was thus blindsided. He was faced with new and unpredicted evidence that reasonably seemed to violate assurances implicit in his adversary\u2019s suggestion that defendant\u2019s admission of liability made further discovery unnecessary. But, it was the very end of the trial, and plaintiff was denied the opportunity to produce his vehicle damage estimate or police testimony of damage observations. Both, we are told, would have demonstrated that plaintiff\u2019s auto had sustained damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Our purpose in describing the circumstances of plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s transgressions is not to excuse them but to evaluate their impact on the outcome of the case. Defendants achieved through surprise an advantage they may well not have deserved. Plaintiff\u2019s response was improper, but may well have done no more than right the balance. Weighing of countervailing improprieties is not our favorite decisional mechanism, but we have no sense that any injustice was done. The damage verdicts were not disproportionate to plaintiff\u2019s disabilities. Defendant\u2019s testimony, whether believed or disbelieved, did not affect the proven fact that plaintiff had herniated discs and unsuccessful surgery. There is no justification for a new trial on this score. <em>Cf. Henker, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 517-18, 524 A.2d 455 (likelihood that prejudice infected excessive verdict enhanced by inflammatory summation).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">As to defendants\u2019 other alleged trial errors, we are satisfied that plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s summation did not violate the \u201cgolden rule,\u201d which prohibits inviting the jury to award the amount they would want to receive for suffering plaintiff\u2019s damages. <em>Cox v. Valley Fair Corp., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>381, 385, 416 A.2d 809 (1980). Also, <em>R. </em>l:7-1(b) legitimizes the time-unit argument made in summation. The question of whether advanced notice was effectively given is not determinable on this record. If it was not, the omission was harmless. The judge\u2019s instructions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the subject are not criticized. The interjected comments of plaintiff about his financial situation were inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">One last matter. The trial judge made it clear to counsel that he thought it improper to interrupt a summation with objections. There is, of course, the danger that interruption of a dramatic summation will flatten its effect and throw the speaker off stride. Thus, interruption for tactical purposes is improper. There are potential improprieties in summation that are best dealt with on the spot, however, and only immediate objection will serve to trigger necessary remedial action by the judge. For those reasons, we disagree with the trial judge\u2019s blanket warning to the attorneys. It is clear, however, that the matter had no effect on the result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The comment in <em>Ruff v. Weintraub, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>233, 238, 519 A.2d 1384(1987), that the <em>Tenore </em>decision was limited to wrongful death cases refers to another aspect of <em>Tenore </em>which did not deal with the \u201cbottom line\" problem. As to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>other aspect, the Supreme Court in <em>Ruff </em>extended the rule announced in <em>Tenore </em>also to nondeath cases. We are satisfied the Court would take the same course in regard to the \u201cbottom line\" problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b43-9\"><em>But see </em>amended <em>R. </em>1:7-1 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b46-8\">PETRELLA, P.J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ati\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Although I can agree that several of the errors which occurred in this personal injury case can be disregarded, I have to part company with the majority opinion and dissent essentially based on two issues which in my view were extremely prejudicial, and could not be excused by any dereliction by defense counsel. It may well be that because of what I consider improper arguments by plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, the jurors were persuaded for extraneous reasons to assess against defendant a substantial verdict, albeit less than the amount suggested by plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, rather than considering solely what plaintiffs were entitled to receive as compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">Our function is not only to declare and apply the law, but to exercise a corrective and prophylactic function. The court must ensure that all parties get fair treatment, and this is not accomplished by \u201ctit for tat\u201d justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">My first essential point of disagreement is with the thesis that <em>Tenore v. Nu Car Carriers, Inc., </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>466, 341 <em>A.</em>2d 613 (1975), only prohibits an expert or some witness from testifying about the bottom line damage request. In my view, <em>Tenore\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>principles are broader. To allow an attorney to do the multiplication and demand specific dollar amounts as unliquidated damages would be error under the philosophy of <em>Tenore. </em>Unless and until the Supreme Court determines that <em>Tenore </em>should be reconsidered or expanded we should not allow an attorney to do what the expert is not permitted to do. To allow an attorney to do the mathematical calculations violates the spirit of <em>Tenore </em>and effectively does an impermissible end run around the rule of law in that case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If this were permissible, attorneys in every case, even where only a life expectancy table is used, would see this as a license for mathematical sum computation analysis to be addressed to jurors in other personal injury cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Most jurors are unsophisticated in discerning between what is actually evidence and mere argument by the attorneys. Presented with a logical argument by counsel based on the evidence, it is not difficult to envision the effect of suggesting bottom line figures. While the court instructed the jury that the specific dollar amount stated by counsel in his closing argument was merely argument, it did not specifically instruct the jury to disregard such amount and to arrive at its own figure based upon its review of the evidence. Instructions by the court to the jury to disregard the comments of the attorneys and to rely on the evidence seem impractical in the face of absolute numbers suggested by counsel grounded in some fashion in the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Thus, I would conclude that the comments of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney were improper, and constituted harmful error. As the Supreme Court in <em>Tenore </em>noted, a speculative total award figure could have a profound psychological, and prejudicial, impact on the jury. Indeed, in recognizing such impropriety the <em>Tenore </em>Court quoted with approval its earlier opinion in <em>Botta </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>v. Brunner, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>82, 104, 138 A.2d 713 (1958), where it overruled prior decisions allowing counsel to advise the jury of the amount in plaintiffs\u2019 <em>ad damnum </em>clause. The reasoning in <em>Botta </em>was that it was doubtful that, the figure could be erased from the jury\u2019s mind, even with cautionary instructions that the amount represented only plaintiffs\u2019 claim; a jury award must be based on reasonable compensation. 26 <em>N.J. </em>at 94-104, 138 A.2d 713. <em>See Tenore, supra </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>at 483, 341 A.2d 613.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also Dunn v. Praiss, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>180,195-200, 606 A.2d 862 (App.Div.1992) (court held that it was error for expert to break down the damages to a simple mathematical formula with the relevant numbers inserted and to place this formula before the jury for mere computation). Until declared otherwise by the Supreme Court, I would read the current version of <em>R. </em>l:7-lb, which prohibits reference to specific money totals where unliquidated damages and a time-unit argument are involved, as applying to all unliquidated damages, and as a continuing expression that the type of specific sum reference to unliquidated economic damages made here is prohibited. <em>See Curtis v. Finneran, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>563, 571, 417 A.2d 15 (1980) (expert testimony similar to that in <em>Gilborges v. Wallace, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 379 A.2d 269 (App.Div.1977), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>342, 396 A.2d 338 (1978), found proper only in the context of a nonjury trial; such testimony would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>unacceptable in a jury trial). <em>See also Cross v. Robert E. Lamb, Inc., </em>60 <em>N.J.Super. </em>53, 79-81, 158 A.2d 359 (App.Div. 1960), <em>certif. denied </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>350, 160 A.2d 847 (1960) (\u201cAny excessiveness in the verdict is traceable to the summation alone\u201d which relied on improper bottom line argument for projected wage losses).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In addition, the bottom line damages argument was aggravated by the attack by plaintiffs\u2019 attorney upon defendant Ruth D\u2019Angelo based on his assertion of her refusal to answer interrogatories and appear for depositions. Perhaps this was exacerbated by the trial judge\u2019s over-broad ruling prohibiting interruptions of summation. The effect of such a prohibition is to encourage counsel to attempt to cross the line with impunity unless and until a subsequent \u201ccurative\u201d instruction attempts to unring the bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Although it might be inferred that plaintiffs\u2019 attorney assented to defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s position that there was no need to produce his client for deposition since liability was being admitted (damages were always hotly contested), plaintiffs\u2019 attorney hardly pursued this vigorously. Indeed he subsequently obtained an order only requiring a response to certain supplemental interrogatories, without a request to depose defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Since the issue of whether defendant answered interrogatories was not before the jury, the trial judge properly prevented cross-examination on the issue. However, even after the court\u2019s ruling, and apparently in the presence of the jury, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">MR. COLLINS: Her credibility is before this jury, judge. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard from this woman despite repeated requests to get testimony out of her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">MR. PEEKARSKY: Objection, your Honor, this goes way beyond the issue. THE COURT: Mr. Collins, don\u2019t discuss that or I\u2019ll have to explain to the jury that you also have the right to compel these things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-10\">MR. COLLINS: I did. I wish you would explain that to the jury because I got a court order to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-11\">THE COURT: Fine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>While the judge had previously instructed the jury to disregard defendant\u2019s acknowledgment that she did not answer interrogatories and did not appear for a deposition, the above quoted colloquy, in which plaintiffs\u2019 attorney in effect asserted that defendant had flouted a court order, was not corrected. This remark was prejudicial and inflammatory, and was reinforced by other remarks of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney. He capitalized on this comment, when, in summation, he said that defendant never answered interrogatories, never appeared for a deposition, and at the final stage of the trial, testified as to the allegedly minimal impact involved in the automobile accident with plaintiff. Defendants\u2019 attorney did object to these comments at the close of summation. However, the court never ruled on that objection. It was lost in the discussion of the objection to the bottom line damage figures, and was never addressed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s comments were inaccurate, or at the very least distorted. Although defendants\u2019 attorney may have been dilatory in having defendant respond to interrogatories, defendant eventually did respond and plaintiff never sought to compel her to appear for a deposition. Intellection of such matters into the record had the effect of undermining defendant\u2019s credibility and reinforcing plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. At very least, the jury was entitled to be told the truth promptly and cautioned that the particular fact was not to be considered in its deliberations. <em>See Tomeo v. Northern Valley Swim Club, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>416, 421, 493 A.2d 544 (App.Div.1985) (retrial ordered where jury returned no cause verdict after defense counsel falsely implied that defendant was not insured). Just as an attack by an attorney upon a litigant\u2019s character or morals, when not an issue in the case, is not an appropriate trial tactic, <em>Henker v.

But it is extremely doubtful whether such admonitions are sufficient to eliminate the figure from their minds as a conscious or unconscious factor in reaching their verdict.
