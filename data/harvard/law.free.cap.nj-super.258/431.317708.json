Plaintiff Thomas Vogel, a police officer, was struck by a vehicle operated by defendant Lynette M. Skobo while he was chasing a speeding motorcycle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In granting summary judgment, the trial judge concluded that the \u201cfireman\u2019s rule\u201d barred recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>because plaintiff, as a police officer, had assumed the risks inherent in the high-speed chase. We disagree. We hold that defendant\u2019s negligence was an independent and intervening act which is not insulated by the \u201cfireman\u2019s rule.\u201d We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Plaintiff is a Stafford Township police officer. While on duty monitoring a radar detection device, he observed a motorcycle exceeding the speed limit. He thereupon engaged his emergency lights and siren on his motorcycle and pursued the speeding motorcycle in a westerly direction on Jane Drive in Stafford Township. Just as plaintiff was passing defendant\u2019s vehicle, which was also proceeding westerly on Jane Drive, defendant made a quick left turn and struck plaintiff\u2019s motorcycle. Plaintiff sustained multiple injuries as a result of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In <em>Krauth v. Israel Getter &amp; Buckingham Homes, Inc., </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>270, 273-74, 157 A.2d 129 (1960), our Supreme Court adopted the \u201cfireman\u2019s rule\u201d which holds that because a firefighter\u2019s business is to deal with hazards incident to fighting fires, he \u201ccannot complain of negligence in the creation of the very occasion for his engagement.\u201d The rule was extended to police officers in <em>Berko v. Freda, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>81, 459 A.2d 663 (1983). The underlying policy of the fireman\u2019s rule is that the firefighter or police officer assumes the risk attendant to the performance of his or her public duty \u201cfor which he [or she] is trained and paid.\u201d <em>Krauth, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>at 274, 157 A.2d 129. The rationale of the rule is that there is no duty owed to the officer because he or she assumes the risks attendant to the officer\u2019s duties. Thus, \u201cin the final analysis the policy decision is that it would be too burdensome to charge all who carelessly cause or fail to prevent fires with the injuries suffered by the expert retained with public funds to deal with those inevitable, although negligently created, occurrences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, there is \u201cmore than mere dollars-and-cents considerations underpinning the fundamental justice of the \u2018fireman\u2019s rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berko, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 88, 459 A.2d 663. A citizen should not be exposed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the risk of a civil judgment against him or her \u201cfor negligent acts that occasion the presence of a firefighter at the scene of a carelessly-set fire or of a police officer at a disturbance or unlawful incident resulting from negligent conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88-89, 459 A.2d 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Our Supreme Court recently extended the fireman\u2019s rule in <em>Rosa v. Dunkin\u2019Donuts of Passaic, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>66, 583 A.2d 1129 (1991). There, a policeman responded to an emergency medical assistance call from a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts store. <em>Id. </em>at 69, 583 A.2d 1129. While carrying an unconscious employee to a police ambulance, plaintiff slipped on a white powdery substance on the kitchen floor. The Court held that the policies and goals of the fireman\u2019s rule that bar a public safety officer from recovering for injuries caused by ordinary acts of negligence that occasioned the officer\u2019s presence on the premises, are \u201cequally applicable to bar liability for injuries that arise from an act of ordinary negligence posing a hazard that is incidental to and inherent in the performance of the officer\u2019s duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76, 583 A.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Citing the above-quoted language in <em>Rosa, </em>the trial judge here found that the fireman\u2019s rule \u201cis geared to this type of situation\u201d because it is \u201cforeseeable that this event would occur. It is within the realm and risk that is inherent when an officer takes pursuit\u201d of a speeding vehicle. The trial judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">The Court believes that this situation is not any different from the ordinary negligence that was found by the officer at the location at the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts as discussed in <em>Rosa. </em>He is not off duty. He is not in any way on normal police patrol. If that were the case, he wouldn\u2019t be passing on the left and passing the line of motor vehicles in the fashion that\u2019s been described and submitted here as the factual scenario.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">There is an absolute relationship between the injury and the cause of this injury and the officer\u2019s duty. There is nothing subsequent about the action of Mrs. Skobo. It is part and parcel of the response and the pursuit of the fleeing felon. It\u2019s not after and it\u2019s not before. It's occurring while the pursuit is ongoing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">In our view, the trial judge\u2019s expansive reading of <em>Rosa </em>ignores the well-settled corollary to the fireman\u2019s rule that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>\u201cindependent and intervening negligent acts that injure the safety officer on duty are not insulated.\u201d <em>Wietecha v. Guy Peoronard, Chr Bjelland &amp; Co., Inc., </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>591, 595, 510 A.2d 19 (1986); <em>see also McCarthy v. Ehrens, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 255-56, 514 A.2d 864 (Law Div.1986). The genesis of this corollary is found in <em>Krauth, </em>where the Court cited \u201cappreciable authority\u201d for the proposition that liability will be imposed \u201cwith respect to conditions creating undue risks of injury beyond those inevitably involved in fire fighting.\u201d 31 <em>N.J. </em>at 274,157 A.2d 129. The Court in <em>Berko </em>also recognized the rule when it stated that \u201c[c]ase law draws a distinction between injuries stemming from the negligence that brought the firefighters or police to the scene in the first place <em>and injuries suffered from independent causes that may follow.\u201d </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 85, 459 A.2d 663 (emphasis added); <em>see also Knoetig v. Hernandez Realty Co., Inc., </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 604 A.2d 619 (App.Div.1992) (fireman\u2019s rule as extended by <em>Rosa </em>not applicable where firefighter slips and falls on public right-of-way in response to emergency at industrial complex); W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton &amp; D. Owen, <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 61 at 431 (5th ed. 1984) (the fireman\u2019s rule \u201cwill not shield a defendant from liability for independent acts of misconduct which otherwise cause the injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We do not read <em>Rosa </em>as intending to disturb this well-settled corollary. <em>Rosa </em>carefully crafted an extension of the fireman\u2019s rule to avoid the \u201cartificial distinctions\u201d between the negligence that occasioned the presence of the public safety officer at the premises where he or she is injured and \u201cthe negligence defining the scene at which [the officer] arrives[.]\u201d 122 <em>N.J. </em>at 74, 583 A.2d 1129. Its \u201cassumption of risk\u201d analysis thus focuses on the inherent nature of the risk encountered at the scene to which the officer has been dispatched. In other words, extension of the fireman\u2019s rule to the facts in <em>Rosa </em>was \u201cgood sense and good policy,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 73, 583 A.2d 1129, because, from an assumption of risk standpoint, the dangerous condition that caused plaintiff\u2019s injury at the scene of the emergency was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>inseparable from the act which occasioned the officer\u2019s presence. Nothing in <em>Rosa </em>even suggests that the fireman\u2019s rule bars recovery for independent and intervening negligent acts causing injury to the responding officer on his or her way to the scene of the emergency. In short, the trial judge\u2019s reading of <em>Rosa </em>would essentially swallow up the corollary that independent and intervening negligent acts that injure the safety officer on duty are not insulated by the fireman\u2019s rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Here, plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is not barred by the fireman\u2019s rule because he was injured by an independent and intervening act: defendant\u2019s negligent operation of her vehicle. The sound public policy of the fireman\u2019s rule, which frees a citizen from fear of calling for assistance in emergencies, <em>see Berko, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 88, 459 <em>A.</em>2d 663, does not apply since defendant\u2019s conduct did not initiate the high-speed chase. <em>Rosa </em>is inapplicable since plaintiff was not injured as a result of a dangerous condition at the scene of an emergency to which he had been dispatched in the performance of his duties. In terms of \u201cassumption of risk,\u201d we deem defendant\u2019s intervening and independent act of negligence as creating \u201cundue risks of injury beyond those inevitably involved\u201d in the performance of the police officer\u2019s duties. <em>Krauth, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>at 274, 157 <em>A.2d </em>129.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\"><em>Wietecha </em>is supportive of our holding. There two patrolmen investigating a multi-car accident were injured as a result of subsequent collisions involving passing vehicles. Without extensive discussion, the Court held that the corollary to the fireman\u2019s rule allowed recovery against the operators of the vehicles whose independent negligence occurred after the patrolmen arrived at the scene of the accident, but not against the operators of the vehicles whose negligence occasioned their presence. 102 <em>N.J. </em>at 595, 510 <em>A.</em>2d 19. In our view, there is no conceptual difference between the \u201cindependent and intervening\u201d negligent act that injures the safety officer while at the scene of an accident, as in <em>Wietecha, </em>and the \u201cindependent and intervening\u201d negligent act that injures the officer while pursuing a speeding vehicle. Barring the officer from assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>ing a cause of action simply because he or she had not yet reached the \u201cscene\u201d where the speeding vehicle was stopped \u201cwould promote none of the public policy concerns underlying the fireman\u2019s rule, would serve no jurisprudential imperative and would produce an arbitrarily unfair result.\u201d <em>Knoetig, </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 44-45, 604 A.2d 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-15\">Plaintiff Louise Vogel, Thomas\u2019 wife, asserts a <em>per quod </em>claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
