The complaint was dismissed because of plaintiffs\u2019 failure to meet \u201cthe threshold\u201d requirement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">No damages shall be awarded against a public entity or public employee for pain and suffering resulting from an injury; provided, however, that this limitation on recovery of damages for pain and suffering shall not apply in cases of permanent loss of a bodily function, permanent disfigurement or dismemberment where the medical treatment expenses are in excess of $1,000.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Plaintiffs contend that Jay Thorpe\u2019s medical expenses for the \u201cpermanent loss of a bodily function\u201d exceed $1,000;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that even if the injury did not constitute \u201ca permanent loss of a bodily function,\u201d the preclusion embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d) relates only to recovery for \u201cpain and suffering,\u201d and that \u201cthe preclusion of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d) does not bar Jay Thorpe from recovering an award for his permanent injuries even if it bars an award for pain and suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">It was uncontested, for purposes of the motion for summary judgment, that the treating physician, Dr. Munir Ahmed, reported that plaintiff Jay Thorpe suffered a \u201cchronic lumbosacral sprain\u201d and \u201capproximately 15% permanent disability.\u201d Doctor Ahmed\u2019s bill totalled $340.00 for visits and a \u201cmolded\u201d corset over a period of time from February 1987 through May 1987 and then for one more visit in October 1989. There was also a bill for physical therapy of $820.00. Therefore, the bills for medical expenses aggregated more than $1,000 for \u201cmedical treatment expenses.\u201d The issue before us, therefore, is whether plaintiff has presented a sufficient showing of \u201cpermanent loss of a bodily function\u201d to survive the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>For purposes of the summary judgment motion, we must accept that plaintiff was pulled out of a car, and assaulted with a gun and excessive force by Police Officer Cohen incident to a motor vehicle stop. For purposes of the motion, we must also assume culpability and proximate cause. Dr. Ahmed\u2019s report, on which plaintiff relies, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">Mr. Thorpe reported difficulty with performing \u201cbasic\u201d tasks such as lifting his child and skiing because they hurt his lower back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">Clinical examination, however, reveals straight leg raising test to be negative. No motor sensory deficit was elicited. There did not appear to be any evidence of disc herniation or of any other severe problems. Other systemic review was unremarkable and non-contributory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">It is my opinion that Mr. Thorpe is left with a <em>Chronic Lumbosacral Sprain. </em>There is nothing further orthopedically to be done for that. He has a probably 15% permanent disability with regard to the lower back. This disability is functional and he is discharged from further care to come back if any problems arise. His <em>prognosis </em>is <em>satisfactory, </em>(emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">We find the question presented to be in many ways similar to the \u201cverbal threshold\u201d issues involved with respect to the automobile \u201cno fault\u201d law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8(a). In <em>Oswin v. Shaw, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>461, 595 A.2d 522 (App.Div.1991), <em>certif. granted, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>552, 606 A.2d 365 (1991), we considered the right of a plaintiff to sue for \u201cnon-economic loss\u201d where the plaintiff claimed a \u201csignificant limitation of use of a bodily function\u201d and \u201cpermanent loss of use or consequential limitation of use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>250 <em>N.J.Super </em>at 465, 467, 595 A.2d 522. Plaintiff there insisted that she had the right to pursue her action \u201cfor disability and pain and suffering.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 595 A.2d 522. She had been taken to an emergency room after the accident and suffered from \u201cheadaches and pain in the back of her neck.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 595 A.2d 522. She also suffered from a \u201cforaminal encroachment,\u201d which was not \u201cspecifically related to the accident\u201d in the report of the treating doctor, and from spasms, but no fracture or dislocation was observed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">We found that there was no \u201cpermanent\u201d injury. Rather, plaintiff Oswin suffered only from \u201csoft tissue\u201d injuries for which plaintiff was treated 32 times by chiropractic manipulation. The doctor presented a report claiming \u201cpermanency\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the statutory prerequisite to sustain the cause of action, but the report did not specify any permanent restriction of cervical motion or other objective indicia of a permanent injury. In those circumstances we found that the issue was properly decided by the judge before trial and that the threshold had not been met. We concluded that there was no \u201csignificant permanent injury in the form of a significant limitation of use of a bodply] function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470, 595 A.2d 522. We noted in that context that the injury did not have \u201ca serious impact on the plaintiff and her life.\u201d <em>Id. See also Brown v. Puente, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>203, 208, n. 1, 608 A.2d 377 (App.Div.1992) (concurring \u201cfully in the broad summary judgment standard employed by <em>Oswin </em>in determining whether the injuries, as a matter of law, are not sufficiently serious, within the statutory perception, to warrant continuation of the action.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">As knowledgeable commentators have noted with respect to the \u201cthreshold\u201d issue under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">[t]o be considered \u201cpermanent\u201d within the meaning of the subsection, such injury must constitute an <em>objective </em>impairment such as a fracture. <em>LaBarrie v. Homing Auth. of Jersey City, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>61, 64, 362 A.2d 624 (Law Div.1976). Without such objective abnormality, a claim for permanent injury consisting of \u201cimpairment of plaintiffs health and ability to participate in activities\u201d is merely a disguised claim for pain and suffering. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Ayers v. Jackson Tp., </em>[106 <em>N.J. </em>557, 571, 525 A.2d 287 (1987)], it was held that interference with claimant\u2019s \u201cquality of life,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>inconvenience and disruption of daily activities is objective injury and is not \u201cpain and suffering\u201d subject to the restrictions of this subsection. <em>[Margolis and Novack, Claims Against Public Entities </em>(1990), comment <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9 \u2014 2(d) (emphasis added)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">In <em>Ayers v. Jackson Tp., </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>557, 571-72, 525 A.2d 287 (1987) the Supreme Court upheld an award for \u201cquality of life\u201d damages, notwithstanding the claim that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d) barred it. The Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">The Tort Claims Act\u2019s ban against recovery of damages for \u201cpain and suffering resulting from any injury\u201d is intended to apply to the intangible, subjective feelings of discomfort that are <em>associated with personal injuries. </em>It was not intended to bar claims for inconvenience associated with the invasion of a property interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that the quality of life damages represent compensation for losses associated with damage to property, and agree with the Appellate Division that they do not constitute pain and suffering under the Tort Claims Act. (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">On the other hand, the Court held that the \u201cclaims for emotional distress [damages] are encompassed by the term \u2018injury\u2019 in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d)\u201d and also dismissed the claim for <em>\u201cunquantified </em>enhanced risk of disease,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 575, 598, 525 <em>A.2d </em>287. Further, while not discussing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d) directly, the Court also held that \u201cthe cost of medical surveillance is a compensable item of damages\u201d where necessary to monitor a significant exposure to chemicals or toxic substances. <em>Id. </em>at 606, 525 A.2d 287. <em>Ayers, </em>then, allows recovery for economic loss and out-of-pocket expenses and not for personal injuries themselves, in the absence of satisfying the threshold. Presumably, the threshold would have to be satisfied before a suit can be commenced or recommenced against a public entity or official for damages based on development of actual physical injuries. <em>See also Srebnik v. State, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 349-52, 585 <em>A.</em>2d 950 (App.Div.1991); <em>Marion v. Borough of Manasquan, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>320, 330-332, 555 A.2d 699 (App.Div. 1989). We do not read <em>Ayers </em>as addressing the issues presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The wording of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d) precludes only the award of damages for \u201cpain and suffering.\u201d It does not preclude damages for any other claim or injury. The comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">The limitation on the recovery of damages in subparagraph (d) reflects the policy judgment that in view of the economic burdens presently facing public entities a claimant should not be reimbursed for <em>non-objective </em>types of damages, <em>such as </em>pain and suffering, except in aggravated circumstances \u2014 cases involving permanent loss of a bodily function, permanent disfigurement or dismemberment where the medical treatment expenses are in excess of $1,000. The limitation that pain and suffering may only be awarded when medical expenses exceed $1,000 insures that such damages will not be awarded unless the loss is substantial, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The comments to the Act, taken from the Report of the Attorney General\u2019s Task Force on Sovereign Immunity \u2014 1972, \u201cac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>companied the Act during its consideration by the Legislature [and] have the precedential weight and value of legislative history.\u201d <em>Rochinsky v. State of N.J. Dept. of Trans., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>399, 407 n. 4, 541 A.2d 1029 (1988). We read the comment as persuasive and conclude that Thorpe\u2019s claim for pain and suffering is barred in the absence of an objective injury beyond the type involved here. And given the policy behind the Tort Claims Act which requires evaluation of <em>\u201cwhether an immunity applies and if not, should liability attach </em>[with the hope that] in utilizing this approach the courts will exercise restraint in the acceptance of novel causes of action against public entities,\u201d Task Force comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-1 (emphasis in original); <em>see also Weiss v. New Jersey Transit, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>376, 379, 608 A.2d 254 (1992); <em>Rochinsky v. State, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 407-408, 541 A.2d 1029, we conclude that the \u201cthreshold\u201d issue was properly resolved by the judge before trial, particularly because there is no dispute of fact, as opposed to a legal conclusion based thereon, and there is no need for an evidentiary determination. <em>See Oswin v. Shaw, supra; cf. Brown v. Puente, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 212-13, 608 A.2d 377, <em>supra. See also LaBarrie v. Housing Auth. of Jersey City, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>61, 65, 362 A.2d 624 (Law Div.1976) (\u201cA failure to meet the threshold requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d) can be disposed of by summary judgment.\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>We also reject the appealing argument that \u201ceven if the plaintiff is not entitled to an award for pain and suffering, he is entitled to an award for his permanent injuries.\u201d As Margolis and Novack have noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">Limitations are also placed upon recovery of damages for pain and suffering. To recover such damages a claimant must suffer permanent injury and incur medical expenses in excess of $1,000. If the $1,000 threshold is not met, but permanent injury has been sustained, a claimant may recover damages for the injury, but not for pain and suffering. The collateral source rule does not apply and no subrogation claim may be brought against the public entity or employee. [Introduction at xi].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\"><em>See also, Peterson v. Edison Tp. Bd. of Ed., </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>566, 350 <em>A.</em>2d 82 (App.Div.1975), where we held that only the claim for pain and suffering, not permanent injuries, was precluded by plaintiffs failure to meet the $1,000 threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">We do not, however, find any legislative intent to permit a claim for disability or bodily injury when the threshold is not met due to the absence of an objective injury, as opposed to the medical expense. In <em>LaBarrie v. Housing Auth. of Jersey City, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 64, 362 <em>A.</em>2d 624 (Law Div.1976), plaintiff did not have medical expenses in excess of $1,000 and conceded that she could not sue for pain and suffering. She nevertheless contended \u201cthat <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d) does not bar recovery for damages for permanent injuries <em>i.e., </em>the impairment of her faculties, health and ability to participate in activities as distinguished from physical discomfort and distress.\u201d In <em>LaBarrie, </em>Judge Bilder, then sitting in the Law Division, distinguished <em>Peterson </em>where there was \u201cobjective impairment,\u201d and stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">[t]o extend <em>Peterson </em>so as to permit recovery for this type of non objective complaint would be to ignore the Legislative mandate. The result would be to allow recovery for pain and suffering by denominating it permanent injury. The Legislature did not intend such a result. The intention of the Legislature is entitled to greater recognition and implementation. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>We believe that Judge Bilder\u2019s analysis is equally applicable in these circumstances and affirm the dismissal of the personal injury claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">We note our agreement with plaintiff that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d) does not bar all claims. As made so very clear by the Attorney General\u2019s Task Force Report, the Tort Claim Act promotes reimbursement for \u201cfull net economic loss,\u201d Report at 16, quoted in full in <em>Margolis and Novack, supra, </em>at R-8. However, plaintiffs do not press a claim before us for medical expense reimbursement, undoubtedly because the Act \u201cprohibits awards ... for damages compensated through collateral sources such as insurance policies,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at R-9,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and they could not identify any economic loss on the motion for summary judgment. Their argument to the motion judge that there \u201cmay be other things that we\u2019ve discovered through ongoing discovery\u201d cannot suffice to preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Finally, we agree with plaintiffs\u2019 contention that they may pursue their punitive damage claim against the public employees, although not against the entity. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>59:9\u2014 2(c). <em>See also Chatman v. Hall, supra. </em>And this is so, notwithstanding the fact that no compensatory damages may be recoverable. <em>Marion v. Borough of Manasquan, supra, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 333, 555 A.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">We accordingly reverse the judgment insofar as it dismisses the claim for punitive damages against the individual defendants and otherwise affirm the judgment under review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Plaintiffs also contend that it is for the jury to decide if Jay Thorpe suffered a \"permanent loss of a bodily function\u201d and satisfied the threshold.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We recognize that a majority of our Supreme Court has recently distinguished between public entities and public employees under the Tort Claims Act, noting that \u201c[a] public entity is deemed \u2018not liable for an injury except as provided in the Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-1. In contrast, a public employee 'is liable for injury\u2019 except as otherwise provided. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-1.\u201d <em>See Chatman v. Hall, </em>128 <em>NJ. </em>394 at 402, 608 A.2d 263 (1992). Independent of the fact that the Court there \"emphasized that the differential treatment of public employee and entity liability by the Tort Claims Act in [that] case [was] limited to dangerous conditions on public property,\u201d 128 <em>NJ. </em>at 417, 608 A.2d 263, the immunity embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(d) expressly relates to both \"a public entity or public employee.\u201d Moreover, in <em>Weiss v. New Jersey Transit </em>128 <em>NJ. </em>376, 608 A.2d 254 (1992), decided the same day as <em>Chatman, </em>a majority of the Court made clear that \u201cthe liability provisions of the Act will not take precedence over specifically granted immunities\" and that \"[w]e have been adjured by the framers of the Tort Claims Act that we should approach these case from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>perspective that immunity is the dominant theme of the Act,\" relying on the Task Force Comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-1. 128 <em>N.J. </em>at 380, 383, 608 <em>A.2d </em>254.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The record reflects that Dr. Ahmed received an \"insurance check\u201d for $295.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
