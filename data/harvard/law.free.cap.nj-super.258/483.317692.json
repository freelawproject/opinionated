(ICI) has operated a factory in Bayonne since 1965 which produces a Teflon-like plastic sold under the trade name \u201cFluon.\u201d For a substantial period of time, ICI has stored the waste generated by this production process in a 55,000 gallon storage container and disposed of it by means of a hazardous waste incinerator. Since ICI constructed its storage container and incinerator prior to the enactment of the SWMA, it was not required at that time to obtain a waste facility permit from the DEP.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, after the enactment of the SWMA, the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u00a7 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 6901 to \u00a7 6992k, and administrative regulations implementing these legislative enactments, ICI was required to obtain such a permit. Consequently, on March 21, 1984, the DEP directed ICI to submit a complete New Jersey Hazardous Waste Facility Permit Application for its storage container and incinerator. ICI submitted this application on September 21, 1984, but did not furnish other necessary documents until September 15, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">On September 29, 1988, ICI submitted a second application seeking authorization to construct a new and substantially larger incinerator. ICI indicated that a new incinerator was needed because it was expanding its production facilities, which would result in increased waste generation and thus a need for increased incinerator capacity. However, ICI did not submit an EIS with this application and a member of the public raised a question regarding this omission during the comment period. In response, the DEP stated that ICI was not required to submit an EIS under the applicable administrative regulations, because \u201cthe facility in question is not a new facility ... [and] ... the facility is not applying for a modification or revocation and reissuance of a permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">On November 8, 1989, ICI withdrew its initial permit application for the existing incinerator but continued its second application for the new incinerator. On March 15, 1990, the DEP issued a final hazardous waste facility permit to ICI, which granted ICI\u2019s second application to construct and operate the new incinerator.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Appellants filed a notice of appeal from DEP\u2019s decision to issue a hazardous waste facility permit to ICI without requiring an EIS. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The SWMA requires any party who proposes to construct, acquire or operate a solid waste management facility to prepare an EIS. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-26 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoC\"><em>Prior to the construction, </em>acquisition, or operation <em>of any solid waste facility, ... the person proposing the construction, </em>acquisition, or operation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>in addition to preparing an environmental impact statement for the solid waste facility </em>in such form as shall be required by the commissioner pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-6] shall make or cause to be made any preliminary surveys, investigations, studies, borings, maps, plans, drawings, and estimates of costs and of revenues as the commissioner may deem necessary relating to the type of such solid waste facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\"><em>The results of the environmental impact statements, </em>surveys, investigations, studies, borings, maps, plans, drawings, and estimates required by the commissioner <em>shall be submitted to the commissioner for approval. </em>[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The definition of \u201csolid waste facilities\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-3(h) includes an \u201cincinerator.\u201d Therefore, the SWMA envisions that an EIS will be prepared before an incinerator is constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">In addition, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-6a(2) provides in relevant part that the DEP shall</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">[f|ormulate and promulgate, amend and repeal codes, rules and regulations concerning solid waste collection and solid waste disposal activities. <em>Such codes, rules and regulations shall establish the procedures relating to the preparation and submission of environmental impact statements prior to the construction, acquisition, or operation of any solid waste </em>facility____ [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">The DEP has discharged this statutory responsibility by adopting regulations which set forth the required contents of an EIS in considerable detail. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-1.4; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-2.9(c); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-12.2(j)(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An EIS must contain a \u201crealistic\u201d assessment of the probable impact of the proposed facility \u201cupon the geology, soils, hydrology, air quality, ecology, land use, socioeconomics, aesthetics, history and archeology\u201d of the surrounding area. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-1.4. In addition, the statement must contain a \u201clisting of adverse environmental impacts which cannot be avoided\u201d and a \u201cdescription of the steps to be taken to minimize\u201d further degradation. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">The regulation which is the focus of this appeal is <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26 \u2014 12.2(j), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Certain applicants will be required to submit an Environmental and Health Impact Statement (EHIS) in addition to Parts A and B of the permit application in accordance with the provisions set out below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">1. Applicants seeking the initial permit issued pursuant to this subchapter for a new facility unless: [exceptions not applicable here]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Another regulation excludes operators of \u201cexisting hazardous waste facilities\u201d from the requirement to submit an EIS. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-12.1(a)l.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-26 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-6(a)(2) do not provide express authorization to the DEP to exempt any party who proposes to construct, acquire or operate a solid waste management facility from the obligation to prepare an EIS. However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-4(a) authorizes the DEP to create exemptions from the registration requirements of the SWMA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\"><em>The department </em>shall have power to supervise solid waste collection and disposal facilities or operations, and shall in the exercise of such supervision require the registration of new and existing solid waste collection and disposal facilities and operations; and <em>may exempt from the requirement of registration any class of solid waste collection or disposal facility or operation. </em>[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Since <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-26 provides that the result of an EIS, together with surveys, investigations, borings, maps, plans, drawings and estimates, shall be submitted to the Commissioner of DEP for approval, it appears that the essential purpose of an EIS is to assist the DEP in determining whether to approve a solid waste facility. Consequently, it seems reasonable to conclude that the authority of DEP under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lE-4(a) to establish exemptions from registration extends to exemptions from the obligation to file an EIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">However, this authority must be reasonably exercised in a manner consistent with the underlying objectives of the SWMA. In <em>Service Armament Co. v. Hyland, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>550, 558-59, 362 A.2d 13 (1976), the Court took note of \u201cthe general principle that exceptions in a legislative enactment are to be strictly but reasonably construed, consistent with the manifest reason and purpose of the law.\u201d When the Legislature delegates authority to an administrative agency to establish exceptions from general statutory requirements, it should exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>that authority in a similar manner. Thus, the DEP must strictly construe its own regulations establishing exemptions from the regulatory requirements of the SWMA in furtherance of the underlying objectives of this legislation. <em>Cf. Medford Convalescent &amp; Nursing Ctr. v. Division of Medical Assistance &amp; Health Servs., </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 5, 526 A.2d 1087 (App.Div.1985) (\u201cRegulations are subject to the same rules of construction as a statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The objective of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-4(a) is \u201cto authorize exemptions only with respect to technologies that either impose minimal environmental and public health risks or those that are pervasively regulated by other federal or state statutes.\u201d <em>Terminal Constr. Corp. v. Hoboken-Union City Weehawken Sewerage Auth., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>537, 544, 582 A.2d 1288 (App. Div.1990), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>323, 598 A.2d 883 (1991). The DEP\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations to allow ICI to construct a new hazardous waste incinerator without filing an EIS is inconsistent with this interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-4a. Preliminarily, we note that ICI has never obtained a permit from the DEP for any part of its hazardous waste facility and consequently has never submitted an EIS. Moreover, the new incinerator constitutes a substantial expansion of the hazardous waste activity previously conducted on the site; while the old incinerator could burn 60 pounds of waste per hour, the new incinerator has an authorized capacity of 160 pounds per hour, thus resulting in a 167% increase in incineration capacity. ICI does not suggest that the technology incorporated in this incinerator imposes \u201cminimal environmental and public health risks.\u201d There also is no indication that ICI\u2019s facility is \u201cpervasively regulated\u201d under other federal or state statutes. To the contrary, the SWMA is the primary mechanism under which New Jersey regulates hazardous waste facilities, and the Environmental Protection Agency has delegated a substantial part of the federal regulation of such facilities to the State pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 6926. See 50 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>5260 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The salutary purposes served by an EIS is another reason for narrowly construing DEP\u2019s authority to exempt hazardous waste facilities from this requirement. An EIS forces both the permit applicant and the DEP to consider the impact of the proposed activity on all aspects of the \u201cenvironment\u201d \u2014 ecological, socioeconomic, geologic and aesthetic. No other disclosure required by the SWMA involves such a broad-ranging inquiry. <em>Compare N.J.A.C. </em>7:26 \u2014 12.2(j)(4) (prescribing contents of an EIS) <em>with N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-12.2(e) and (f) (prescribing contents of parts A and B of a permit application).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The submission of an EIS also allows local public officials and community residents to participate in the permitting process in a more meaningful way. Any tentative approval of a solid waste disposal facility must be transmitted to the governing body of the affected municipality, \u201caccompanied by a fact sheet setting forth the principal facts and the significant factual, legal, methodological and policy questions considered in granting the tentative approval.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-5.1c. In cases where an applicant is required to submit an EIS, the fact sheet must also contain \u201ca brief summary as to how the [EIS] demonstrates that the proposed facility, subject to such conditions made part of the draft permit, would not create a significant adverse impact upon the public health or environment.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-12.11(c)4. Thereafter, the DEP is required to conduct a \u201cfull and impartial hearing\u201d regarding the proposed facility and operation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-5.1d. The \u201cobvious purpose\u201d of these provisions is \u201cto give interested persons sufficient information to enable them to review and evaluate the proposal and provide the DEP with their views.\u201d <em>In re NJPDES Permit No. N.J. 0055247, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 18, 522 A.2d 1022 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>185, 527 A.2d 1390 (1987). Therefore, to the extent that a \u201cfact sheet\u201d omits information concerning the environmental impact of a proposed facility, local officials and residents will be less well equipped to intelligently participate in the permit approval process, contrary to the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-5.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Consequently, if <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-12.2(j) clearly exempted ICI\u2019s new incinerator from the requirement to submit an EIS, we would conclude that the regulation exceeded the DEP\u2019s authority under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-4a. However, we believe that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-12.2(j)(l) may be reasonably construed to apply to Id\u2019s new incinerator.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26 \u2014 12.2(j)(l) requires an EIS to be submitted by an applicant who seeks \u201cthe initial permit issued pursuant to this subchapter for a new facility.\u201d ICI had not previously been issued a permit under the SWMA and thus the solid waste facility permit issued by DEP on March 15, 1990 was an \u201cinitial permit.\u201d The only question is whether that permit was issued for a \u201cnew facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The SWMA defines \u201csolid waste facilities\u201d to include \u201cincinerators,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-3(h), and Id\u2019s application to DEP was for permission to construct a new incinerator. Nevertheless, the DEP concluded that Id\u2019s new incinerator was not a \u201cnew facility\u201d but rather a new component part of an \u201cexisting facility.\u201d <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-12.1(a)(1). Consequently, the DEP took the position that ICI was not required to submit an EIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">However, while the term \u201cfacility\u201d may refer in some contexts to an entire solid waste management complex, see <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-1.4, it also may be construed to refer to an individual unit, such as an incinerator, in order to effectuate the underlying intent of a legislative enactment. <em>See Mobil Oil Corp. v. EPA, </em>871 .2d 149, 153 (D.C.Cir.1989) (\u201cIf the expert agency believes that the legislative purposes will best be satisfied by construing [facility] to mean different things in different contexts, then it may act upon that premise.\u201d). Here, it is clear that Id\u2019s construction of a new incinerator with a capacity to treat more than twice as much hazardous waste is a significant enough change to require a complete reevaluation of the impact of that facility upon the environment. Indeed, if DEP\u2019s construction of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-12.2(j)(l) were correct, ICI could have replaced its present incinerator with one a hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>times larger and still not be required to prepare an EIS. Therefore, we conclude that the construction of a new incinerator changed the existing complex into a \u201cnew facility\u201d requiring the submission of an EIS.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">This interpretation of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-12.20(1) is reinforced by the regulations governing the submission of an EIS for nonhazardous waste facilities. In 1986, as part of an effort to bring the permit procedures governing non-hazardous waste facilities into conformity with those governing hazardous waste facilities, the DEP proposed substantial amendments to its regulations including provisions requiring an EIS to be submitted in connection with permit applications for non-hazardous solid waste facilities. 18 <em>N.J.R. </em>883-924 (May 5, 1986). The proposed <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-2.4(c) stated that every application for a new permit shall include an EIS, and the proposed <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-2.7(a)(2) stated that \u201c[a]ny expansion, extension, enlargement or other increase beyond permitted capacity conditions shall be considered a new facility and shall require the application for the Departmental approval of a new permit.\u201d In response to objections to these proposed regulations, the DEP stated:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">The Department\u2019s review of the facility\u2019s environmental and health impact statement is based largely on the capacity of the facility. This capacity translates into environmental impacts generated by the facility which must in turn be evaluated by the Department. To suggest that the facility be permitted at one capacity, and that capacity being the limits on which the environmental impacts were evaluated and determined to be acceptable, and then allow expansion without a subsequent reevaluation by the Department and its associated public review, would be in direct contravention of the intent and purposes of the rules and legislative mandate of the Solid Waste Management Act. [19 <em>N.J.R. </em>930 (June 1, 1987) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Consequently, the DEP adopted <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-2.4(c) and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26-2.7(a)(2) as proposed. Since the DEP\u2019s regulations governing non-hazardous waste facilities treat any expan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>sion in capacity as a \u201cnew facility,\u201d it would be highly anomalous and in our view impermissible for the DEP to interpret this term more restrictively in connection with its regulation of hazardous waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Finally, we reject ICI\u2019s argument that it was not required to submit an EIS because the purposes of an EIS are fulfilled by the RCRA permitting process administered by the DEP. Although the RCRA requires the regulations of any state which chooses to administer the RCRA hazardous program to be equivalent to the federal RCRA regulations, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 6926(b), it also authorizes a state to adopt regulations which are more stringent than the requirements of RCRA and the regulations adopted thereunder. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 6929. Thus, even if an EIS is not required under RCRA, the DEP may require ICI to submit an EIS pursuant to state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the DEP granting ICI a hazardous waste facility permit and remand the matter to DEP to require an EIS to be submitted and to reconsider ICI\u2019s permit application in the light thereof.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-12\">Pursuant to an executive reorganization plan, the Department of Environmental Protection recently has been redesignated as the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy.
