The affidavit of one o'f the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, and who signed the stipulation, denies expressly that the time therein mentioned was forty days, and states positively that it was thirty days; and denies that he ever signed any stipulation, giving forty days to serve the case or bill of exceptions. It states further, that the word has been altered from <em>thirty </em>to <em>forty, </em>since he gave the stipulation, and without the consent of either of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys. The stipulation is not produced. It was filed in the clerk\u2019s office of Che-mung county on the 8th of April, and after the question arose whether it was thirty or forty days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>On the 2d of April, the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys issued an execution upon the judgment and delivered same to a deputy of the sheriff of Chemung for collection. No written notice of the judgment has been given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-5\">On the 7th of April notice of appeal and copy hill of exceptions were served by defendants\u2019 attorneys on plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, a copy of the notice of appeal having been previously filed with the clerk of Chemung county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">The motion by the defendants is to set aside the execution, and that proceedings be stayed, &amp;c., until the decision of the appeal, and that the defendants have liberty to perfect the ap peal, &amp;c., or for such other order, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-7\">Brooks &amp; Tomlinson, <em>for </em>defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-8\">Christie &amp; Curtis, <em>for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b432-9\">Welles, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AeQ\">The stipulation upon which the defendants rely, must be laid out of view. So far as it could, by possibility, aid them, it is flatly denied. It is not produced, and no sufficient reason is given for not producing it. It is not a paper belonging to the files of the clerk\u2019s office, and it was unnecessarily placed there after the dispute arose respecting its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">The notice of appeal was not served upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys until after they had issued their execution. The execution was, therefore,.regular. The defendants\u2019 appeal, however, is regular, and in time. There has been no written notice of the judgment served upon the defendants or their attorneys. Nothing short of this will limit the time in which to appeal. Actual knowledge of the entry of the judgment, by the defendants or their attorneys, will not supersede the written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">The motion to set aside the execution must be denied, with seven dollars costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">The application to stay- proceedings until the decision of the appeal by the general term, is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">An appeal from a judgment entered upon the report of a referee does not operate to stay execution, without the under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>taking provided by the Code, unless a judge of the court so order. Nothing appears in these papers to justify such an order. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 348.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">I incline to the opinion that the defendants may now give the requisite undertaking, and thus stay the plaintiff\u2019s proceedings. The defendants may have ten days to serve a case or bill of exceptions, and the plaintiff thirty days to propose amendments.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
