The property was worth $8,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-11\">The plaintiffs are'judgment-creditors of defendant. The attorneys of the former issued an execution on the judgment to the sheriff, and subsequently stated to him, in a letter, that they desired to give all requisite attention to the execution, and would come to Brooklyn at any time., if necessary, for that purpose. The sheriff\u2019s deputy acknowledged the receipt of such letter, and stated, in his reply thereto, \u201cthat he would see them (the attorneys) again soon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-12\">The property was subsequently sold by another deputy of the sheriff on the 3d May, 1856, without any previous notice of the sale to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, for $38, to one W. H. Keith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-13\">Mr. Taber, one of the attorneys of the plaintiffs, swears that had they not relied upon receiving notice from the sheriff, they would have attended the sale, and either bid to the full amount of the judgment, interest and costs, or have directed the execution to be returned unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Defendant has little or no property, except the real estate sold on such execution, and the plaintiffs will lose the amount due on their judgment unless the sale is opened or set aside. The defendant, a few. days before the docketing of the judgment, and after the cause was noticed for trial, conveyed such real estate to his daughter without consideration. The purchaser swears that he purchased the premises in good faith; but it appears that at the time of the sale the defendant was in his employ, or was, secretly, his partner in business. The attorney of the plaintiffs, on the 21st Oct., 1856, offered to pay Keith the said sum of $38, and interest since the sale, which he declined to receive.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b564-5\">Clark B. <em>Cochran, for plaintiffs.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b564-6\">Richard H.

Their attorneys were misled by the letter of the sheriff\u2019s deputy, who stated therein that he would see them again in respect to the execution. They had reason to rely on this assurance that they would receive notice in case their attendance at the sale was necessary to protect the interests of their clients. They were prevented from attending and bidding at the sale by this promise or assurance of the sheriff\u2019s deputy, to give them notice of the sale. This alone is a sufficient cause for setting aside the sale, as the property has been sacrificed. The conduct of the deputy produced surprise upon the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, and evidently misled them. The case comes clearly within the decision in <em>Collier </em>agt. Whipple, (13 <em>Wend. </em>224, 228, 230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The sale of the separate parcels of the real estate together as one parcel, is always sufficient cause for setting aside the sale. Parties interested in a sheriff\u2019s sale have a right to expect that the property will be put up and sold in the usual manner, and in accordance with the requirements of law; and if it appears that the property has been sacrificed by the neglect of the sheriff to comply with such requirements in respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the sale, the parties injured are entitled to a resale; or to such other relief as can be given without doing injustice to <em>bona fide </em>purchasers at the sale. (9 <em>Paige, </em>259; 2 <em>id. </em>339,100; 26 <em>Wend. </em>143; <em>3 John. Ch. </em>424; 10 <em>Paige, </em>243, 487; 6 Wendell, 522; 18 <em>id. </em>611.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Keith, the purchaser, swears that he purchased the premises fairly, and without collusion with any one. The fact, however, that the defendant was, at the time of the sale, either in the employ of Keith or his partner in business, connected with the voluntary conveyance of the former to his daughter, evidently with the intent to defraud the plaintiffs, is calculated to cast suspicion upon the good faith of the purchase by Keith.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The sale must be set aside; b,ut it must be set aside only upon the condition that the plaintiffs repay to Keith $38, the amount of his bid paid to the sheriff, with interest thereon since the sale, and also $7 costs of opposing this motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
