That about the first of August last, plaintiff called on Berg to sign an agreement to constitute them partners, provided Berg would give security; that Berg declined this, and immediately sold out the furniture to defendant Krahe, who purchased with full knowledge that Berg had no title, and that this was done to cheat the plaintiff out of his property. That defendants Berg and Krahe, put the defendant Elsraer into possession, and that all of the defendants knew of plaintiff\u2019s rights.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-6\">S.

The case of <em>Avery </em>agt. Smith, (2 <em>Com. p. </em>60,) is'an authority under the old system of practice, that a party might resort to either a court of law or equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">But the distinction between courts of law and equity, which so long prevailed in our system of jurisprudence, has been abolished by the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The inquiry is not now whether the relief demanded is according to principles of equity or the 'common law practice, but simply whether the party is entitled to it (the injunction) by reason of. the acts complained of producing an injury to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">In <em>Furniss </em>agt. Brown, (8 <em>How. Prac. Rep. </em>59,) it was held, that when the action was for the recovery of the possession of personal property, an injunction under the Code might stand in aid of that action\u2014it appearing that the plaintiff is entitled to it by reason of the injury to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">I am satisfied, from the affidavits submitted to me, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>plaintiff was the owner of the furniture in the store of defendant Berg, and that such ownership was well known to both defendants, Berg and Krahe; that the pretended sale from Berg to Krahe was made in fraud of the rights of the plaintiff, and so known to both of said defendants; and that the title of the plaintiff to said furniture has not been divested.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">I am therefore of the opinion that the injunction should be retained, until the trial of this cause, in aid of the plaintiff\u2019s action, and that the motion to vacate the injunction order should be denied, with |10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
