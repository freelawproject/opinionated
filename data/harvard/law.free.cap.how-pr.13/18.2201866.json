After, a contest on exceptions to the an'swer for insufficiency, the cause was brought to issue by filing and serving a replication in 1854, and was referred under the supplementary act, in the same year, to a referee, to hear and determine the whole issues. The cause was heard before the referee, who reported for plaintiffs, and judgment was entered on his report against defendants, May 29th, 1856, in the clerk\u2019s office of the city and county of New-York, for 05,156.87 damages and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-5\">On the 31st of May, 1856, written notice of the entry of the judgment was served on Alfred Ely, Esq., defendants\u2019 attorney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-6\">On the 5th day of June, 1856, a notice of appeal to the general term, subscribed by <em>Ely </em>Sf Husbands, and <em>without </em>security, was served on Smith &amp; Cornwell, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, which notice was returned to E. &amp; H. for irregularity and insufficiency, on the ground that,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-7\">1.

That no <em>appeal </em>would lie from the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-10\">On the 20th of June, 1856, another notice of appeal, subscribed by Ely &amp; Husbands, as attorneys, was served on plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, accompanied by a sufficient undertaking, and also by notice of entry of an order substituting Ely &amp; Husbands as attorneys for defendants. In the meantime, and on the 9th of June, 1856, the papers for this motion were served on plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, in the <em>name of Alfred Ely, </em>as attorney for defendants, with an order to show cause for this day, why. the time of defendants to make case should not be enlarged for forty days.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-11\">T. B. Husbands &amp; T. Hastings, <em>for </em>motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-12\">F. E.

Darwin Smith, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"An\">The first ground of objection to the granting of this order, made by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, is. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>that according to subdivision 3, of \u00a7 401, this being an action pending in the first judicial district, the motion cannot be made elsewhere, and that therefore I have no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Subdivision 1, of \u00a7 401, is, \u201c an application for an order is a - motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Subdivision 3 is, \u201c motions must be made within the district in which the action is triable, or in a county adjoining that in which it is triable, <em>except that where the action is triable in the first judicial </em>district, <em>the motion must be made therei</em>n.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">I am inclined to think that this section does not apply to chamber orders; but that under \u00a7 405, giving general powers <em>to </em>\u201c <em>a judge of the court </em>\u201d to enlarge time, &amp;c., any judge in any part of the state may make such an order, notwithstanding subdivision 3 of \u00a7 401. That section should be construed as to chamber business, beneficially for the profession, and so as to promote their convenience in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">2. The more serious objection to granting this application, is contained in the plaintiffs\u2019 second ground of objection, which is, that no appeal is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">It is claimed that in equity causes, pending at the time the Code took effect, there is no such thing as an appeal to the general term: that the only mode of review is by <em>notice of rehearing., accompanied by </em>security, and that this notice must be served and security given <em>within ten days </em>after notice of the judgment or decree. <em>(See Chap. </em>11, \u00a7 7, <em>of Supplemental Act </em>\"<em>of Provisions Relating to Existing Suits.\u201d) </em>And this position is supported by reference to \u00a7 323 of the Code; and to <em>sub. </em>3 of \u00a7 2 of chapter 1 of supplemental act, by which it appears that \u00a7 348, providing for appeals to general term, is <em>not </em>applied to existing suits; and that \u00a7 323 (which, in connection with the latter part of subdivision 3 of \u00a7 2 of chapter 1 of supplemental act, shows that it includes decrees in equity,) <em>is </em>applied to existing suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">I am strongly inclined to the opinion, that the plaintiffs are right in their construction of the statute, and that there is no appeal pending, and that defendants\u2019 proceedings for that purpose are not effectual. (3 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>254, 271, 422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>But, inasmuch as a mere order enlarging time to make case will not affect the question-one way or the other, or prejudice the plaintiffs, I am disposed to grant it, without prejudice to their right to move to dismiss the appeal, and without staying the plaintiffs in the collection of their judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
