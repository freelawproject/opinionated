On reflection, I think I cannot go behind the judgment. The only inquiry contemplated by the Code, on such an application as this, is, whether the judgment, or any part thereof, has been satisfied. While the judgment remains on record, we cannot go any further. It is presumed to be the solemn and deliberate act of the court, which can only be set aside on a formal application for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">If the statement of the defendant is true, he is not without his remedy. The judgment may he declared a nullity; but, I cannot, on this application, entertain the question. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>174 of the Code provides, that the court may, in its discretion, and upon such terms as may be just, at any time within one year after notice thereof, relieve a party from a judgment, order, &amp;c., taken against him, through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">For this purpose a direct application may be made to the court; and then, probably, a reference would be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">As the judgment is now a valid and conclusive record, and as it has not been satisfied, the application of the plaintiffs is granted, without costs, and, of course, without prejudice to the defendant to take any course in relation to the judgment that he may be advised to take\u00bb</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
