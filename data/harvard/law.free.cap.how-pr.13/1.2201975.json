Pratt only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-5\">The duties of an examiner in such cases, at all times delicate and responsible, become painful when, in their discharge, they are required to declare that candidates who have applied for admission are not qualified ,\u2022 and the undersigned have deemed it proper to state to the court the general reasons which have influenced their conclusions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-6\">The former system, which required a fixed and extended time of clerkship in the office of a practicing attorney, to entitle the applicant to an examination, furnished high evidence that he had at least enjoyed abundant opportunities for attaining the requisite qualifications. Under this provision an examination might have been waived or relaxed, or been rendered mere matter of form, with far more safety and propriety than under the present system, which furnishes no safeguard to either courts or community, except the examination of the candidate. So long as the laws prescribe qualifications for attorneys and counsellors, and require that those only who possess \u201c the requisite qualifications of learning and ability \u201d <em>{Constitution of </em>1846, <em>Art. </em>6, \u00a7 8,) shall be entitled to admission; and so long as special licenses to practice are granted, in the opinion of the undersigned, the examination prescribed should be full, complete and thorough, and applicants be rigidly admitted. And whenever this examination shall be frittered away, until it becomes an idle and mischievous ceremony, it will be far better to dispense with the whole system of admissions and licenses, and advise the public that the courts are no longer responsible for the qualifications or integrity of those who are entrusted with their process, and practice as attorneys and advocates.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-7\">It is a delusive idea to suppose that the modern system of practice can be acquired without study, or mastered without training; though in many respects more simple and less cumbrous than the former system, whatever may be its excellences or its defects, the new system has been so intimately interwoven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>up\u00f3n the old, that the successful practitioner must now understand the old system, before he can practice the new, even in a single protracted litigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-5\">The legal student need not expect that he can become qualified for admission to practice by a few months casual and superficial reading. No one can profitably enter upon a course of legal studies, until he has at least a well-grounded English education; and his mind is well stored with general knowledge and information. He must follow his course of professional reading with system, patience and perseverance: when he has mastered Blackstone, Cruise, Kent, Sugden, Comyn, Chitty, Starkey, Greenleaf, Story, and other elementary works, ancient and modern, and made himself familiar with the leading provisions of the Revised Statutes, he will have reached a point where he may begin to peruse the Code with advantage, and contemplate the decisions of the courts with a just appreciation of their conclusions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-6\">The undersigned are by no means unmindful or ignorant of the labor the course recommended imposes upon the candidate for legal honors ; but they deem it as well due to the applicant for admission as to the public, that it should be adopted and rigidly enforced; nor especially are they unmindful of the interests of those who, without pecuniary means or adventitious aids, are struggling to procure an education and admission to the bar. They have seen and felt the obstacles which those thus situated must surmount to attain the object of their wishes, and would place no impediments in their pathway. But all experience has proved, that nothing short, of a term of thorough study and training, and that too in the office of a practicing attorney, will ever make a lawyer. As well might the surgeon become qualified to practice his profession away from the subject, the mechanic to acquire his art by the abstract study of his trade, or the chemist away from his laboratory, as the legal student to become qualified to practice by merely reading, without practical office education. Sir Edward Coke truly said of the profession, that \u201cthe study was abstruse and difficult, the occasion sudden, the practice dangerous.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Many members of the bar, under a system requiring a long and fixed time of study, when courts were more inaccessible than they now are, the expenses of admission much greater, and facilities less, have illustrated the truth, that even with no other advantages, industry, economy and perseverance will finally reward the efforts of those who sternly practice these \u25a0 sterling and cardinal virtues.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-5\">An attorney at law stands in a most interesting and responsible relation to society, and has no apology for ignorance. The last and dearest interests of individuals in every walk of life are daily confided to his keeping. The life, liberty, character and material interests of clients depend constantly upon his-integrity and skill. His license is evidence that the courts regard him as competent to discharge his duties by reason of approved integrity and learning, and the generous confidence which society has at all times extended to the profession, demands that those only possessing these qualifications should, under any circumstances, be admitted to practice as attorneys and counsellors of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-6\">Daniel S. Dickinson,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2\">Samuel Gordon,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-7\">Henry R.
