But only ten freeholders certified that such highway was necessary and proper; and as Ross did not consent to the laying of such highway, the commissioners of highways of the town of Preston made an order refusing to lay out such highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-5\">Afterwards, on or about the <em>22d </em>day of June, 1855. Asa Scott made an application to the commissioners of highways of Preston to lay out a public highway on or near the same route, through the inclosed, improved and cultivated lands of Ross, Daniel and Arnold Wait, situated in Preston. But Ross did not consent to the laying of such highway, and twelve freeholders of Preston did not certify that such highway was necessary and proper, and no notice was given of a time or place that freeholders would meet to examine or certify as to the necessity and propriety of such highway. And the commissioners of highways of Preston, on the 30th of June, 1855, made an order refusing to lay out such highway. But an appeal was taken from such order to the county judge of Chenango county; and he appointed three referees to hear and determine the appeal. And two of the <em>referees on </em>the 10th day of November, 1855, made a decision, by which they reversed the order appealed from, and laid out the highway as applied for by Scott. The commissioners have not taken any steps for the opening or working of the highway laid out by the two referees; nor has such highway been opened or \"worked, or regarded by the commissioners as legally laid out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-6\">On the 5th day of June, 1856, Arnold Wait, Daniel Wait and Hiram Hale, residents of the town of Norwich, who were liable to be assessed for highway labor, and owned lands in the town of Preston, presented an application to the commissioners of highways of Preston, by which they asked for the laying out a public highway through the inclosed, improved and cultivated lands of Augustus Ross and Daniel and Arnold Wait in Preston, on or near the same route that the two referees laid out the highway applied for by Asa Scott,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The highway applied for by Hale, Arnold and Daniel Wait is described in their application as, \u201c beginning in the boundary line between the towns of Plymouth and Preston, at the termination of a road running in Plymouth through the lands of Lester Blackman, and thence to run southeasterly in Preston through the inclosed, improved and cultivated lands of Augustus Ross, Arnold and Daniel Wait, until it intersects near Wait\u2019s saw-mill, a road running east and west in Preston through the lands of Ross and Arnold and Daniel Wait, and of Asa Scott and Hiram Hale.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-5\">This application states that Ross did not consent to the laying of such highway. Twelve freeholders duly certified to the necessity and propriety of the proposed highway, and all proceedings were regular in obtaining such certificate. But the commissioners of highways of Preston afterwards refused, and still do refuse, to act upon such certificate, or to make any order, either refusing to lay out, or laying out such highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-6\">The relator obtained an alternative mandamus, commanding the defendants, as commissioners of highways of Preston, to make an order either refusing to lay out, or laying out such highway, or to show cause why they did not do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-7\">The defendants have made their return to the mandamus, by which they state, they have refused to make any order whatever upon the application of Hale, Arnold and Daniel Wait, for the laying out of the highway certified to be necessary and proper by twelve freeholders, as aforesaid, for these reasons, viz., 1st. The applicants, Hale and Waits, are non-residents of the town of Preston, and they ask for the laying out of a highway through lands of other persons than theirs in Preston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-8\">2d. That the decision of the referees, laying out a highway on or near the same rout\u00e9 upon the application of Asa Scott, is a bar to the application of Hale and the Waits, and will so remain for the term of four years from the filing of the decision of the referees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-9\">On these facts the court is called upon to determine whether the relator is entitled to a peremptory mandamus, commanding the defendants, as commissioners of highways of Preston, to act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Upon the freeholders\u2019 certificate that was obtained and pre\u00bb rented to them by Hale and the Waits, The return is regarded* by the stipulation presented, as demurred to upon this state of facts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-5\">ewis Kingsley, <em>for relator.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-6\">James W.

The true construction makes the statute read so that every person liable to be assessed for highway labor, and owning lands in a town in which he is not a resident, may apply to the commissioners of highways of the town (in which the lands are situated) to alter, discontinue, o\u00ed lo lay out any road through the same <em>town.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">It was clearly the intention of the legislature to place nonresidents* who own real estate in a town, and who are therein assessed for highway labor, on equal grounds with residents, as to the right to apply for the alteration, discontinuance and laying out of highways in such town. The object and intention of the legislature in enacting this statute may be resorted to in ascertaining its meaning. <em>(The People </em>agt. <em>The Utica Insurance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>Company, </em>15 <em>Johns. </em>358; <em>Jackson </em>agt. Collins, 3 <em>Cowen, </em>89.) Non-resident landholders wanted highways to enable them to pass to and from their lands without being trespassers; and it is fair to infer the legislature intended to authorize them to apply for the laying out of highways according lo their wants and views of what the interests of the public required. And such a construction should be given to the statute in question as will not suffer the intention of the legislature to be defeated-. (15 <em>Johns. </em>358; 3 <em>Cow. </em>89.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The laying out of the highway on or near the same route by two of the three referees appointed by the county judge, was a void proceeding. They laid it through the inclosed, improved and cultivated lands of Augustus Ross, without his consent.; and the applicant therefor did not give notice of any meeting of freeholders, to certify in regard to the necessity and propriety of the highway; (1 <em>R. S. </em>514, \u00a7 59;) nor did he procure a certificate of twelve freeholders that such highway wao necessary and proper. (1 <em>R. S. </em>514, \u00a7 58.) The referees, probably, supposed they had no authority to entertain an ob jection to their acting by reason of such irregularity. <em>(The, Commissioners of highways of Warwick </em>agt. <em>The Judges of Orange </em>County, 13 <em>Wend. </em>432; <em>but see </em>1 Selden, 568.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The commissioners of highways of Preston would be trespassers, if they should open the highway laid out by the referees, or cause it to be worked. <em>(Clark </em>agt. Phelps, 4 <em>Cow. </em>190.) They cannot be compelled by mandamus to open such ljighway, or to cause it to be worked. <em>(Ex parte </em>Clapper, 3 <em>Hill, </em>458.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The defendants\u2019 counsel contends that the decision of the referees is conclusive for the term of <em>four </em>years, unless sooner reversed by certiorari. It is true, the statute declares, that \" their decision, or that of any two of them, shall be conclusive in the premises.\u201d <em>(Laws of </em>1847, <em>chap. </em>455, \u00a7 8.) Also, that \"such decision shall remain unaltered for the term <em>o\u00ed four years </em>from the time the same shall have been filed in the office of the town clerk.\u201d <em>(Laws of </em>1847, <em>chap. </em>455, \u00a7 9.) Such, however, is the effect of the decision of referees only, when the proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>mgs.upon which it is founded are not void by reason of the facts being insufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the commissioners to lay out the highway. But when the commissioners lack jurisdiction to lay out the highway applied for, and make an order refusing to lay it, the decision of referees reversing their order, <em>a\u00f1d </em>laying out such highway, is a nullity. <em>(Harrington </em>agt. <em>The </em>People, 6 <em>Barb. </em>607.) It has no more force than the judgment of a justice of the peace has in an action wherein he never obtained jurisdiction of the parties, by the service of a process, or by a voluntary appearance of the parties before him. Such a judgment is no bar to another action for the same demand included in the judgment. It has no force whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The proceedings on which the referees acted, including their decision, could be reversed by <em>certiorari; </em>(6 <em>Wend. </em>564;) and so a void judgment of a justice of the peace may be reversed on appeal. <em>(Striker </em>agt. <em>Mott, </em>6 <em>Wend. </em>465; <em>id. </em>564.) But a void decision or judgment does not conclude a party to it. (6 <em>Wend. </em>564; 6 <em>Barb. </em>607.) Void judgments and decisions are as no judgments or decisions, as to a party thereto who chooses so to consider the same; and void judgments 'and decisions never affect strangers to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The foregoing conclusions show that the decision of the referees, laying out a highway on or near the route of the one applied for by Hale and the Waits, is entirely void, and therefore no bar to the right of the relator to require the commissioners to act upon the freeholders\u2019 certificate that was procured by Hale and the Waits.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The relator is, therefore, entitled to a peremptory mandamus, commanding the defendants, as commissioners of highways of the town of Preston, to make an order, either laying out, or refusing to lay out, the highway applied for by Hale and the Waits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
