The power, therefore, of punishing the disobedience is with the judge who made the order, and not -with the court. It was said, in the matter of Southurst, (2 <em>Sand. </em>S. <em>C. R. </em>726,) that the Revised Statutes must be referred to as to the mode in which that power is to be exercised <em>\u00a1 </em>and as the Code does not point out the mode of proceeding, the provisions of the Revised Statutes respecting proceedings for contempt are given to the court, and an attachment therefor is necessarily returnable be\u00bf fore the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">But in this case the power to punish is given to the judge, and not to the court, and the attachment must be returnable before him, as he alone can exercise the power. Under a special act, <em>(Laws of </em>1840, <em>p. </em>222,) a proceeding commenced before any one of the judges of this court may be continued before another judge of this court. But that does not help this case. The process here is returnable before the court, and the court, as such, can order no action in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The defendant must, therefore, be discharged from custody.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
