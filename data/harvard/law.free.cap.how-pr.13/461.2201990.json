S. p. </em>191,) it is decided, in order to have this effect in an appeal to the court of appeals, the sureties must justify in double the amount (|250) required to be inserted in the undertaking, to cover the costs of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">The undertaking in this case is deficient in this very respect; the sureties justify only in double the amount of the judgment, without reference at all to the security for costs. It cannot, therefore, properly stay proceedings; and, by \u00a7 282, this motion cannot be granted unless the undertaking is sufficient to stay the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">Motion denied, with $5 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
