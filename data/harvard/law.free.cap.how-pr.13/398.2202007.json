Cutting. Each of these judgments was rendered in pursuance of the provisions of the mechanics\u2019 lien law. <em>(See Sess. Laws of </em>1852, <em>p. </em>611; <em>id. </em>1853, <em>p. </em>809.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-10\">The claim of the plaintiff, in each suit, was for work and labor done for one Jackson, upon a house which Jackson was building for the relator, under a contract. The plaintiffs severally served upon the relator a specification of their claims, and notice to appear before the justices\u2019 court at a time and place specified, according to the provisions of the act. Pursuant to the notice, the parties appeared, and the relator put in his answer, and issue was joined. Upon the trial of these issues, judgments were rendered as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-11\">From these judgments the relator, in due form, appealed to the Rensselaer county court. Returns were made to the appeals, and the causes were noticed for argument and placed upon the calendar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-12\">When the causes were moved for argument, the counsel for the plaintiffs in the judgments objected that the court had no jurisdiction to review a judgment rendered under the provisions of the act above mentioned. The county judge so held, and refused to hear the causes argued upon the appeals, and made an order that the same be dismissed. Upon these facts, the relator moved for a mandamus, requiring the county judge to vacate the orders dismissing the appeals, and to proceed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>hear and determine the same, in the same manner and with the like effect as other appeals from justices\u2019 courts are heard and decided.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-5\">G.

The appellate jurisdiction of the county court, therefore, embraces all judgments rendered by a justice\u2019s court in civil actions, or, as they are called in the 351st section of the Code, \u201c civil cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The question now to be decided is, whether the judgments which the relator seeks to have reviewed, are judgments in civil actions or cases, within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Various attempts have been made to define an action. The last, of which I am aware, is that made in framing the Code. Its definition, as now amended, is, that it is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice, by which one party prosecutes another for the enforcement of a right, &amp;c. It must be conceded, I think, that this definition is not remarkable for its perspicuity or distinctness. I suppose, myself, that any judicial proceeding which, if conducted to a termination, will result in <em>a judgment, </em>is an action. Hence the definition of a judgment, as given in the 245th section of the Code, is, that it is the final determination of the rights of the parties <em>in an action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">There are various modes of commencing an action. In courts of record, since the adoption of the Code, it must be by summons, served upon the party in some one of the modes prescribed, .or by voluntary appearance, which is regarded as equivalent to a personal service. Other modes have been, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>may be prescribed in particular cases. In justices\u2019 courts it may be commenced by summons, warrant, or attachment, or in whatever mode the legislature may prescribe. The character and effect of the judgment may differ, according to the mode in which the action is commenced; but if the proceeding result in a judgment, it is an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Applying this test to the adjudications in question, there can be no doubt that they are <em>judgments in civil actions. </em>It is true, the proceedings were instituted by the service of what the, statute calls a notice, requiring the defendant to appear, &amp;c. But whether the defendant appear according to the exigency of this notice or not, the court proceeds to dispose of the case, as it does other cases after due service of process. If the defendant does not appear, judgment upon default is rendered against him, as in other cases. If he does appear, issue is to be joined, and then the parties proceed to trial and judgment in all respects as in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">This view of the question is strongly supported by the uniform practice of other courts, in kindred cases arising under similar statutes. The act under which the proceedings in question were had is, substantially, a copy of the New-York lien law of 1851. <em>(Sess. Laws, </em>1851, <em>p. </em>953.)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Appeals have frequently been brought from the judgments of the marine court and justices\u2019 courts in New-York, in proceedings instituted under this law, to the New-York common pleas, and have always been entertained. The fact that no objection appears to have been made to the right of the court to review these judgments, should not impair the value of the precedent. <em>(See Sullivan </em>agt. <em>Brewster, </em>8 <em>How. </em>207; <em>Cronk </em>agt. <em>Whitaker, </em>1 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>647; <em>M\u2018Bride </em>agt. <em>Crawford, id. </em>658; <em>Cronkright </em>agt. <em>Thomson, id. </em>661; <em>Hauptman </em>agt. <em>Halsey, id. 668\u2014and many other cases under same law reported in same volume.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">I am of opinion that the county judge erred in refusing to entertain the appeals for want of jurisdiction, and that he ought to be required to reinstate the appeals, and hear and decide them. The motion is, therefore, granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
