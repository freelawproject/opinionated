United States, </em>No. 00-447C, 2003 U.S. Claims LEXIS 238 (Fed.Cl. Aug.11, 2003). Appellants received overtime compensation, apparently pursuant to the Federal Employees Pay Act (\u201cFEPA\u201d), codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5542, at a rate less than one-and-one-half times their regular rate of pay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants assert entitlement to overtime compensation at the rate specified under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-219, which is at least one- and-one-half times them regular rate of pay, rather than at the lower rate provided for in the FEPA. In other words, Appellants seek to recover as damages the difference between what they received under the FEPA versus the amount they would have received under the FLSA (\u201cunderpaid overtime compensation\u201d). The case was submitted for decision after oral argument on September 7, 2004. Because Appellants do not have a cognizable property interest in either the underpaid overtime compensation or in an administrative claim thereto within the meaning of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">1. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">A. Statute of Limitations Applicable to FLSA Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">The FLSA provides overtime compensation to certain employees who work more than forty hours per week at a rate not less than one-and-one-half times the employees\u2019 regular rate of compensation. This statute originally did not cover federal employees. In 1974, however, Congress extended it to federal employees, but exempted those classified as executive, administrative, or professional. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 213(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-15\">To recover unpaid overtime compensation under the FLSA, a federal employee may file either an action at law or a claim before the General Accounting Office (\u201cGAO\u201d). Actions at law brought under the FLSA are subject to the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>limitations provided in the Portal-to-Portal Pay Act, codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 251-262, which provides for a two-year limitations period for cases in which the FLSA violation is non-willful and a three-year period where the violation is willful. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The statute of limitations for administrative claims before the GAO initially was selected, then revised by, the Comptroller General of the United States and twice altered by Congress. The numerous changes in the statute of limitations for claims before the GAO, in part, create the backdrop of the instant takings claim. Therefore, it is important to have a general understanding of the evolution of the limitations periods involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">In 1978, the Comptroller General ruled that the statute of limitations for FLSA claims before the GAO was not the statutory period specific to FLSA claims, but was six years as set forth in the more generally applicable Barring Act, codified at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(b). <em>In re Transp. Sys. Ctr., </em>57 Comp. Gen. 441 (1978). Sixteen years later, on May 24, 1994, the Comptroller General effectively changed the statute of limitations for FLSA claims before the GAO from six years to two years for non-willful violations and three years for willful violations, essentially recognizing as applicable the limitations period specifically set for FLSA claims in the Portal-to-Portal Pay Act. <em>In re Ford, </em>73 Comp. Gen. 157 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Shortly thereafter, on September 30, 1994, Congress enacted the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act of 1995, Pub.L. No. 103-329, 108 Stat. 2383, 2432 (1994). Section 640 of that act mandated that the Comptroller General apply a six-year statute of limitations period to any administrative claim under the FLSA filed prior to June 30, 1994, and a two-year statute of limitations period to any such claim filed after June 30,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">On November 19, 1995, Congress enacted the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-52, 109 Stat. 468, 468-69 (1995), which amended Section 640 to further limit the types of FLSA claims that may be decided by the GAO (\u201camended Section 640\u201d). Amended Section 640 precluded, among other changes, application of the six-year statute of limitations originally set forth in Section 640 to employees who had received overtime compensation under another provision of law. Thus, those employees were limited to the two-year statute of limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">B. Appellants\u2019 Status Under the FLSA</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 551.201, the BATF, the DEA, the IRS, the Customs Service, and the USSS independently determined, as the respective employing agencies, that Appellants were administrative employees exempt from the FLSA and its overtime provisions. In making this determination, the employing agencies evaluated whether Appellants\u2019 duties met the administrative exemption criteria set forth in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 551.206. Significantly, Appellants were presumed to be non-exempt under the civil service regulations, thereby requiring the employing agencies to carry the burden of establishing that the Appellants met the criteria of \u00a7 551.206. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 551.202(a), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">Dissatisfied with this exemption determination, Appellants filed an action at law under the Tucker Act, codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, against the Government in the United States Court of Federal Claims. Simultaneously, Appellants filed identical administrative claims before the GAO. In both proceedings, Appellants alleged that they were improperly ruled ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>empt from the FLSA and were entitled to damages flowing from this misclassification. In a decision dated October 30,1992, the Court of Federal Claims concluded that some of the Appellants were exempt, while others were non-exempt. <em>Adams v. United States, </em>27 Fed.Cl. 5, 28-29 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">On September 23, 1998, we partially reversed the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 ruling in a non-precedential opinion and remanded the case for further proceedings as to those criminal investigators held exempted from the FLSA. <em>Adams v. United States, </em>No. 98-5011, 1998 WL 804552, 1998 U.S.App. LEXIS 23565 (Fed.Cir. Sept. 23, 1998) (Table). That case remains pending before the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">C. Prior Court Proceedings Leading to the Instant Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">On October 27, 1995, prior to the enactment of amended Section 640, Appellants filed suit against the Government in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking mandamus, injunctive, and declaratory relief against the GAO for its inactivity on their administrative claims. Following the enactment of amended Section 640, Appellants twice supplemented their complaint to challenge the constitutionality of original Section 640 and amended Section 640 under the Due Process and Takings Clauses of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">On October 12, 1996, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Government. <em>Adams v. Bowsher, </em>946 F.Supp. 37 (D.D.C.1996). The district court addressed Appellants\u2019 due process arguments, ultimately concluding that neither Section 640 nor amended Section 640 violated the Due Process Clause. As to Appellants\u2019 takings claim, the district court concluded that a compensable taking did not occur, based upon the three factors set forth for regulatory takings in <em>Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., </em>475 U.S. 211, 224-25,106 S.Ct. 1018, 89 L.Ed.2d 166 (1986). <em>Adams, </em>946 F.Supp. at 44. Appellants appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">On August 28, 1998, the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s decision on the due process claim, but reversed its decision on Appellants\u2019 takings claim. <em>Adams v. Hinchman, </em>154 F.3d 420 (D.C.Cir.1998). The circuit court noted that takings claims for amounts greater than $10,000 fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims pursuant to the Tucker Act. <em>Id. </em>at 425-426. Consequently, the circuit court concluded that the district court might lack jurisdiction to entertain Appellants\u2019 takings claim and remanded the takings claim to the district court to determine whether jurisdiction was proper under the Little Tucker Act, codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2), for claims of less than $10,000, which lodges concurrent jurisdiction in the district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">On March 30, 2000, the district court issued an opinion answering the jurisdictional question posed by the circuit court. <em>Adams v. Walker, </em>No. 95-2015 (D.D.C.Mar.30, 2000). The district court noted that Appellants sought to amend their complaint to allege an amount in controversy in excess of $10,000. The district court stated that the circuit court \u201cessentially rejected [Appellants\u2019] claim for injunctive relief and viewed it instead as a claim for money damages.\u201d <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 5. Hence, the district court concluded that justice required it to allow Appellants to amend their complaint and, therefore, to transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims. <em>Id., </em>slip. op. at 6. The district court thus vacated its ruling concerning Appellants\u2019 takings claim and ordered the case transferred to the Court of Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Claims pursuant to the transfer provision in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. <em>Id., </em>slip. op. at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">D. The Court of Federal Claims Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">On August 4, 2000, after transfer from the district court to the Court of Federal Claims, Appellants' complaint claimed that three separate governmental actions effected a taking of their property under the Fifth Amendment: (1) the Comptroller General\u2019s <em>Ford </em>decision that retroactively applied a two- or three-year statute of limitations to their administrative claims instead of the six-year statute of limitations; (2) the GAO\u2019s failure and refusal in the intervening year to apply the original Section 640 to their administrative claims; and (3) Congress\u2019s amendment of Section 640 in late 1995 restricting restoration of the six-year limitations period to situations where no overtime was paid at all. In response, the Government asserted that Appellants\u2019 case is merely a standard FLSA entitlement case disguised as a Fifth Amendment takings claim. Put differently, the Government argued that Appellants\u2019 claim is one for statutory entitlement under the FLSA because the only property allegedly taken was FLSA overtime compensation. The Government also argued that a claim to FLSA overtime compensation is not \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of the Takings Clause, and subsequently moved to dismiss the complaint under Court of Federal Claims Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and Court of Federal Claims Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">The trial court distilled the parties\u2019 arguments to a single issue: whether Appellants\u2019 claim involves \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Adams, </em>2003 U.S. Claims LEXIS 238 at *20. To address that issue, the trial court considered Appellants\u2019 claim for underpaid overtime compensation separate from Appellants\u2019 administrative claim. Relying on <em>Commonwealth Edison Co. v. United States, </em>271 F.3d 1327 (Fed.Cir. 2001) (en banc), the trial court held that a governmental obligation to pay money pursuant to a statute is not a protected \u201cproperty\u201d interest under the Takings Clause. <em>Adams, </em>2003 U.S. Claims LEXIS 238 at *20. In reaching that holding, the trial court focused its analysis on the identification of a true property interest but concluded that \u201c[a]ll the [appellants] have identified is a run-of-the-mill claim for liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *27. Additionally, the court reasoned that even if a statutory right to payment could be considered \u201cproperty,\u201d the Government had not \u201ctaken\u201d Appellants\u2019 money for its own use; it simply did not pay them because it determined after analysis that they were exempt from the FLSA. <em>Id. </em>at *30.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">As for Appellants\u2019 administrative claim, the court observed that the abolition of a cause of action may rise to the level of a taking, but only if the cause of action secures a \u201clegally protected interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *40. For that reason, the court concluded that Appellants\u2019 administrative claim also must fail, since the interest underlying this claim is not cognizable as a property right protected by the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the court noted that the district court and District of Columbia Circuit already had rejected Appellants\u2019 due process claims. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded, therefore, that no cause of action to protect Appellants\u2019 property or procedural rights had been unconstitutionally taken from them. <em>Id. </em>at *41. Accordingly, the Court of Federal Claims granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and ordered entry of final judgment in favor of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Appellants timely appealed, arguing that the Court of Federal Claims erred in deciding that they did not have a property interest in either FLSA overtime compensation, or an administrative claim thereto, cognizable under the Takings Clause. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3) because the appeal is from a final judgment of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The Court of Federal Claims did not explicitly state whether the motion to dismiss was granted under Rule 12(b)(1) or under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims. Nevertheless, it appears that the Government did not present an exclusively jurisdictional argument, which would invoke Rule 12(b)(1). Additionally, the Court of Federal Claims focused on the merits of Appellants\u2019 case in its opinion. Therefore, the Court of Federal Claims can best be described as having granted the motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Court of Federal Claims for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Dismissal for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is proper only when a plaintiff \u201c \u2018can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leider v. United States, </em>301 F.3d 1290, 1295 (Fed.Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). In reviewing the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we must assume that all well-pled factual allegations in the complaint are true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant. <em>See Leider, </em>301 F.3d at 1295. Whether the Court of Federal Claims properly dismissed Appellants\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is a question of law which we review <em>de novo. See id. </em>(citing <em>Boyle v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 1369, 1372 (Fed.Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">B. The Takings Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides, in pertinent part: \u201cnor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V, cl. 4. A claimant under the Takings Clause must show that the government, by some specific action, took a private property interest for a public use without just compensation. <em>Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Ass\u2019n, </em>452 U.S. 264, 294, 101 S.Ct. 2352, 69 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981). In evaluating a takings claim, we have developed a two-step approach. First, we determine whether the claimant possessed a cognizable property interest in the subject of the alleged taking for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, <em>i.e., </em>whether the claimant possessed a \u201cstick in the bundle of property rights.\u201d <em>Karuk Tribe of Cal. v. Ammon, </em>209 F.3d 1366, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2000) (internal citation omitted). Second, once we have determined that such a property interest exists, we decide \u201cwhether the governmental action at issue constituted a taking of that \u2018stick.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>M &amp; J Coal Co. v. United States, </em>47 F.3d 1148, 1154 (Fed.Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">In this case, our analysis focuses on the threshold requirement of a recognized property interest, <em>i.e., </em>whether Appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>possessed any cognizable property interests within the meaning of the Takings Clause in either FLSA overtime compensation or in an administrative claim thereto. The Constitution itself neither creates nor defines the property interests that if taken by the government are compensable under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). Rather, \u201cexisting rules or understandings that stem from an independent source,\u201d such as state, federal, or common law, create and define the dimensions of property interests for purposes of establishing a cognizable right and hence a potential taking. <em>Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003, 1030, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798 (1992). We have observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApO\">Property interests are about as diverse as the human mind can conceive. Property interests may be real and personal, tangible and intangible, possessory and nonpossessory. They can be defined in terms of sequential rights to possession (present interests \u2014 life estates and various types of fees \u2014 and future interests), and in terms of shared interests (such as those of a mortgagee, lessee, bailee, adverse possessor), and there are interests in special kinds of things (such as water, and commercial contracts). And property interests play across the entire range of legal ideas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-5\"><em>Fla. Rock Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>18 F.3d 1560, 1572 n. 32 (Fed.Cir.1994). In light of the complex nature of property interests and associated rights, we must identify the precise nature of Appellants\u2019 takings claim on appeal. Appellants argue, as they did before the Court of Federal Claims, that two specific property interests are implicated, namely, an interest in payment of underpaid overtime compensation according to FLSA rates and an interest in an administrative claim thereto before the GAO. We consider each of these alleged property interests in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">i. Do Appellants Possess a Cognizable Property Interest in Their Asserted Right to Underpaid Overtime Compensation According to FLSA Rates?</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Appellants argue that as of November 18, 1995, they possessed a valid claim against the Government for six years of underpaid overtime compensation. Appellants contend that when Congress amended Section 640 on November 19, 1995, reducing the limitations period for certain claims from six to two years, the Government confiscated via a <em>per se </em>taking four years of their claim for underpaid overtime compensation under the FLSA without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Appellants assert that vested property rights may be created by either statute or contract, proceeding on both theories in the alternative. Focusing first on statutory grounds, Appellants contend that they acquired property rights in underpaid overtime compensation under the FLSA for six previous years because such rights vested at the end of each pay period during which they worked hours of overtime, and the statute of limitations was six years. Appellants assert that the Government was obligated as a matter of law to pay them for these overtime hours at the FLSA rate <em>(ie., </em>at least one-and-one-half times their regular rate), not at any lesser rate under the FEPA or any other statute. As examples of cases that recognize property interests and derivative rights created by statute, Appellants cite <em>United States v. Larionoff, </em>431 U.S. 864, 97 S.Ct. 2150, 53 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977), <em>Zucker v. United States, </em>758 F.2d 637 (Fed.Cir.1985), and <em>Kizas v. Webster, </em>707 F.2d 524 (D.C.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>We disagree that Appellants own any Fifth Amendment property interest pursuant to the FLSA statute. Appellants confuse a property right cognizable under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment with a due process right to payment of a monetary entitlement under a compensation statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Larionoff, Zucker, </em>and <em>Kizas </em>are inapposite because each involves enforcing a statutory entitlement to compensation for employment, not recognizing the predicate for a takings claim. In <em>Larionoff, </em>the Supreme Court considered a soldier\u2019s entitlement to a reenlistment bonus under the statutory Variable Reenlistment Bonus Program. 431 U.S. at 866, 97 S.Ct. 2150. Similarly, in <em>Zucker, </em>we decided civil servant retirees\u2019 entitlement to cost-of-living-adjustments under the Civil Service Retirement Act, while in <em>Rizas, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit addressed FBI agents\u2019 entitlement to a \u201cspecial preference\u201d as an element of compensation under Title 5 of the United States Code. <em>Zucker, </em>758 F.2d at 639-40; <em>Kizas, </em>707 F.2d at 534-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Appellants alternatively contend that the assertedly applicable FLSA rate of overtime compensation became a contractual right once the work was completed. Appellants rely on a passage from <em>Fisk v. Jefferson Police Jury, </em>116 U.S. 131, 6 S.Ct. 329, 29 L.Ed. 587 (1885), to support that contention: \u201cBut after the services have been rendered, under a law, resolution, or ordinance which fixes the rate of compensation, there arises an implied contract to pay for the services at that rate. This contract is a completed contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133-34, 6 S.Ct. 329. Pursuing a contract theory, Appellants contend that they acquired vested property rights to the underpaid overtime compensation via an implied contract with the Government formed when they completed the overtime work. For support, Appellants cite to selected cases, such as <em>Lynch v. United States, </em>292 U.S. 571, 54 S.Ct. 840, 78 L.Ed. 1434 (1934), wherein courts have found that sometimes rights arising out of a contract can be protected by the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Appellants\u2019 contract theory is without merit. At the outset, Appellants mischaracterize <em>Fisk. </em>The plaintiff in <em>Fisk </em>served as a Louisiana parish district attorney by appointment, and a municipal law fixed his salary. When the Parish of Jefferson failed to pay his salary for four years, plaintiff sued in state court for recovery, requesting a writ of mandamus to compel the parish to assess and collect a tax for the payment of his salary. The Supreme Court of Louisiana denied the writ based upon a provision of the Louisiana Constitution limiting the power to levy a tax. The plaintiff sought review in the United States Supreme Court, arguing that the Louisiana constitutional provision impaired the obligation of his contract as guaranteed by the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>Fisk, </em>116 U.S. at 133, 6 S.Ct. 329. The United States Supreme Court agreed, concluding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">[the plaintiffs] appointment as district attorney was lawful and was a request made to him by the proper authority to render the services demanded of that office. He did render these services for the parish, and the obligation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>police jury to pay for them was complete. Not only were the services requested and rendered, and the obligation to pay for them perfect, but the measure of compensation was also fixed by the previous order of the police jury. There was here wanting no element of a contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 134, 6 S.Ct. 329. Thus, <em>Fisk </em>involved an unconstitutional provision of state law and was decided under the Contracts Clause, not the Takings Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Appellants cite no case law to show that either the United States Supreme Court or this court would view a takings claim against the United States in the same light. Like all federal employees, Appellants served by appointment. The terms of their employment and compensation, consequently, were governed exclusively by statute, not contract. They had not, and could not have, entered into any separate agreement with the Government, express or implied, for additional overtime compensation beyond that to which they were entitled by the applicable statute. Hence, contrary to Appellants\u2019 characterization of their entitlement to underpaid overtime compensation as based on an implied contract, Appellants had nothing more than a unilateral expectation to receive FLSA, rather than FEPA, overtime compensation for their hours of overtime work. Indeed, the District of Columbia Circuit previously recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW9\">federal workers serve by appointment, and their rights are therefore a matter of legal status even where compacts are made. In other words, their entitlement to pay and other benefits must be determined by reference to the statutes and regulations governing [compensation], rather than to ordinary contract principles. Though a distinction between appointment and contract may sound dissonant in a regime accustomed to the principle that the employment relationship has its ultimate basis in contract, the distinction nevertheless prevails in government service. Applying these doctrines, courts have consistently refused to give effect to government-fostered expectations that, had they arisen in the private sector, might well have formed the basis for a contract or an estoppel. These cases have involved, <em>inter alia, </em>promises of appointment to a particular grade or step level, promises of promotion upon satisfaction of certain conditions, promises of extra compensation in exchange for extra services, and promises of other employment benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-8\"><em>Kizas, 707 </em>F.2d at 535 (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">Furthermore, Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Lynch </em>is misplaced. In <em>Lynch, </em>despite the government having duly issued the insured a lawful insurance policy, Congress abrogated by legislation all such policies in force. Here, unlike in <em>Lynch, </em>the Government did not enter into any private agreement with Appellants regarding the terms or rates of Appellants\u2019 overtime compensation, and Congress did not abrogate any such contract. The Government, in fact, could not have contracted to pay Appellants for overtime work at a rate of at least one-and-one-half them regular rate of pay because, like all government employees, Appellants\u2019 compensation is governed exclusively by statute. Consequently, as previously stated, Appellants cannot be contractually entitled to overtime compensation at the rate specified under the FLSA or any other pay statute. When the Government and private parties contract, as in <em>Lynch, </em>the private party usually acquires an intangible property interest within the meaning of the Takings Clause in the contract. The express rights under this contract are just as concrete as the inherent rights arising from ownership of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>real property, personal property, or an actual sum of money. Here, no contract established in Appellants a property interest in overtime compensation at a particular rate under the FLSA. Because Appellants cannot show that they had a contract with the Government, they are not entitled to Takings Clause protection under <em>Lynch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Extending its contract theory, Appellants particularly equate the Government\u2019s alleged statutory obligation to pay them overtime compensation at the FLSA rate with a debt owed by a debtor to a lender. They use the word \u201cdebt\u201d repeatedly, but they distort the meaning of this word. That is, Appellants claim that when they performed the overtime work, the Government incurred a debt commensurate with paying them for their labor at the FLSA rate, not a lesser rate under an alternative overtime pay statute. Appellants contend, in turn, that paying this \u201cdebt\u201d is akin to paying the insurance policy proceeds in <em>Lynch </em>or the gold standard bonds in <em>Perry v. United States, </em>294 U.S. 330, <em>55 </em>S.Ct. 432, 79 L.Ed. 912 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Appellants\u2019 argument is wholly unpersuasive. In <em>Lynch, </em>an insured purchased a war insurance policy from the United States, effectively lending money to the Government in exchange for future payment on the value of the policy at the time of the insured\u2019s death. 292 U.S. at 574-75, 54 S.Ct. 840. Likewise, in <em>Perry, </em>the bond owner purchased a gold bond from the United States, also in effect lending money to the Government in exchange for payment of the principal amount of the bond plus interest in gold coins. 294 U.S. at 346-47, 55 S.Ct. 432. In both eases, the Government agreed with the lenders, <em>i.e., </em>the insured and the bond owner, to make future payment of either the policy amount in the case of a war insurance policy or the bond principal plus interest in the case of the gold bond in exchange for the immediate use of their money. Also, the Government\u2019s \u201cdebt\u201d to the insured and the bond owner was evidenced in a legal instrument issued by the Government to acknowledge and create the debt, respectively an insurance policy and a bond certificate. Here, as stated above, the Government and Appellants did not, and could not have, agreed that the Appellants would \u201cloan\u201d their underpaid overtime compensation to the Government in exchange for a \u201cdebt\u201d owed by the Government to them. Additionally, the Government issued no underlying legal instrument evidencing the Government\u2019s agreement to a loan. The only legal instrument, the Form 50, rather than acknowledging Appellants\u2019 right to be paid for overtime at the rate specified in the FLSA, instead indicated that the FLSA did not apply to them. Thus, Appellants are not in the same position as the insured and bond holder in <em>Lynch </em>and <em>Perry, </em>but instead are in the opposite position. Accordingly, as the Government argues, Appellants are not owed a debt; they have nothing more than a bald allegation that they are owed underpaid overtime compensation by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Lastly, Appellants argue that the Court of Federal Claims misunderstood and misapplied our <em>Commonwealth Edison </em>decision. Appellants assert that this court in <em>Commonwealth Edison </em>did not intend to suggest by using the phrase \u201cspecific fund of money\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the Takings Clause ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>plies only when a particular sum or account is at stake. Rather, Appellants contend that this court used the phrase merely to distinguish between an obligation imposed by the Government to pay money to achieve a regulatory objective, as in that case, and confiscation of specific money by the Government, as in a classic per <em>se </em>taking, which Appellants argue occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">New England Legal Foundation (\u201cNELF\u201d), as amicus curiae,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> advances a similar argument, going so far as to assert that the alleged underpaid overtime compensation is a \u201cfund of money.\u201d NELF reaches this position by advocating that \u201c[t]he key to a \u2018fund of money\u2019 is that it must be \u2018specific\u2019 and \u2018separately identifiable,\u2019 not that it be kept in a separate account.\u201d In other words, NELF appears to claim that as long as the money allegedly owed is both \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201cseparately identifiable,\u201d then it qualifies as a protected \u201cfund of money.\u201d NELF contends that Appellants theoretically could calculate the amount of underpaid overtime compensation by multiplying the total number of overtime hours by the applicable overtime rate under the FLSA. Accordingly, NELF asserts that the amount of underpaid overtime compensation due to Appellants is both \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201cseparately identifiable,\u201d even if it is not maintained in a separate account by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The Government seeks to refute Appellants\u2019 and NELF\u2019s positions, arguing that the Court of Federal Claims was correct that an ordinary statutory obligation to pay money can never constitute property for purposes of the Takings Clause. The Government asserts that Appellants and NELF plainly ignore the holding in <em>Commonwealth Edison </em>and attempt to distinguish that case based on differences between the facts there and those here that are immaterial. Additionally, the Government claims that NELF fails to explain how the alleged underpaid overtime compensation is any more a \u201cfund of money\u201d than the obligation to pay money in <em>Commonwealth Edison. </em>Indeed, the Government further contends the allegedly underpaid overtime compensation here is even less a \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201cseparately identifiable\u201d fund than the monetary obligation in <em>Commonwealth Edison.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Like the Government, we do not read <em>Commonwealth Edison </em>in the same light as either Appellants or NELF. In <em>Commonwealth Edison, </em>Congress imposed a monetary assessment in the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Pub.L. No. 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776 (codified as amended in various sections of 42 U.S.C.), on all domestic utilities such as Commonwealth Edison that used uranium re-processing facilities operated on their behalf by the United States Department of Energy. Under the Energy Policy Act, the Government was to use the revenue generated by the assessment to fund part of the cost of environmental remediation of its contaminated re-processing facilities. We held that Congress did not effect a taking within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment by imposing a statutory obligation to pay money on the utility companies. <em>Commonwealth Edison, </em>271 F.3d at 1340. In reaching this conclusion, we followed the views of a majority<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the justices of the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>Court in <em>Eastern Enterprises. Id. </em>at 1338. In that case, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992, codified at 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9701-9722 (the \u201cCoal Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The Coal Act required certain coal mine operators to fund future health benefits of former coal mine employees of defunct companies, even though the paying, extant companies never employed them. Writing for the plurality, Justice O\u2019Con-nor, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas, concluded that the retroactive impact of the Coal Act as applied to Eastern Enterprises was an unconstitutional taking because it placed a \u201csevere, disproportionate and extremely retroactive burden\u201d on the extant coal operators. <em>E. Enters., </em>524 U.S. at 538, 118 S.Ct. 2131. While concurring in the result, Justice Kennedy disagreed with the plurality\u2019s conclusion that an obligation to pay money can support a taking, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvF\">[the Coal Act] does not operate upon or alter an identified property interest, and it is not applicable to or measured by a property interest. The Coal Act does not appropriate, transfer, or encumber an estate in land <em>{e.g., </em>a lien on a particular piece of property), a valuable interest in an intangible <em>{e.g., </em>intellectual property), or even a bank account or accrued interest. The law simply imposes an obligation to perform an act, the payment of benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 540, 118 S.Ct. 2131. Indeed, the four dissenters, namely, Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, specifically \u201cagreed that the Takings Clause was not implicated because \u2018the private property upon which the [Takings] Clause traditionally has focused is a specific interest in physical or intellectual property.... This case involves not an interest in physical or intellectual property, but an ordinary liability to pay money.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554, 118 S.Ct. 2131. We thus held in <em>Commonwealth Edison </em>that \u201cthe mere imposition of an obligation to pay money, as here, does not give rise to a claim under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth Edison, </em>271 F.3d at 1340. Given the precise language found in Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence and the dissent, we premised our holding in <em>Commonwealth Edison </em>not on whether the statutory obligation was imposed for purposes of regulation or confiscation as suggested by Appellants, but rather on the nature of the interest in dispute <em>(i.e., </em>a legally-recognized property interest such as one in real estate, personal property, or intellectual property, versus an ordinary obligation to pay money). The former is protected as property under the Takings Clause, whereas the latter is not because it lacks any foundation in property law.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">We also took care in <em>Commonwealth Edison </em>to distinguish the specific funds implicated in <em>Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, </em>524 U.S. 156, 118 S.Ct. 1925, 141 L.Ed.2d 174 (1998), and <em>Webb\u2019s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, </em>449 U.S. 155, 101 S.Ct. 446, 66 L.Ed.2d 358 (1980), as legitimate property interests from statutory obligations to pay money. 271 F.3d at 1338. Particularly, we noted that each contributor\u2019s share of interest income generated by funds held in a specific, consolidated Interest on Lawyers Trust Account, commonly known as an IOLTA account, is the private property of that contributor for purposes of the Takings Clause. <em>See Phillips, </em>524 U.S. at 160, 118 S.Ct. 1925. Similarly, we observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>that each contributor\u2019s share of interest generated from deposits into a specific, consolidated interpleader account is a property interest of that contributor within the meaning of the Takings Clause. <em>See Webb\u2019s Fabulous Pharmacies, </em>449 U.S. at 164-65, 101 S.Ct. 446. In light of our use of the term \u201cspecific\u201d to mean an actual sum of money representing interest derived from ownership of particular deposits in an established account, as opposed to some abstract sum of money capable of being calculated, NELF\u2019s argument cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">While it may be debatable to what extent the precise holding in <em>Commonwealth Edison </em>controls the instant case, this decision certainly provides the principle for determining how to treat the instant claim of a statutory entitlement to money under the Takings Clause. Both the Government and the Court of Federal Claims correctly noted that <em>Commonwealth Edison </em>clearly suggests that no statutory obligation to pay money, even where unchallenged, can create a property interest within the meaning of the Takings Clause. Here, in Appellants\u2019 claim that the Government is obligated to pay underpaid overtime compensation under the FLSA, we are faced with a statutory obligation to pay money, just as was implicated in <em>Commonwealth Edison. </em>Hence, based upon the principle of <em>Commonwealth Edison, </em>Appellants do not possess a property interest under the Takings Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">What is more, we conclude that a statutory right to be paid money, at least in the context of federal employee compensation and benefit entitlement statutes, is not a property interest for purposes of the Takings Clause. Appellants have neither cited, nor are we independently aware of, any appellate court decision recognizing a statutory obligation to be paid money as a property interest grounded in property law. We decline to treat a statutory right to be paid money as a legally-recognized property interest, as we would real property, physical property, or intellectual property. Instead, we view it as nothing more than an allegation that money is owed. We thus conclude that Appellants cannot prove any set of facts that could support granting their requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">ii. Do Appellants Possess a Cognizable Property Interest in an Administrative Claim to Underpaid Overtime Compensation Before the GAO?</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Appellants argue, but only in a cursory fashion, that as of November 18, 1995, they owned a valid administrative claim before the GAO to recover their unpaid overtime compensation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They contend that when Congress amended Section 640 on November 19, 1995, the Government entirely extinguished their administrative claim to underpaid overtime compensation, effecting a <em>per se </em>taking of their private property without just compensation. Appellants rely on <em>Alliance of Descendants of Texas Land Grants v. United States, </em>37 F.3d 1478 (Fed.Cir.1984), to support their argument that their GAO claim, like certain causes of action, is \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of the Takings Clause. What is more, Appellants maintain that it was immaterial that their claim had not yet been decided by the GAO when Section 640 was amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">Although we agree with Appellants that sometimes a cause of action may fall within the definition of property recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>nized under the Takings Clause, we observe, like the Court of Federal Claims, that precedent has limited the application of the Takings Clause to cases in which the cause of action protects a legally-recognized property interest. <em>See, e.g., Cities Serv. Co. v. McGrath, </em>342 U.S. 330, 72 S.Ct. 334, 96 L.Ed. 359 (1952) (holding that seizure by Alien Property Custodian of interest represented by bond or debenture without seizure of instrument itself is unconstitutional taking of obligor\u2019s property unless he is assured that he has claim against United States for recoupment in the event of subsequent recovery against him in foreign court by holder in due course of debenture). Such is not the case here because, as discussed in detail above, the underlying subject matter of Appellants\u2019 alleged administrative claim fails to qualify as a recognized property interest under the Takings Clause. Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Alliance of Descendants </em>is utterly misplaced because the cause of action there was to recover compensation for an interest in land, a property interest cognizable under established takings jurisprudence because land is, beyond question, property under state and common law. <em>Alliance of Descendants, </em>37 F.3d at 1481. Appellants have not cited any precedent finding such a property interest in a claim of Government liability before an administrative agency. Hence, we conclude that Appellants do not possess a cognizable property interest in any part of their administrative claim before the GAO.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">iii. <em>Per Se </em>Takings Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Because we agree with the Court of Federal Claims that Appellants do not possess any cognizable property interest within the meaning of the Takings Clause, we necessarily hold that the Government could not commit a <em>per se </em>taking without just compensation any more than it could commit a regulatory or any other kind of taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">The order of the Court of Federal Claims granting the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and the resulting judgment for the Government are</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-9\">. Several of those agencies or units thereof have since been renamed and/or merged into the United States Department of Homeland Security. <em>See </em>Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296 \u00a7 1502, 2002 U.S.C.C.A.N. (116 Stat. 2135, 2308 (2002)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b856-16\">. The parties fail to analyze the specific provision under which Appellants received compensation for overtime work. Nevertheless, the Government cited the FEPA in its brief, a citation that was not contradicted in Appellants\u2019 reply brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b860-8\">. Rule 12 of the Court of Federal Claims mirrors Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b862-5\">. Generally, entitlements are considered to be government conferred benefits, safeguarded exclusively by procedural due process. See <em>Bd. of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). In light of this, entitlements are often referred to as \u201cproperty interests\u201d within the meaning of the Due Process Clause in cases decided under that clause, but such references have no relevance to whether they are \"property\u201d under the Takings Clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b864-6\">. The phrase \"fund of money\u201d as used in <em>Commonwealth Edison </em>derives from Justice Breyer's dissent in <em>Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, </em>524 U.S. 498, 118 S.Ct. 2131, 141 L.Ed.2d 451 (1998). Justice Breyer stated: \"But the monetary interest at issue there [referring to <em>Webb\u2019s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, </em>449 U.S. 155, 101 S.Ct. 446, 66 L.Ed.2d 358 (1980)] arose out of the operation of a <em>specific, separately identifiable fund of money.\u201d E.

The Federal Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Association (\"FLEOA\u201d) also presented an amicus curiae brief in support of Appellants\u2019 position.

Notably, there was not a majority opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>Eastern Enterprises. </em>By referring to \"a majority\u201d view herein, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>mean those views expressed in the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy together with those expressed in the dissenting opinion of Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b867-7\">. Appellants devoted little attention to this issue, discussing it only in a handful of paragraphs in their opening and reply briefs.
