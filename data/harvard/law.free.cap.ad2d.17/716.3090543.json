We find insubstantial respondent\u2019s contentions that the provisions of the ordinance requiring ratification by the Town Board were invalid as enacted without statutory authority. The \u201cspecial exceptions\u201d there dealt with differ from variances (1 Rathkopf, Law of Zoning and Planning, ch. 54, pp. 3-5) and were, in our view, properly the subject of an ordinance under the power conferred by section 261 of the Town Law. <em>(Matter of Larkin Co. </em>v. <em>Schwab, </em>242 N. Y. 330, 335-337; 1 Rathkopf, Law of Zoning and Planning, ch. 54, pp. 32, 33.) Nevertheless the Town Board\u2019s action with respect to ratification or disapproval of a special exception was, \u201c for court review purposes \u201d, administrative in nature and \u201c subject to review <em>\u2018 </em>as to reasonableness \u2019 in an article 78 proceeding.\u201d <em>(Matter of Lemir Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>11 N Y 2d 20, 24.) It follows that under familiar principles the Town Board is required, for the purpose of an intelligent review and particularly in view of the rather numerous and detailed standards established by the ordinance itself, to state the reasons for its determination. <em>(Matter of Holmes &amp; Murphy </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>6 A D 2d 200, and <em>eases cited therein.) </em>The board\u2019s action is epitomized in a formal resolution which included no facts upon which its members relied to deny respondent\u2019s application. Thus, it is our \u201cduty to ask the board for its reasons, so as to determine whether they were lawful ones or such as reasonable minds could act on.\u201d <em>(Matter of Lemir Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Larkin, supra, </em>p. 25.) Order appealed from modified by striking therefrom its decretal paragraphs and substituting therefor the following provisions: (1) a provision permitting the Town Board to serve an amended answer containing, as prescribed by statute (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 1291), such facts as may be pertinent and material to show the grounds of the action taken by it which is complained of; (2) a provision permitting the Town Board to serve and submit with such answer affidavits, made by a person having knowledge of the facts, or other written proof, showing such evidentiary facts as shall entitle it to a trial of any issue of fact; and (3) a provision permitting the petitioner, on the service of such papers by the board, to renotice the matter for a hearing on the merits at Special Term, or, if such papers shall not be served within 20 days after service of a copy of the order to be entered hereon, with notice of entry, permitting petitioner to apply for appropriate relief to the Special Term. As so modified, order affirmed, without costs. Bergan, P. J., Gibson, Herlihy, Reynolds and Taylor, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
