Appellee filed a bill for divorce against appellant, her husband, to which he filed a demurrer. Without disposing of the demurrer the chancellor entered an order that defendant pay complainant five dollars per week as temporary alimony, and twenty-five dollars for her solicitors\u2019 fees, and from such interlocutory order the defendant prosecutes this appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-3\" pgmap=\"338\">J.

Therefore if the wife\u2019s petition or answer is without merits\u2014as if she is plaintiff, and sets out no adequate cause for divorce\u2014she cannot have temporary alimony.\u201d 2 Bishop Harr. &amp; Div., section 932; Harding v. Harding, 40 Ill. App., 202; S. C., 144 Ill., 588\u2014596.</p> <p id=\"b338-8\" pgmap=\"338\">The bill was filed July 24, 1906. It alleges that the marriage occurred January 14, 1905, and that defendant deserted complainant June 1, 1905. So far, therefore, as the bill attempts to set up desertion, as a ground of divorce, it is clearly insufficient because the desertion alleged was for a less period than two years prior to the filing of the bill.</p> <p id=\"b338-9\" pgmap=\"338\">The bill also alleges that: \u201cthe defendant has, for a considerable time past, given himself over to adulterous practices and is now living an adulterous life.\u201d This is only an averment of a conclusion, that defendant\u2019s life and practices were adulterous, not an averment that defendant had committed adultery, and is therefore insufficient. If the allegation could be held to amount to a charge that the defendant had committed adultery, it would still be insufficient because it fails to state the time, place, circumstances or the name of the person with whom such act of adultery was committed, or any excuse for the omission to state such particulars. 2 \u2019 Bishop Harr. &amp; Div., section 1325.</p> <p id=\"b338-11\" pgmap=\"338\">It follows from what has been said, that in our opinion the bill fails to state facts which constitute a ground for divorce, and therefore the order appealed from was erroneous, and will be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b338-12\" pgmap=\"338\">Reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
