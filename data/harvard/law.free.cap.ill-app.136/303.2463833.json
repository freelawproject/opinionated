This is an appeal from a judgment in favor of appellee in a suit to recover for personal injuries suffered while in appellant\u2019s employment.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-11\" pgmap=\"339(209) 340(342)\">The material facts are that appellee was one of a gang of fifteen men employed by appellant to clean and wash sleeping cars at the yards of the Santa Fe Railroad Company in Chicago. He had been in the country two years. Fie had worked in a machine shop and for the Illinois Central Railway Co. cleaning cars for more than a year prior to his employment by appellant. He began work for the latter May 18, 1902, and the accident in controversy occurred May 21st following. In addition to cleaning cars, the gang of which appellee became a member was required when necessary to unload a carload of new wheels brought to the Santa Fe yard to take the place'of wheels which upon inspection were found to be worn or untrue, and also to load upon a car such defective wheels to be taken away for repair. These wheels were attached to their axles. When any one wheel became defective, it was necessary to remove its fellow wheel with it, the two constituting a pair connected by the axle. Upon the day when the accident occurred, a flat car arrived at the yard with fourteen or fifteen pairs of wheels. This car was run near to a turn-table, and the wheels unloaded, the men running each pair by means of skids down upon the turn-table. This unloading was finished just before noon. After dinner, the men were directed to roll certain old wheels which had accumulated, from the tracks where they had been placed, onto the turn-table to be loaded upon the flat car. When the new wheels were unloaded in the forenoon, appellee held the turn-table in position to receive them upon its track. The method pursued was to stop the first pair of wheels on the turn-table track and then let the others in succession bump each against the preceding pair. In thus unloading it appears that one pair of wheels left or jumped from the skid or from the track, so that one wheel was outside its rail and the other inside, and the latter bumped against the axle of the preceding pair, instead of against the wheel in front of it. When in the afternoon the turn-table had been set to receive from the track on which they stood the wheels to be loaded, the foreman directed his men to run them on. The method pursued was that each man pushed a pair of wheels, one following behind another. The distance was according to appellee\u2019s contention about one hundred and twenty feet. The track, it is said, was about level. Each pair of wheels with axle weighed about 2,600 pounds. They were about three feet in diameter, so that when the wheels stood against each other on the track there was a space of about three feet between the axles. The evidence tends to show that when the wheels were started, one pair after another, they were pushed along with more or less speed as fast probably as a man could readily make them go. The first pair of wheels was stopped upon the turn-table. The second pair was allowed to bump against the first and so on, following each other some six or eight feet apart. \u25a0</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\" pgmap=\"340(70) 341(167)\">Appellee was aided in starting his pair of wheels by the foreman, who he states told him to \u201churry up.\u201d He kept about five or six feet, he states, from the man preceding and the man following him kept at about the same distance. He says that when he came to the turn-table he tried to check his wheels, but could not do so.- The man in front of him when his pair of wheels reached their destination jumped outside of the tracks from in front of appellee\u2019s wheels. When appellee\u2019s pair of wheels reached the turn-table some of his fellow workmen called to him to \u201clook out,\u201d the reason being, it is said, that he had his hand on the flange of one of his wheels where it might be struck by the wheel following him. He says this \u201cscared\u201d him. He let go his wheels and tried to jump out from between the tracks. In so doing his right foot and leg were caught between one of his own pair of wheels and the wheels behind him, inflicting the injuries complained of. Had he remained where he was between the tracks he would not have been injured. There was a space of three feet between the axles where he could have remained in safety, as did one at least of his fellow workmen. The accident happened just beyond the edge of the turn-table.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-4\" pgmap=\"341\">The declaration contains four counts, two original and two additional. The first count charges that plaintiff was employed as a car cleaner and for no other purpose, and was directed by the foreman to assist in removing car wheels, the foreman knowing that appellee was not experienced in that class of work; that it was the duty of defendant to furnish two men for each pair of wheels to prevent them from rolling upon plaintiff, and that he was injured by reason of the failure of defendant to furnish a sufficient number of persons to perform the work. The second count contains recitals to the same effect and avers that defendant \u201ccarelessly and negligently left said wheels loose and insufficiently guarded.\u201d The first additional count charges that defendant negligently directed and permitted another of its servants to roll wheels along the tracks at an unsafe and improper distance behind plaintiff, by reason of which he was injured. The last additional count avers that plaintiff was employed to wash windows and clean cars, and was ordered to leave said employment to roll car wheels; that he was inexperienced in said work, unacquainted with the dangers and that it was the duty of the defendant to have instructed and warned him of dangers incident thereto.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-3\" pgmap=\"342\">A jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff and judgment was entered accordingly.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b342-4\" pgmap=\"342\">Runnells &amp; Burry and F.

Whether this risk was open and obvious was a question of fact for the jury. Ill. Term R. R. Co. v. Thompson, 210 Ill., 226-237. Had this question been submitted to the jury the verdict as rendered might have been construed as settling it in appellee\u2019s favor. In the view taken by a majority of the court this question of assumed risk was erroneously eliminated from the case by the following instruction given at the request of appellee\u2019s attorneys: \u201cIf the jury find from the evidence that the plaintiff has made out his case by a preponderance of the evidence as alleged in his declaration, then the jury should find the defendant guilty.\u201d The instruction is peremptory in form, and following the authority of Ill. Terra Cotta Co. v. Hanley, 214 Ill., 243-246, constituted reversible error for reasons stated in that case, where it was said that the \u201ceffect of said instruction was to eliminate the question of assumed risk from the case, as it is not averred in either count of the declaration, expressly or by implication.\u201d The writer does not entirely concur in this view in the present case, but it necessitates the reversal of the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b343-4\" pgmap=\"343\">Our attention is called also to the seventh instruction given at appellee\u2019s instance. We regard this instruction as open to objection for reasons stated in Chicago U. T. Co. v. Strand, 114 Ill. App., 479-483.</p> <p id=\"b343-5\" pgmap=\"343\">The judgment of the Superior Court will he reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b343-6\" pgmap=\"343\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
