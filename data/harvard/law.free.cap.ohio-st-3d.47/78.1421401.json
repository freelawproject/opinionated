R.C. 4123.09. This discretionary approval is based on the reasonableness of the movant\u2019s request. Ohio Adm. Code 4121-3-09 (B)(5)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-18\">We have addressed this subject on two previous occasions. Upon review, we conclude that our decisions <em>in State, ex rel. General Motors Corp., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St. 2d 244, 1 O.O. 3d 141, 351 N.E. 2d 442, and <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Moody\u2019s of Dayton, Inc. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 238, 1 OBR 260, 438 N.E. 2d 1162, require employers to meet more stringent deposition criteria than do claimants. Under <em>Williams, </em>a claimant need only show that a substantial disparity exists between various medical reports and that the commission relied on one of those reports to the exclusion of others. Under <em>State, ex rel. General Motors Corp., supra, </em>however, an employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>must additionally demonstrate that the relied-upon reports considered nonallowed conditions. The commission has never been required to <em>rely </em>on all the evidence before it \u2014 it need only <em>consider </em>it. Moreover, any commission failure in this regard will not be cured by a physician deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The present controversy centers on Dr. Frenz\u2019s reference to nonallowed conditions. -The commission argues that it reviewed the report and found that the doctor\u2019s conclusion was based solely on the allowed injuries. The commission contends that its finding is supported by \u201csome evidence\u201d and thus is not subject to correction in mandamus. <em>Stale, ex rel. Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936. Appellee, on the other hand, contends that the question is not whether the reviewing physician <em>actually </em>relied on nonrecognized conditions, but whether there was reasonable cause to believe that he or she did so. This contention is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Neither <em>General Motors </em>nor <em>Williams, supra, </em>expressly or inferentially refers to a \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard. Such a standard was unnecessary in <em>General Motors </em>since it was clear that nonallowed conditions were considered, substantial disparity existed and certain reports were not considered. Similarly, in <em>Williams, </em>we specifically found that substantial disparity and exclusionary reliance <em>did </em>exist, not that they <em>may have </em>existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In reviewing the record for \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s order, we find that, contrary to the court of appeals\u2019 suggestion, Dr. Frenz did discuss the allowed conditions. He found practically no cervical spine motion and referred to his \u201cdetailed review\u201d of claimant\u2019s cervical X-rays, noting spur formation at C5-6. Most persuasive, however, is his conclusion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">\u201cThis claimant has indeed sustained impairments per this claim which renders <em>[sic] </em>him permanently and totally disabled from sustained remunerative employment to a degree of 100%; <em>this is exclusive of his other unrelated medical problems and disabilities. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">In reviewing claimant\u2019s medical history, Dr. Frenz unquestionably discussed nonallowed conditions. However, we find mere discussion insufficient to support the appellate court\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Frenz\u2019s finding on disability was improperly based on nonrecognized conditions, especially when the doctor specified otherwise. We thus find \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the appellate court judgment which orders the commission to permit appellee to depose Dr. Frenz. We affirm that portion which denies Dr. Rosen\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed in part and affirmed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-12\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b126-13\">Holmes and Douglas, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
