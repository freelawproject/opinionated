Allied Wheel Products, Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 47,1 O.O. 2d 190, 139 N.E. 2d 41; <em>State, ex rel. Cleveland Wrecking Co., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St. 3d 248, 520 N.E. 2d 228. Upon review, we find that the commission abused its discretion in applying Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-5-05(D)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">Claimant\u2019s VSSR application alleged violations under Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-5, IC-5-03.07(A) and Bulletin 203. Bulletin 203, an early codification of specific safety requirements, was later replaced by IC-5, which was in turn replaced by Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-5 in 1977. In the case before us, the commission ruled that, <em>based on claimant\u2019s 1982 date of injury, </em>Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-5 applied. Code applicability, however, is controlled by the date the machine in question was placed into service, not by the date of injury. See <em>State, ex rel. Cunningham, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St. 3d 73, 78, 30 OBR 176, 181, 506 N.E. 2d 1179, 1183; <em>State, ex rel. Sanchez, </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 46, 18 OBR 81, 479 N.E. 2d 864. Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-5 became effective on August 1, 1977 \u2014 five years after the Longwood spawner was placed into service. The commission thus erred in finding Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-5-05(D)(1) applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Ironically, neither appellee seriously disputes this conclusion, arguing instead that appellant waived the issue by failing to raise it below. Examination of the record, however, reveals that appellant did raise the question before the appellate court. Moreover, despite representations to the contrary, we also find that the issue was raised before the commission by the claimant himself. Claimant\u2019s VSSR application cited all three codifications. In so doing, he implicitly asked the commission to make an applicability determination, which the commission did by selecting Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The claimant also contends that, notwithstanding the applicability of Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-5-05(D)(1), a violation of .that section automatically entails a violation of its \u201cpredecessor,\u201d IC-5-03.07(A), since the two contain identical language. This assertion, however, ignores the fact that despite similar language, the scope of the two provisions differs significantly. Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-5-05 applies to \u201cAuxiliary Equipment\u201d while IC-5-03 is restricted to \u201cPower Transmission Machinery.\u201d This distinction, as we discussed in <em>Cunningham, supra, </em>invalidates any suggestion that the two provisions are equivalent.' As stated therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">\u201c* * * In this new codification [Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-5-05(D)(1)], the requirements of a disengaging switch and a lock-out device are not grouped under the rule governing \u2018Mechanical Power Transmission Apparatus\u2019 * * * but rather are contained in a new rule * * * governing \u2018Auxiliary Equipment.\u2019 This rule governs all auxiliary equipment, regardless of whether it transmits power to operating equipment. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">\u201c* * * [T]he shifting of the language of the machinery control section of IC-5-03.07(A) and (B) to a rule covering \u2018Auxiliary Equipment\u2019 indicates a desire, on the part of the Industrial Commission, to expand the coverage of those safety requirements on and after August 1,1977. * * *\u201d <em>Id. </em>at .78, 30 OBR at 181, 506 N.E. 2d at 1183.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">We acknowledge that Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-5-05(D)(1) and IC-5-03.07 (A) have been used interchangeably in the past. See <em>State, ex rel. A-F Industries, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St. 3d 136, 137, 25 OBR 117, 497 N.E. 2d 90, 92, fn. 1; <em>State, ex rel. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 145, 16 O.O. 3d 165, 404 N.E. 2d 140. Those decisions, however, preceded <em>Cunningham, </em>which we herein affirm as our definitive pronouncement on this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Based on the foregoing, we find that the commission abused its discretion in finding a violation of Ohio Adm. Code 4121:1-5-05(D)(1). Accordingly, the judgment of the appellate court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-12\">Moyer, C.J., Holmes, Wright and H.
