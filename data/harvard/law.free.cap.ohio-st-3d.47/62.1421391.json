We answer such query affirmatively, as a holding to the contrary would permit a double recovery for a single injury, contrary to the language and purpose of R.C. 4123.57.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">It is well-settled that a writ of mandamus will not issue unless relator demonstrates that: (1) he has a clear right to the relief requested; (2) the respondents are under \u00e1 clear legal duty to perform the requested acts; and (3) no plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law exists. <em>State, ex rel. Westchester Estates, Inc., </em>v. <em>Bacon </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 42, 15 O.O. 3d 53, 399 N.E. 2d 81, paragraph one of the syllabus. The legal duties of appellant Industrial Commission here are set forth in R.C. 4123.57.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">R.C. 4123.57(B) provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">\u201cThe district hearing officer, upon such application, shall determine the percentage of the employee\u2019s permanent disability, <em>except such as is subject to division (C) of this section, </em>based upon that condition of the employee resulting from the injury or occupational disease and causing permanent impairment evidenced by medical or clinical findings reasonably demonstrable. The employee shall receive sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of his average weekly wage, * * * for the number of weeks which equals such percentage of two hundred weeks. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">\u201cNo award shall be made under this division based upon a percentage of disability which, when taken with all other percentages of permanent disability, exceeds one hundred per cent. If the percentage of such permanent disability of the employee equals or exceeds ninety per cent, compensation for permanent partial disability shall be paid for two hundred weeks.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">R.C. 4123.57(C) provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-13\">\u201cIn cases included in the following schedule the compensation payable per week to the employee shall be sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of his average weekly wage * * * and shall continue during the periods provided in the following schedule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-15\">&lt;&lt;* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-16\">\u201cFor the loss of a leg, two hundred weeks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">Divisions (B) and (C) award benefits for permanent partial disability that are similar to general damages. <em>State, ex rel. Latino, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St. 2d 103, 106-107, 42 O.O. 2d 324, 325-326, 234 N.E. 2d 912, 914; <em>State, ex rel. Hammond, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 237, 239, 18 O.O. 3d 438, 440, 416 N.E. 2d 601, 603. In the syllabus of <em>State, ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>Walker, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 402, 12 O.O. 3d 347, 390 N.E. 2d 1190, this court held that a \u201ctotal and permanent loss of use of both legs constitutes a \u2018loss\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 4123.57(C). * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AGd\">Finally, R.C. 4123.57(D) provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">\u201cCompensation for partial disability under divisions (A), (B), and (C) of this section shall be in addition to the compensation paid the employee for the periods of temporary total disability resulting from the injury or occupational disease, but the amount of compensation paid for partial disability under division (A) of this section is not in addition to the compensation paid for permanent partial disability under division (B) or (C) of this section and the amount of compensation paid for partial disability under division (A) of this section shall be deducted from the amount of compensation payable for permanent partial disability under division (B) or (C) of this section but only one deduction shall be made if payments are made under both divisions (B) and (C) of this section for permanent partial disability involved <em>in the same claim. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Division (D) clearly permits payment of both a division (B) and division (C) award in the same claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This case presents, for the first time, the issue of whether both may be paid, without offset, for the same condition or injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellee first observes that division (D) expressly provides for division (A) awards to be deducted from division (C) awards, but it does <em>not </em>provide for a deduction of division (B) awards from division (C) awards. Thus, appellee contends, the statutory rule of construction <em>expressio unites est exclusio alterius </em>applies: the General Assembly intended to prohibit what it did not include. His argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Division (B) requires the hearing officer to determine the percentage of an employee\u2019s permanent disability, based on the employee\u2019s condition resulting from his injury causing permanent impairment. However, such determination is not to include any scheduled disability provided for in division (C) (\u201chearing officer * * * shall determine the percentage of the employee\u2019s permanent disability, except such as is subject to division [C] of this section * * *,\u201d R.C. 4123.57 [B]).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">These provisions assume that an industrial injury would result in either (1) an amputation or total loss of use of an appendage, or (2) a lesser, permanent disability which allows some use of such appendage. Thus, a claimant would only be entitled to a division (B) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>or </em>(C) award for the same injury. It is obvious the General Assembly did not contemplate that an employee could originally qualify under division (B) and then later also qualify under division (C) for the same injury. Thus, division (D) contains no provision for deduction of a division (B) award from a division (C) award simply because the legislature did not envision a situation where a claimant could ever be entitled to both \u2014 not because the General Assembly intended a double payment for a single injury. The rule of <em>ex-pressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>is inapplicable under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The decisions of this court support the conclusion that the compensation schemes of divisions (B) and (C) are mutually exclusive with respect to single injuries. In <em>State, ex rel. Hammond, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm., supra </em>(64 Ohio St. 2d), at 240-241, 18 O.O. 3d at 440-441, 416 N.E. 2d at 604, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">\u201cDivisions (B) and (C) serve similar purposes, <em>i.e., </em>the compensation of injuries which result in permanent partial disabilities to a worker. Certainly, the approaches taken by the two sections are different, but, when read together, they comprise a single scheme for the compensation of such injuries. R.C. 4123.57(C) provides an extensive schedule of specific awards to be made in a number of common, easily identifiable situations. Division (B) allows the determination of compensation in those instances where an uncommon injury occurs, one which does not fall within one of the specific categories contained within division (C) .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">\u201cWhen thus viewed, the preliminary language of (B) becomes clear as a prescription to read the two divisions together. <em>Any disability specifically provided for under (C) is not subject to compensation under the provisions of (B) to the extent that compensation is provided for in (C). </em>Where an injury is not provided for under (C), then resort may be had to (B) to determine what compensation, if any, the injured worker is entitled to. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">Next, in <em>State, ex rel. GF Business Equipment, Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St. 3d 86, 2 OBR 639, 443 N.E. 2d 147, the claimant had received a division (C) award for the loss of the use of his right hand. His claim was subsequently amended to include a psychological condition, and he then applied for an award under division (B). Two medical reports estimated that the claimant\u2019s psychological condition resulted in a permanent partial disability of between sixty-five and seventy-five percent. A third report found a five-percent permanent partial disability under division (B), and noted that the claimant had previously received a division (C) award for his hand. The Industrial Commission made an eighty-percent award, combining the seventy-five and five-percent figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">Upon petition by the employer, this court affirmed the grant of a limited writ of mandamus requiring the Industrial Commission to identify to which condition the five-percent figure was attributable. This court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-14\">\u201cUpon inspection of Dr. Paloski\u2019s report, it is unclear whether the diagnosis of a five percent permanent partial disability was for new conditions caused by the hand injury, or for injuries already compensated. <em>Clearly, Hayes [the claimant] may not recover a scheduled award under R.C. 4123.57 (C) in addition to recovering a percentage of permanent partial disability under R.C. 4123.57(B). </em>However, if the five percent permanent partial disability figure in Dr. Paloski\u2019s report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>represents injuries in addition to those for which Hayes was already compensated, the five percent permanent partial disability award is allowable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 88, 2 OBR at 641, 443 N.E. 2d at 149-150.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Contrary to the court of appeals\u2019 reasoning below, <em>Hammond </em>and <em>GF Business Equipment </em>do not stand merely for the proposition that awards under divisions (B) and (C) cannot be paid contemporaneously. Neither opinion contains such language, and neither opinion involved a contemporaneous award. In fact, in <em>GF Business Equipment, </em>the claimant had previously been awarded division (C) compensation and was, some eighteen months later, seeking additional compensation under division (B). That case, and <em>Hammond </em>before it, clearly stand for the proposition that dual awards under divisions (B) and (C), in any sequence, may never be paid to compensate for the same injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">That this proposition expresses the obvious intent of the legislature is manifest by the practical considerations of appellee\u2019s position. As noted in <em>State, ex rel. Walker, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm., supra, </em>amputation and loss of use are, for practical purposes, the same \u2014 both deprive the claimant of an appendage\u2019s use. One who suffers an immediate amputation from a work accident is immediately precluded, by division (B)\u2019s terms, from an award under that division for that condition. Under appellee\u2019s position, however, a claimant who suffers the same eventual degree of loss through deterioration instead of amputation may get both division (B) and division (C) compensation if the claimant applies for a division (B) award prior to completely losing an appendage\u2019s use. Thus, while the claimants suffer the same practical degree of loss, the amputee is limited to a division (C) award while the \u201closs of use\u201d claimant may be compensated under both divisions (B) and (C). In <em>Walker, </em>this court found it unjust that an amputee could recover under paragraph (C) while a \u201closs of use\u201d claimant could not. We thus enlarged the definition of \u201closs\u201d \u201cin order to alleviate the \u2018obviously unjust result, whereby a claimant\u2019s award is measured by the fortuity of the events contributing to his disability ***.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404,12 O.O. 3d at 348, 390 N.E. 2d at 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Such reasoning applies with equal force in this case. R.C. 4123.95 requires that \u201c[s]ections 4123.01 to 4123.94, inclusive, of the Revised Code shall be liberally construed in favor of employees and the dependents of deceased employees.\u201d Courts and the Industrial Commission must not construe these statutes in favor of whichever claimant happens to appear before them at any given time, but in favor of <em>all </em>employees and their dependents equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Therefore, we hold that a claimant who has received a permanent partial disability award pursuant to former R.C. 4123.57(B), for an injury which subsequently deteriorates to the point of a total loss of use of an appendage or other condition qualifying for a scheduled award, may not be awarded scheduled benefits pursuant to former R.C. 4123.57(C) without an offset of the benefits received under division (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Based on all these reasons, the Industrial Commission had no clear legal duty to pay division (B) and division (C) benefits for the same condition without offset, and thus appellee\u2019s complaint for a writ of mandamus should be denied. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b112-11\">Moyer, C.J., Wright and H.

The amendment, <em>inter alia, </em>re-lettered former divisions (B) and (C) (at issue here) to (A) and (B), respectively.

In this situation, presumably the worker would be compensated under division (C) for the loss of his fingers, and would look to division (B) for compensation related to the burn injury, an injury not covered, <em>i.e., </em>not \u2018subject to division (C) of this section.\u2019 R.C. 4123.57(B).
