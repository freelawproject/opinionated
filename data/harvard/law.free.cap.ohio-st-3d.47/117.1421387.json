Hinkle requests this relief because, on or about September 12, 1989, the board invalidated a number of the part petitions he submitted pursuant to the local option election procedures in R.C. 4301.33. By the time Hinkle filed his complaint on October 10, 1989, however, absentee ballots had already been printed and mailed to electors who would have been affected by the questions Hinkle proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In <em>State, ex rel.

We see no reason for not reaching the same result here. Accordingly, the writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b164-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
