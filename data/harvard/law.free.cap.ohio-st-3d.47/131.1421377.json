This case concerns the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. It is an important issue, given past and current legislation, and considering past, and especially recent cases, both from this court and various courts of appeals, on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">The case involves a claim, by an employee, for injury which occurred prior to August 22, 1986. Claimant sought allowance of the claim on the basis that stress brought about by employment caused a psychiatric condition. Claimant was a police officer and since the facts in the case were stipulated, there was no dispute that the claimant\u2019s employment caused the alleged psychiatric condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">The definition of \u201cinjury\u201d is found in R.C. 4123.01(C). That definition contains the language, \u201c \u2018[i]njury\u2019 includes any injury * * The question to be answered in this case is whether a psychiatric condition is an \u201cinjury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">Since I would decide the case on the merits, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to dismiss the case as having been improvidently allowed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b178-14\">Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
