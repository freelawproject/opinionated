L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G-, as amended, relate to the defence of insanity. The defendant, McHoul, was convicted and sentenced for two crimes committed about 2 p.m. on March 29,1966 \u2014 assault with intent to rape, and breaking and entering a dwelling house with intent to commit rape. The defendant at the time was a patient at Boston State Hospital. About 2:25 p.m. on March 29, the defendant said to a male practical nurse at the hospital, who asked where his trousers were, \u201cI want to tell you something. 1 did something wrong. I raped a woman.\u201d Counsel who argued the case on appeal did not represent the defendant at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">1. An expert for the Commonwealth, Dr. Malcolm Ros-enblatt, testified that he had an opinion as to the sanity of the defendant which was, \u201cThat according to the M\u2019Nagh-ten rule<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he was legally sane.\u201d The defendant moved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>have the answer struck. The judge ruled, \u201cI will strike out the part about the M\u2019Naghten rule. I will allow the last part to stand.\u201d The defendant excepted \u201cto the part of the answer the Court did not strike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The rule which has prevailed in this Commonwealth was first expressed by Shaw, C.J., in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>7 Met. 500, 501-502. A more recent statement, including a quotation from the <em>Rogers </em>case, is in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCann, </em>325 Mass. 510, 515: \u201cOne whose mental condition is such that he cannot distinguish between right and wrong is not responsible for his conduct, and neither is one who has the capacity to discriminate between right and wrong but whose mind is in such a diseased condition that his reason, conscience and judgment are overwhelmed by the disease and render him incapable of resisting and controlling an impulse which leads to the commission of a homicide. In such an instance, the homicide would be \u2018not the act of a voluntary agent, but the involuntary act of the body, without the concurrence of a mind directing it.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In the light of this rule, the judge\u2019s action in respect of Dr. Rosenblatt\u2019s answer was prejudicially erroneous. The witness did not testify that in his view, McHoul, according to Massachusetts law, was sane. It is beside the point whether he would have. He did not testify in respect of irresistible impulse. The judge\u2019s ruling left before the jury a statement, attributable to a qualified physician, not in fact made by him. It presented to the jury, in terms conclusive of the issue that they alone were to pass on, an unsupported statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">2. The defendant excepted to the refusal of the judge to charge in the words of \u00a7 4.01 of the American Law Institute \u2019s Model Penal Code, Proposed Official Draft (1962) p. 66: \u201cSection 4.01 Mental Disease or Defect Excluding Responsibility. (1) A person is not responsible for crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>nal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">For the reasons stated below (point 2 [b]), we regard the Code definition as an evolutionary restatement of our rule rather than a substantively new rule, which, of course, it is in those jurisdictions that adopt its dual test to replace the single cognitive test of the M\u2019Naghten rule. The requests in the language of \u00a7 4.01 were fully adequate to direct attention to the dual test of criminal responsibility as it has been stated in our cases. In the light of those cases an instruction in Model Penal Code terms was not required, and a correct instruction would have been in some such words as are quoted in point 1, <em>supra, </em>from the <em>McCann </em>case. The instruction given was not, however, in words or substance, our dual test. That no exception was taken to the charge as given does not exclude our appraisal of it as not meeting the implicit requirement of the defendant\u2019s requests at least to state our rule in its accepted wording. Furthermore, the error is related to the error discussed in point 1 for which there must be in any event a reversal. We do not decide whether in other circumstances we would be warranted in reviewing the charge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conroy, </em>333 Mass. 751, 757. We look first at the definition of insanity as stated by the judge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">(a) The judge charged the jury substantially in terms of the M\u2019Naghten rule, saying, \u201c [E]very man is presumed to be sane . . . until the contrary be proved to your satisfaction. To establish a defense upon the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did . . . [know], that he did not lmow he was doing what was wrong. The knowledge required by the \u2018right and wrong\u2019 test is the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong; not in the abstract, but as to the particular act which constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the crime charged. If such capacity existed at the time of the forbidden act, the accused is fully responsible though in other respects he may have been insane. If such capacity did not exist at the time, the accused is then not responsible. \u2019 \u2019 He then added, <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 An irresistible impulse to commit a crime in and of itself is no defense to its commission unless it is accompanied by an inability to distinguish between right and wrong and ... [a lack of] awareness of the nature and quality of the acts committed at the time of their commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">This instruction wrongly stated that the absence of awareness of wrongdoing must accompany irresistible impulse. We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that the defect in the charge may be overlooked because the evidence did not show conduct that was irresistibly impelled. The \u201cburden of proof is on the Commonwealth to prove the defendant mentally responsible for crime <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>188 Mass. 382, 388). \u2019 \u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>292 Mass. 409, 415. Hence the issue was for the jury under proper instructions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soaris, </em>275 Mass. 291, 298, 301-302.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">We do not pause to consider the defendant\u2019s contention that the charge also erred in shifting from the Commonwealth the burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>188 Mass. 382, 388; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>346 Mass. 482, 489-490; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>160 U. S. 469, 481-483; Weihofen, Mental Disorder as a Criminal Defense, c. V.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">(b) There has been widespread agreement on the need for a restatement in modern terms of the dual definition of criminal irresponsibility. For reasons to be stated we believe the Model Penal Code has met this need and has done so in language which will not make the dual test in this jurisdiction a substantially different rule in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">\u25a0 In <em>Commonivealth </em>v. <em>Chester, </em>337 Mass. 702, 713, we said, \u201cWe do not labor under the illusion that the rule of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>is entirely satisfactory. Indeed, in this troublesome field there will be serious difficulties in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>rule that can be formulated. . . . We, of course, intend no intimation that the rule tentatively proposed [now finally] by the American Law Institute in its Model Penal Code and which has been recommended favorably by a majority of the Judicial Council<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ... is not a desirable one, but no question touching that rule is before us.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AHt\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>346 Mass. 482, 491, we rejected the rule of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Currens, </em>290 F. 2d 751 (3d Cir.). That, however, was not a disapproval of the Code definition, for the <em>Currens </em>case, although accepting in substance the second part of the rule, rejected the cognitive element. See fn. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Advantages of the Code definition are stated in the opinion in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>357 F. 2d 606, 620-621 (2d Cir.), which was approved by four judges of the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>in addition to the three who were sitting. It reversed a conviction following a trial in which the M\u2019Naghten rule had been applied, and adopted the Code definition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Perhaps the single greatest point made for the Code definition is that under it, experts will be unrestricted in stating all that is relevant to the defendant\u2019s mental illness. This advantage, however, already exists under our rule, properly applied. We indicated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>342 Mass. 279, 296-297, that the rule of the <em>Rogers </em>case is to be applied to the admission of expert testimony \u201cin terms of modern psychiatric concepts\u201d so as to avoid the \u2018 \u2018 confusion which may result from references to differences between legal insanity and mental illness.\u201d This means that experts experienced in the study and treatment of the mentally ill may testify fully as to the nature and extent of impairment of defendants\u2019 mental faculties as well as their observations or other bases for their conclusions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See, for cases where evidence appears to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>admitted in general conformity with the foregoing, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCann, </em>325 Mass. 510, 514-515; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lundin, </em>326 Mass. 551, 556-558; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>333 Mass. 610, 619-627; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chester, </em>337 Mass. 702, 707-710; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrison, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The Code\u2019s expression of the dual test modifies the classical <em>Rogers </em>case wording in three significant respects: (1) the qualification of \u201ccapacity\u201d (\u201csubstantial capacity\u201d) ; (2) the use of the word \u201cappreciate\u201d rather than \u201cknow\u201d; and (3) the rejection of the words \u201cirresistible impulse \u2019 \u2019 in stating lack of capacity to control conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">We think our test <em>as applied </em>has been in all likelihood, in most cases, a \u201csubstantial capacity\u201d test. The rule, significantly, has been the criterion applied in the uncertain case. Its main function has not been to say that the idiot or similarly mindless person shall not be convicted; prosecutors do not bring such persons to trial. See G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 99, 100, 100A. A defendant\u2019s sanity comes to trial in cases where psychiatrists can and do hold and state opposing views. All such cases show that psychiatry is far from an exact science and that whether a defendant is to be called sane or insane cannot depend on any certain measurement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Chief Judge Murrah, in <em>Wion </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 F. 2d 420, 427-428 (10th Cir.), quoting Frankfurter, J., in <em>Leland </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>343 U. S. 790, 803, has observed, \u201cOnly one proposition seems certain, i.e. that \u2018. . . [s]anity and insanity are concepts of incertitude. \u2019 \u201d In any but the extreme case, where there will be no controversy, no expert can speak with scientific certainty and no jury can or does act on the assumption that some of the experts in the case have done so. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>346 Mass. 482, 489-490.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The Code intends that \u2018 \u2018 a defendant will not be convicted of crime if mental illness has deprived him of effective power to make the right choices in governing his own behavior.\u201d Schwartz, The Model Penal Code, 49 Am. Bar Assn. J. 447, 449. According to the <em>Freeman </em>opinion, <em>supra, </em>the Code \u201cwill remove from the pale of criminal sanctions precisely those who are in no meaningful sense responsible for their actions\u201d (357 F. 2d at 623). Such is the precise intent of our test, expressed in terms of capacity. This, we believe, is what juries have understood they should determine when so instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">We turn to the other changes in the language of the definition. We think that the use of \u201cappreciate\u201d rather than \u201cknow\u201d expresses what the word \u201cknow\u201d- in the classical statement of the rule means in the light of modern knowledge. Many psychiatrists, as indicated in the records in recent cases, appear to have recognized this.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">\u201cThe draft . . . accepts the criticism of the \u2018irresistible impulse\u2019 formulation as- inept in so far as it may be impliedly restricted to sudden, spontaneous acts as distinguished from insane propulsions that are accompanied by brooding or reflection. See e.g., Boyal Commission on Capital Punishment, Beport (1953) par. 314, p. 110.\u201d \u2014 Comment (3) to \u00a7 4.01 of Model Penal Code, Tent. Draft No. 4 (1955), p. 157. This is an important change in respect of that part of the dual test under which the chief controversy arises in many if not most cases, including the case at bar (fn. 7). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Currens, </em>290 F. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>751, 775 (3d Cir.). The new wording, we believe, will tend to minimize misunderstanding and is plainly advantageous. We think that, for some time, many expert witnesses have testified more nearly in accordance with the new definition. Although the issue has been, as Chief Justice Shaw in substance stated, whether the defendant was irresistibly impelled to the act done, the emphasis, in modern times, has inevitably been on the concept expressed in the word \u201cirresistible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We think that the statement of Chief Justice Shaw that if there is an irresistible impulse the deed is \u201cnot the act of a voluntary agent, but the involuntary act of the body, without the concurrence of a mind directing it, \u2019 \u2019 no longer reflects the general understanding of how human beings act. Although the mind may have a part in planning and executing compulsive acts, that circumstance does not prevent the finding of \u2018 \u2018 irresistible impulse. \u2019 \u2019 This 1844 statement is, of course, not an integral part of the rule and its omission in the Code reformulation does not show essential variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Our view that the Code restates our rule appears to be that of the Tenth Circuit. In <em>Wion </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 F. 2d 420, 424, 430, the charge that was questioned had been phrased in one of the several established variations of the <em>Rogers </em>case statement. The court expressly rejected the <em>Gurrens </em>rule (and by implication the <em>Durham </em>rule) and approved the Code definition. It concluded that there was no error in the instruction, because the definition of insanity as stated \u201cembodied ... all of the elements of the A.L.I. Code.\u201d See also <em>Dusky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>295 F. 2d 743, 759 (8th Cir.), cert. den. 368 U. S. 998.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>The Code definition does not bar such questions as whether the defendant is legally sane. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>333 Mass. 610, 625. Nor is there an implication that such questions should be barred.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But the new language means, we believe, a lessening in semantic dueling between attorneys and experts, and an end to the confusing debates on the issue: \u201cDoes he know right from wrong?\u201d and related topics.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See, for example, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>333 Mass. 610, 621-622. With the definition of legal insanity expressed as lack of \u201csubstantial capacity . . . to appreciate ... or to conform,\u201d the examination and cross-examination should be in terms in which the psychiatrist feels that his expertness and training enable him to speak and support him in testifying. We anticipate, nevertheless, about the same division of experts at future trials of the issue of criminal irresponsibility.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In both New Jersey <em>(State </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>30 N. J. 37, 63-72) and Washington <em>(State </em>v. <em>White, </em>60 Wash. 2d 551, 578-593), where the Code definition has been rejected, the issue Avas whether to replace the M\u2019Naghten test. The opinions lay stress on the wisdom of a policy of punishment for its general and specific deterrent effects. As these opinions reject the defence of irresistible impulse, they necessar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>ily reject the Code definition and they do not bear on whether the Code is a satisfactory restatement for those jurisdictions already committed to the irresistible impulse principle.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">It is appropriate to observe, however, that, in our view, the Code restatement does not suggest a weakening in respect of deterrence. See the <em>Wion </em>case, <em>supra </em>(325 F. 2d 420, 426-430). The principle of criminal irresponsibility, embodied in the <em>Rogers </em>rule and in the Code is to maintain the general and specific deterrent effect of criminal penalties for wrong conduct, subject only to recognition of the injustice of punishing those lacking the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of, or to control, their behavior. See Wechsler, The Criteria of Criminal Responsibility, 22 Chicago L. Rev. 367, 372, 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">It follows from what we have said that, although the trial of this case under the <em>Rogers </em>rule would have given no basis for claim of error, nevertheless, in cases hereafter tried, the trial is to be conducted and the charge given under the clearer and more understandable words of \u00a7 4.01 of the Model Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">3.

The Code formulation, the opinion said, \"views the mind as a unified entity and recognizes that mental disease or defect may impair its functioning in numerous ways. The rule, moreover, reflects awareness that from the perspective of psychiatry absolutes are ephemeral and gradations are inevitable. By employing the telling word \u2018substantial\u2019 . . . the rule emphasizes that \u2018any\u2019 incapacity is not sufficient . . . but that \u2018total\u2019 incapacity is also unnecessary. The choice of the word \u2018appreciate\u2019 rather than \u2018know\u2019 . . . also is significant; mere intellectual awareness that conduct is wrongful, when divorced from appreciation or understanding of the moral or legal import of behavior, can have little significance. . . . Expert testimony . . . will be admissible whenever relevant but always <em>as </em>expert testimony \u2014\u25a0 and not as moral or legal pronouncement. Believed of their burden of divining precise causal relationships, the judge or jury can concentrate upon the ultimate decisions which are properly theirs, fully informed as to the facts. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\"> There is an especial need in murder cases (and most insanity trials are in such cases) for permitting psychiatrists to state the extent of the impairment of capacity apart from an opinion whether it had reached the point of legal insanity (criminal irresponsibility within the definition). This stems from our statute which allows the jury to recommend against the death penalty. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>30 <em>N. J. 37, 87, </em>Weintraub, C.J., in a concurring opinion said, \"I have no doubt that . . . [full psychiatric] testimony belongs in the case for that purpose. I am convinced the Legislature so intended when ... it provided that the jury shall fix the punishment. . . . The mental condition of a man is so inseparable from the issue of a just disposition \u2014 just to him and to society \u2014 that it is inconceivable that the Legislature intended to exclude it. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b589-7\"> In this case also, in general, the psychiatrists were permitted to state their views in terms of modern psychiatric concepts. Dr. Eobey, the clinical director of the Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, called by the defendant, had seen MeHoul ten to fifteen or more times. On March 29, 1966, the defendant was mentally ill; he had also a brain disease and mental deficiency \u201cmaking a fairly serious problem psyehiatrically.\u201d He was mentally ill within the definition of G. L. e. 123, \u00a7 1. Dr. Eobey would expect the brain damage he had referred to would cause a defect in the defendant\u2019s judgment or his ability to control his behavior. The defendant was diagnosed to have a schizophrenic reaction, one of the more serious of the mental illnesses. It affects the patient\u2019s ability to test reality, to understand and recognize what is real and what is not real. The defendant had shown overt paranoid signs, and depression \u201cto the point of even being suicidal,\u201d and at \u201cone point he showed . . . catatonic signs.\u201d The symptoms would come and go. On cross-examination, Dr. Eobey testified that, when he discharged the defendant as competent to stand trial, he was aware the defendant could be sexually dangerous. The record facts in respect of a prior commitment included two charges of breaking and entering with intent to commit rape. On March 29, 1966, the defendant \u201cknew in the intellectual sense the difference between right and wrong\u201d and was aware of the nature and the quality of his actions. Q. \u201cAnd even though you may say that his actions were impulsive . . . you cannot consider them as irresistibly so, can you?\u201d A. \u201cYes, I could, but this is an opinion I cannot\u2014 [answer unfinished].\u201d As to irresistibleness of the defendant\u2019s action on March 29, 1966, Dr. Eobey was of \u201cthe opinion that he could have been irresistibly impelled.\u201d \u201cI cannot say clearly.\u201d \u201cI am giving an educated opinion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\"> In the <em>Dusky </em>ease, the court went beyond our view saying, <em>\u201c </em>[W]e would hesitate to reverse a ease . . . <em>if </em>the charge appropriately embraces and requires positive findings as to 3 necessary elements, namely, the defendant\u2019s <em>cognition, </em>his <em>volition, </em>and Ms <em>capacity to control </em>his behavior. . . . We think this approach to be sound because it preserves and builds upon those elements of M\u2019Naghten and of irresistible impulse wMch are acceptable in these days and yet modernizes them in terms wMch a jury can grasp and apply. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Feguer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>302 <em>F. </em>2d 234, 244-245 (8th Cir.), cert. den. 371 U.

No expert can answer, with scientific or medical certainty, whether it was impulse not resisted or impulse irresistible. That is the basis of thoughtful criticism of the dual test as distinguished from the M\u2019Naghten rule. See 37 Col. L. Rev. 701, 757. This dilemma remains under the \u201csubstantial capacity\u201d test. Experts, if asked whether there was \u201csubstantial capacity,\u201d may therefore be expected to differ in their answers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b593-10\"> <em>State </em>v. <em>Poulson, </em>14 Utah 2d 213, 216, reaffirming an established wording of the dual test, has rejected the Code definition without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
