L., c. 231A. The plaintiff seeks a declaration \u201csetting forth whether . . . [he] has a contract with the Town of Ipswich which violates . . . [Gr. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 20 (a)],\u201d the so called conflict of interest statute. The case was heard on a statement of agreed facts. A final decree, was entered declaring that (1) \u201cThis [c]curt places upon the word \u2018contract\u2019 as it appears in . . . [G-. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 20 (a)], the broadest legal interpretation,\u201d (2) each transaction of the plaintiff \u201cwas an implied contract between the . . . [plaintiff] and the Welfare Department of the Town of Ipswich,\u201d and (3) \u201ceach of these separate transactions . .-. [was] violative of\u201d G-. L. c. 268A, \u00a720 (a). The plaintiff appealed from this decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">The plaintiff is a selectman of the town of Ipswich and therefore a municipal employee under Gr. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 1965, c. 351. He also owns a drug store in the same town. \u2018 \u2018 [A] s a druggist he is a seller of prescription drugs, and . . . among his customers . . . are welfare recipients of the' Town of Ipswich, persons receiving welfare \u2018 benefits under the. several welfare statutes of the Commonwealth. \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">\u2022 \u201cThe procedure followed in the several transactions which the ... [plaintiff] has from time to time with welfare recipients of the Town . . .' [is] as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">\u201c (a) A welfare recipient, having received a prescription from a physician, takes the prescription t\u00f3 a drug store of his choosing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u201c(b) . . . [T]he welfare recipient identifies himself as such to the druggist, who verifies the identification with the town welfare department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">\u201c(c) The . . . druggist, when assured by the welfare department of the proper identity, fills the prescription for the welfare recipient and submits a claim for the price of the prescription directly to the welfare department of the Town of Ipswich.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">\u201c(d) The welfare department of the Town of Ipswich sends a check in payment of the particular prescription directly to the . . . druggist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">General Laws c. 268A, \u00a7 20 (a), reads in material part as follows: \u201cA municipal employee who has a financial interest, directly or indirectly, in a contract made by a municipal agency of the same city or town, in which the city or town is an interested party of which financial interest he has knowledge or has reason to know, shall be punished . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The only substantial question presented is whether the relationship between the plaintiff and the town of Ipswich which is created by any one of the transactions described above is a \u201ccontract\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 20 (a). It is apparent that a prescription is filled for a welfare recipient by the plaintiff only upon assurance by the town\u2019s welfare department that it will pay him for the prescription. In the cases of medical assistance for the aged under G. L. c. 118A, \u00a7\u00a7 13<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 14,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and of assistance to the disabled under G. L. c. 118D, \u00a7 5,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that assurance is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>guaranteed by statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commr. of Pub. Welfare, </em>347 Mass. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">It is of course irrelevant that the assurance upon which the plaintiff acted was not expressed in so many words. It is enough that the conduct of the welfare department could reasonably have been interpreted as a promise to pay for the prescription filled and that the plaintiff acted on that promise. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Co. </em>150 Mass. 457, 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">We do not agree with the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the real \u201cpurchaser\u201d of the prescription drugs is the welfare recipient. Nor is it relevant that the town has the statutory power in some cases to recover the cost of the drugs from the welfare recipient in an action of contract. See Gr. L. c. 117, \u00a7 5. Cf. <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>304 Mass. 276, 278. The right of the town to look to the recipient of welfare for reimbursement does not alter the original contractual relationship between the town and the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">We see no merit in the plaintiff\u2019s argument that because the Department of Public Welfare of the Commonwealth prescribes the rules under which inhabitants of the town can receive welfare benefits the town is merely a \u201cconduit,\u201d and hence has no contractual obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The plaintiff asserts that as a selectman he does not serve on the board of public welfare, which is an independently elected body.. He argues that \u201c [t]he Board of Public Welfare has the sole decision for qualifying a person to receive aid in purchasing drugs, and the recipient has the freedom to select his own drugstore. The members of the Board of Selectmen participate in the foregoing business only in signing the warrant as required by law to authorize the Town Treasurer to pay the bills. The signing of the warrant by the Selectmen is only for the purpose of insuring regularity in municipal affairs, not as a condition precedent as to the validity of the amount paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">This argument ignores G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 20 (a), which pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>scribes any direct or indirect financial interest of a \u201cmunicipal employee\u201d in a contract made by a \u201cmunicipal agency of the same city or town, <em>in which the city or town is an interested party </em>...\u201d (emphasis supplied). Clearly the town of Ipswich is an interested party in the contract made by the board of public welfare and the plaintiff is a municipal employee of the town of Ipswich. It is of no consequence that the plaintiff himself is not the person maldng the contract for the municipal agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Finally, the plaintiff argues that the statute removes \u201cfrom those eligible to hold elective office practically all businessmen, and thus . . . [has] the effect of discriminating against businessmen, unduly depriving them of the constitutional right to hold elective office.\u201d The statute does nothing of the kind. It merely requires that a businessman who chooses to run for political office and upon election by virtue of Gr. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 1, thereby becomes a municipal employee, is obliged to refrain from contracting with an agency of the same municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-14\"> G.
