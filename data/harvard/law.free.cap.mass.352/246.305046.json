L. c. 30A, \u00a7 15, from the final decree of the Superior Court in proceedings under e. 30A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-16\">\u25a0 Daniel Baker on September 21,1964, applied to the Brock-ton board of public welfare (the local board) for hospital benefits under G. L. c. 118A, \u00a7\u00a7 13-32, \u201cMedical Assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>for the Aged. \u2019 \u2019 The application was denied on October 30, 1964, as the \u201c [ajpplicant transferred property without fair consideration.\u201d On appeal under G. L. c. 118A, \u00a7 21, the department reversed the action of the local board, and the city of Brockton through the local board acted to obtain judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">1. The department at the arguments in this court suggested that the Superior Court was without jurisdiction inasmuch as c. 118A, \u00a7 21, provides that \u201cEvery decision of the department shall be final and binding upon the local board involved and shall be complied with by such local board.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reject the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 14, provides: \u201cExcept so far as any provision of law expressly precludes judicial review, any person or appointing authority aggrieved by a final decision of any agency in an adjudicatory proceeding . . . shall be entitled to a judicial review thereof .... Where no statutory form of judicial review or appeal is provided, or where the only statutory form of review is by extraordinary writ, judicial review shall be obtained by means of a petition for review, as follows: . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Chapter 118A, \u00a7 21, does not expressly preclude judicial review. The limited nature of the review under c. 30A, \u00a7 14, leaves the department\u2019s decision final on issues of fact rightly presented. Even where statutes provide judicial review in a lower court and that the decision of such court shall be final <em>(MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. 612, 614, and cases cited) or that there shall be no appeal from such decision <em>(Young </em>v. <em>Mayor of Brockton, </em>346 Mass. 123, 124) errors of law are reviewed on certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">2. We turn to the issue whether c. 118A, \u00a7 6, as amended through St. 1964, c. 345, \u00a7 2, is applicable. This is in the group of sections under the chapter subtitle \u201cOld Age Assistance\u201d and provides in part: \u201cNo assistance <em>under this </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>c\u00f1\u00e1pte'r </em>[emphasis supplied] shall be granted to an applicant who, at any time\u2018within five years immediately prior to the filing of an application for such assistance, has made an assignment'or transfer of property so as to render himself'eligible, tb suchmsSistance.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The referee, whose decision became the decision of the department under c. 118A, \u00a7 21, found that on April 2,1962 (that is, more than one year but less than five years before the application), Baker had transferred for a consideration of less than $100 certain parcels of real estate of substantial value, but he. ruled, in effect, that \u00a7 6 did not apply.' The judge took the contrary view. In ruling that \u00a7. 6 is applicable, he was undoubtedly guided by <em>Gangloff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>347 Mass. 73, 74, which assumed that an undisclosed part of the Manual of Public Assistance set out instructions for applying \u00a7 6 to an application for medical assistance for the aged. We put aside for the moment consideration of that case and turn to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The present old age assistance program was adopted by St. 1936, c. 436,. \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Chapter 118A, as thereby inserted, dealt solely with old age assistance.' By St. 1960, c. 781, the General Court adopted a program of medical assistance for the aged. Chapter 781, \u00a7 3, added the subtitle <em>\u201cOld </em>Age Assistance\u201d to \u00a7\u00a7 1-12 of c. 118A. Chapter 781, \u00a7 8, added \u00a7[ 13-32 to c. 118A under the subtitle \u201cMedical Assistance for the Aged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u25a0 These-are separate programs. In.'each of the'two subdivisions ' of the chapter there are separate, although' to some extent' similar, provisions for qualifying for assistance, administering the prograin, establishing disqualifications, obtaining reimbursement, and bringing actions for recovery on account of assistance granted.\" In this connection see \u00a7 27, as amended through St. 1965, c. 827: \u201cNo medical assistance for the aged shall .be furnished to any person for any period during which he received aid . . . [references to c.. 69; c. 1[8; c.;118B] or.old.age assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>under this chapter, except . . . [in accord with] any exceptions allowed in the federal Social Security Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Certain provisions of the earlier sections are, nevertheless, suitable for application to medical aid for the aged. Such a section is \u00a7 4A. Section 23 (in the later group of sections) provides: \u201cThere 'shall be no recovery of .any medical assistance for the aged correctly paid, on behalf of a recipient during his lifetime or the lifetime of his surviving spouse. When recovery is appropriate, action shall be brought in accordance with the proceedings <em>[sic </em>\u2014 procedures ?] set forth in section four A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Section. 6, in the absence- of any provision in the later group of sections stating disqualification because of transfers of property, also appears, at least when separately considered, as substantively appropriate for application to medical aid for the aged.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">With the enactment of St. 1965, c. 657, \u00a7 1, however, the intention was manifested that there be a different disqualification provision for medical aid for the aged. Chapter 657, \u00a7 1, added to \u00a7 18 the sentence: \u201cNo- assistance shall be granted to an applicant who, at any time within one year immediately prior to the filing of an application for such assistance, has made an assignment or transfer of personal property so as to render himself eligible for such assistance. \u2019 \u2019 Section 6 applies to a \u201ctransfer of property'\u2019 \u2019 (not restricted as to realty or personalty) within five years; If applicable to medical aid for the aged, it would render the new provision in \u00a7 18 redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The .applicability of \u00a7 6 to Baker\u2019s 1964 application should, nevertheless, be determined in the then existing statutory context. The statute is not a model of clarity, but upon analysis we conclude that, even before 1965, the provisions of \u00a7 6 were inapplicable to medical assistance: for the aged.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">One or another of the phrases \u201cassistance under this chapter\u201d (quoted from A 6) and \u201csuch assistance\u201d and the unmodified word \u201cassistance\u201d occurs several times in the old age assistance sections. . By contrast each section from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>\u00a7 13 through \u00a7 32 except \u00a7 26 refers at least once to \u201cmedical assistance for the aged\u201d or \u201cmedical assistance\u201d and \u00a7 26, by reference back to \u00a7 25, shows that the words in \u00a7 26 \u201csuch disbursements for assistance\u201d refer to a disbursement for \u201cmedical assistance for the aged.\u201d Thus there is a contextual definition of \u201cassistance,\u201d \u201csuch assistance\u201d or \u201cassistance under this chapter,\u201d where used in the earlier \u00a7\u00a7 1 through 12 as \u201cold age assistance.\u201d The first sentence of \u00a7 1 has a definitive aspect: \u201cAdequate assistance to persons in need of relief and support who have reached the minimum age . . ..\u201d By contrast, \u00a7 13 (e) has a comprehensive definition of the term \u201cMedical assistance for the aged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Consistent with this construction are the references to \u201cthis chapter\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 1 to 12 that can reasonably apply only to that part of the chapter dealing with old age assistance. Thus in \u00a7 3, a right of appeal to the department is given to \u201c [a]ny person aggrieved by the failure of any town to render adequate assistance under this chapter.\u201d The matters for appeal are specified and relate to old age assistance whereas \u00a7 21 states the right of appeal in respect of a \u201cfailure ... to grant medical assistance for the aged.\u201d See also \u00a7\u00a7 1,1A, 2, 2A, 4, 5, 5A, 6A, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The <em>Gangloff </em>case (347 Mass. 73) was decided in 1964. The referee had denied medical assistance for the aged because the applicant had \u201ctransferred resources immediately (eight days) prior to application to make himself eligible . . . (Manual of Public Assistance, Page 38).\u201d It appeared that the so called transfer was a withdrawal by the applicant\u2019s daughter from a joint savings account. We ruled that inasmuch as the withdrawal was not shown to have been with the applicant\u2019s knowledge it could not be found to be a transfer by him. We said (P. 74), \u201cThe manual referred to by the referee is not before us. . . . We assume, however, that it sets out instructions for applying G. L. c. 118A, \u00a7 6. . . . [That section] does not bar assistance as Gangloff, so far as appears, made no transfer within five years prior to the application. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>It now appears likely that page 38 of the manual referred to rules of the department. Two rules set out in the present record<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> would in terms bar medical assistance for the aged to applicants who have made transfers within one year.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The assumption in the <em>Gangloff </em>case that \u00a7 6 was applicable was not necessary for the decision and, for the reasons stated above, appears unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">As to this point 2, this is the decision of a majority of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">3. The final decree is reversed. A decree is to enter affirming the decision of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-9\"> The issue was not raised in <em>Marlborough Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub.
