In\\each of the present cases other members of the fire or police department, as the case may be, are the additional plaintiffs. In addition to the city, the defendants in each case include the mayor, the members of the board of aldermen, the city clerk, the board of registrars of voters, the city auditor, the city treasurer, certain petitioners for a r\u00e9ferendum, and Chicopee Taxpayers Association, Inc. In the Lafleur ease the chief of the fire department is a defendant.

By interlocutory decrees, the report was confirmed with the addition of two rulings of law by the trial judge. Final decrees were entered declaring (1) that the Chicopee hoard of aldermen by order passed December 3, 1963, accepted St. 1963, c. 19 (providing a schedule of minimum annual compensation for police officers), and St. 1962, c. 520 (a similar statute concerning fire fighters); (2) that the plaintiffs are entitled to be paid in accordance with these statutes beginning on December 3, 1963; and (3) that referendum petitions (protesting the aldermen\u2019s order of December 3) filed with the city clerk on December 18, 1963, did not comply with G. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 38-42, require no action by the board of aldermen, and do not affect the operation of the orders of December 3, 1963. The defendants appealed from the interlocutory decrees and the final decrees. The facts are stated upon the basis of the master\u2019s report and a stipulation (fn. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Statute 1963, c. 734, provided that G. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 37-44 (dealing with municipal initiative and referendum procedures), should apply to Chicopee (notwithstanding provisions of its charter found in St. 1890, c. 189, and St. 1897, c. 239, as amended) upon its acceptance by a majority of the voters at the regular municipal election in 1963. A question concerning such acceptance was placed upon the ballot. At the election held on November 5, 1963, the vote was 11,566 for acceptance and 5,759 against acceptance. Recounts for certain offices were completed on December 16, 1963. No recount was held concerning the vote of accepting St. 1963, c. 734. The election results were not \u201cdeclared\u201d (see G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 137, as amended through St. 1935, c. 55) by the board of aldermen<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> until December 30, 1963, after unnecessary postponements of such action.</p>\n<p id=\"Anu\">On November 12, 1963, the second Tuesday of the month,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a meeting of the board of aldermen was held pursuant to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>unanimous vote of all the members of the hoard at a meeting held on October 22, 1963, that Rule 1 \u201che suspended, and the November regular meeting be held November 12, 1963. \u2019 \u2019 Notice of this proposed action was contained in the agenda distributed to each alderman by city messenger twenty four hours in advance of the October 22 meeting. On November 12, one alderman was absent. The rules were suspended by unanimous vote. Orders accepting St. 1963, c. 19 (police minimum compensation), and St. 1962, c. 520 (fire fighter minimum compensation), were given first readings and referred to committees by roll call votes of eleven to one. It was voted \u201cto hold the next meeting on Tuesday, November 19, 1963.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">At the November 19 meeting the minimum compensation orders were given a second and final reading. See \u00a7 25 of the charter. All board members were present. One aider-man, who was then acting mayor, could not participate under \u00a7 30 of the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">On December 3, 1963, the first Tuesday in December, a regular monthly meeting of the board (fn. 3) was held. Letters were received from the mayor. Each letter referred to one of the orders and purported to veto that order in the manner provided by \u00a7 27 of the charter (fn. 2). Both orders were passed notwithstanding the mayor\u2019s veto. A motion to reconsider the vote in each case was defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">On December 11, 1963, a special meeting was called by the mayor for purposes which included certification of the results of the November election. An order ratifying the results was referred to a committee. On December 17, 1963, another board meeting was held. A motion to reconsider the acceptance of the two minimum pay statutes was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>defeated. It was voted unanimously to hold the next meeting on December 30, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">On December 18, 1963, two referendum petitions (\u201cprotesting\u201d the December 3 orders) were filed with the city clerk by three defendants (the three petitioning voters) all of whom were members of the defendant Chicopee Taxpayers Association, Inc. (fn. 1). Each of these referendum petitions was signed by over twelve per cent of Chicopee\u2019s registered voters. Other facts concerning this petition are stated in point 2 of this opinion where the effect of the referendum petitions is discussed. The bills for declaratory relief raised various questions concerning (a) the validity of these referendum petitions and (b) whether the delay in declaring the results of the election held on November 5, 1963, prevented St. 1963, c. 734, from taking effect until too late to permit such referendum petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">1. The first question is whether the two readings given to the orders (accepting the minimum compensation statutes) at the board\u2019s meetings on November 12 and 19 were valid final action (subject to the mayor\u2019s veto and any available referendum) in view of Bule 1 of the board\u2019s rules (fn. 3) placing regular meetings of the board on the first Tuesday of each month and the explicit provisions of \u00a7 13 of the charter (a) giving to the mayor the power and duty to call special meetings by written notice, <em>\u20181 </em>stating the subjects to be considered thereat,\u201d and (b) forbidding \u201cfinal action\u201d at a special meeting \u201con any business not stated in such notice.\u201d See McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 13.08,13.37; Bhyne, Municipal Law, \u00a7 5-5. The meetings are questioned because neither was held (a) on a day specified in Bule 1 for a regular meeting, or (b) at the call of the mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">We think all questions about these two meetings are met by the following considerations. (1) The November 12 meeting, by unanimous consent of the board of aldermen voted at the meeting on October 22, was held on that day, in lieu of the regular meeting for November (which would normally have been held on November 5, election day). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>We think that such unanimous consent permits change, at least in advance of the usual meeting date, of the date set by rule for the regular meeting. It is much the same as if the meeting set for November 5 had been held on that day and then adjourned until November 12. All board members had consented to holding a regular meeting on that day, and had an opportunity to be present and to participate in any action. See <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Framingham, </em>345 Mass. 363, 364-365. See also <em>Stebbins </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>10 Cush. 27, 34; <em>Re Oxted Motor Co. Ltd. </em>[1921] 3 K. B. 32, 37, 39. (2) The meeting of November 12, held on that day by unanimous consent, could have been adjourned to November 19, and the adjourned meeting would still have been in effect a regular meeting. In the circumstances, we interpret the vote at the November 12 meeting \u201cto hold the next meeting on . . . November 19\u201d as designed and intended (a) to accomplish something which the board of aldermen lawfully could do without the consent of the mayor, viz. to adjourn the November 12 meeting for a week, rather than (b) to call a new special meeting, action which under \u00a7 13 (fn. 2) we assume (without deciding) would have required consent or participation of the mayor. A vote to adjourn or recess the November 12 meeting to the later date, of course, would have avoided doubt and would have been more accurate and appropriate action. See McQuil-lin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed.), \u00a7 13.38. See also <em>State, ex rel. Rees, </em>v. <em>Winchell, </em>136 Ohio St. 62, 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Accordingly, we hold that final action by the board of aldermen (subject to the mayor\u2019s power of veto and to any referendum) on the two pay statute acceptance orders properly did take place at the meeting on November 19. On December 3, 1963, these orders were duly passed over the mayor\u2019s veto at the regular meeting of the board of aider-men properly held on that day and became effective subject to any referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">2. We turn to the referendum petitions filed on December 18, 1963, with the city clerk, as already stated. If St. 1963, c. 734 (making available in Chicopee the referendum provisions of Gr. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 37-44), had then been ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>fectively accepted in Chicopee, the referendum petitions of December 18 were seasonably filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">(a) After the completion on December 16, 1963, of the last recount of votes cast at the election of November 5, 1963, there were meetings of the board of aldermen on December 17, 20, 23 (two meetings), 27, and 30, 1963. It was not until December 30 that the board adopted an order concerning ratification of the election (i.e. an order declaring its results). The mayor had twice requested earlier action on this declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The board of aldermen were under a duty \u201cforthwith\u201d to declare the votes (see G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 137, as amended through St. 1935, c. 55) upon the question submitted to the voters at the November 5, 1963, election. Upon the facts found by the master, the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that there was deliberate delay by the board in announcing the result of the November 5 vote on the question. As to that vote no recount had been sought. This delay caused the declaration (on December 30,1963) of the November 5 vote to take place after December 23, the last day for filing a referendum petition concerning the board\u2019s purported orders of December 3. See G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 42 (as amended through St. 1961, c. 550). The last day for asking a recount was November 12, 1963. See G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 135, as amended through St. 1963, cc. 234 and 627 (see also later amendments through St. 1966, c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">We need not decide whether, under \u00a7 137, the result of the vote on November 5 should (or could) have been declared by the board prior to the completion of other recounts concerning other issues or contests for public office. In any event, there had been public announcement of the result of that vote (see G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 105, as amended) followed by the expiration (without a petition for recount) of the period within which a recount petition could be filed with respect to that vote. Deliberate delay does not constitute the \u201cdue diligence\u201d contemplated by the word \u201cforthwith.\u201d See <em>Gamwell </em>v. <em>Bigley, </em>253 Mass. 378, 382; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bouchard, </em>347 Mass. 418, 420. Particularly is this so in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>matter of public concern. Even after December 16, 1963, when the last recount was completed, there was ample time for such a declaration, and there were several meetings of the board at which the declaration should have been made. Nothing in the record suggests that there was any matter relating to the November 5 vote which gave rise to any area of discretion in the board of aldermen (compare <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Mayor of Holyoke, </em>216 Mass. 62, 64, with <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>District Atty. for the No. Dist. </em>342 Mass. 212, 214-215), or which made the declaration of the result more than a ministerial act.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Substantive rights of voters cannot thus be thwarted. By a mandamus proceeding action could have been compelled. The purpose of our election statutes is to ascertain, in a sensible and expeditious manner, the will of the voters (see <em>Abbene </em>v. <em>Board of Election Commrs. of Revere, </em>348 Mass. 247, 250) and to inform the public promptly about election results. The purpose is not to be obstructed by such tactics. We treat the election declaration of December 30,1963, as relating back to November 5, 1963, the date of the election. Statute 1963, c. 734, provided that if the November 5 vote was \u201cin the affirmative, this act shall <em>thereupon </em>take effect\u201d (emphasis supplied). It did not say that the act would become effective when the board of aldermen got around to declaring the vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">(b) The petitions for referendum filed on December 18, 1963, within twenty days after the votes of December 3, 1963, were reasonably expressed, as the master in effect found, in a form showing that each signer wished to protest against the orders \u201ctaking effect.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 42 (as amended through St. 1961, c. 550). Minor discrepancies in the form of protest are of no importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>(c) General Laws c. 43, \u00a7 38, is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The procedure in that section applies to referendum petitions under G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 42.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The master found that the petitions were \u201cin conformity with\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 42 \u201cexcept in one particular and that is that neither petition contains the names and addresses of three persons \u2018designated as filing the same \u2019 as the statute calls for. \u2019 \u2019 There are, however, three signatures (of the three petitioning voters) on the face sheet of each petition but these are stated to be those who \u201ccirculated the petition.\u201d The three petitioning voters were, as the master found, all present with the city clerk in his office when the petitions were filed. Bach of them signed the face sheet of each petition (adding his address).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">We think that having the three petitioning voters sign the face sheet (adding their addresses) effected compliance with the italicized words of \u00a7 38 (fn. 5) and that this was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>or should have been, readily apparent to the city clerk and to the registrars of voters. We hold that what was done was all that was necessary. The usual procedures required by \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 42 for submitting to the voters the issues raised by the referendum petitions then should have been followed by the appropriate city officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">3. The interlocutory and final decrees are reversed. The cases are to be remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The Superior Court may retain jurisdiction of these cases until the referenda sought by the petitions filed December 18, 1963, have been held and the results declared. New final decrees are to be entered declaring (1) that St. 1962, c. 520, and St. 1963, c. 19, were accepted by votes of the board of aldermen on December 3,1963, subject, however, to the possibility of referenda; (2) that the referendum petitions filed December 18, 1963, were seasonably filed and were valid; and (c) that referendum questions concerning the acceptance of St. 1962, c. 520, and St. 1963, c. 19, are to be submitted to the voters at the next municipal election or at a duly called special election.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"alj-dedup-0\"> Chicopee\u2019s charter (St. 1897, c. 239) provides (emphasis supplied), in part (\u00a7 2), \u201cThe administration of all the . . . affairs [except those relating to the public schools] of said city . . . shall ... be vested in an executive department . . . the mayor, and in a legislative department, which shall consist of . . . the board of aldermen . . ..\u201d (\u00a7 13), \u201cThe board of aldermen shall hold regular meetings at such times as may be designated by the board <em>by general rule. </em>The <em>mayor </em>may at any time call <em>a special meeting </em>. . . and shall call a special meeting upon the request in writing of one third of the members.
