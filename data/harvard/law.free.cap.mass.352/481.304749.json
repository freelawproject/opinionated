The case was heard on a statement of agreed facts. A final decree was entered dismissing the bill from which the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">The plaintiff was born on June 25, 1894, and was appointed a deputy sheriff on January 4,1939, for a period of six years. He was reappointed to that position every six years until May 4, 1961, at which time he was appointed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>court officer effective May 8, 1961, under Gr. L. c. 221, \u00a7 70, as amended by St. 1960, c. 719. As deputy sheriff \u201che was assigned on various days ... to attend sessions of the Supreme Judicial Court and the Superior Court . . . for which services he was paid compensation based on a per diem basis for each day he served in court.\u201d During his service as deputy sheriff he served \u201capproximately\u201d from between 52 and 150 days per year on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The plaintiff was denied membership in the Bristol County retirement system. <em>Andrade </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>350 Mass. 447. Acting pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 20 (5) (e), the Bristol County Board of Retirement (board) notified the plaintiff \u201cthat his services as a court officer would terminate as of June 30,1964. The sole reason for this action was that the . . . [plaintiff] would be seventy years old as of June 25, 1964.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">1. The plaintiff argues first that his removal from office is a judicial act which cannot be exercised by the Executive without violating art. 30 of the Declaration of Rights. In support of his argument he cites G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 16, which requires sheriffs to attend all sessions of the Superior Court in their respective counties \u201cby themselves or by their deputies\u201d and G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 70, which authorizes certain sheriffs to delegate their duty to salaried court officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">As the plaintiff concedes in his brief, there is a distinction between \u201cjudicial officers whose sole function it is to determine rights and duties . . . [and] another class of officers to carry into effect the decisions and decrees made by the courts.\u201d This latter class of officer is certainly not a \u201cjudicial officer\u201d within the meaning of Part 2, c. 2, \u00a7 1, art. 9, or Part 2, c. 3, art. 1 of the Massachusetts Constitution whose retirement could not be compelled by statute. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>271 Mass. 575, 578-582.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">It is established-that the courts may properly inquire into the fitness of certain officers (see <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>239 Mass. 458, 480; <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>240 Mass. 264, 296; <em>Massachusetts Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>351 Mass. 321), and that \u201c [t]his power of removal is judicial in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>sense that it is incidental to the performance of the judicial functions of the court.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>300 Mass. 596, 598. But this is not to say that the Legislature may not set terms of office and the age for retirement of such officers and set up an agency to be administered by the Executive which is empowered to determine, subject to normal channels of judicial review, whether a State employee who is also a court officer has reached the statutory retirement age. The Legislature, by determining the age for retirement and other general qualifications for such officers, and the Executive, by administering such laws, do not \u201cexercise the . . . judicial powers\u201d in contravention of art. 30 of the Declaration of Bights.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">2. The plaintiff argues that he \u201cdoes not fall within the purview of the language of G. L. c. 32.\u201d Section 20 (5) of that statute provides in part, \u201cThe board of each such system shall keep a record of the date of birth of each member of the system, and also shall keep . . . [such record for] each other employee who entered or re-entered the service of the governmental unit to which such system pertains after attaining age sixty and after the date when the system became operative therein. . . . [The board shall] notify each such . . . employee ... of the date when such . . . employee will attain the maximum age for his group, and such . . . employee shall not be employed in any governmental unit after such date . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The plaintiff contends that he did not \u201center or re-enter\u201d the service of Bristol County after attaining the age of sixty because he has \u201cbeen employed in the same capacity by Bristol County since 1939.\u201d He urges that \u201c [t]he essential characteristic of employment is the duties of the employee. Whether an employee is salaried or paid on a per-diem basis is an accidental matter and has little effect on the legal status of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">But the \u201clegal status of employment\u201d in this case is governed by statute. General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 1, defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cany person who is regularly employed in the service of any . . . political subdivision.\u201d We had occa-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>si\u00f3ri in <em>Andrade </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>350 Mass. 447, 449-450, to consider the effect of this definition on the status of this plaintiff. We upheld the decision of the hoard that the plaintiff was not eligible for membership in the Bristol County retirement system. The board had exercised its discretion under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3 (2) (d), to determine that the plaintiff was not eligible for membership in the retirement system. The basis for that decision was, necessarily, that prior to the appointment of the plaintiff as a court officer, he was not an \u201cemployee\u201d for the purposes of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3 (2) (f), \"because he was not \u201cregularly employed.\u201d Hence he was not eligible to join the system under the provisions of \u00a7 3 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">It follows that since the plaintiff was not an \u201cemployee\u201d of Bristol County within the definition of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, at the time of his appointment as a court officer in May, 1961, he \u201centered or re-entered\u201d the service of Bristol County as of that date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The plaintiff cannot rely on <em>Essex County Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>North Andover, </em>349 Mass. 233, 236, because the reason for his ineligibility for membership in the retirement system is his entry into employment after the age of sixty. Only if the position currently held by the plaintiff disqualified him for membership in the system would the <em>Essex </em>case protect him from mandatory retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">3. The plaintiff also argues that G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prevents his retirement because his \u201cremoval must be approved by the Justices of the Superior Court; and, having failed to do so, the attempt to terminate the . . . [plaintiff\u2019s] employment is a nullity.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Compulsory retirement of employees of a political subdivision is governed by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5. Even though superannuation would not be a breach of good behavior, the tenure of court officers is set by the Legislature and not by the Constitution. Cf. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>271 Mass. 575, 580. The statute requires the retirement of court officers for superannuation in accordance with the condition set forth therein. The effect of G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 72, is to permit the earlier removal of such an officer for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\"> We are puzzled <em>by </em>the plaintiff\u2019s assertion in his brief that the <em>Andrade </em>case holds that the plaintiff \u201cwas an employee of Bristol County prior to his sixtieth birthday.\u201d Perhaps the confusion is due to the use of the word \u201cemployee\u201d in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3 (2) (d), to describe even part time workers whom the board must pass upon to determine their eligibility for the retirement system. But- the controlling section is \u00a7 1 where employee is defined for the purposes of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-9\"> The section provides in material part, \u201c [C]curt officers . . . shall hold office during good behavior and until they are removed by the sheriff . . . for cause approved by the justices of the court for attendance upon which they were appointed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
