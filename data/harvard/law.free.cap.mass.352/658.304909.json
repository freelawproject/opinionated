The final decree of the Superior Court adjudged that the employee had suffered a personal injury arising out of, and in the course of, her employment and remanded the case to the Industrial Accident Board for the purpose of computing total disability and dependency compensation which, with counsel fees, was ordered paid. The insurer appealed. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The single member found that the employee was a registered nurse employed by the Revere Visiting Nurse Association who worked five days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Upon reporting to work each morning she would be given a list of calls to be made. The association had one automobile and she and one or more of her associates employed it in their rounds. She usually reported back during the day for further instructions on additional calls. On January 13, 1964, it was snowing and sleeting. She reported as usual after a ten minute walk from her home and made her assigned calls during the morning. \u2018 \u2018 The storm worsened and the director of nurses suggested that she and her associate . . . take the car to the garage and leave it there, and then go home for the remainder of the day, because of the storm. She further told the employee that she would be \u2018on call\u2019 until her usual quitting time; that is, 4:30 p.m.\u201d The associate drove the car to the garage and the employee left it. While on her way home she fell on a slippery sidewalk and injured her right wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The conclusion of the single member was that \u201c [t]he employee\u2019s trip from the garage to her home was not a part of the \u2018business affairs or undertakings of her employer. \u2019 The fact that she was excused from work for the afternoon was for her convenience and safety, and the fact that she was to remain \u2018on call\u2019 did not make the trip between the garage and her home a trip in the course of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d We view this conclusion as an error of law. Injury to the employee occurred while, in response to her employer\u2019s direction, she was making her way home where, as she testified (as the only witness), she was \u201cobliged to stay . . . until at least 4:30\u201d subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>possible further instruction. As the employee has pointed out in her brief, this distinguishes this case from <em>Jarek\u2019s Case, </em>326 Mass. 182, where the employee left his place of employment with permission to return home for the purpose of telling his wife he was going to work late. See <em>Simmons\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass. 319. Prior to her injury there was no break in time when it might be said that this employee was not acting subject to instructions by her employer and in the course of her employment. See <em>Souza\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 332, 335-336. Cf. <em>Levin </em>v. <em>Twin Tanners, Inc. </em>318 Mass. 13, 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
