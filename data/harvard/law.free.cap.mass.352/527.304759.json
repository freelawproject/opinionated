The case is before us on a statement of agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">On August 11, 1958, Errico was appointed (without the statement of any specific term in the notice of appointment) a member of the Revere board of assessors by the city manager. Revere was then under a Plan E charter. See G. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 1 to 45, 93 to 116, as amended. An ordinance (\u00a7 2-96) adopted in 1953 provided that there should be three assessors appointed by the city manager \u201cwho shall serve until their successors are appointed and qualified\u201d and that the city manager should fill any vacancy. In the election of November, 1964, Revere accepted the Plan B charter. See G. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 1-45, 56-63, as amended. On January 10, 1966, the mayor nominated two of the defendants (see fn. 1) to be members of the board of assessors. They were confirmed that day by the city council. Errico was a veteran of the type referred to in G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 112A (inserted by St. 1947, c. 276), which had been accepted in Revere.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The trial judge ruled (1) that Errico\u2019s term, see G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 24,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cwas for three years and thereafter until his successor was duly elected or appointed\u201d; (2) that the position of assessor thus was \u201can appointive office for a fixed term\u201d under c. 41, \u00a7 112A;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) that Errico \u201ccould be involuntarily separated from office without compliance with\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 43, 45; (4) that this result was not affected by the fact that Errico \u201cwas a holdover occupant of the office\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>when Revere accepted c. 41, \u00a7 112A; and (5) that the mayor\u2019s appointment on January 10,1966, of two assessors, was the appointment of Errico\u2019s successor in office with the consequence that he then ceased to hold office. Errico appeals from a final decree making declarations in accordance with the judge\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Errico, of course, received no protection from c. 41, \u00a7 112A (fn. 3), if his appointment was \u201cfor a fixed term.\u201d The trial judge was right in ruling that the appointment, by virtue of c. 41, \u00a7 24, was for a three year term. Very general statutory language relating to the Plan E form of charter (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 104, 105<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) to the effect that the city manager \u201cshall make all appointments and removals,\u201d does not operate to make indefinite for assessors (who are public officers required by c. 41, \u00a7 24) the specific term of three years provided by \u00a7 24 (fn. 2). See the discussion in <em>City Manager of Medford </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn. </em>329 Mass. 323, 324. We need not consider whether and to what extent \u00a7 105 may have given authority to the former city manager to remove his appointees. To the extent that removal power existed, it existed by virtue of a statute (e.g. \u00a7 105). It thus had no tendency to show that under \u00a7 24 Revere assessors were not appointed for a fixed term. Cf. <em>Adie </em>v. <em>Mayor of Holyoke, </em>303 Mass. 295, 299-302. The question now before us was not presented in <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>351 Mass. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">We hold that, in the circumstances, Errico gains no benefit from \u00a7 112A.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b566-7\"> Section 24 (as amended through St. 1953, c. 267, \u00a7 2) reads, \u201c. . . The assessors in every city . . . shall be . . . appointed as otherwise provided by law; but as nearly <em>one </em>third of their number as may be shall be . . . appointed annually, each to hold office for three years and thereafter until his successor is duly elected or appointed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\"> Section 112A (inserted by St. 1947, c. 276) reads in part, <em>\u201cA </em>veteran . . . who holds in the service of a city which accepts this section ... an office or position not classified under . . . [c. 31], other than <em>... an appointive office for a fixed term . . . </em>and has held such office or position for not less than five years, shall not be involuntarily separated from such office or position except ... in accordance with\u201d e. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 43 and 45 \u201cto the same extent as if said office or position were classified under\u201d e. 31 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\"> Section 105 reads in part, \u2018\u2018 Such officers ... as the city council, with the advice of the city manager, shall determine are necessary for the proper administration of the . . . boards ... of the city for whose administration the city manager is responsible shall be appointed, and may be removed, by the city manager.\u201d Assessors, of course, are officers whose duties are largely prescribed by statute. See G. L. c. 59. We would be slow to hold that general statutory language relating to standard form charters affected the precise provisions of e. 41, \u00a7 24, in the absence of a clear indication of legislative intention that this be the result.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
