The case was heard in the Superior- Court by a judge without a jury, on the pleadings and a stipulation. The case is here on the defendant\u2019s exception to the judge ordering judgment for the Commonwealth in the sum of $13,113.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>The only issue before us is whether, under St. 1948, c. 544, \u00a7 14, and St. 1960, c. 701, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 16, the defendant is liable to the Commonwealth for the cost of the State audits.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The predecessor of the defendant was created by St. 1948, c. 544. Section 14 of that statute provided in material part: \u201cThe Authority shall cause an audit of its books to be made at least once in each year by the state auditor, and the cost thereof may be treated as part of the operation of the project.\u201d By St. 1960, c. 701, \u00a7 16, the defendant took over the assets of its predecessor and assumed all its liabilities. Section 13 thereof makes no material change in St. 1948, c. 544, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In St. 1966, c. 411, a major appropriations statute, item 0701-02 appropriated funds \u201c [f]or the office of the auditor . . . provided, that any expense incurred in the audit of the . . . [defendant] shall be reimbursed by said authority, as provided by law.\u201d Similar statements are found in prior appropriations statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">It is a well established principle of statutory interpretation that \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>[n] one of the words of a statute is to be regarded as superfluous, but each is to be given its ordinary meaning without overemphasizing its effect upon the other terms appearing in the statute, so that the enactment considered as a whole shall constitute a consistent and harmonious statutory provision capable of effectuating the presumed intention of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>319 Mass. 81, 84-85. <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Commn. </em>342 Mass. 222, 225. If the Legislature had not intended that the defendant reimburse the Commonwealth for the cost of the State audits it would not have been necessary for the statute to provide that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>cost thereof may be treated as part of the operation of the project.\u201d In addition, the provision in the appropriations statutes since 1955 for reimbursement reveals the legislative intent that such reimbursement be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The defendant discusses similar sections in the statutes setting up various other public authorities. In some instances an audit is required to be made by a certified public accountant. St. 1956, c. 465, \u00a7 21 (Massachusetts Port Authority). In others, the State auditor is specified, as in St. 1953, c. 669, \u00a7 7 (Boston Arena Authority), and in the case at bar. General Laws c. 11, \u00a7 12, was amended by St. 1962, \u00a7 733, to provide for an annual audit by the State auditor of \u201cauthorities created by the general court,\u201d and it was further provided that \u201cThe examination of the accounts of . . . authorities required by this section shall be made in addition to any audit required by the law creating such . . . authority.\u201d The defendant argues that \u201cit seems incredible that the Legislature should have intended to saddle\u201d those authorities required to have an audit made by an independent certified public accountant \u2018 \u2018with a second audit fee. \u2019 \u2019 But the audit under G. L. c. 11, \u00a7 12, as amended, is made in pursuance of the auditor\u2019s supervisory function, not as a service to the authority. Where no audit is made by an independent accountant the State auditor performs two functions. He is not only the overseer for the Commonwealth, but also performs a service for the authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We believe the Legislature intended that the Commonwealth be reimbursed for the auditor\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The defendant relies heavily on the fact that the statutes do not direct reimbursement in so many words. We do not consider it significant that in \u00a7 17 of G. L. c. 161A, inserted by St. 1964, c. 563, establishing the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, there is specific language requiring the Commonwealth to be reimbursed for the cost of the audit. We view the 1964 statute as a clarification of any doubts which may have existed prior to its enactment, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>as \u201cindicative that the law as it stood before St. 1964, c. 563 . . . did not impose any obligation upon existing authorities ... to reimburse the Commonwealth for the cost of audits made by the State Auditor\u201d as argued by the defendant. Where, as in the instant case, the inference to be drawn from the statutory language is clear, the specific language desired by the defendant is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\"> St. 1955, c. 706, item 0701-24. <em>1 </em>lO\u00f1fi <em>o </em>koi &gt;&gt; \u201d <em>7 7 </em>1956, e. 501, <em>77 7 7 &gt;7 </em>1957, c. 438, <em>7 7 7 7 7 7 </em>1958, e. 434, <em>7 7 7 7 7 7 </em>1959, e. 433, <em>7 7 7 7 7 7 </em>1960, c. 507, <em>7 7 7 7 7\u2019 </em>1961, c. 495, <em>7 7 77 7 7 </em>1962, e. 591, <em>7 7 7 7 7 7 </em>1963, e. 500, <em>7 7 77 7 7 </em>1964, c. 665, <em>7 7 </em>0701-02. <em>7 7 </em>1965, c. 824, <em>7 7 </em>, <em>7</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\"> We assume that both functions could he performed in a single audit by the State auditor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
