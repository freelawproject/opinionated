L. c. 273A, the Uni-</p>\n<p id=\"Ae5V\">form Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (see c. 273A, \u00a7 17), seeks support for her minor child. The petition was filed in 1964 in the Family Court, Rockland County, State of New York, under the New York Uniform Support of Dependents Law, which is substantially similar to G. L. c. 273A. The petition alleged (1) that the respondent is the father of the petitioner\u2019s child, then seven months old, (2) that the respondent is a college student residing in Massachusetts, and (3) that he has neglected to provide fair and reasonable support for the petitioner and the child. In sworn written assertions, attached to the petition under the heading, \u2018\u2018Testimony of Petitioner,\u201d the petitioner states, among other things, that she lives in the State of New York, that she has never been married, that she never lived with the respondent, that there was (at the time of the testimony) no outstanding complaint or order for support, that she is living with her parents who support her and her baby, and that a \u201cprivate investigator hired by . . . [her] has a statement from the respondent in which . . . [he] admits having sexual relations with\u201d her.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>The papers were forwarded<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the First District Court of Bristol in accordance with G. L. c. 273A, and were filed in that court on September 2, 1964. After trial in that court on June 22,1965, the judge found that the respondent was the father of the child and that the \u201crespondent gave the petitioner a false name . . . during the time of their meetings . . . [so that] it was necessary for the petitioner to hire a lawyer and a private investigator. \u2019 \u2019 The respondent was ordered to pay support of $10 a week plus medical, legal, and investigation bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">There was the following testimony at the trial. The respondent attended an athletic tournament in New York City on March 20, 1963. There he met the petitioner, a high school student. They had sexual relations on March 21, 1963, as the respondent admitted to one Stawinsky, a private investigator. A baby was born on December 20,1963. The respondent\u2019s domicil is in Massachusetts. The petitioner has her domicil in New York. The child lives with her there.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The respondent requested, and the trial judge denied, rulings (a) that as matter of law there must be a finding for the respondent, and (b) that an \u201cadjudication of paternity may not be made under\u201d G. L. c. 273A. The Appellate Division dismissed a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">1. The evidence warranted the trial judge (if he had jurisdiction to consider that issue) in deciding that the respondent was the father of the petitioner\u2019s child. The essential question, raised clearly by the second request for ruling, is whether the District Court could properly determine the contested issue of paternity in this proceeding under G. L. c. 273A.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">2. The proceedings are civil. \u201cThe purpose of the uniform act [c. 273A] is to provide an effective procedure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>compel performance by one under a duty to support dependents in another State.\u201d See <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>336 Mass. 561, 562-563.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See also <em>Keene </em>v. <em>Toth, </em>335 Mass. 591, 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">This court, in these cases, has recognized the requirement of c. 273A, \u00a7 17, that the act \u201cshall be so construed and interpreted as to accomplish its general purpose\u201d (see <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>338 Mass. 263, 269) and has avoided restrictive application of its provisions. The civil remedies afforded by this statute are not to be construed narrowly and every \u201cendeavor should be made ... to render this statute operable. \u2019 \u2019 See <em>Pfueller </em>v. <em>Pfueller, </em>37 N. J. Super. 106, 109. See also <em>Lambrou </em>v. <em>Berna, </em>154 Maine, 352, 356; <em>State of Ill. ex rel. Shannon </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>248 Minn. 266, 274-275; <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Daly, </em>39 N. J. Super. 117, <em>128; Re Duncan, </em>172 N. E. 2d 478, 480-481 (Ct. App. Ohio); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shaffer, </em>175 Pa. Super. 100, 106; note, 45 Ill. L. Rev. 252, 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Pertinent provisions of c. 273A (in general as amended through St. 1954, c. 556, \u00a7 1) are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>These statutory provisions, and others mentioned below, provide a procedure which may be summarized as follows. (1) The appropriate court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the initiating State, that is, the State (here New York) of residence of the obligee, here the child (see \u00a7 6), determines that there exists probable cause for enforcement of a right of support under c. 273A. See \u00a7 8; <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>338 Mass. 263, 269. (2) That court transmits to the appropriate court of the responding State the petition and other appropriate documents. (3) The proper court in the responding State (here Massachusetts) proceeds to <em>\u201ca </em>speedy hearing.\u201d See \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It then determines <em>(\u00a7 </em>10) whether a \u201cduty of support\u201d exists. (4) If \u201cthe court finds [that such] a duty of support\u201d exists, it may issue an appropriate order. See Brockelbank, Interstate Enforcement of Family Support, pp. 47-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Because (\u00a7 2) the remedies in c. 273A \u201care in addition to . . . any other remedy\u201d (see <em>Helgesson </em>v. <em>Helgesson, </em>196 F. Supp. 42, 46 [D. Mass.], affd. 295 F. 2d 37 [1st Cir.]), the special civil remedy (given to District Courts in Massachusetts) under c. 273A is not in terms dependent upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>compliance with the requirements of any other procedures provided by other statutes (in the responding State) for enforcement of the same support obligation. Chapter 273A provides its own procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Support is now sought for a period during which the respondent has been a resident of Massachusetts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This Commonwealth, by G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 15, places a father under a legal duty to support an illegitimate child wherever begotten.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 15 is a criminal statute for it creates a misdemeanor. Although criminal in form, it is sometimes regarded and used as a method of enforcing a support duty. That this is so is indicated by G. L. c. 273, <em>\u00a7 17 </em>(as amended through St. 1953, c. 163), permitting the dismissal of a complaint on various grounds, including the fact \u201cthat adequate provision has been made for its [the child\u2019s] maintenance, or that it is for the best interests of the child.\u201d In any event, even though in form a criminal statute, c. 273, \u00a7 15, clearly establishes the civil duty of a natural father to support a child of his born out of wedlock. The question for decision is whether the existence of his relationship to the child (that is, his paternity) can be established in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>civil proceeding under c. 273A, where Massachusetts is a responding State.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">No practical considerations preclude having the Massachusetts District Courts determine paternity in civil proceedings under c. 273A. These courts<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> habitually make such determinations in criminal proceedings under c. 273, \u00a7\u00a7 11-18. The principal difference between a civil proceeding under c. 273A and a quasi-criminal nonsupport prosecution under c. 273 is that appellate review under c. 273A will be by the Appellate Division (see St. 1954, c. 556, \u00a7 9) rather than (as under c. 273) by the Superior Court with a jury trial de nova. These courts have available to them in civil proceedings under c. 273A at least the same powers of investigation available to them under c. 273.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">We recognize that in many proceedings under c. 273A, especially where there is little dispute on the facts, the petitioner may never appear in person in the court of the responding State. See Brockelbank, op. cit. pp. 51-53.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See also <em>Aberlin </em>v. <em>Aberlin, </em>3 App. Div. 2d (N. Y.) 417, 419, 421. Evidence often is offered only by deposition or through the respondent. In a contested paternity case this may not be at all appropriate, for the issues are such that presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the parties before the trier of the fact may be of great importance. No such problem, however, exists in the present case for the petitioner, her father, the respondent, and other witnesses were all present in person in the District Court and testified. In such circumstances, considerations of prompt adjudication and of carrying out the beneficial purposes of the uniform reciprocal support act lead to determination, in the civil c. 273A proceedings, of the civil issue whether a duty of support exists because of paternity. See Brockelbank, op. cit. pp. 57-58. We construe c. 273A (even if it is largely procedural and even though it creates no new substantive rights or duties) as providing a new and additional civil remedy (\u00a7 2, fn. 3) for the enforcement of all relevant preexisting substantive rights. See <em>Ivey </em>v. <em>Ayers, </em>301 S. W. 2d 790, 794-797 (Mo.). See also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>131 Cal. App. 2d 764, 770; <em>Illinois ex rel. Shannon </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>248 Minn. 266, 274; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shaffer, </em>175 Pa. Super. 100, 108-109.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The broad language of c. 273A, \u00a7 10, permits enforcement of the support obligation, if \u201cthe court finds a duty of support.\u201d We regard this language as specifically and adequately placing this civil remedy in the District Court and enabling the judges of that court to make in civil proceedings under c. 273A the same type of determination of paternity (as a basis of finding a \u201cduty of support\u201d) which it is clearly possible for them to make in criminal proceedings under c. 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Chapter 273A provides for the enforcement of a duty of support which is essentially equitable in character. See <em>Hatfield </em>v. <em>Klimoski, </em>338 Mass. 81, 83-84; <em>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, to the use of Warren </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>204 Md. 467, 472-475. Because proceedings under c. 273A have no criminal aspect, they are unlike those under c. 273, \u00a7\u00a7 11,12, and 15, which, because criminal, afford to a defendant father an appeal (from a conviction in the District Court) to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 131, \u00a7 8). By c. 273A, \u00a7 10, as has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>noted, \u201cthe court\u201d is charged with deciding whether there is \u201ca duty to support.\u201d In the present case, no appeal was claimed under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 97, hut in any event an appeal under \u00a7 97 would be inconsistent with the review provided by St. 1954, c. 556, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">3. We conclude that the determination of paternity was properly made under c. 273A and that there was no error in denying the respondent\u2019s requested rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\"> The judge of the Family Court certified that he had examined the petitioner under oath, that the petition \u201cwas duly filed . . . under the . . .

Because begetting, to constitute a crime in Massachusetts, must have occurred in this State (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanoue, </em>326 Mass. 559, 560-563), \u00a7 11 often will have no relevance in a case where Massachusetts is a responding State under e. 273A, unless, of course, the child was begotten here. See also sections related to \u00a7 15, e.g. c. 273, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 12A, 16._ As a practical matter and in effect \u00a7 15 is often applied essentially as a civil remedy much like the Uniform Act on Paternity, drafted in 1960 but not adopted in Massachusetts.
