L. c. 231A is brought against Massachusetts Envelope Company and Jerome Grossman, its president and clerk, for a binding declaration as to the plaintiff\u2019s status as a stockholder. A demurrer was sustained generally by an interlocutory decree. A final decree dismissed the bill with prejudice, reciting 'that the plaintiff had been guilty of loches. The plaintiff appealed from the decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The bill alleges that the plaintiff is the owner and holder of fifteen shares of the common stock issued to him on December 23, 1936, which have never been transferred on the books. The corporation was organized under the laws of Massachusetts on December 21, 1936, the capital stock issued being 1,000 common shares. On December 22, 1936, the plaintiff, described as a director, first vice-president, and principal salesman, signed a written document, which was entitled, \u201cAgreement between Massachusetts Envelope Company, hereinafter called the Corporation, and the undersigned employee, William J. Travers.\u201d This provided: \u201cThere has been issued to the said employee, William J. Travers, fifteen shares of the common capital stock of Massachusetts Envelope Company. In consideration of the issue of said shares, said employee agrees, and it is one of the conditions upon which the said shares have been issued to him, that, in the event that the said employee shall cease for any reason to be employed by the said Corporation, said employee or his executors and administrators, if any, will forthwith upon such termination, assign and transfer said shares to the said Corporation.\u201d Another paragraph provides for payment by the corporation, upon the transfer of the employee\u2019s shares, of the pro rata amount of the undistributed earned surplus as shown by the semi-annual inventory and account of the corporation next prior to the date of transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Apparently the agreement was not signed on behalf of the corporation, but there was a longhand statement on the back of the certificate, which read, \u201cThe shares represented by this certificate are held by the stockholder subject to the agreement with the corporation dated December 22, 1936.\u201d There is nothing to show a waiver by the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">On December 16,1939, after difficulties with the management, the plaintiff tendered his resignation to take effect immediately. He ceased to be an employee, but was never notified of the acceptance of his resignation either as an officer or director. He has never been requested to transfer his stock to the corporation. After resigning he has re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ceived no notice of stockholders\u2019 meetings, no dividends, and no reports of the corporation\u2019s financial condition. The corporation denies that the plaintiff is a shareholder and refuses to recognize him as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The grounds of demurrer are (1) want of equity and (2) loches in that, without cause, the plaintiff unreasonably neglected and delayed institution of this suit to the prejudice of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The plaintiff terms the decision below a forfeiture of his property and an unjust enrichment of the corporation. This assertion gives no weight to the fact that his stockholder\u2019s standing arose as an incident of the employment he has voluntarily renounced and as a condition of which his duty was forthwith upon resignation to transfer the shares to the corporation. Having failed in this, now more than a quarter of a century later, he tries to place the consequences of his breach upon the corporation because it did not demand compliance, a promise it had never made.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s loches is apparent on the face of the bill. <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Lally, </em>308 Mass. 41, 44. <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine R.R. </em>343 Mass. 684, 685. There is far more than a mere delay, which is all there was in <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Chioda, </em>317 Mass. 446, 452, and <em>Security Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>345 Mass. 434, 441. There is patent disadvantage to the corporate defendant. The plaintiff was well aware that he was no longer recognized as a stockholder, but nevertheless throughout twenty-six years took no action. Under the contract, upon transfer of the stock he was entitled to the pro rata amount (fifteen one thousandths) of the undistributed earned surplus as of the corporation\u2019s previous inventory and balance sheet. In one of the prayers he seeks to examine \u201csuch portion of its records as will bear upon and tend to show the pro rata amount, if any, of the undistributed earned surplus of the corporation as of the latest semi-annual inventory and account of the corporation, and supporting data therefor including prior inventory records and accounts. \u2019 \u2019 This active purpose in prosecuting this suit, to enlarge the corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>ration\u2019s undertaking, is a graphic illustration of delay to its prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The bill states the existence of a controversy and other facts entitling the plaintiff to a binding declaration as to his rights as a stockholder. It, accordingly, was error to sustain the demurrer and to dismiss the bill. <em>Carlton Hotel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>322 Mass. 201, 203. <em>Willcutt </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>340 Mass. 532, 535. <em>Hannan </em>v. <em>Enterprise Publishing Co. </em>341 Mass. 363, 365. <em>Trustees of Reservations v. Stockbridge, </em>348 Mass. 511, 513. <em>School Comm. of New Bedford </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ. </em>349 Mass. 410, 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The interlocutory decree and the final decree are reversed. There is to be a new interlocutory decree overruling the demurrer, and a final decree is to enter declaring that the plaintiff by reason of loches has lost his rights as stockholder of the defendant corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
