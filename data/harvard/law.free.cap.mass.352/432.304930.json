The case was tried under the provisions of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G and is here on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">Although the defendant filed five assignments of error the argument in his brief, except for a meager reference to the exclusion of certain testimony, is directed to what he states was the refusal of the \u201ctrial judge ... to allow the defendant to file his proposed motion to suppress because the vehicle in question was stolen and the real estate upon which the vehicle was located was not his.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">We summarize the pertinent testimony in relation to the motion to suppress. Lieutenant Collins of the Somerville police following a conversation with the defendant visited the premises of the Granite Research Laboratories (Gran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>ite). Granite was a customer of the defendant and was using the Fruehauf trailer for storage. He was accompanied by Joseph McDonald, a special agent for the National Automobile Theft Bureau, Richard Daley and Herbert L. Burr, investigators for the Registry of Motor Vehicles. They \u201cobtained the serial number from the underpart of the flat-body [of the] trailer.\u201d The \u201cvehicle identification number\u201d had been removed. The number was observed on the \u201cstrike plate\u201d of the trailer, which is \u201cthe part where the tractor backs into and hooks onto\u201d the trailer. The strike plate was photographed and the photographs were introduced in evidence. Other photographs were introduced which showed the trailer standing in an open lot on the premises of Granite.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">1. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on two grounds. First, the trailer was on the property of a third party. Second, the defendant\u2019s title to the trailer was in dispute. In effect, the judge ruled that the defendant, for those reasons, did not have standing to raise the issue of the legality of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We assume, without deciding, that the judge should have considered the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim of an unreasonable search and seizure. However there is adequate evidence in the record to show that no \u201csearch\u201d took place. There is no evidence as to whether the police went on the premises of Granite with or without permission. But even if they were trespassers the evidence they obtained was not thereby rendered inadmissible. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Romano, </em>330 F. 2d 566, 569 (2d Cir.), cert. den. 380 U. S. 942; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>227 F. Supp. 433, 436 (S. D. N. Y.). The evidence shows that the \u201csearch\u201d consisted of inspecting the underside of the trailer and noting the serial number found there. No \u201centry\u201d was made. Indeed, from the photographs of the flatbed trailer it appears no entry was possible. Such an inspection of the surface of the vehicle is not a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">2. The defendant also contends that \u201cthe trial judge should have permitted the defendant to impeach the eredi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>bility of the commonwealth\u2019s chief witness by showing through independent proof that his testimony was incorrect.\u201d That statement, plus two citations, is the extent of the defendant\u2019s contention on this point and can scarcely be considered an argument. We are satisfied that the judge did not exceed his sound discretion in limiting the cross-examination. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Makarewicz, </em>333 Mass. 575, 593. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palladino, </em>346 Mass. 720, 723. To the contrary, we believe that the judge permitted the defendant considerable latitude in his cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
