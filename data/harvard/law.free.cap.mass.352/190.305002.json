The trial judge made findings (adopted as a report of material facts) and concluded that Plante\u2019s retirement allowance should not be based upon sixty-five per cent of the chief\u2019s salary. From a final decree maldng a declaration to this effect, Plante appeals. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">In 1937, Plante (whose service began in 1911) became deputy chief of the fire department. On April 30, 1954, he was designated \u201c [ajcting [e]hief . . . until further notice. \u2019 \u2019 From that date until his retirement on February 16, 1957, upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of sixty-five, he continuously performed the duties of chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">The city manager, shortly after April 30, 1954, recommended that Plante be given compensation equal to that of the chief but no such vote was ever adopted. Upon his retirement \u201cas senior deputy\u201d he was paid, and is receiving, a pension of $4,485, based on sixty-five per cent of the pay of the senior deputy chief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">By Ordinance No. 157 (Medford Ordinances, c. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 69, 70), effective January 1, 1957, the city adopted a compensation plan. Section 69.05 of this plan provided, \u201cIn the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>event that an employee is given the title \u2018Acting,\u2019 the compensation for the position <em>may or may not </em>be paid to the acting employee in the discretion of the Employing Authority. If an employee <em>remains </em>in the capacity of \u2018Acting\u2019 for more than six months, he shall be paid the compensation attached to the position but payment of said compensation shall not affect the employee\u2019s status as \u2018Acting\u2019 \u201d (emphasis supplied). Prior to the adoption of the ordinance there was no provision that an employee in an \u201cacting\u201d status should receive the compensation of the chief of the fire department.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The trial judge ruled that Plante was \u201cnot entitled to a retirement pay equal to 65 per cent of . . . the salary of the fire chief,\u201d because he had not served in an acting capacity, as defined in \u00a7 69.05 for more than six months after the adoption of Ordinance No. 157, for he \u201chad been retired . . . only 47 days after the pay plan was adopted.\u201d The question before us is whether this ruling is correct in view of the fact that for thirty-two months prior to January 1, 1957, Plante had been serving as acting chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Section 69.05 can be interpreted as applying from January 1,1957, to persons who then (or at any time thereafter) had been in an acting status for more than six months. Such an interpretation would make the effect of the ordinance wholly prospective, for it would mean that the city would be paying a higher rate only for future work. Cf. <em>James </em>v. <em>Mayor of New Bedford, </em>319 Mass. 74, 76 (ordinance raising salaries \u201cfrom January 11, 1945,\u201d was \u201cnot retroactive to include the first eleven days of the year, \u2019 \u2019 for the city could not give employees \u201ca gratuity on account of work already performed\u201d); <em>Eisenstadt </em>v. <em>County of Suffolk, </em>331 Mass. 570, 572-574.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The trial judge\u2019s interpretation of the ordinance involves, in effect, the insertion in \u00a7 69.05 of the words \u201con and after the effective date of this ordinance\u201d immediately after the words \u201csix months.\u201d The city council itself did not see fit to incorporate these words in \u00a7 69.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The preamble of Ordinance No. 157 states that it was intended \u201cto provide a modern and comprehensive system of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>personnel administration and compensation for . . . Med-ford so that fairness and equity to the employees and the taxpayers . . . may be achieved, \u2019 \u2019 with the consequence that \u201clike work should be compensated ... by like pay\u201d and \u201cpublic employment in the service of . . . Medford . . . made attractive as a career.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The city\u2019s contention, that Plante is not entitled to the benefits of \u00a7 69.05, necessarily involves some failure to carry out the equitable purpose thus declared. The ordinance established as the city\u2019s public policy that, after six months, an \u201cacting\u201d employee should receive the pay of the post in which he was acting. We think that (in the light of the stated purpose of the ordinance) it would take very clear legislative language to justify denying that pay to an \u201cacting\u201d employee, about to retire, merely because he had performed some or all of the work qualifying him for such pay before, rather than after, the effective date of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We recognize that the word \u201cremains\u201d in \u00a7 69.05 may suggest that the section is designed to refer only to future service in an \u201cacting\u201d status. Nevertheless, undue weight should not be given to this single word. Although the ordinance could have been much more precisely expressed (cf. <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>342 Mass. 344, 348-349; <em>Albernaz </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>346 Mass. 336, 341, fn. 2), it seems to us more consonant with the comprehensive character and equitable purpose of the ordinance to treat the clause, \u201cremains in the capacity of \u2018Acting\u2019 for more than six months,\u201d as describing (a) persons who on the effective date of the ordinance have satisfied, in whole or in part, the requirements of the clause, as well as (b) persons who thereafter satisfy it by six months of service in an \u201cacting\u201d capacity entirely after the effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The result is (1) that the first sentence of \u00a7 69.05 leaves it to the discretion of the employing authority for a period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>of six months to determine whether to pay, or not to pay, an \u201cacting\u201d employee the full compensation of the office the duties of which he is performing, and (2) that, after the first six months of \u201cacting service\u201d (whether these took place before or after the effective date of the ordinance), the employee (while still \u201cacting\u201d after the effective date) must receive the full salary of the position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The final decree is reversed. A new final decree making a declaration of rights consistent with this opinion is to be entered. Plante is to have costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-12\"> The Medford Ordinances (see c. 8, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5) provide (\u00a7 4) that \u201cthe chief engineer [fire chief] shall be held responsible \u2019 \u2019 for running the fire department; and that (\u00a7 5) \u201c [i]n case of the absence or disability of the chief engineer, the senior deputy chief engineer, during such absence or disability, shall have and exercise all the power and authority of the chief engineer, and shall perform the duties of his office. <em>\u2019 \u2019'</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\"> See G.
