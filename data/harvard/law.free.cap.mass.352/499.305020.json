L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, the decision of the contributory retirement appeal board (the appeal board) (G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 [4]) which set aside the local board\u2019s decision and ordered the payment of retirement benefits for total and permanent disability under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, to James F. Hurton, the intervener, a call fireman employed by the town. Pursuant to our order that a copy of all the proceedings before the appeal hoard be transmitted to us on the original papers as filed in the Superior Court, we have before us everything that was before the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"ari-dedup-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The record shows that on July 2, 1962, the local board notified Hurton with appropriate forms attached that under Cr. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5 (1) (a), he must retire for superannuation, sixty-five years, by August 31, 1962. A letter from Burton\u2019s attorney, dated July 19, 1962, enclosing a request for retirement for accidental disability, purportedly dated July 12, 1962, was received by the local board. A medical panel appointed under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6 (3), certified that Hurton was (1) physically incapacitated for further duty, that the diagnosis was \u201c [s]evere pulmonary emphysema and chronic bronchitis,\u201d and (2) that the disability was likely to be permanent. A majority of the panel answered \u201cTes\u201d to the question whether (3) the disability was \u201csuch as might be the natural and proximate result of the . . . hazard undergone on account of which retirement is claimed. \u201d The local board, after hearing, denied Burton\u2019s request. The appeal board rightly remanded the case to the local board because the medical panel had followed an incorrect standard in answering (3), and ordered that an examination be given Hurton by a new panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In March, 1964, the second medical panel, consisting in part of two doctors who had been on the first panel, certified answers (1) and (2) as had the first panel; and to the third question answered: \u201cTes. Aggravation of existing disease.\u201d The chairman of the second panel wrote to the local board that \u201cthe job as fireman means smoke inhalation of varying severity, repeated as often as there is a fire and for which exposure his pulmonary condition is completely unsuited\u201d and that, \u201cwhile smoke inhalation at his fire-fighting occupation is not believed to be the causative agent in the present condition of Mr. Hurton, it is recognized as a recurrent aggravation and a worsening of his underlying condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The local board, on April 17, 1964, conducted a second hearing at which fifteen documents, including those heretofore mentioned, were admitted as exhibits by agreement. The town\u2019s fire chief, a brother of the applicant, testified. Based upon the testimony and the exhibits the local board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>made a comprehensive and analytical report of seven typed pages which concluded \u201cthat James F. Hurton was not physically incapacitated for further duty as an officer or firefighter in the Fire Department as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duty at a definite time and at a definite place and that he should not be retired under . . . [G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7] and further that his application was not submitted in accordance with . . . [G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7 (1)].\u201d The application for retirement for accidental disability was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Hurton then submitted his case to the appeal board on the same fifteen exhibits which had been presented to the local board. The appeal board also received as an exhibit the complete \u201cminutes\u201d or report of the second hearing before the local board and a copy of a claim for \u201c [l]ung damage from smoke inhalation,\u201d filed with an insurance company on April 20, 1963. The latter claim had been denied by the insurance company. There was no testimony before the appeal board at the second hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The appeal board reversed the local board. It found that Hurton\u2019s disability was \u201cthe proximate and natural result of an injury or hazard received as a result of and while in the performance of his duties.\u201d It stated, citing <em>Zavaglia </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>345 Mass. 483, that the local board had applied an incorrect standard of law in denying Hurton\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The appeal board\u2019s reliance upon the <em>Zavaglia </em>case, both in its decision and in its brief, is misplaced. The <em>Zavaglia </em>case dealt specifically with the meaning, under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7 (1), of the words \u201cpersonal injury\u201d and \u201cat some definite place and at some definite time\u201d (pp. 485-487). The question before the court was whether asthma resulting from the inhalation of coal and chalk dust over a period of years while employed as a school janitor constituted a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d \u201cat some definite place and at some definite time.\u201d The appeal board appears to have proceeded on the assumption that Hurton\u2019s physical disability arose from circumstances analogous to those presented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>the <em>Zavaglia </em>case; that is, that Hurton was exposed to smoke at each alarm to which he responded and that the cumulative effect of the exposure constituted a \u201cpersonal injury. \u2019 \u2019 Hurton, however, did not seek a disability allowance on this ground. Nor was there evidence which would justify an award of a disability allowance on this ground. Nor have the facts necessary to raise the presumption provided by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 94A, been shown to exist. Cf. Math<em>ewson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>335 Mass. 610, 614. Only one substantiated episode of smoke inhalation (July 12,1960) was before the local board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question presented by this appeal is whether a causal connection exists between that \u201chazard undergone . . . while in the performance of . . . duties\u201d (G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7 [1]) and the permanent incapacity. The existence of a causal connection was expressly reserved in the <em>Zavaglia </em>case because no finding had been made on that issue (pp. 485, 487). The <em>Zavaglia </em>case is therefore not determinative of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The burden of proving the causal connection between the smoke inhalation on July 12,1960, and the present physical disability complained of was on Hurton. See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>341 Mass. 611, 614. The evidence before the local board fell far short of requiring a finding that there was in fact a causal connection between Hurton\u2019s acknowledged disability and the one authenticated instance of smoke inhalation or other hazard undergone in his employment. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7 (3) (a). On that occasion, July 12, 1960, Hurton was hospitalized overnight with three other firemen and then released. The certification by the medical panel that this incident might have been the cause of the permanent disability is not decisive of the ultimate fact of causal connection. It is \u201cin the nature of evidence before the local retirement board.\u201d <em>Mathew</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>son </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>335 Mass. 610, 615. <em>Cassier </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>332 Mass. 237, 240n. The medical panel \u201cis not charged with the duty to provide statements of any evidence.\u201d <em>Mathewson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>335 Mass. 610, 615. The statement of the chairman of the second medical panel to the local board, quoted earlier in the opinion, was therefore extraneous to his duty as a member of the panel, and was, at best, a gratuitous general observation without any evidential basis to justify its application to the case before the panel. The determination of the ultimate fact of causal connection under \u00a7 7 was for the local board, based on relevant evidence which may include non-medical facts, and is analogous to that made by the Industrial Accident Board under G. L. c. 152. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>341 Mass. 611, 614. It is our view that the record contains no \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d which would justify the appeal board\u2019s overturning the finding of the local board that the incident of July 12,1960, was not the cause of Hurton\u2019s present physical disability. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (8) (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The decree of the Superior Court must be reversed. A decree is to be entered setting aside the decision of the appeal board and remanding the case to the appeal board with instructions to affirm the decision of the local board.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\"> Although Hurton claimed to have inhaled smoke on January 6, 1962, and to have been disabled for some time thereafter, there was no entry of it in the department\u2019s records as there were of two other firemen on the same date. The call firemen\u2019s payroll shows payment in full to Hurton for services during the period of alleged disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
