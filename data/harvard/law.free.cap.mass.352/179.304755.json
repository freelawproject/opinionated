Palmer was to have a steady job (\u201csite\u201d) aboard until he quit, or was discharged for cause. If \u201cnothing was said or done by either party prior to or at the time of settling up,\u201d Palmer would make the next trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">Palmer made two trips. The second ended on Saturday, July 18, 1964. \u201cThe catch was not unloaded but was topped with ice to wait for Monday\u2019s market.\u201d On Monday, Palmer and others tended the hatch and helped clean the vessel. About 11 a.m. Palmer went home, had lunch, \u201cand took a shower around noon.\u201d While doing so, he slipped and hurt his wrist. About 2 p.m. he returned to the Fish Pier \u201cto settle up. He was paid for his trip and returned home.\u201d Nothing had been done prior to July 21, 1964, \u201cto terminate . . . [Palmer\u2019s] site aboard the . . . vessel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Palmer\u2019s wrist got worse. On July 21, Palmer \u201cnotified the captain . . . that he had been injured and . . . would be unable to make the next trip.\u201d A transient fisherman (employed on a trip-to-trip basis) took Palmer\u2019s place. Palmer was disabled until September 18, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In July, 1964, \u201cit was the . . . practice ... on the fishing boats going out of Gloucester, that the members of the crew could be called upon by the [c]aptain, while ashore between trips, to perform certain work aboard the fishing vessel, such as, mending of twine . . . repairing nets ... ordering grub ... or cleaning the galley. The injury occurred while . . . [Palmer was] subject to the call of duty since he could be called upon at any time to perform [such] work aboard the vessel, ... as well as any other duties that might arise. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In this action brought by Palmer in a District Court to recover under general admiralty and maritime law for his maintenance, care, and cure arising out of his injuries, the trial judge granted various rulings requested by Palmer and denied certain requests of the defendant. These requests in general raised the issue whether in the circumstances Palmer as matter of law could recover maintenance, care, and cure for his injuries suffered within the confines of his own home. The trial judge found as a fact that Palmer \u201cwas a member of the crew . . . and in the service of the vessel, subject to being called back to duty . . . when he received his injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The Appellate Division dismissed a report. The defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The broad liability of shipowners \u201cfor the maintenance and cure of seamen becoming ill or injured during the period of their service\u201d was fully discussed in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of N. Y. </em>318 U. S. 724, 730, where (at pp. 732-738) this liability was treated \u201cas covering injuries received without misconduct while on shore leave.\u201d In <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>336 U. S. 511, a shipowner was held liable for maintenance and cure of a seaman who overstayed his shore leave and was injured returning late to his ship. Mr. Justice Jackson said (at p. 516), \u201cFor any pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>pose to introduce a graduation of rights and duties based on some relative proximity of the activity at time of injury to the \u2018employment\u2019 or the \u2018service of the ship,\u2019 would alter the basis and be out of harmony with the spirit and function of the doctrine . . ..\u201d See <em>Warren </em>v. <em>United States, </em>340 U. S. 523, 524 (injury of negligent seaman at a dance hall on shore leave). See also <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Trawler Racer, Inc. </em>362 U. S. 539, 544, fn. 6; <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>369 U. S. 527, 531-534. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>167 F. 2d 550, 551 (4th Cir.), liability for maintenance and cure was recognized as extending to a seaman on shore leave in the ship\u2019s own home port, although not at the moment of his injury \u201cengaged ... in the ship\u2019s business.\u201d See <em>German </em>v. <em>Carnegie-Ill. Steel Corp. </em>169 F. 2d 715, 716 (3d Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The decision most closely relevant is <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Trawler Brighton, Inc. </em>102 F. Supp. 300 (D. Mass.). There a seaman on a fishing vessel, employed upon oral arrangements and having a \u201csteady site,\u201d was injured near his lodging house while on shore leave in Boston, the port from which the trawler made trips. \u25a0 Between trips members of the crew (p. 301) ordinarily were free to leave the vessel and go \u201cabout their own affairs,\u201d although \u201cthey could be called upon to perform such work as mending nets. \u2019 \u2019 Judge Ford held that the \u201cright to maintenance and cure is not determined by what the seaman is doing when he receives his injury. It is only required that he be in the service of the ship in the sense of being generally answerable to the call of duty.\u201d The <em>Hunt </em>case was cited with approval in <em>Keeping </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>262 F. 2d 868, 870-871 (1st Cir.). In the <em>Keeping </em>case, however, recovery was denied in the absence of evidence that, on the date of his injury, the seaman \u201cwas generally answerable to the call of duty by the master\u201d of his vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In the circumstances, rulings could not have been given that Palmer, who was at the time of his injury \u201cgenerally answerable to the call of duty,\u201d (a) was not \u201cin the service of the ship\u201d and (b) was not entitled to maintenance and cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
