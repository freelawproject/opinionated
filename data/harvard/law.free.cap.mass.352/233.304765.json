We cannot rule that there was no evidence to connect the claimant\u2019s peritonitis, following a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>double operation for hernia and appendicitis, with the employment connected hernia. Two physicians gave opinions adequate to support the single member\u2019s finding. We may not weigh the testimony of the surgeon, called by the insurer, tending to show that the appendicitis arose from usual causes of infection of the appendix, unrelated to the hernia; that the operation was separate from the repair of the hernia; and that the peritonitis came from the appendectomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">2. The injury occurred December 28, 1961. The claim was filed May 3, 1962. The final decree awarded interest from May 3,1962, at six per cent as required by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50, as amended by St. 1965, c. 616, if applicable. Section 50, as so amended, provides that \u201c [w]henever compensation is not paid within sixty days of notice\u201d of claim, interest shall be paid at the rate of six per cent per annum from the day of the receipt of the notice of claim. Prior to the 1965 amendment the section called for interest at four per cent from the date of the first decision where the compensation was not paid within ninety days of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 2A, provides: \u201cEvery act, in amendment of this chapter, in effect on the effective date of this section or thereafter becoming effective which increases the amount or amounts of compensation payable to an injured employee or his dependents shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be deemed to be substantive in character and shall apply only to personal injuries occurring on and after the effective date of such act, unless otherwise expressly provided. Every act, in amendment of this chapter, in effect on the effective date of this section or thereafter becoming effective which is not deemed to be substantive in character within the meaning of this section shall be deemed to be procedural or remedial only, in character, and shall have application to personal injuries irrespective of the date of their occurrence, -unless otherwise expressly provided. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Using the word \u201ccompensation\u201d in its general sense, interest is compensation for the delay in receiving that to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>which the recipient is forthwith entitled. <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>15 Pick. 198, 208. Where interest must be paid to avoid a taking of property without due process of law the right thereto has a substantive aspect. See discussion in <em>Swampscott </em>v. <em>Remis, </em>350 Mass. 523, 527-529.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">But the issue here is whether the interest is a part of the \u201ccompensation payable to an injured employee\u201d under the statute. We conclude that it is not and that the final decree was right. See cases exemplifying the Massachusetts rule that interest on foreign judgments is to be computed in accordance with our statutes, as a matter \u201ctouching the remedy.\u201d <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>179 Mass. 514, 518. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>129 Mass. 600. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Child, </em>136 Mass. 344, 348. Beale, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 420.1, notes cases elsewhere which apply the foreign law in order to give \u201cfull effect and credit\u201d but says, \u201cin Massachusetts, with more reason,\u201d the rule is that interest is \u201cnot an integral part of the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Statute 1930, c. 208, amended G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10, by inserting a provision that if the insurer files a claim for review and the board orders the insurer to make or continue payments \u201cthe cost to the injured employee of such review, <em>including therein reasonable counsel fees . </em>. . shall be paid by the insurer\u201d (emphasis supplied). In <em>Ahmed\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 180, 189, this court said that since c. 208 \u201crelates solely to costs and procedure, it applies to all cases arising after its effective date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">3. The decree is formally adequate as a final decree notwithstanding that it does not in terms refer to the board\u2019s decision. The decree, reflecting the amounts which the board had ordered paid, sets out and orders paid the amounts due for total incapacity compensation, dependency compensation, partial incapacity compensation, doctors\u2019 fees (for appearances and testimony) and costs before the reviewing board. It also orders paid a stated amount for costs of appeal to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">4. Costs of this appeal are to be determined by the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
