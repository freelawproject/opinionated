The bank was named as escrow agent as well as custodian. Fund was to exchange its shares for deposited securities as of an \u201ceffective date of the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>change\u201d to be fixed by Fund. In effect each depositor was to receive (with the same tax basis) Fund shares representing an indirect undivided interest in Fund\u2019s diversified, commingled securities in place of such depositor\u2019s direct ownership of the low tax basis (fn. 2) securities deposited by him. The number of Fund\u2019s shares to be issued to each shareholder was to be determined by dividing \u201cthe market value of . . .

[deems it] advisable.\u201d The prospectus provisions governing valuation of securities exchanged for Fund shares upon the issue of those shares, or upon their later redemption, are set out in the margin.5</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>On February 28,1961, Saphier and Shore deposited, with the bank as escrow agent, 5,385 shares and 4,506 shares, respectively, of Class A common stock of Cole National Corporation (Cole) \u201cto be exchanged for shares of . . . Fund in accordance with . . . [the] prospectus.\u201d July 25,1961, became the \u201ceffective date of the exchange\u201d described in the prospectus. The last prior business day was July 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Cole shares, after January 1,1961, were not listed on the New York or the American stock exchanges. \u201cThe only published source of market quotations for Cole . . . stock as of any date since January 1,1961 was a National Quotation Sheet [the so called \u201cpink sheet\u201d] . . . published by National Quotation Bureau, Inc. on each business day. The . . . [s]heet sets out the quoted bid and asked prices on . . . [many \u201cover-the-counter\u201d] stocks .... [I] t lists each security . . . quoted on the date of the . . .

[Cole] stock on July 24, 1961 known to\u201d the bank as Fund\u2019s escrow agent and custodian and to Arthur Young &amp; Company, independent certified public accountants, the firm which served as Fund\u2019s auditors (Fund\u2019s auditors). The bank and Fund\u2019s auditors did not know, the order in which, or the time at which, these bids were quoted on July 24, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The market value of deposited securities as of July 24, 1961, was determined by the bank as custodian. This determination was reviewed by Fund\u2019s auditors. Securities traded over the counter were valued on the basis of bid prices for July 24, 1961, as reported in the National Quotation Sheet. In determining the market value of Cole stock as of July 24,1961, the bank took the five bid prices already mentioned, arranged them in order from the highest to the lowest (i.e. 30, 29%, 29%, 29%, 29%) and selected the \u201cmedian\u201d (middle or third figure), i.e. 29%. On the basis of a market value of 29% per share, the total value of the 5,385 shares of Cole deposited by Saphier for exchange was determined to be $158,837.50.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On September 1,1961, Fund issued to Saphier 12,253 shares of Fund, valued at $12.50 a share, and made a cash payment of $10.16 in lieu of a fractional share. The process of valuation of Shore\u2019s deposited Cole stock (and of the issue of Fund shares) was the same as that followed with respect to Saphier\u2019s deposited stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>About September 1, 1961, Fund sent out a \u201cReport to Shareholders,\u201d containing an audited financial statement of Fund at the exchange date, July 25, 1961. On September 18, 1961, Fund\u2019s board of directors voted to adopt and confirm the valuation of securities set forth in that statement. Saphier and Shore promptly protested Fund\u2019s determination of the value of their Cole stock by a letter dated October 2,1961. They have never withdrawn their protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Saphier or Shore tendered for redemption shares of Fund on eighteen different dates between June 20, 1963, and January 14, 1964. \u201cFund exercised its right to pay the redemption price in kind by a distribution of Cole . . . stock held by . . . Fund.\u201d Representative redemptions and the relevant circumstances are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Bach valuation of Cole stock was determined by the bank as custodian on the basis of bid prices furnished to it by Fund\u2019s \u201cdealer-manager\u201d (a brokerage and investment security firm) \u201cwhich derived . . . [the] prices from . . . National Quotation Sheet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The parties have stipulated that, if the market value of Cole shares \u201cas of July 24, 1961, determined as provided in the prospectus . . . was $30 per share . . . Saphier is entitled to recover $2,506.40 plus interest . . . from July 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>1961, and . . . Shore is entitled to recover $2,096.70 plus interest\u201d from that date.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">1. The parties\u2019 contract is the prospectus which, in effect, was incorporated by reference in the letters of transmittal depositing the plaintiffs\u2019 Cole stock with the bank as Fund\u2019s escrow agent. The pertinent valuation provision is that in fn. 5, par. (a), at point [A] (emphasis supplied), \u201cOther securities [not listed on an exchange] for which market quotations are readily available shall be appraised at the <em>last quoted bid price </em>thereof [B] known to the person . . . making such determination.\u201d Closely related is the provision, at point [C], that \u201cFund\u2019s Custodian Agreement provides that such valuations will be made <em>by the Custodian\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">It will be noted that the valuation process is not to ascertain \u201cfair market value,\u201d but to determine the \u201clast quoted bid price . . . known to the person . . . making such determination.\u201d Accordingly, decisions dealing with valuation at \u201cfair market value\u201d for estate, gift, and inheritance tax purposes (see authorities referred to in <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>348 Mass. 345, 350) are not directly relevant but are useful only by way of analogy. The present valuation issue is also different, in terms of what is to be determined, from the statutory valuation process mentioned in <em>Martignette </em>v. <em>Sagamore Mfg. Co. </em>340 Mass. 136, for here what is to be determined is not \u201cvalue\u201d but (as noted above) the \u201clast quoted bid price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">There is no dispute about what facts were (see fn. 5, point [B]) \u201cknown to the person . . . making such determination.\u201d The bank, as escrow agent and custodian, knew all five of the bids listed for July 24, 1961, and had before it a range of bids, from a high of $30 a share to a low of $29.50 a share.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Precision cannot be expected in fixing either a value or a bid price for an unlisted '\u2018 over-the-counter \u2019 \u2019 security where several bid prices are reported at the same time. As one judge has pointed out, in respect of another stock (see <em>Fis-tel </em>v. <em>Christman, </em>135 F. Supp. 830, 831 [S.D. N. Y.]), \u201cThe bid and offer quotation on the over-the-counter market, as shown by the records of the National Quotation Bureau, did not reflect actual transactions but at best were in the nature of'feelers,\u2019and . . . were . . . few in number.\u201d The nature of the National quotations has been recognized. See Loss, Securities Regulation (2d ed.), 1277-1283 (\u201cThe quotations . . . are not transaction prices. Probably they do not even amount to bids . . . which can be accepted by other dealers without further negotiation.\u201d). See also Report of Special Study of Securities Markets of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 88th Cong. 1st Sess. House Doc. No. 95, Part 2, pp. 541, 552, 569-576, 590, 595, 598, 604, 624-630, 635-637, 653, 677, 682, 707-709; Burns, Over-the-Counter Market Quotations, 52 Cornell L. Q. 262 (at pp. 268-269, \u201cA quotation, if bona fide and genuine, is at best an indication of interest by a broker-dealer in buying . . . or selling securities, at the time of submission, at a given price if a price is quoted,\u201d and at p. 269, \u201cOne cannot tell whether a broker-dealer\u2019s two-way quotations reflect a continuous market of depth or permanence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The plaintiffs contend that the bank should have taken at least the highest bid quoted for July 24, 1961. In this they rely on Rules 70 and 71 of the New York Stock Exchange to the effect that the highest bid and lowest offer \u201cshall have precedence\u201d in all cases. See C.C.H. N.Y. Stock Exchange Guide, pars. 2070, 2071. Even if we were to take judicial notice of these rules (cf. <em>White </em>v. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>347 Mass. 367, 373), they could hardly be given controlling weight with reference to the \u201cover-the-counter\u201d market, which differs (as the authorities already cited indicate) from the organized exchange markets. The bank was not required to give them such weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Doubtless, a seller of Cole stock on July 24, 1961, would have tried to obtain the highest bid or better, but whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>there would have been a market at that price for Saphier\u2019s 5,385 shares and Shore\u2019s 4,506 shares may be doubtful. The fact remains that the \u201clast quoted bid price \u201d was made up of several varying bids, and some method of taking account of the one-half point range of quoted bids might more accurately guide determination of the \u201clast quoted bid price . . . known\u201d to the bank than merely taking the highest bid. We cannot say that the bank erred, as matter of law, in viewing the quotations as a group as constituting the last quoted bid price, or that selecting the median bid as representative of the group was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">2. The plaintiffs also contend that the bank as custodian itself (by its conduct in redeeming Fund shares with Cole stock, fn. 7) interpreted the valuation provisions of the prospectus as calling for the high \u201cpink sheet\u201d quotation on each valuation date. The bank\u2019s practice in redemp-tions, although largely consistent with this contention, was not completely uniform. All the redemptions mentioned in the record, of course, took place about two years after the initial valuation as of July 24, 1961, and after the plaintiffs had complained about the method then employed. The bank obtained a quotation for each redemption from the dealer-manager rather than directly from the \u201cpink sheets\u201d as in the original valuation. No single redemption involved more than 502 Cole shares (as compared with the 9,891 shares in the aggregate deposited by these plaintiffs in 1961) and direct resort to the \u201cpink sheets\u201d may not have been deemed necessary. The bank\u2019s conduct, after a lapse of time and in somewhat different circumstances, does not seem to us a binding interpretation of the prospectus by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">3. The plaintiffs also contend that the burden was on Fund to prove that it complied with the contract and made payment for the Cole shares deposited. See <em>Springfield Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Jeffers, </em>266 Mass. 248, 252-253. See also <em>Pampegian </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>319 Mass. 216, 219. They rely in part on G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-305 (3), \u201cWhen a price left to be fixed otherwise than by agreement of the parties fails to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>fixed through fault of one party the other may . . . himself fix a reasonable price.\u201d This section is inapplicable. The prospectus (fn. 5) provided the price would be \u201cthe last quoted bid price . . . known to the person . . . making such determination. \u2019 \u2019 The cases stated reveal no failure to fix the price because of Fund\u2019s fault<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or because of the bank\u2019s fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">4. These cases depend upon the nature of the function given to the bank as escrow agent and custodian. As to listed securities, the bank obviously had only the ministerial duty of ascertaining \u201cthe last quoted sale price\u201d or \u201cthe last quoted bid price ... on such Exchange,\u201d a matter of Exchange record. See fn. 5 (a). As to unlisted securities, the bank had a slightly wider function because \u201cover-the-counter\u201d bids may cover a range of prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Certainly, the crucial provision (fn. 5 [a] at point [C], \u201cthat such valuations will be made by the Custodian\u201d) does not entrust to the bank any such broad scope of decision as was given to directors in <em>New England Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>162 Mass. 148, 154, or to arbitrators in <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>v. <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Assn. </em>331 Mass. 177, 186. The bank, however, was given a limited judgment in view of the range of \u201cover-the-counter\u201d quotations already described, although the bank\u2019s determination could be reviewed to see whether the bank had misconceived its lawful function, in effect committing error of law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Doubtless, in lieu of the \u201cmedian\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> bid selected in 1961, the bank could have taken (a) the high bid, or (b) the mid-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>die bid of 29%, or (c) the average of all bids. Even if we were to regard some other possibility as somewhat more appropriate than the 1 \u2018 median, \u2019 \u2019 we cannot say that choice of the \u201cmedian\u201d was unreasonable. It was not the function of the trial judge, nor is it our function, to make the choice for the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">5. Judgments for the defendants were properly ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Fund in many respects was similar to other \u201copen-end\u201d investment trusts designed to give shareholders units or shares representing a proportional beneficial interest in a diversified, commingled fund of investment securities. Fund\u2019s arrangements, however, contained special provisions to make available to owners of securities with a low tax basis for Federal income tax purposes a chance to take advantage of an Internal Revenue Service ruling \u201cthat no federal capital gains tax liability\u201d would be incurred upon the proposed \u201cexchange, except to the extent of any cash paid in lieu of a fractional share.\u201d See Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 351, as amended November 13, 1966, by Public Law 89-809, Title II, \u00a7 203 (a), (b), 80 Stat. 1577 (limiting future non-recognition of capital gains for such funds); 89th Cong. 2d Sess.

Bad faith or fraud, of course, is not to he presumed. See <em>Rankin </em>v. <em>New York, N. </em>H. &amp; H. <em>R.R. </em>338 Mass. 178, 186. There is no indication of any advantage to Fund (as distinguished from its shareholders) in adopting the valuations of Cole shares shown hy this record. So far as appears, Fund\u2019s effort was solely to comply with the prospectus and to deal fairly with the plaintiffs in relation to Fund\u2019s other shareholders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\"> Fund itself and its directors are not shown to have acted in the matter at all until September 18, 1961, when the directors \u201cvoted to approve, adopt and confirm the valuation of securities. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b730-9\"> For example, the bank, we think, would have been wrong (a) in going outside the range of the \u201cpink sheet\u201d bid quotations, or (b) in acting without responsible consideration of the underlying prospectus objectives (see fn. 3 and related text) of making Fund\u2019s original distribution of shares with reasonable precision and of maintaining the relative interests of shareholders among themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b730-10\"> The \u201cmedian\u201d on July 24, 1961, turned out to be the same as the low bid. On various other dates shown in the record (e.g. September 11, 1963, when there were two bids at 18%, two at 18%, and one at 18%) the \u201cmedian\u201d would not have been either the high or low bid.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
