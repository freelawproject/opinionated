They appeal (a) from an interlocutory decree sustaining a demurrer to their amended bill for declaratory relief, and (b) from a final decree dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The bill alleged, among other things, (1) that the plaintiffs had formed an association called Merrimack Educational Research and Counseling Institute (Merrimack) to provide individual tutoring in remedial reading and college board examination review and also classes for adults; (2) that the plaintiffs work for Merrimack outside their regular school curriculum hours; (3) that the plaintiffs were ordered by the defendants (fn. 1) to discontinue their association with Merrimack, but that the defendants refuse to state their reasons or to give a preliminary hearing to the plaintiffs concerning whether work for Merrimack conflicts with their school duties; (4) that the plaintiffs believe that the defendants intend to \u201cexpel them from the . . . [s]chool [s]ystem\u201d if they keep up their association with Merrimack; (5) that the school committee has refused to permit the plaintiffs \u2019 counsel or the public to be present at a hearing for \u201cdealing with disciplinary measures against the\u201d plaintiffs; (6) that the defendants \u201cmade final decision, ordering the . . . [plaintiffs] to desist from . . . any . . . connection\u201d with Merrimack and informed the plaintiffs \u201cthat their failure [so] to desist . . . would result in (further) disciplinary action\u201d; (7) that the plaintiffs \u201cwere \u2018suspended\u2019 . . . without any just cause\u201d; (8) that the plaintiffs believe that \u201csuch suspension has been entered upon their written records\u201d; and (9) that the defendants (despite \u201cthe absence of law prohibiting\u201d the plaintiffs \u2019 proposed work for Merrimack in off-duty time) \u201chave threatened . . . further and continuous suspension until . . . [the plaintiffs] disassociate themselves\u201d from Merrimack.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">We find nothing in the bill (apart from allegations too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>confused and vague to have significance and from mere conclusions) which asserts more than that the defendants requested or directed a private conference with the plaintiffs as school teachers (without the presence of counsel, the public, or the press) about the plaintiffs\u2019 off-duty activities in a field so closely similar to their work as teachers as to raise serious doubts concerning its compatability with their public teaching work. For the school committee to investigate such matters is well within the scope of its official administrative functions. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 38 (as amended through St. 1960, c. 333, \u00a7 2). See <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>Norwood, </em>346 Mass. 394, 396-397. Although the allegation that the plaintiffs have been \u201csuspended\u201d perhaps could refer to action under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, to suspend the plaintiffs as teachers, this allegation (when read in the context of the whole amended bill) appears to refer to an \u201corder\u201d by the defendants that the plaintiffs cease work with Merrimack upon pain of possible disciplinary action not yet the subject of final decision by the defendants after compliance with \u00a7 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The allegations of the bill are confused and imprecise. They do not show that the school committee has as yet ordered definite disciplinary action sufficient to give rise to a controversy in the sense in which that word is used in Gr. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 1. A controversy indeed may be developing but the bill does not show that it has yet emerged as a matter in which (as a consequence of a definite decision on specific disciplinary action) the plaintiffs are now entitled to declaratory relief. See <em>Saint Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>320 Mass. 467, 469-470; <em>Electronics Corp. of America </em>v. <em>City Council of Cambridge, </em>348 Mass. 563, 566-568. See also <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>346 Mass. 709, 715. Because the matter of the plaintiffs\u2019 conduct is a proper subject of inquiry by the defendants, this plainly is not a case where the defendants have no administrative jurisdiction whatsoever. See <em>Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>351 Mass. 643, 647. Consequently, until the defendants decide upon definite action with some final<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>ity, declaratory relief is premature. See also <em>Batista </em>v. <em>Nicolls, </em>213 F. 2d 20, 22 (1st Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The demurrer was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\n<em>Interlocutory and final decrees affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
