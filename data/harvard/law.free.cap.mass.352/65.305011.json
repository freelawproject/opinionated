L. c. 208, \u00a7 1) by the decree of legal separation between the spouses entered by the Civil Tribunal of Agrigento, Italy, December 18,1946, adjudging that \u201cthe legal separation of the spouses must be pronounced on the basis of the guilt of both of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">The Probate judge made the following findings. The spouses, Carmelo and Maria, were married on March 2, 1943, in Aragona, Agrigento Province, while Carmelo was on military leave. \u201cPrior to his return to military service, . . . [Carmelo] had taken a two years lease on a house in Aragona, with rent prepaid, and in addition had turned over his entire savings to . . . [Maria].\u201d After his release from the service in 1945 and his return to Aragona, Maria refused to live with him in a domicil of his own choosing and he made no contribution to her support. He came to the United States in 1960 and did not seek to bring Maria. He has not since sent her funds to come here. Maria did not appear in the Probate Court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">The foreign record includes the following findings and rulings: In an interval of Carmelo\u2019s military service, \u201cduring the period of disorder,\u201d he returned to Aragona but went to live with a sister, failed to support Maria, and cut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>off her military allowance. This, the Italian court ruled, was desertion, not justified by Maria\u2019s prior conduct in leaving his family\u2019s home, it having been necessary for Maria to sleep in a room with two women, one of whom was tubercular, a brother-in-law, and a seventeen year old boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The tribunal also, in a prior paragraph, found that when Carmelo returned home from military service (we conclude this was in 1945, as the Probate judge found) Maria at first consented to live with him on condition that they live alone but later she \u201crefused to follow him\u201d stating she would live with him only in her grandmother\u2019s house. The court ruled that this was a failure in a most essential attribute of marriage and that she had \u201csubstantially deserted . . . [Carmelo], even though at the hearing before the President of the Tribunal she declared her willingness ... to a reconciliation with him; and this constitutes one of the grounds of separation provided under the law in force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Carmelo recognizes that this foreign decree is to be given the force of a domestic judgment. <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>Guyot, </em>159 U. S. 113. <em>Amato </em>v. <em>Amato, </em>244 Mass. 349, 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The decree, we conclude, in its legal effect on a right to a divorce in this Commonwealth, differs from a decree of a Massachusetts court establishing the right of the wife to live apart for the fault of the husband. The decree shows that the findings are based on facts established in a prior criminal proceeding relating to the marital conduct of the spouses. It shows the intervention of the public prosecutor in the separation proceedings. The decree shows also that the decision in the criminal court controlled and determined the judgment in the civil proceedings. It reads: \u201cDue to superior considerations which are confirmed by the sentence of the District Court Judge of Aragona who decreed the responsibility of both spouses for the crime of violation of the duties of family assistance, the legal separation of the spouses must be pronounced on the basis of the guilt of both of them, with the due consequences of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The decree, we think, was a determination that, without violating the law or policy of the State, the spouses might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>live apart and need furnish no marital assistance; also that no legal sanctions might be availed of by either spouse to enforce the other\u2019s marital duties. This was all that was significant in a jurisdiction where divorce will not be decreed even for an existing unjustified marital wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The decree was not, however, an adjudication that Maria was justified in failing to join her husband when, the exigencies of wartime living conditions being ameliorated, he offered a home. Indeed, by establishing her \u201cguilt\u201d it ruled in effect that she was not so justified. At the time of the final break between the spouses Maria was found to have failed in a duty constituting \u2018 \u2018 one of the most essential attributes of marital . . . authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Nor does the decree adjudge that Maria would thereafter be free of marital fault in not living with Carmelo. Indeed, the implication of the concept that divorce is contrary to public policy is that the parties ought to recognize and conform to the obligation of the marital state even though the law no longer supplies sanctions. Carmelo had sought to act in recognition of this; Maria had declined to do so. Doubtless after the judgment Carmelo was under no legally enforceable obligation to accept an offer of Maria to return ; the decree, however, does not determine that he would be without fault in such rejection of his duty in the continuing marriage. See <em>Espinola </em>v. <em>Espinola, </em>273 Mass. 450, 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The decree lacks the essential attributes of those separation decrees in our courts that are effective to bar a divorce for desertion. It is not a determination that, in living apart, the wife committed no marital wrong. Nor is it a ruling that the husband\u2019s fault justified the wife\u2019s conduct. Compare <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>150 Mass. 111; <em>Amato </em>v. <em>Amato, </em>244 Mass. 349. The decree, on the other hand, does establish that Maria was without justification in rejecting the offered marital domicil; thus it shows that marital wrong which under our law supports a divorce for desertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">A further consideration may be noted. The inclusion of Carmelo\u2019s fault as well as Maria\u2019s as a ground for the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>cree appears from the judgment to have had effect in relieving Maria and Carmelo of costs; also it avoided placing on Maria alone the stigma of an offence against the State. Since no further relief than the separation could be decreed by the State there was no occasion to consider the effect of the judgment on a right in Carmelo to further relief.- But Carmelo in this Commonwealth may seek and has sought an absolute divorce. In these proceedings, therefore, the effect of the inclusion in the Italian judgment of the reference to Carmelo\u2019s fault should be no more than that judgment, in the context of the Italian restriction against divorce, clearly requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The issue remains whether Carmelo is barred by consent to the separation. His bringing the petition because of Maria\u2019s refusal to live with him was not inconsistent with a desire to have her do so and it did not give rise to a presumption of consent. <em>Espinola </em>v. <em>Espinola, </em>273 Mass. 450, 452 (\u201cWhat he sought in . . . [the prior separation proceeding] was that, while the wife persisted in her conduct and would not of her own choice live with him, she should not interfere with him or disturb him or in any way deprive him of his liberty. This is not inconsistent with a willingness to resume marital relations. Approval of the wife\u2019s conduct is not to be inferred from this petition. If it were granted and the wife were willing to return, he could not obtain a divorce for desertion if he refused to take her back\u201d). For the presumption where the prior libel was for divorce, see <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>350 Mass. 478, 480, and cases cited. We do not construe G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 22, as amended by St. 1962, c. 433, to change the rule of the <em>Espinola </em>case. See 37th Report of the Judicial Council (1961) Pub. Doc. No. 144, pp. 42-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">There is no finding that the attempted reconciliation in the course of the court proceedings failed because of Carmelo\u2019s refusal to accept Maria\u2019s return. The finding that at the hearing Maria declared her willingness to a reconciliation proves neither her willingness to live with Carmelo in his chosen domicil, nor Carmelo\u2019s unwillingness to receive her there. Compare <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>160 Mass. 258. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Nothing appears as to the subsequent conduct of either spouse except that Carmelo has not sought to bring Maria to this country. This shows no more than acquiescence in the state of affairs that Maria\u2019s desertion brought about. It does not show that had Maria sought to return she would have been rejected. Compare <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>143 Mass. 577, 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Italian decree shows no such misconduct by Carmelo as would bar his libel for divorce for desertion. It does not appear that at the time of the \u201cdisorder\u201d he had any other place to live than in his sister\u2019s home. If by going to live there he \u201cdeserted\u201d his wife, his subsequent offer of a home removed that act as justification for Maria\u2019s desertion. His failing to support Maria at that time and after she declined to join him in 1945 is not shown to have been done \u201cgrossly or wantonly and cruelly.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 1. See <em>Keenan </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>219 Mass. 107, 109; <em>Reddington </em>v. <em>Reddington, </em>317 Mass. 760, 764 (cases cited); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>333 Mass. 767. Compare <em>Lyster </em>v. <em>Lyster, </em>111 Mass. 327, 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">We conclude that the decree does not extinguish the effect of Maria\u2019s wrong in deserting Carmelo or bar its being given its appropriate significance in this jurisdiction where legal consequences, beyond those permitted in Italy, may be decreed based on that wrong. We conclude also that Maria\u2019s desertion as a wrong against the marital state continued into and throughout the three years next prior to the filing of the libel and that, on the findings below, Carmelo is entitled to a decree. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\n<em>Decree reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b108-8\">Cutter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APX\">(concurring) I concur in the result because there has been no proof concerning the effect under Italian law of the decree of the Italian civil tribunal. Although we may take judicial notice of foreign law not brought to our attention, we are not required to do so. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 233, \u00a7 70. <em>De Gategno </em>v. <em>De Gategno, </em>336 Mass. 426, 431. The opinion of the court thus does not fail to give recogni-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>tian, as matter of comity, to any clearly established necessary incident or effect of that decree. See Restatement 2d: Conflict of Laws (Tent. draft No. 11, April 23, 1965), \u00a7 430e. The result is consistent with our cases giving to a proceeding for separation or to a separation decree no greater effect as a bar to a later divorce libel than is necessarily incident to, or involved in, the earlier proceeding or decree. See <em>Espinola </em>v. <em>Espinola, </em>273 Mass. 450, 452-453; <em>Cochrane </em>v. <em>Cochrane, </em>303 Mass. 467, 471-473.
