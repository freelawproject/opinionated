L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21, by way of an appeal from a decision of the zoning board of appeals of Framingham (board) upholding the granting of a building permit to the defendant Catalina Swim Club, Inc. (Catalina) for the construction of a swimming pool, locker room, and attendant facilities in a single residence district in that town. The plaintiffs, who at the time the bill was brought were homeowners in the immediate vicinity of the locus where the pool was built, complain that the permit was issued in violation of the zoning by-law of the town. They seek to have the permit declared illegal and void, to enjoin the use of the locus for any nonpermitted purpose, and to require Catalina and the defendant Frank W. Generazio, Jr. to remove the structure already erected on the locus. The plaintiffs appeal from a final decree of the Superior Court sustaining the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">The question presented for our review is whether the defendant Catalina is a \u201cclub\u201d or \u201crecreational building and ground\u201d within the meaning of the Framingham zoning bylaw allowing such uses in a single residence district. Bart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>II, \u00a7 A, 1, of the by-law provides in substance that premises in single residence districts shall not be used \u201cexcept for one or more of the following purposes: ... d. Public and recreational buildings and grounds; schools and hospitals and dormitories accessory thereto; churches or other places of <em>worship; </em>parish houses, clubs, lodges, charitable and welfare institutions; passenger stations; water towers, reservoirs, airports, radio and television towers and stations, and/or like uses not otherwise covered. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">1. \u201cThe word \u2018club\u2019 has no very definite meaning. Clubs are formed for all sorts of purposes, and there is no uniformity in their constitutions and rules.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pomphret, </em>137 Mass. 564, 567. A club is generally an association or a corporation comprised of individuals joining together for social intercourse or some other common object. See Annotation, 52 A. L. R. 2d 1098, 1100-1101. Samuel Johnson long ago defined a club as \u201can assembly of good fellows, meeting under certain conditions.\u201d Samuel Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (Bohn ed. 1852) p. 211. Our basic inquiry is whether Catalina is a bona fide club with limited membership controlled by the members, into which admission cannot be obtained by any person at his pleasure, and in which the property is actually owned in common or held for the common benefit of the members, \u201cor whether, either the form of . . . [the] club has been adopted for other purposes, with the intention and understanding that the mutual rights and obligations of the members shall not be such as the organization purports to create, or a mere name has been assumed without any real organization behind it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pomphret, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Chilton Club, </em>318 Mass. 285, with <em>Lerner </em>v. <em>Club Wander In, Inc. </em>174 F. Supp. 731 (D. Mass.).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The trial judge found \u201cthat Catalina is not a bona, fide club and therefore it is not an accepted use under the section of the Zoning By-Laws referred to. Catalina\u2019s ByLaws are such that they could be applied so that anyone could come in off the street and use the swimming pool. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>There appears to be no restriction in this regard so that a \u2018temporary membership\u2019 might be attained by any such individual.\u201d Article III, \u00a7 4, of Catalina\u2019s by-laws provides that \u201ctemporary membership\u201d entitling a person to swim could be granted orally by a member of the membership committee, an officer, or the person for the time being in charge of the business of Catalina. In addition, the bylaws, while creating three different classes of membership, in no way limit the number of members allowed in each class, or provide any criteria or restrictive requirements for admission to membership. Limitation on membership was to be determined largely by the physical size of the pool and its capacity to hold human beings. Although, like Judge Aldrich, we do not believe that a club need have \u201ca misanthropic membership committee which peppers the candidates\u2019 list with blackballs,\u201d we do believe, as does he, \u201cthat a mutual relationship of some contemplated permanence . . . [should be] entered into.\u201d <em>Lerner </em>v. <em>Club Wander In, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 732. The fee paid by \u201ctemporary members\u201d was nothing more than a charge for the use of the pool. Catalina\u2019s solicitation of prospective members by mail and by radio only reinforces this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The trial judge also found that Catalina\u2019s property \u201cis not owned by the members in common, with control rights and obligations pertinent thereto but is owned by those who invested money in the club at the time it was constructed.\u201d On this issue the trial judge concluded \u201cthat the word \u2018club\u2019 has been used in an effort to qualify Catalina for this permitted use\u201d under the zoning by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The defendants argue that Catalina\u2019s corporate charter is prima facie evidence of its nonbusiness purpose and that the corporate entity holds title to the property for the benefit of its members. Catalina was organized as a nonprofit corporation under Gf. L. c. 180 \u201c [t]o encourage athletic and recreational activities of all kinds, and to acquire and develop facilities designed to promote the same.\u201d Regardless of what may or may not be the proper construction of the word \u201cclub,\u201d it is obvious that Catalina cannot, merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>by incorporating under c. 180 and by adopting an appropriate corporate title and purpose, thereby create a bona fide club. <em>Lerner </em>v. <em>Club Wander In, Inc. </em>174 F. Supp. 731 (D. Mass.). The provisions of Catalina\u2019s by-laws and the course of its financial operations to date justify the conclusion that members other than the promoters had neither a common interest in the underlying assets of Catalina nor an effective means of participating in its management. There were no regular members other than the incorporators at the time the building permit was issued and during the first year of the pool\u2019s operation. In addition, neither associate members, who apparently held season memberships, nor temporary members were permitted to vote or otherwise participate in Catalina\u2019s management. Even after thirty-eight members were elected, they were not presented with a report of Catalina\u2019s first year of operations as required by the by-laws. Furthermore, Catalina\u2019s financial records did not fully disclose the financial arrangement existing between Catalina and Catalina Pools of New England, Inc., the company that constructed the pool. The officers of Catalina held virtually the same positions in Catalina Pools of New England, Inc. There was more than sufficient evidence to support the conclusion reached by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We in no way decide that bona fide swimming clubs do not enjoy the same standing as other private clubs in residential districts under zoning by-laws similar to that adopted by the town of Framingham. See, e.g., <em>Montgomery County </em>v. <em>Merlands Club, Inc. </em>202 Md. 279; <em>Steppler </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment of Radnor Township, </em>5 D. &amp; C. (Pa.) 2d 8. We hold only that in the circumstances here presented the trial court was correct in finding that Catalina was not a \u201cclub\u201d within the meaning of the Framingham zoning by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">2. The trial court sustained the decision of the board upholding the issuance of a building permit to Catalina on the ground that Catalina is a \u201crecreational building and ground\u201d within the meaning of the by-law. The plaintiffs, however, point to another section of the by-law and claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>that Catalina is a \u201ccommercial amusement place\u201d allowable only in specified nonresidence districts of Framingham. Part III, \u00a7 A, of the town\u2019s by-law permits in business districts \u201c [a] 11 uses that are permitted in Residence Districts . . . and the following: ... 4b. Theatres, moving picture shows, bowling alleys, skating rinks, billiard rooms and other commercial amusement places.\u201d They argue that the commercial nature of the pool as evidenced by the indiscriminate admission of \u201ctemporary members,\u201d the solicitation of patrons by mass media, charges to patrons apportioned according to their use of the pool, together with other aspects of the pool\u2019s operation, require the conclusion that the pool is properly described as a \u201ccommercial amusement place\u201d and must be located in a nonresidential district.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">We accept, for purposes of discussion, the defendants\u2019 contention that the word \u201cpublic\u201d in Part II, \u00a7 A, 1 d, of the by-laws does not qualify the words \u201crecreational buildings and grounds,\u201d but that each word, \u201cpublic\u201d and \u201crecreational,\u201d permits a distinct category of buildings and grounds within the meaning of the by-law. Such a construction will allow the defendants to prevail if it can be shown that Catalina is either a \u201cpublic building and ground\u201d or a \u201crecreational building and ground.\u201d Given this, the defendants\u2019 position is simply that the use of Catalina\u2019s premises as a swimming pool would clearly be a \u201crecreational building and ground\u201d and hence would be permitted under the aforementioned by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We do not believe that a proper interpretation of the bylaw will support this construction advanced by the defendants. Although the judge found that Catalina\u2019s use was not \u201caccompanied by what might be called.a commercial flavor, such as would exist when lights . . . [or] other devices were used to attract persons as they passed by, either on foot or in motor vehicles,\u201d it is the use to which the premises are put rather than the external indicia of use which is controlling under the by-law. Framingham Zoning By-Law, Part II, \u00a7 A, 1. <em>Hinves </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Works of Fall </em>River, 342 Mass. 54. <em>Chicopee </em>v. <em>Jaku-bowski, </em>348 Mass. 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Recent decisions of this court have distinguished between commercial and noncommercial uses in determining whether a particular use was properly permitted in a residence district. They control the outcome of this case. In <em>Kurz </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of North Reading, </em>341 Mass. 110, a case involving the construction of a by-law permitting educational uses in residential areas, it was held that where a dancing school was run as a commercial enterprise for the personal profit of the owner it did not come within the educational use contemplated by the by-law. See <em>Chicopee </em>v. <em>Jakubowski, </em>348 Mass. 230, where the teaching of ceramics for profit was held to be neither a \u201cschool\u201d nor an \u201ceducational purpose\u201d within the meaning of a zoning by-law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Catalina cannot escape the effect of its commercial activity by invoking its incorporation as a nonprofit enterprise under Gr. L. c. 180. \"While its charter contains express provision that no part of its net earnings shall inure to the benefit of any member of the corporation, or of any incor-porator, officer or other individual, the statute in no way inhibits Catalina from making a profit from its operations or engaging in commercial activities. <em>McKay </em>v. <em>Morgan Memorial Co-op. Indus. &amp; Stores, Inc. </em>272 Mass. 121, 124. <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Plymouth Rubber Co. Mut. Benefit Assn. </em>307 Mass. 444, 446. The evidence which we have reviewed tends to show that the pool\u2019s earnings would be applied to a greater or lesser extent to the benefit of the promoters. From the foregoing recitation of facts and considerations it is evident to us that the commercial aspects of the operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the pool as a private enterprise overrode those which would have made of it primarily a social venture. We conclude that the zoning by-law did not contemplate the operation of such an enterprise as Catalina in a residential zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">This conclusion is reinforced by Part III, \u00a7 A, 4 b, of the by-law which restricts \u201ccommercial amusement places\u2019-\u2019 to business districts within the town. A fair construction of this section considered with the provisions pertaining to single residence districts indicates an intention that single residence districts should be restricted to residences and certain other specific uses such as hospitals, schools and other public and private buildings, while business districts should in general contain businesses and other commercial ventures. Were we to adopt the construction advanced by the defendants, a majority of the \u201ccommercial amusement places,\u201d such as bowling alleys, skating rinks, and billiard rooms, could also qualify as \u201crecreational buildings and grounds\u201d in single residence districts. Under this construction the enumeration of \u201ccommercial amusement places\u201d in subsection 4 b, would be rendered surplusage since they would already be permitted under the general language in \u00a7 A of Part III allowing in business districts \u201c[a] 11 uses that are permitted in Residence Districts.\u201d Such a construction is to be avoided. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>275 Mass. 575, 578. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Chilton Club, </em>318 Mass. 285, 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">For these reasons we think that Catalina\u2019s use of the premises in the manner shown by the evidence constitutes a commercial enterprise within the meaning of \u201ccommercial amusement place\u201d under Part III, \u00a7 A, 4 b, of the zoning by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">3. There was error in the ruling that Catalina was a recreational building or ground within the meaning of Part II, \u00a7 A, 1 d, of the zoning by-law of Framingham. The decree is reversed. A decree is to be entered annulling the decision of the board and requiring the removal of any structure which has been erected upon the premises by Catalina and Q-enerazio.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-6\"> Other decisions are to the same effect. This court, in deciding whether a conservatory attached to a house was a \u201cgreenhouse,\u201d requiring the consent of the building commissioner, or an accessory use not requiring consent, distinguished a structure used \u201csolely for the personal use of the owner\u201d from one which allowed for cultivation on a larger scale and the product of which was \u201craised for purposes of sale.\u201d <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Melrose, </em>315 Mass. 291, 295. <em>Needham </em>v. <em>Winslow Nurseries, Inc. </em>330 Mass. 95. See <em>Jaffarian </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Somerville, </em>275 Mass. 267, 270, where it was held that a miniature golf course was a public amusement subject to the licensing statute despite its \u201caspects of athletic interest.\u201d See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bow, </em>177 Mass. 347 (requiring a merry-go-round to be licensed as a public amusement) ; <em>Gruberg </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>5 Misc. 2d (N. Y.) 223 (children's rides for a fee <em>not </em>permitted in \u201cpublic parks, playgrounds and recreational areas,\u201d but permitted in a business district).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
