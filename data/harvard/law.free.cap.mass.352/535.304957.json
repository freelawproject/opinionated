He was consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ering the purchase of a diesel engine for his fishing boat. In the fall of 1960, Perkins\u2019s sales manager, one Rideout, went to Hunt\u2019s house in Orleans to acquaint him with the various Caterpillar diesel engines available. At Rideout\u2019s suggestion, Hunt went to Maine to look at a boat equipped with such an engine. In January, 1961, Hunt signed a purchase order for one Caterpillar Model D330 engine with a 1.2 to 1 reduction gear (instead of one reduction gear ordinarily supplied by the manufacturer) and certain specified accessories. The written portion of the purchase order was prepared (except for the signatures) by Rideout. It was on a \u201cpad of paper containing several copies separated by carbon paper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Hunt did not read anything on the back of the order when he signed it. \u201cThe original and all . . . copies of the . . . [o]rder were taken by Rideout . . . for signature by an official\u201d of Perkins. Hunt received a fully executed copy of the order by mail a few days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The face of the purchase order contains a statement of the property sold, acknowledgment of a $500 deposit, a statement of the balance ($4,095) due, and certain miscellaneous information. In the center of the face of the order in bold face type capitals appears the statement \u201cBOTH THIS ORDER AND ITS ACCEPTANCE ARE SUBJECT TO \u2018TERMS AND CONDITIONS\u2019 STATED IN THIS ORDER.\u201d On the reverse side of the order at the top in the same bold face type capitals appear the words \u2018 \u2018 TERMS AND CONDITIONS. \u2019 \u2019 Underneath those words there are eleven numbered paragraphs. Included among the numbered paragraphs are those set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>After Hunt had received his executed copy of the order, he took his boat to Plymouth Marine Railways (Marine) to have it prepared for the new engine. Seven or eight days later Hunt by telephone learned from Rideout that there would be a delay in delivery. Rideout then told Hunt that he could tear up the contract and forget the engine if he wanted to do so. Hunt decided to go through with the purchase because his boat was already at Marine and the old engine had been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The engine was delivered to Marine on March 6, 1961, and was thereafter installed in the boat by Marine. This installation work included everything that was necessary to connect the engine, with the exception of the initial starting. That was done by employees of Perkins. Marine was not connected with, nor acting for, Perkins at any time. Its work was not controlled by Perldns. It was engaged by and paid by Hunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">After the engine was installed a series of mechanical problems arose, each of which was corrected by Perkins at no expense to Hunt other than the time involved while the repairs were being made. The engine, when running, gave off excessive quantities of heavy black smoke, which caused the boat to become dirty, inside and out, and rendered Hunt\u2019s work on the boat unpleasant. This condition persisted until the removal of the engine. At Hunt\u2019s request Perkins, on several occasions and by a variety of means, attempted without success to curtail the smoking.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">About July 20,1961, the engine was removed by Hunt and put on the dock at Marine\u2019s plant. Hunt called Perkins and reported that he had removed the engine and advised Perkins to get it. The engine is still on Marine\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>In July, 1961, Hunt purchased a new engine from another manufacturer. This new engine has performed satisfactorily.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Hunt\u2019s evidence of damages consisted of a showing of cash payments to Marine of $761.49 for installation work and testimony that he lost $250 each day when he was prevented from fishing as a result of Perkins\u2019s work on the boat. Perkins worked on the boat on about ten different occasions between the installation of the engine and June, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The trial judge denied motions for directed verdicts in this action in two counts, count 1 for breach of an implied warranty of merchantability and count 2 for breach of an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. The jury returned verdicts for $5,357: Perkins brings before us exceptions to the denial of directed verdicts and to the judge\u2019s refusal to order verdicts entered for Perkins under leave reserved. There was evidence from which the facts stated above could have been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">1. This case presents issues under the Uniform Commercial Code (see St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1) concerning excluding or modifying (a) the implied warranty of merchantability under GL L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (b) the implied warranty under c. 106, \u00a7 2-315, that goods shall be fit for a particular purpose.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 2-316 (2) reads, in part: <em>\u201c </em>(2) . . . [T]o exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability <em>and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, </em>and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and <em>conspicuous. </em>Lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>guage to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that \u2018There are no warranties which extend beyond the description <em>on the face hereof \u2019 \u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Section 2-316 (2) must be read with \u00a7 1-201 (10) which provides, in part: \u201c \u2018Conspicuous\u2019: A term . . . is conspicuous when it is so written that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate <em>ought to have noticed it. </em>A printed heading in capitals (as: NON-NEGOTIABLE BILL OF LADING) is conspicuous. Language in the body of a form is \u2018conspicuous\u2019 if it is in larger or other contrasting type or color. . . . Whether a term or clause is \u2018conspicuous\u2019 ... is for decision by the court\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Hunt concedes that Perkins\u2019s disclaimer of warranties would have been effective if the disclaimer language in the \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d (fn. 1), instead of being on the back of the contract form had been (a) on the face of the purchase order, or (b) had been referred to on the face of the order by words such as \u201csee other side\u201d or \u201cas stated on the reverse hereof.\u201d The first question for decision is whether the disclaimer of the warranties on the back of this purchase order was \u201cconspicuous.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Some light is shed upon the meaning of \u201cconspicuous\u201d in \u00a7 1-201 (10) by the official comment on the subsection, which says in part, \u2018 \u2018 This is intended to indicate some of the methods of making a term attention-calling. But the test is whether attention can reasonably be expected to be called to it.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See 1957 official text, p. 26. Most commentators <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>discuss the issue in general terms.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The decided cases are not controlling. In <em>Boeing Airplane Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>329 F. 2d 585, 593 (8th Cir.), a disclaimer \u201cmerely in the same color and size of type used for the other provisions\u201d was treated as not conspicuous. In <em>Minikes </em>v. <em>Admiral Corp. </em>48 Misc. 2d (N. Y.) 1012, 1013 (Dist. Ct.), a \u201cdisclaimer . . . smaller, not larger, than the rest of the purchase order\u201d was held not conspicuous. In <em>Roto-Lith, Ltd. </em>v. <em>F. P. Bartlett &amp; Co. </em>297 F. 2d 497, 498-500 (1st Cir.), effect was given to a disclaimer in type \u201cstill conspicuous\u201d on the hack of the acceptance of an order, which was referred to on the front of the order in the following terms, \u201cAll goods sold without warranties, express or implied, and subject to the terms on reverse side.\u201d See for a case disregarding a disclaimer in relatively small type on the back of a form, <em>Berk </em>v. <em>Gordon Johnson Co. </em>232 F. Supp. 682, 686-688 (E. D. Mich.).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Under \u00a7 2-316 (2) read with the last sentence of \u00a7 1-201 (10), it is a question of law for the court whether a provision is conspicuous. We are in as good a position to decide that issue as the trial judge, for a photographic copy of both sides of the purchase order is before us. We decide the issue by applying the statutory test under \u00a7 1-201 (10) of what is conspicuous, viz. whether \u201ca reasonable person against whom . . . [the disclaimer] is to operate ought to have noticed it. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">In the language of the official comment (see fn. 5 and related text) the bold face printing on the front of the purchase order (although adequate in size and contrast with the rest of the printing on the form) was not in words suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>ficient to call attention to the language on the back of the form. That language would naturally be concealed because the forms were part of a pad of paper when Hunt signed the paper. There was no reference whatsoever on the front of the order to the \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d as being on the back of the order, and the quoted words \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d might have been thought to apply to other small type provisions on the front of the order unless Hunt had happened to turn over the form and look at the back of the order. His first reasonable opportunity to do this was when the executed form was returned to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In the opinion of a majority of the court, the provisions on the front of the purchase order did not make adequate reference to the provisions on the back of the order to draw attention to the latter. Hence the provisions on the back of the order cannot be said to be conspicuous although printed in an adequate size and style of type. The disclaimer was not effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">2. Upon the evidence, the jury could reasonably conclude that the continued smoking of the engine was caused by a condition which constituted a breach both of the warranty of merchantability and of the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. A smoking marine engine can hardly be regarded as of merchantable quality when sold by a distributor of such engines who is unable to cure the defect after persistent efforts. It could be found that Perkins, through Bideout, was fully aware of Hunt\u2019s requirements and his purpose in buying the engine and that Hunt relied on Perkins to guide him in its selection. See <em>Kurriss </em>v. <em>Conrad &amp; Co. Inc. </em>312 Mass. 670, 677-683; <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Hillcrest Dairy, Inc. </em>341 Mass. 624, 625-629. No evidence summarized in the bill of exceptions suggests that any injury to the engine may have been caused by Marine\u2019s work in installing it in Hunt\u2019s boat. Verdicts could not have been directed for Perkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\"> The relevant terms and conditions are the following: \u201c1. <em>Acceptance. </em>This order is subject to acceptance by Seller only at Seller\u2019s place of business in Massachusetts and shall become a binding contract only when a copy has been accepted in writing and . . . returned to Buyer. 2. <em>All Agreements. </em>This written order when accepted by Seller shall be the . . . exclusive statement of all terms of the agreement between the parties other than such additional agreements as may be contained in any contracts, notes or other documents specified herein.

After paraphrasing the official comment, the authors go on to say, \u201cIn the ease of a disclaimer of warranties, it is suggested that a contrasting size of type be used at a minimum, and, if it is at all possible, different color type should also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>be used. When contrasting size of type is mentioned, this would mean that the language disclaiming the warranty of merchantability should be in larger size type. The color of the type could be a darker shade of black, or perhaps a yellow or red, or some other color that would call attention to the disclaimer.\u201d This, of course, may be merely a counsel of caution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b578-9\"> See Cudahy, Limitation of Warranty under the Uniform Commercial Code, 47 Marquette L.
