The employee, Alfred King, was a truck driver for Hager\u2019s Ice Cream Company. On April 13, 1959, while so employed, he fell off a truck and injured his left side and back. He went immediately to the company physician who strapped his back. The next day he returned to work and continued working until December, 1959. During that period, however, he experienced pain in his back and left flank. Beginning in September he visited several physicians but none of the various treatments he received alleviated the pain. He became nervous and irritable, lost his normal appetite, and was unable to sleep well. By December the increasing pain made it difficult for him to walk or hold his body erect.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>The employee stopped working in the middle of December. He was referred by the insurer to a physician and was hospitalized in General Hospital, Somerville, on December 29. A chest X-ray taken the next day revealed a linear streaking in his left lung. Several months later he was taken to the Massachusetts General Hospital. On March 25, 1960, a section of his lung was removed, and a definite diagnosis of cancer was made. Treatment was unsuccessful, and the employee died in a rest home on August 25, 1960. The cause of death was determined to be cancer which had originated in his pancreas and spread metastatically to other parts of his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The employee\u2019s widow brought this claim for compensation, alleging that her husband\u2019s death resulted from his fall from the truck.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The single member dismissed the claim, finding \u201cthat the claimant . . . failed to sustain the burden of proving that her husband\u2019s death was causally related to his industrial accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The reviewing board made findings of its own and reversed the decision of the single member. The board found \u201cthat at the time of his injury in April 1959 the employee had a cancer of the pancreas area . . . which had not metastasized at that time; that in the fall he suffered an injury to the area of his pancreas which dislodged some cancer cells; . . . [and] that the fall set in motion a process of the cancer cells metastasizing to the lungs and other parts of the employee\u2019s body which caused this continual pain and gradual downhill course generally and, eventually, his death.\u201d Upon certification to the Superior Court a decree was entered in accordance with the board\u2019s decision. The insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The basic question is whether the evidence supported the findings that the employee\u2019s death was causally related to his industrial accident. The facts that the employee suffered a generally constant deterioration of health after the accident, and that the symptoms of his injury and the can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>cer partially coincided, do not, standing alone, support the findings of causation. \u201c [W]here such causal relation is a matter beyond the common knowledge and experience of the ordinary layman, proof of causation between the injury and the ensuing death must rest upon expert medical testimony.\u201d <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 747, 749, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The only medical testimony supporting the findings of causation was that of Dr. Elliott L. Sagall, a specialist in internal medicine and cardiovascular diseases. Dr. Sagall had not treated the employee and based his testimony upon the medical records. He testified \u201cthat this situation was one where an individual, previously symptom free and able to work, suffered a severe blow in an area over an organ which was later shown to have cancer and . . . his course after the injury indicated progressive difficulty, with spread of the cancer. On this basis, it is my opinion that it is likely that the injury itself, hitting a previously cancerous area, promoted metastasis and hastened his death.\u201d He further stated that in his opinion the \u201cdeath was hastened by the injury, either as [a] direct result of the blow, affecting the pre-existent cancerous tissue, causing it to spread more rapidly and sooner than it ordinarily would have locally and also metastatically and that the continued pain, nervousness, irritability and other bodily reactions to the pain in his back lowered his general bodily resistance and thereby contributed further to the spread of this carcinoma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Dr. Sagall\u2019s opinion was based upon alternative theories. The first \u2014 that the force of the fall directly affected the pre-existent cancerous tissue of the pancreas and thereby hastened metastasis \u2014 is the basis of the challenged findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This theory was based upon three assumptions, each of which was adopted by the reviewing board: that cancer was present in the employee\u2019s pancreas prior to the acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>dent; that the accident disturbed the pre-existent cancerous tissue ;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that such disturbance hastened the metastasis. On cross-examination Dr. Sagall conceded that none of these assumptions was directly supported by clinical evidence. He agreed that cancer was not diagnosed definitely until the operation on March 25, 1960, and that the first clinical suggestion of cancer was the X-ray taken on December 30, 1959, which revealed a streaking in the left lung. When asked whether it was possible that the cancer had originated at some time after the accident, Dr. Sagall answered, \u201cThis would be unusual in view of the . . . wide spread metastasis; the size . . . and the spread indicate it has probably been present for years . . ..\u201d Q. \u201cDo you mean to say that . . . cancer doesn\u2019t spread rapidly sometimes ? \u201d A. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d Q. \u201c Conceivably this cancer could have started between those two dates and spread rapidly . . ..\u201d A. \u201cThis is conceivable; I answer in terms of likelihood.\u201d Dr. Sagall also agreed that there was no indication in the records that the accident had caused any injury or trauma to the pancreas. He conceded that \u201c [t]he cause of cancer in many instances is still unknown today.\u201d Nowhere in his testimony did he point to any positive evidence in the records which, assuming a cancerous pancreas and a blow affecting it, would substantiate the conclusion that the spread of the cancer was thereby hastened.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">There are limits to the probative value of expert opinion. It \u201cwill be disregarded where it amounts to no more than mere speculation or a guess from subordinate facts that do not give adequate support to the conclusion reached.\u201d <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 747, 751, and cases cited. <em>Ober-lander\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 1, 7. We think that Dr. Sagall\u2019s opinion, given maximum weight, expressed no more than a mathematical likelihood that the employee\u2019s death was causally related to his accident. But as we said in <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Acc. Co. </em>307 Mass. 246, at p. 250, \u201cIt . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>[is] not enough that mathematically the chances somewhat favor a proposition to be proved .... [T]hat proposition is proved by a preponderance of the evidence if it is made to appear more likely or probable in the sense that actual belief in its truth, derived from the evidence, exists in the . . . minds of the tribunal . . ..\u201d <em>Tartas\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 585, 587, is to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">We are of opinion that the decision of the reviewing board was lacking in evidential support and cannot stand. The decree is reversed and a new decree is to be entered dismissing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\"> The widow-claimant died on October 30, 1964, and the administrator of her estate was substituted as claimant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\"> The board made no finding based upon the alternative theory that the employee\u2019s injury lowered Ms bodily resistance and thereby contributed to the metastasis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b529-6\"> Although the board\u2019s finding contained the phrase \u2018 \u2018 dislodged some cancer cells,\u201d which was not used by Dr. Sagall, we assume the expression to be a paraphrase of the doctor\u2019s first alternative.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
