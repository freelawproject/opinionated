They were purchased from the defendant in the year 1917 for $129 each. In the latter part of October, 1924, the defendant opened a dirt road about 30 feet wide through the middle of lots 106 and 107 without the permission of the plaintiff, and in doing so cut down about ten trees. Defendant sought to prove that it did this relying upon Ordinance Ho. 247 of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, passed and approved October 18th, 1924, for the opening of Arbutus Avenue from the southeast side of Walnut Avenue to the southeast side of Lindenwood Avenue. This included the road opened by defendant. Defendant offered this ordinance in evidence and also certain plats for the condemning and opening of Arbutus Avenue in accordance with Ordinance Ho. 247. On objection by plaintiff they were excluded, and this is the subject of the first bill of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">It is contended by appellee that this exception is not in proper form, in that it embraces two offers ruled upon by the trial court. But w\u00a9 regard the two offers as so connected that they may properly be included as one exception. The common objection to both offers was that the thing sought to be proved furnished no excuse for the trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">The second exception was to the ruling out of the testimony of a witness for the defendant that the road was cut through after the passage of the ordinance. The fourth was to -the granting of plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer, overruling defendant\u2019s special exception thereto and the refusal of defendant\u2019s first and second prayers. There was no error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>refusing defendant\u2019s second prayer, because it limited recovery to nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer submitted the question of punitive damages to the jury. It was specially excepted to, on the ground that \u201cthere is no evidence in the case from which the jury can find that the defendant acted in such a wanton and reckless manner or in disregard of the plaintiff\u2019s rights as to entitle her to exemplary damages.\u201d The defendant\u2019s first prayer was as follows: \u201cThe defendant prays the court to instruct the jury that there is no evidence in this case to entitle the plaintiff to exemplary or punitive damages, and in estimating the damages the jury should confine their verdict to such sum as will compensate the plaintiff for any damage (if the jury shall find any) which she may have sustained by reason of the construction of the roadway over the plaintiff\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">To prevent this prayer from misleading\u2019 the jury there should have been added to it the words \u201cand the destruction of trees,\u201d although that was involved in the construction of the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">In our opinion the rulings challenged in the first and second exceptions and in granting plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer were erroneous and prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Evidence as to the ordinance was not relevant as a defense to the action. <em>Balto. &amp; O. R. Co. v. Boyd, </em>63 Md. 325. But it was admissible to be considered with other facts by the court in determining whether the question of punitive damages should be submitted to the jury; Pr by the jury, if such question is submitted. <em>Balto. &amp; O. R. Co. v. Boyd, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">\u201cAs the ground of allowing exemplary damages is evil motive or wantonness, or aggravation, all circumstances showing the absence of these may be proved to prevent the allowance of such damages.\u201d <em>Sedgwick on Damages, </em>sec. 369 ; 38 <em>Cyc. </em>1115; <em>Gray v. Waterman, </em>40 Ill. 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Coming now to plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer, we find no evidence of malice or wantonness, or reckless disregard of the rights of plaintiff. The trespass itself does not raise a presumptiofi of either. In <em>Timanus v. Leonard, </em>121 Md. 583, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>.John C. Leonard and Charles T. Delaney were sued for trespass for removing a large quantity of dirt from plaintiff\u2019s lot for grading a street without plaintiff\u2019s permission. Leonard had the contract for grading the street and Delaney was his foreman. Delaney testified that when he discovered that dirt was being taken from plaintiff\u2019s lot he asked the man temporarily in charge of the work why he was getting it from plaintiff\u2019s lot. The man replied that he was told to do so by Leonard. Although Leonard was a witness in the case he did not deny that he had given such instructions. This court held, in an opiniofi by Judge Pattison, that there was \u201can absence of any such elements of wanton or malicious motives, or such reckless disregai'd of the rights of the plaintiff in the commission of the trespass as would entitle the plaintiff to claim punitive or exemplary damages,\u201d and that, there was no error in so instructing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In <em>Balto. &amp; O. R. Co. v. Boyd, supra, </em>the trespass was committed, as in the present case, under the supposed authority of an ordinance. In an opinion by Judge Miller this court said: \u201cWe are all of opinion the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover exemplary damages, and consequently that there was error in granting their second prayer, which allowed the jury to give such damages. This court has, on many occasions, had this subject before it, and in the very recent case of <em>Phila., W. &amp; B. R. Co. v. Hoeflich, </em>62 Md. 300, 307, the question was very carefully considered, and we there said that to entitle one to such damages there must be an element of fraud or malice, or evil intent, or oppression, entering into and forming part of the wrongful act. It is in such cases as these that exemplary or punitive damages are awarded as a punishment for the evil motive or intent with which the act is done, and as an example oh warning to others. But where the act, though wrongful in itself, is committed in the honest assertion of a supposed rig'ht, or in discharge of duty, or without any evil or bad intention, there is no grofind on which such damages can be awarded.\u2019 This, we are satisfied, places the doctrine upon the right ground, and the rule applies as well to cases of injury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>property as to the person.\u201d See also <em>Eliason v. Groves, </em>85 Md. at p. 231; <em>Phila., B. &amp; W. R. Co. v. Green, </em>110 Md. 32; <em>Sedgivick on Damages, </em>vol. 1, see. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The prayer under consideration is substantially the same as one approved in <em>Frostburg v. Hithins, </em>99 Md. 617, which was strongly urged by the learned trial court as authority for its ruling. But there are two reasons why that case is no authority for the ruling complained of here: (1) There does not appear th have been a special exception filed to the prayer in that ease. (2) The facts are entirely different. There was evidence in that case of oppression and bad faith on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">There is one other exception to be considered, the third. This has reference to the measure of damages other than punitive. The exception, however, is not in form to reach the real cause of complaint of appellant, which was a suggestion by the court in the presence of the jury of an erroneous basis of arriving at actual damages. The only ground of this exception was the refusal to strike ofit the answer of a wfitness which was responsive to a question not objected to. There was no error in that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">For the errors above pointed out the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and a neiv trial awarded, with costs to appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">OrruTT3 J.., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
