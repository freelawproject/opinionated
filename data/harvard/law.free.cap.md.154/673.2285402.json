J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AW3\">delivered the opinion of the Co'urt.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-16\">A motion made by the appellees to dismiss this appeal must, in our opinion, be granted. It is an appeal by a purchaser of property at a sale upon foreclosure of a mortgage under the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City, from an order overruling his exceptions to the ratifica,tion of the sale because of a small difference between the amount of ground rent stated in the advertisement of sale, on the one hand, and the amount paid for a period of years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>past and <em>that </em>specified <em>in an </em>early conveyance, on the other hand. The order was signed and filed on the 12th day of July, 1927, and the appellant\u2019s order for his appeal was swom to and filed on the 13th day of September, 1927; and by section 36 of article 5 of the Code an appeal from an order of a court of equity is required to be taken and entered \u201cwithin two months from the date of the decree or order appealed from, and not afterwards.\u201d There can be no doubt .that, according to' the rule followed by this court in previous decisions, the 13th day of September was beyond the time limit, \u201cwithin two months\u201d from the 12th day of July, unless an elimination of hue or more days from the count should be possible. <em>Calvert v. Williams, </em>34 Md. 672, 673; <em>Stiegler v. Eureka, Life Insurance Co., </em>146 Md. 629, 655. And the appellant contends that September 12th, the last day of the two months, should be eliminated because that day was a legal holiday in Baltimore City and the office of the clerk of the court was closed. It has twice been decided that the fact that the last day of such a time allowance, longer than seven days, falls ota. Sunday, does not permit an extension of the time to include the Monday following. <em>American Tobacco Co. v. Strickling, </em>88 Md. 500, 510; <em>Stiegler v. Eureka Life Insurance Co., supra. </em>And we do not find any sufficient ground for distinguishing between Sunday and a legal holiday on another day, under that rule. Such holidays would be common incidents of almost any two months\u2019 period in Maryland except when Good Friday falls in March or Labor Day falls after the 4th day of September, there could be no two months\u2019 period which would not include one or more of them (Code, art. 13, sec. 9); and we must suppose the Legislature to have had in mind this likelihood of including holidays when it specified merely the two months. It did not allow two months clear of holidays. We do not understand it to- be argued, indeed, that holidays anywhere before the last day of the two months should be deducted in calculating the time. Yet there seems to be no satisfactory ground for deducting for a holiday on the last day that would not require deduction for one on an earlier day.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>It is to be borne in mind that, in time allowances such as this, it is not only the last day that has- been allo'wed for the action to be taken; the whole of two- months, -or as it happens in this instance -sixty-one days before the last one, have been allowed, and the latitude given by this was, we think, undoubtedly meant to provide for -contingencies which might arise and interfere during the period. In view o'f these- considerations, asnd of the authorities cited, it does not seem permissible to say that it was intended that an appellant might .defer entering Ms appeal until the last day within the limit, and then because it was a holiday haive still another day allowed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed, with costs to the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
