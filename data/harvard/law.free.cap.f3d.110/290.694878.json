JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b367-21\">Appellant Leonard C. Jaques (\u201cJaques\u201d), a practicing attorney and unsuccessful defendant in this fraud case filed by a former client, appeals the final order of the district court imposing sanctions for Jaques\u2019s conduct in his deposition. We agree with the district court that its inherent power to regulate court proceedings authorized the issuance of a monetary sanction against Jaques; further, Jaques\u2019s conduct warranted the $7,000 sanction imposed. We affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-22\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b367-23\">In October 1994, Dermot P. Carroll filed suit against Jaques and his law firm, The Jaques Admiralty Law Firm, P.C., asserting several claims arising from the defendants\u2019 alleged negligent representation of Carroll in a lawsuit several years earlier. Because the district court held most of Carroll's claims barred by limitations, Carroll was allowed to pursue only his claim of actual fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-24\">Carroll originally noticed Jaques\u2019s deposition for January 18, 1996; Jaques did not appear. Neither did Jaques attend a court-ordered mediation the next day. On February 1, the court conducted a show cause hearing to consider whether sanctions should be ordered against Jaques and his firm for ignoring the court-ordered mediation. At the show-cause hearing, Jaques, who lives in Michigan, made himself available to be deposed on that day. In spite of the last minute notice and as an accommodation to Jaques, Carroll\u2019s counsel agreed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-25\">At his videotaped deposition, which lasted for more than four hours, Jaques threatened and cursed at Carroll\u2019s attorney. The following is a brief excerpt from the deposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>testimony that exemplifies Jaques\u2019s egregious conduct:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">Q. So, you knew you had Mr. Carroll\u2019s file in the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">A.

He ought to be punched in the g \u2014 damn nose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\">Q. How about your own net worth, Mr. Jaques? What is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">[DEFENDANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Excuse me. Object also that this is protected by a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-12\">THE WITNESS: Get off my back, you slimy son-of-a-bitch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-13\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: I beg your pardon, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-14\">THE WITNESS: You slimy son-of-a-bitch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-15\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: You\u2019re not going to cuss me, Mr. Jaques.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-16\">THE WITNESS: You\u2019re a slimy son-of-a-bitch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-17\">[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: You can cuss your counsel. You can cuss your client. You can cuss yourself. You\u2019re not going to cuss me. We\u2019re stopping right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-18\">THE WITNESS: You\u2019re damn right. [PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: We\u2019ll resume with Judge Schell tomorrow. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-19\">THE WITNESS: Come on. Let\u2019s go. [PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Good evening, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-20\">THE WITNESS: F\u2014 you, you son-of-a-bitch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-21\">After Carroll filed a motion to compel Ja-ques to answer questions presented at his deposition and to refrain from verbal abuse, the district court, on its own motion, noticed and conducted a show cause hearing to determine whether Jaques should be sanctioned for his abusive conduct at his deposition. The court considered imposing sanctions pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 37, but because plaintiffs counsel declined to file an affidavit setting forth his expenses and attorney\u2019s fees incurred, Rule 37 was inappropriate, as were other provisions that award fees or costs to the offended party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, relying on its inherent power, the district court imposed sanctions against Jaques in the amount of $7,000 to be paid to the Clerk of the United States District Court. <em>See Carroll v. Jaques, </em>926 F.Supp. 1282, 1293 (E.D.Tex.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-24\">Jaques appeals the court\u2019s order imposing sanctions, complaining that the district court abused its discretion by (1) resorting to its inherent powers to sanction Jaques, (2) failing to use the least severe sanction available, (3) finding that Jaques\u2019s behavior during the deposition constituted bad faith, (4) punishing speech protected by the First Amendment, and (5) assessing sanctions in the absence of clear and convincing evidence of sanctionable conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-25\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b368-26\">We review the district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions for abuse of discretion. <em>Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 55, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 2138, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991); <em>Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of Am. v. Energy Gathering, Inc., </em>2 F.3d 1397, 1410 (5th Cir.1993), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1073, 114 S.Ct. 882, 127 L.Ed.2d 77 (1994). When a party\u2019s deplorable conduct is not effectively sanction-able pursuant to an existing rule or statute, it is appropriate for a district court to rely on its inherent power to impose sanctions. <em>See Chambers, </em>501 U.S. at 50, 111 S.Ct. at 2135-36; <em>Natural Gas Pipeline Co., </em>2 F.3d at 1406. \u201cA court must, of course, exercise caution in invoking its inherent power, and it must comply with the mandates of due pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>cess, both in determining that the requisite bad faith exists and in assessing fees.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>501 U.S. at 50, 111 S.Ct. at 2136.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">No due process issue is raised here. Prior to imposing sanctions, the district court issued an order to show cause why sanctions should not be ordered against Jaques for his behavior and failure to answer questions at his deposition. Before the hearing, Jaques filed and the court considered his Memorandum Opposing Sanctions. Jaques complains that the court questioned his credibility by relying on previous published court sanction orders against him, but the trial court hardly hinged its ruling on those cases, and we will not consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">After acknowledging that he should cautiously invoke the inherent power to sanction, the court ruled that sanctions were appropriate. The court found that Jaques\u2019s behavior of hurling \u201cvulgar and profane words\u201d at Carroll\u2019s counsel and threatening Carroll\u2019s counsel with an act of physical violence constituted bad faith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">This abusive behavior disrupted the litigation (1) by forcing counsel for the Plaintiff to terminate the deposition and (2) by displaying blatant disrespect and contempt for the judicial processes of this court. Jaques\u2019s language was extremely offensive, threatening, and contumacious. No court can effectively dispose of cases when a party engages in such repugnant conduct in the course of pretrial discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-7\"><em>Carroll, </em>926 F.Supp. at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Finding Jaques to be a man of considerable wealth, the court concluded that a substantial sanction was necessary in order to deter him and those like him from future abusive behavior. The court credited certain mitigating circumstances, including Jaques\u2019s claimed fatigue at the deposition, his hypoglycemic condition, and the impact of his disruption upon the discovery process but not the entire litigation. An award of $7,000 was levied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court stated that this \u201csanction is large enough to deter Jaques from engaging in any future abusive conduct, yet the amount is lower than what it may have been if there were no mitigating circumstances.\u201d <em>Carroll, </em>926 F.Supp. at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">Contrary to Jaques\u2019s contention, the district court did not legally err or abuse its discretion in resorting to its inherent power to sanction Jaques for his behavior at his deposition. First, other statutes and rules, such as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, Fed.R.Civ.P. 37, and the Eastern District of Texas Local Rules, do not squarely contemplate sanctions payable to the court for disruptive behavior. As plaintiffs counsel disclaimed any monetary sanction for the offense \u2014 a position justified explicitly by counsel\u2019s statement that money could not rectify the insult and, perhaps, implicitly by the hefty damage verdict his client won \u2014 the usual rules were not \u201cup to the task.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>501 U.S. at 50, 111 S.Ct. at 2136. Second, Fed.R.Civ.P. 83(b) does not bar the district court\u2019s use of its inherent power in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rule 83(b) ensures that litigants are not unfairly sanctioned for failure to comply with a local rule of the court or internal operating procedures or the like of which they are unaware. Rule 83(b) does not eliminate a court\u2019s inherent power to sanction, and it does not prevent sanction for failure to respond to deposition questions and intentional disruption of the discovery process \u2014 misconduct that is recognized in the rules, in common sense, and in respect for the court\u2019s processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">Third, the court did not abuse its discretion in considering Jaques\u2019s conduct as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>constituting bad faith. \u201cWe find entirely appropriate the court\u2019s expectations of a heightened standard of conduct by a litigant who is also an attorney.\u201d <em>Coane v. Ferrara Pan Candy Co., </em>898 F.2d 1030, 1033 (5th Cir.1990). This court \u201cadheres to the well established doctrine that \u2018[a]n attorney, after being admitted to practice, becomes an officer of the court, exercising a privilege or franchise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howell v. State Bar of Texas, </em>843 F.2d 205, 207 (5th Cir.) (quoting <em>Harkins v. Murphy &amp; Bolanz, </em>51 Tex.Civ.App. 568, 112 S.W. 136 (1908, writ dism\u2019d)), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 982, 109 S.Ct. 531, 102 L.Ed.2d 563 (1988). \u201cAs officers of the court, attorneys owe a duty to the court that far exceeds that of lay citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is not acceptable for a party \u2014 particularly a party who is also an attorney \u2014 \u201cto attempt to use the judicial system ... to harass an opponent in order to gain an unfair advantage in litigation.\u201d <em>Coane, </em>898 F.2d at 1033. Neither is it a violation of his First Amendment right to be so sanctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The finding of bad faith is predicated on a single point: Jaques knew better. Even if he was tired, hypoglycemic, and feeling put-upon by repetitive and, in his view, irrelevant questioning<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 assumptions which are each dubious, as the district court observed \u2014 his condition was no excuse for abusive, profane, and pugnacious behavior in his deposition. Such conduct degrades the legal profession and mocks the search for truth that is at the heart of the litigation process. To assert, as does Jaques, that using vile language and fighting words during the course of an interrogation under oath do not constitute bad faith is almost as disrespectful of the legal process as his deposition conduct. Jaques\u2019s words and actions in the deposition did nothing to further its purpose and, indeed, subverted it to prevent his answering the questions asked. Through his counsel, Jaques could have acted within the rules to object to questions he thought improper. Profanity and threats are not a good faith substitute for either answering the questions or properly objecting.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Fourth, we agree with the district court that the fine imposed was the least severe sanction available. Fines like this have been imposed by other federal courts for similar offenses. <em>See, e.g., El-Gharabli v. INS, </em>796 F.2d 935, 939-40 (7th Cir.1986) (affirming imposition of a $500 fine for misleading the court concerning the nature of a pending case and consistently violating court rules); <em>Kleiner v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>751 F.2d 1193, 1209-10 (11th Cir.1985) (affirming imposition of $50,000 fine against attorney for intentional misconduct). Jaques\u2019s persistent misconduct during his deposition \u2014 challenging and insulting plaintiff\u2019s counsel, refusing to answer questions, cursing \u2014 necessitated additional court hearings and written interrogatories and thus burdened the court as well as his opponent. Jaques is presumed to have understood the impact of his contumacious approach. It is difficult to conceive of a lesser sanction that would vindicate the dignity of court proceedings and chasten Jaques against future misconduct. The amount of the sanction was, under all the circumstances, modest.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Jaques was sanctioned for his offensive and intimidating conduct, his disruption of discovery proceedings, and his lack of respect for the judicial process. The graphic transcript and videotape of the deposition, as well as the history surrounding the circumstances of his deposition, of which the court was well aware, provided more than enough evidence for the court\u2019s decision. The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sanction against Jaques.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-22\">. A more thorough recitation of Jaques's sanctioned conduct appears in the district court's order. <em>See Carroll v. Jaques, </em>926 F.Supp. 1282, 1285-87 (E.D.Tex.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-27\">. Rule 37, in part, permits the court to order the offending party or its attorneys or both to pay the opposing counsel's reasonable expenses and fees incurred as sanctions for the offending party\u2019s failure to make disclosures or to cooperate during discovery. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\">. This figure was calculated by assessing fines of \u2018\u2018$500 for each of the four times Jaques referred to Plaintiff's counsel as either an \u2018idiot\u2019 or an \u2018ass'; $1,000 for Jaques's suggestion during the deposition that Plaintiff's counsel \u2018ought to be punched in the g-damn nose'; $1,000 for each of the three times Jaques called Plaintiff\u2019s counsel a 'slimy son-of-a-bitch'; and $1,000 for Ja-ques's parting words to Plaintiff\u2019s counsel.\u201d <em>See Carroll, </em>926 F.Supp. at 1293.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\">. Rule 83(b) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-14\">A judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law, rules adopted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2072 and 2075, and local rules of the district. No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law, federal rules, or the local district rules unless the alleged violator has been furnished in the particular case with actual notice of the requirement.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b370-5\">. Jaques emphasizes that Carroll's attorney repeatedly harassed him by posing irrelevant questions, such as questions concerning Jaques's and his firm\u2019s net worth. Jaques complains that questions concerning his net worth were irrelevant because the case was governed by Michigan law. Under Michigan law, punitive damages are not available to punish a defendant, and, therefore, a defendant\u2019s net worth is not discoverable. However, at the time of his deposition, the choice of law determination had not yet been made by the court. Jaques was deposed on February 1, 1996; the district court ruled on February 8, 1996 that Michigan law would apply in this case. Therefore, <em>at the time of his deposition, </em>questions concerning Jaques\u2019s and his firm\u2019s net worth \u2014 which Jaques refused to answer \u2014 were potentially relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
