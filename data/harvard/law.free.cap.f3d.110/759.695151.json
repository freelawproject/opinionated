For the reasons below, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">FACTS:</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Carter pled guilty in 1992 to one count of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute. The PSI found that Carter was responsible for 950 kilograms of marijuana that he had imported into Georgia from other states. Thus, the PSI assigned Carter a base offense level of 30. After adding and subtracting adjustments, the PSI calculated Carter\u2019s total adjusted offense level to be 32. Carter fell in Criminal History Category I, and thus his guideline sentencing range was 121 to 151 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">At the sentencing hearing, Carter challenged the PSI\u2019s quantity finding, arguing that it was based on the weight of wet marijuana. He explained, through counsel, that the marijuana had been soaked with water before transport to Georgia. Carter alleged that he had to dry the marijuana before he could resell it, and he further claimed that the dried marijuana \u201cdidn\u2019t probably weigh half of what it weighed in its wet-down form.\u201d The court credited Carter\u2019s allegations, but held that the weight to be used in calculating his base offense level was the marijuana\u2019s gross weight, which included the weight of the water. Thus, the court adopted the PSI\u2019s factual findings and guideline calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">The district court initially sentenced Carter to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. Pursuant to a government motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, however, the court later departed downward to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment to reflect Carter\u2019s substantial assistance in criminal prosecutions. Subsequently, the government filed a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b) to further reduce Carter\u2019s sentence in acknowledgment of his continued assistance in prosecutions. The district court granted this motion and reduced Carter\u2019s sentence to 80 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">Effective November 1, 1993, the Sentencing Commission amended the guidelines to provide that a controlled substance\u2019s weight for sentencing purposes \u201cdoes not include materials that must be separated Jrom the controlled substance before the controlled substance can be used.\u201d U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 484 (codified as U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 1)). The Commission authorized retroactive application of this amendment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a), (c), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">Effective November 1, 1995, the Commission amended the guidelines again to clarify the language added by the previous amendment. This new amendment expressly provided that a court should approximate the dry weight of marijuana that is too wet to consume. U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 518 (codified as U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 1)). Unlike the previous amendment, however, this new amendment was not made retroactive. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a), (c), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">In light of these amendments, Carter brought a motion for sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), seeking to have his sentence recalculated based on the dry weight of the marijuana. Carter again argued that the PSPs- quantity finding was based on the wet weight of the marijuana, and alleged that the dry weight of the marijuana was less than half the wet weight. He also asserted that three government witnesses \u2014 Vernon Smith, J.W. Edwards, and Johnny Johnson \u2014 could verify his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">The district court denied relief. After reviewing Amendments 484 and 518, the court concluded that it was unclear whether retroactive recalculation of dry marijuana weight was authorized. Nevertheless, the court assumed, without deciding, that Carter was eligible for such relief under Amendment 484. The Court also credited Carter\u2019s allegation that the PSI\u2019s quantity finding was based on the wet weight of the marijuana. Because this case involved an \u201chistorical drug conspiracy\u201d and little marijuana had been seized, however, the court found that \u201cit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>would be impossible to estimate the weight of the dried marijuana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">Carter appeals the denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"Alr\">DISCUSSION:</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Carter contends that the district court erred in denying his motion. Citing <em>United States v. Smith, </em>51 F.3d 980 (11th Cir.1995), Carter argues that he is clearly entitled to the retroactive benefit of Amendments 484 and 518. He further argues that the district court should hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the dry weight of the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Without addressing the retroactivity of Amendment 484, the government contends that Amendment 518 is not retroactive. The government further contends that, even if Amendment 518 is retroactive, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Carter\u2019s motion. The government argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that no evidence can be adduced concerning the dry weight of the marijuana. Finally, the government asserts that Carter defaulted on this claim by failing1 to raise it on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">In reply, Carter argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the dry weight of the marijuana may be \u201cdifficult\u201d to estimate, but that it is not \u201cimpossible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">The government failed to raise its procedural-default argument below, and thus the issue is waived for purposes of appeal. <em>Hansen v. United States, </em>956 F.2d 245, 247 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">\n<em>ISSUE 1: Whether Carter is eligible for a sentence reduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">In cases where the defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission, the district court may reduce the term of imprisonment if such a reduction is consistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(2). According to the applicable guidelines policy statement, a defendant is eligible for retroactive application of a subsequently enacted guideline amendment if the amendment is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(e). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">Amendment 484, which established the initial rule excluding unusable materials from drug weight, is among the amendments listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). Amendment 518, which clarified this rule with respect to wet marijuana, is not listed. Thus, Carter is eligible for relief only if Amendment 484 is interpreted as excluding water from the weight of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">In <em>United States v. Smith, </em>51 F.3d 980 (11th Cir.1995), this Court interpreted Amendment 484\u2019s language as requiring a sentencing court to approximate the dry weight of marijuana that is too wet to consume. 51 F.3d at 981-82. The Court cited Amendment 518 \u2014 which was then pending before Congress \u2014 as support for this interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 981. Nevertheless, the Court merely used Amendment 518 as \u201csubsequent legislative history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The actual language that the Court interpreted to require exclusion of water weight was that of Amendment 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">Thus, <em>Smith </em>appears to authorize the relief that Carter seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">\n<em>ISSUE 2: Whether the district court abused its discretion in denying Carter a sentence reduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">The decision whether to retroactively apply an amendment to a particular defendant is a matter within the discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Vazquez, </em>53 F.3d 1216, 1227-28 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">When determining whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, the court should consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) \u201cto the extent they are applicable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The court is not required to make specific findings regarding the applicability of each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, but it should state the reasons for its ruling. <em>See United States v. Dorrough, </em>84 F.3d 1309, 1311 (10th Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 446, 136 L.Ed.2d 342; <em>cf. United States v. Parrado, </em>911 F.2d 1567, 1572-73 (11th Cir.1990) (a district court is not required to rule on the applicability of each particular \u00a7 3553(a) factor when imposing sentence, but it should tailor its comments to show that the sentence imposed is appropriate in light of the these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>factors), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1104, 111 S.Ct. 1005, 112 L.Ed.2d 1088 (1991). The court should also consider the sentence it would have imposed had the amendment been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Here, the district court provided only one reason for denying- Carter\u2019s motion: it found that estimating the dry weight of the marijuana would be \u201cimpossible.\u201d The record does not support this finding. Although the actual marijuana is not available to weigh, there are witnesses who can testify concerning the degree of weight reduction that drying entailed. Carter himself is such a witness. Furthermore, the PSI indicates that Carter had partners in his marijuana business. These individuals may be able to testify in support or contradiction of Carter\u2019s allegations. Finally, Carter\u2019s motion identified three witnesses that allegedly could verify his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Thus, because the district court erred in concluding that it would be impossible to estimate the marijuana\u2019s dry weight, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
