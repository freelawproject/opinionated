Sys. v. Northbrook Life Ins. Co., </em>904 F.2d 236 (5th Cir.1990), in which we held that a third-party provider\u2019s state-law claim for misrepresentation of medical coverage was not preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461. Because we find that the district court erred in concluding that the plaintiffs state-law claim for misrepresentation was preempted, we reverse. In addition, because this case was removed to federal court on the ground that the plaintiffs claim implicated ERISA \u2014 thereby giving rise to federal question jurisdiction \u2014 and because we conclude that ERISA is not implicated, we remand this case to the district court with instructions to remand the plaintiffs state-law claim to Texas state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">In December 1993, Deborah J. Meyer established an employee welfare benefit plan which provided group health insurance for Meyer\u2019s employees and their dependents. The insurance plan was funded through insurance purchased from the defendant Pan-American Life Insurance Company. National Insurance Services acted as Pan-American\u2019s agent. Both parties agree that the health insurance plan is an ERISA plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">Jack Schwartz, one of Meyer\u2019s full-time employees, was admitted to Cypress Hospital and ran up a bill of $178,215.44 in medical services related to a respiratory ailment. Prior to admitting Schwartz, Cypress on two occasions was informed by Pan-American\u2019s agent, National Insurance Services, that Schwartz was covered by Meyer\u2019s health insurance plan. It is undisputed that Cypress extended health services in reliance on National\u2019s representations, that Schwartz was in fact <em>not </em>covered by the health insurance plan, and that National therefore incorrectly informed Cypress about Schwartz\u2019s status under the health plan. Cypress eventually submitted a bill for services to National, who refused to pay on the ground that Schwartz\u2019s \u201ccoverage [was] rescinded as of [the] effective date.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">Cypress then brought suit against Pan-American and National (defendants) in Texas state court alleging a violation of \u00a7 21.21 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Texas\u2019s Insurance Code. Specifically, Cypress argued that the defendants negligently misrepresented Schwartz\u2019s coverage under the health insurance plan, and as such, were liable for deceptive and unfair trade practices. The case was eventually removed to federal court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction. The defendants then filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Cypress\u2019s claim was preempted by ERISA. The district court agreed with the defendants and entered a take-nothing judgment against Cypress. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">This ease requires us to revisit our holding in <em>Memorial Hosp. Sys. v. Northbrook Life Ins. Co., </em>904 F.2d236 (5th Cir.1990), in which we held that a state-law cause of action for negligent misrepresentation brought pursuant to Texas Insurance Code \u00a7 21.21 was <em>not </em>preempted by ERISA. <em>Id. </em>at 245-50. Cypress claims <em>Memorial </em>controls this case. The defendants, on the other hand, argue that <em>Memorial </em>is distinguishable because \u201cthis Court [in <em>Memorial </em>] distinguished between a situation involving an alleged misrepresentation as to the <em>extent </em>of coverage, and one as to the <em>existence </em>of coverage at the time of the misrepresentation.\u201d Red Brief, at 5 (citing <em>Memorial, </em>904 F.2d at 246<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>). The district court did not rely on or cite our decision in Memorial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, the district court concluded that Cypress\u2019s Blue Brief, Appendix, at 5 (emphasis added). Because we find that the defendants have erroneously concluded that <em>Memorial </em>is inapplicable to this case and that the district court erred in not applying <em>Memorial, </em>we reverse the district court\u2019s holding that Cypress\u2019s claims are preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApG\"><em>claims are indistinct from a participant\u2019s claim that his employer misrepresented the plan benefits. </em>... It does not matter whether it was the employee or his hospital that was misled by the benefit plan-related entities. Extensions of coverage however sought are not the plan; the preemption works like a [sic ] omnipotent parole evidence rule to block all extension of amounts recoverable from entities whose involvement is related to plan benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">I. ERISA Preemption and Our Decision in <em>Memorial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">We begin with a brief review of the logic and reasoning of our decision in <em>Memorial </em>because that decision controls our disposition of Cypress\u2019s claims in this case. ERISA preempts \u201cany and all State laws insofar as they now or hereafter <em>relate to </em>an employee benefit plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a) (emphasis added). In <em>Memorial, </em>we set out to define the meaning of \u201crelate to\u201d in cases involving independent, third-party providers of medical services, who assert state-law causes of action for misrepresentation against insurance companies that have misrepresented the existence of health coverage to the detriment of the third-party provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Memorial Hospital was incorrectly informed by Northbrook Insurance Company that an employee of Noffs, Incorporated was covered under Noffs\u2019s health insurance plan. The benefit plan came within ERISA\u2019s scope. After tendering the employee\u2019s hospital bill to Northbrook, Memorial was informed that the employee in fact was not covered under Noffs\u2019s plan. Memorial sued, alleging, among other things, negligent misrepresentation in violation of \u00a7 21.21 of Texas\u2019s Insurance Code. The district court held that Memorial\u2019s state-law cause of action for misrepresentation was preempted by ERISA</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">We reversed. In reaching our conclusion that Memorial\u2019s state-law claim for negligent misrepresentation was not preempted, we initially made a distinction between hospitals who assert a derivative claim for benefits (i.e., the hospital stands in the shoes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>beneficiary of the plan) and independent, third-party claims brought by health care providers such as Memorial. 904 F.2d at 243-44. To determine on which side of the line Memorial fell, we looked to our prior cases in which we found ERISA preemption had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\">two unifying characteristics: (1) the state law claims address areas of exclusive federal concern, such as the right to receive benefits under the terms of an ERISA plan; and (2) the claims directly affect the relationship among the traditional ERISA entities \u2014 the employer, the plan and its fiduciaries, and the participants and beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">904 F.2d at 245 (footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We concluded that Memorial fit into neither category and was therefore asserting its state-law claim for misrepresentation as an independent, third-party provider of medical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">We asserted three justifications for our conclusion. First, we recognized the \u201ccommercial realities\u201d facing third-party providers of health care services, noting that in situations in which it is not clear whether a patient is covered by a health insurance plan, \u201cthe provider wants to know if payment reasonably can be expected. Thus, one of the first steps in accepting a patient for treatment is to determine a financial source for the cost of care to be provided.\u201d 904 F.2d at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Second, when an insurance company erroneously informs a health care provider such as Memorial that a patient is covered by health insurance, state law, which \u201callocat[es] ... risks between commercial entities that conduct business in a state,\u201d normally provides a remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 246-47. This is so, we reasoned, because \u201c[a] provider\u2019s state law action under these circumstances would not arise due to the patient\u2019s coverage under an ERISA plan, but precisely because there is no ERISA plan coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">Third, depriving an independent third-party provider of a state-law cause of action in no way furthers, but rather defeats, Congress\u2019s purpose behind enacting ERISA. We recognized in <em>Memorial </em>that third-party providers would be less likely to accept the risk of nonpayment, and as a result, may require patients to make up-front payments or subject those patients to other unnecessary inconveniences before treatment is offered. <em>Id. </em>at 247. Nor, we reasoned, could Congress have wanted to \u201cshield welfare plan beneficiaries from the consequences of their acts toward non-ERISA health care providers when a cause of action ... would not relate to the terms or conditions of a welfare plan, nor affect \u2014 or affect only tangentially\u2014 the ongoing administration of the plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">In short, in <em>Memorial, </em>we staked out the policy arguments which support the conclusion that ERISA does not preempt a third-party provider\u2019s state-law claims if that third party\u2019s claim is premised on a finding that the beneficiary is not covered at all by an existing ERISA plan. As such, we defined what it meant for a third party\u2019s state-law claims to \u201crelate to\u201d an ERISA plan, premising our conclusion on the commercial realities faced by third-party providers, basic notions of federalism, and Congress\u2019s intent behind enacting ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">II. <em>Post-Memorial </em>Tension in Our Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">After we decided <em>Memorial, </em>some lower courts within our.- Circuit encountered a tension in our cases between <em>Memorial </em>and <em>Hermann Hosp. v. MEBA Medical &amp; Benefits Plan, </em>845 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir.1988) <em>(Hermann I) </em>and <em>Hermann Hosp. v. MEBA Medical &amp; Benefits Plan, </em>959 F.2d 569 (5th Cir.1992) <em>(Hermann II).</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Hermann I </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>and <em>Hermann II, </em>we held that a third-party provider\u2019s state-law claims <em>were </em>preempted by ERISA. It therefore became unclear whether our holding in <em>Memorial </em>applied to <em>all </em>third-party providers of medical services (contra to <em>Hermann I </em>and <em>Hermann </em>II) or whether <em>Memorial </em>invited lower courts to conduct a fact-sensitive inquiry into whether the third-party provider, under the unique circumstances of each case, could properly be characterized as an independent, third-party provider or as an assignee asserting a derivative claim for ERISA benefits. Accordingly, we take this opportunity to clarify the scope of <em>Memorial </em>in light of <em>Hermann I </em>and <em>Hermann II </em>and conclude that the cases are consistent with another.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">In <em>Hermann I, </em>845 F.2d 1286, Hermann Hospital provided a patient medical services after Hermann was informed by MEBA (the insurance company) that the patient was covered by a health plan governed by ERISA. The patient, who had died, assigned her rights to the benefits of the health plan to Hermann. MEBA neither declined nor tendered payment, but told Hermann that the claim was being \u201cinvestigated.\u201d Hermann then filed suit, alleging state-law causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, equitable estoppel, breach of contract, and fraud. Hermann did not assert violations of Texas\u2019s Insurance Code. We held that Hermann\u2019s claims were preempted by ERISA. <em>Id. </em>at 1290. An important element of our holding in <em>Hermann I </em>was our reading of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987) and <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, </em>481 U.S. 58, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987). These cases, we reasoned, stood for the proposition that where a claim relates. to an employee benefit plan governed by ERISA and are \u201cbased upon state law of general application <em>and not a law regulating insurance,\u201d </em>that state-law cause of action is preempted by ERISA. <em>Hermann I, </em>845 F.2d at 1290.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">In <em>Hermann II, </em>959 F.2d 569, we did nothing more than hold that our preemption determination in <em>Hermann I </em>was the law of the case in <em>Hermann II. Id. </em>at 578. Accordingly, <em>Hermann II </em>adds nothing to our understanding of ERISA preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">However, we did clarify the meaning of <em>Hermann I </em>in <em>Memorial. </em>In footnote 20, we distinguished <em>Hermann I </em>on the ground that \u201cthe hospital was aggrieved over a plan\u2019s delay in processing its claim and was seeking recovery of plan benefits allegedly owed to its assignor.\u201d 904 F.2d at 249 n. 20. We further suggested that <em>Hermann I </em>did not control the situation faced by Memorial Hospital because the claims in <em>Hermann I </em>were \u201cdependent on, and derived from, the rights of the plan beneficiaries to recover benefits under the terms of the plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Stated differently, Hermann Hospital was not an independent, third-party provider of medical services, but rather more akin to a first-party beneficiary whose causes of action are normally preempted by ERISA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because <em>Her-mann I </em>was decided before <em>Memorial, Her-mann II </em>did not discuss ERISA preemption, and because we have never questioned the holding or analytical underpinnings of <em>Memorial, </em>our understanding of <em>Hermann I </em>as expressed in <em>Memorial </em>is the law of this Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">As such, the difference between <em>Hermann I </em>and <em>Memorial </em>has nothing to do with the bare existence of an ERISA plan. Rather, the proper inquiry is whether the beneficiary under the ERISA plan was covered at all by the terms of the health care policy, because if the beneficiary was not, the provider of health services acts as an independent, third party subject to our holding in <em>Memorial. </em>This is no doubt what our district courts have understood <em>Memorial </em>to mean.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>III. Application of <em>Memorial </em>to Cypress\u2019s State-Law Cause of Action for Misrepresentation</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Pan-American and National argue that <em>Memorial </em>does not control this case because in its pleadings, Cypress admitted that it was inquiring about the extent rather than the existence of coverage for Schwartz. In addition, Pan-American and National argue that because an ERISA plan was in place and Schwartz was enrolled in the plan, Cypress\u2019s state-law claim should be preempted by ERISA</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The defendants\u2019 position is unavailing because Schwartz, although enrolled in the plan, was not covered by the health care plan insured by Pan-American and National. It is undisputed that National refused to pay Cypress because \u201ccoverage [was] rescinded as of [the] effective date.\u201d Admittedly, because no discovery took place in this case, the record is unclear as to the meaning of this phrase. Nor does the record reveal the precise reasons behind National\u2019s refusal to pay for Schwartz\u2019s services. Nonetheless, Cypress has asserted, and the defendants do not dispute, that coverage was denied because Schwartz was not covered by the health plan. Indeed, neither National, Pan-American, nor the record suggest that \u201ccoverage rescinded\u201d means anything else than Schwartz was not covered by the plan at the time of his hospitalization. As such, Cypress\u2019s cause of action does not relate to ERISA, but rather arises under state law. <em>Memorial </em>is therefore triggered. Cypress\u2019s state-law claim under \u00a7 21.21 for misrepresentation is not preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Finally, the district court\u2019s reasoning is of no help to the defendants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we have pointed out, the district court concluded that for ERISA purposes, third-party providers such as Cypress are on no better footing than first-party beneficiaries. We rejected that premise in <em>Memorial, </em>where we reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">We have held under different circumstances that ERISA preemption may occur even though ERISA itself could not offer an aggrieved employee a remedy for alleged misrepresentations. <em>That principle should not be extended, however, to encompass third-party providers, particularly when to do so would run counter to one of Congress\u2019s overriding purposes in enacting ERISA</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">904 F.2d at 248 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). The district court\u2019s reasoning to the contrary is foreclosed by <em>Memorial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">Because the district court erroneously determined that Cypress\u2019s state-law cause of action for violating \u00a7 21.21 of Texas\u2019s Insurance Code was preempted by ERISA, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s decision. In addition, the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear this case was based on the federal question presented by ERISA preemption, and because we hold that ERISA is not implicated, we REMAND this case to the district court with directions to remand Cypress\u2019s \u00a7 21.21 claim to Texas state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-13\">. The meaning of this phrase is not altogether clear. Nor does the record reveal the precise reasons for National\u2019s denial of coverage. For our purposes, however, Cypress has claimed, and the defendants appear to agree, that National denied coverage because Schwartz was not covered at all under the ERISA plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b358-6\">. The defendants erroneously cited to page 256 of <em>Memorial. </em>Because our opinion in <em>Memorial </em>does not extend to page 256, we assume that the defendants are directing our attention to page 246, which allegedly contains language that supports the defendants' position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b358-12\">.
