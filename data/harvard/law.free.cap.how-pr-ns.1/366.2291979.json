Church on the 4th day of February, 1884, at the city of Troy in this county was a public officer, to wit, chamberlain of the city of Troy (the city of Troy then and there being a municipal corporation duly organized under the laws of this state) having theretofore been duly appointed as such chamberlain, and having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>qualified as such and entered upon the discharge of the duties of said office. That as such chamberlain the said Henry S. Church was intrusted to receive all state, county and city taxes and assessments, taxed or assessed upon real or personal estate in said city of Troy, also to collect and receive all claims due the city of Troy from any other source, and being so intrusted as aforesaid, the said Henry S. Church, by virtue of his said office of chamberlain of the city of Troy, then and there did receive and take into his possession divers amounts of money being in payment of certain state, county and city taxes and assessments that had been taxed or assessed upon real and personal estate in said city of Troy, and of claims due the city of Troy from other sources, exceeding in value and amount the sum of $6,000 (a more accurate description of which cannot now be given) for and on account of the city of Troy, as chamberlain or treasurer of said city. That the said Henry S. Church, on the day and year last aforesaid, at the city and county aforesaid, fraudulently and feloniously did take, make away with and secrete, with intent to deprive the true owner of said money, to wit, the city of Troy, of the use and benefit thereof and to convert and appropriate the same to his own use without the consent of the said city of Troy, and did fraudulently and feloniously convert and appropriate to his own use divers promissory notes for the payment of money, the same being then and there due and unsatisfied, and of a kind known as Hnited States treasury notes, of a number and denomination to the said grand jury unknown, and a more accurate description of which cannot now be given, of the value of $6,000. Divers promissory notes for the payment of money, the same being then and there due and unsatisfied, and of a kind known as national bank notes, of a number and denomination to the said grand jury unknown, and a more accurate description of which cannot now be given, of the value of $6,000. Of the goods, chattels, personal property and money of the city of Troy which had come into his possession and under his control by virtue of his being such public officer, to wit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>chamberlain of the city of Troy- as aforesaid, against the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the. peace of the people of the state of New York and their dignity.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-5\"><em>Warren, Patterson &amp; </em>Gamble, for defendant, urged the following points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-6\">I. That it must appear from the evidence that the defendant was chamberlain of the city of Troy <em>de jure; </em>that he was <em>defaeto </em>is not enough.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-7\">H. That it was improper to indict the defendant under section 528 of the Penal Code, that the indictment should have been if at all under section 470.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-8\">III. That the offense of converting public moneys by the chamberlain was provided for by the charter of the city of Troy, passed March 23,1872 <em>(chap. </em>129, <em>Laws </em>o/T872, y&gt;. 304, <em>sec. </em>20); and this act being special and passed before the Penal Code went into effect under section 725 of the Penal Code stands unrepealed, and the indictment should have been based on that statute.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-9\"><em>Samuel Hand </em>and <em>La Mott W. Rhodes, </em>district-attorney, for people.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Nott, county judge, in overruling these points, said, whether the defendant was chamberlain <em>de jure </em>or <em>de facto </em>was unimportant. He was liable to indictment if he assumed to perform the duties of the office under color of title. Bishop says: \u201c In the actual affairs of government a man sometimes holds an office to which he has not been duly appointed. But if he does the duties of it under color of title, he is called an officer <em>de facto, </em>and his official acts are binding on third persons though they are said not to be valid in his own favor. One duly appointed and commissioned, serving in the office, is called an officer <em>de jure. </em>Now, clearly, a,n officer <em>de facto </em>indicted for malfeasance in office cannot object that he is not such <em>dejwre, </em>because his acting in the office estops him to deny his right to it. And he is an officer liable to punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ment within the statute against embezzlement (1 <em>Bish. on Crim. Law, seoc. </em>464 <em>[,th ed.], and numerous oases </em>cited/ <em>also, </em>2 <em>Bish. on Crim. Law, sec. </em>392).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">With respect to the other points the judge said he thought the district attorney might have framed the indictment under either section 470 or section 528. An illegal act frequently offends against the provisions of two or more statutes, and a prosecution under any one of them is proper <em>(Com. </em>agt. <em>McConnell, </em>11 <em>Gray, </em>204; <em>Com. </em>agt. <em>Trickey, </em>13 <em>Allen, </em>559; 1 <em>Bish. on Crim. Law [7th ed.], </em>778). \u2022 There is, however, a marked distinction between the two sections. Under section 528 the important element of the offense consists in \u201c the intent to deprive or defraud the true owner of his property,\u201d which is distinctly alleged in the pending indictment. Section 470 does not require any such intent to exist in the mind of the defaulting official when he is appropriating public moneys intrusted to him. More must be proven against the defendant to convict him under the pending indictment, than if on trial for an offense under section 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">It was not necessary to follow the charter of the city as it could not have been intended to have it interfere with the general statute of the state, and full effect may be given to the charter provision without trenching upon the statute, making certain acts, like the.present charge of the city chamberlain, felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The case was given to the jury\u2014there was a disagreement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
