I see no reason why a petition for <em>revoking </em>probate should in this respect differ essentially from an answer to a petition <em>granting </em>probate. There are obviously many cases in which the surrogate, in the just exercise of the discretionary authority conferred upon him by section 2533, would not only permit, but would feel bound to require a petitioner or objector to make a full and detailed statement of the facts and circumstances upon which his claim or defense might depend. But, in general, a probate proceeding is of such a character that its issues may be clearly and distinctly presented, without resort to any such particularity of detail as appears in the petition for revocation which is here attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The averments that the moving party seeks to eliminate from the petition concern circumstances and occurrences that must rather be regarded as matters of evidence bearing upon the issues to be tried than as necessary allegations making or attending such issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The whole case is presented in sufficient detail by such portions of the petition as have not been objected to.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The remaining portions must, therefore, be stricken out, but with the exceptions following:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The clause beginning with the words \u201c that in the summer of 1880,\u201d and ending with the word \u201c Simmons,\u201d may remain, and so, too, may the clause commencing with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>words \u201c that your petitioner,\u201d and ending with the words and figures \u201c the 28th day of September, 1883.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Let an order be entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
