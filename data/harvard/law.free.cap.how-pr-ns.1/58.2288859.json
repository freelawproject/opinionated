To the former he gave by his will the rents, interest; &amp;c., of all his estate, real and personal, subject to certain qualifications not necessary to be here indicated. He provided that, in case she should remarry, the estate should be converted into money, whereof she should receive one-third and his son <em>two-thirds; </em>in case she should remain his widow during her life, he directed that, upon her death, the residue of the estate should go to his son Aaron, if living, and, if not, to such of Aaron\u2019s lawful children as might be then alive.</p>\n<p id=\"AcS\">The testator\u2019s widow is now 73 years of age. His son Aaron lately died, leaving him surviving his wife Emma (since married and now Mrs. Morrison) and two children, minors then and still, of whom their mother is guardian. As such guardian she asks to be appointed administratrix c. <em>t. a. </em>of this estate, which, because of the death of one of the executors and the resignation of the other, is now without any legal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">The testator\u2019s widow has herself renounced any claim to letters, but she opposes Mrs. Morrison\u2019s application upon grounds which would strongly appeal to my discretion if I were at liberty to exercise it. It has been repeatedly held, however, by our courts, that letters of administration must be granted to an applicant who is preferentially entitled under the statute, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>be is disqualified for some cause that tbe statute specifies <em>(O'Brien </em>agt. <em>Neubert, 3 Dem., </em>156; <em>Coope </em>agt. Lowerre, 1 <em>Barb. Ch., </em>45; <em>McMahon </em>agt Harrison, <em>6 N. Y., </em>443; <em>McGregor </em>agt. McGregor, 1 Keyes, 133; Emerson v. Bowers, 14 <em>N. Y., </em>449).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">In the case at bar Mrs. Morrison, as guardian of her children, who are legatees under their grandfather\u2019s will, is clearly entitled to letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">It is provided by section 2643 of the Code of Civil Procedure that, upon due application, the surrogate \u201c <em>must </em>\u201d grant administration as follows: 1st, to one or more of the residuary legatees, and 2d, to one or more of tbe principal or specific legatees \u201c who are qualified to act as administrators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">By section 33, title 2, chapter 6, part 2, Revised Statutes (3 <em>Banks [7th </em>ed], 2291), it is declared that, \u201cif any person who would otherwise be entitled to letters of administration with the will annexed, as residuary or specific legatee, shall be a minor, such letters shall be granted to his guardian, being in all respects competent, in preference to creditors or other persons.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
