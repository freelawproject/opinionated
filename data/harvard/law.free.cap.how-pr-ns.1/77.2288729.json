Dart, 26 <em>Hun, </em>24). The fact that the assignee does not actually reside in the \u25a0 state does not of itself furnish proof of fraudulent intent The preference of the notes mentioned in the moving papers does not render the assignment void upon its face. A liability may exist because of those notes, and until it is shown that no* liability does in fact exist, no fraud can be assumed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
