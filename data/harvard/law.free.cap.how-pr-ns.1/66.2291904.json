The Bushwick Railroad Company, respondent.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b92-9\"><em>New </em>trial\u2014 <em>When should he granted in action for negligence.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b92-10\">Where a passenger upon a street car, subsequently to alighting, was pulled down by the conductor\u2019s holding on to him after starting the car:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b92-11\"><em>Held, </em>that he had a good cause of action against the railroad for the injuries sustained.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b92-12\">If a charge to the jury in mentioning the facts of a transaction as narrated by the defendant\u2019s witnesses makes a remark which, though correct as applied to the defendant\u2019s version, applies also to the plaintiff\u2019s version, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>and tends to cut him o2 from a recovery, it is error for which a new trial should he granted.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b93-6\"><em>General </em>Term, December, 1884.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b93-7\"><em>Before </em>McCue, <em>Gh. J., and </em>Reynolds, <em>J,</em></p>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-8\">This suit was to recover for personal injuries received after the plaintiff, a man eighty-three years old and a passenger, had gotten down on the ground from defendant\u2019s horse car, in consequence of the conductor\u2019s holding on to his coat after starting the car, which precipitated the plaintiff to the pavement, breaking his hip. The defendant\u2019s witnesses testified that he fell after the car had passed on, and after the conductor had ceased to hold on to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-9\">The court, in the course of the charge, said: \u201c It is unnecessary for me to tell you that if he fell after he had alighted from the car, after he had both feet on the ground, then he cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted to the last clause. A verdict was rendered for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed from the judgment and order denying a motion for a new trial on the minutes.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b93-11\"><em>Henderson </em>Benedict, for appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-12\">I. Defendants were unquestionably responsible for the injury as narrated by the plaintiff; for the rule relieving masters from liability for malicious injuries inflicted by servants outside the scope of employment does not apply between a common carrier and its passengers, as it undertakes to protect them against any injury arising from the malice or negligence of its servants <em>(Stewart </em>agt. <em>Brooklyn City R. R., </em>90 <em>N. Y., </em>588).</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-13\">II. Even under the general principle the defendants ctiuld not escape, for it is settled that if a servant in performing an act within his authority proceeds beyond his master\u2019s instructions and inflicts willful, malicious or reckless injury, his master is liable, and no proof is necessary of express authority to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the act if it was one (as in the present instance) implied from the nature of his position, as daily exercised under common observation <em>(Hoffman </em>agt. <em>N. Y. C. R., </em>87 <em>N. Y., </em>25 ; <em>Roods </em>agt. <em>D. L. </em>&amp; <em>W. R., </em>64 <em>id., </em>129; <em>Cohen </em>agt. <em>D. D. E. L. R., </em>69 <em>id., </em>170; <em>Mott </em>agt. <em>Consumers\u2019 lce Co., </em>73 <em>id., </em>543; <em>Shea </em>agt. <em>Sixth Ave. R., </em>62 <em>id., </em>180; <em>Higgins </em>agt. <em>W. T. C. Co., </em>46 <em>id., </em>234; <em>Jackson </em>agt. <em>Second Ave. R., </em>47 <em>id., </em>274).</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-5\">III. Nothing except an express withdrawal of this erroneous instruction with a direction to disregard it, accompanied by a statement of the correct principle could have remedied it ( <em>Walton </em>agt. <em>Wise, </em>47 <em>Supr. Ct. [J. &amp; </em>S.], 512; <em>Chapman </em>agt. <em>Erie R., </em>55 <em>N. Y., </em>579; <em>Knupple </em>agt. <em>Knickerbocker Ice Co., </em>84 <em>id., </em>488; <em>Mevey </em>agt. <em>Clar, </em>45 <em>id., </em>285; <em>Avery </em>agt. <em>City of Syracuse, </em>29 <em>Hun, </em>540; <em>Canfield </em>agt. <em>Baltimore O. R., 46 Supr. Ct. [J. &amp; </em>S.], 238).</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-6\">IY. It was essential to except only, and not ask the question submitted to the jury to preserve the plaintiff\u2019s rights <em>(Allis </em>agt. <em>Leonard, </em>58 <em>N. Y., </em>288; <em>Avery </em>agt. <em>City of Syracuse, supra).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-7\">Y. It was unnecessary to specify the grounds of exception or suggest an amendment to the charge <em>(Friend </em>agt. <em>Paten, </em>10 <em>Abb. N. C., </em>311; <em>Goldman </em>agt. <em>Abram, </em>9 <em>Daly, </em>235).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-8\"><em>T. S. Moore, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b94-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">According to the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony, corroborated more or less, by some of his witnesses, the conductor kept hold of him after he had got upon the ground and after the car had started, and by this means dragged him down thereby causing the injury. The evidence of the defendant was in substance that after the plaintiff had alighted and was clear of the car and the conductor, he fell through some misadventure of his own. It was probably in view of this evidence on behalf of the defendant that the trial judge remarked in the course of the charge: \u201c It is unnecessary for me to tell you that if he fell after he alighted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the car, after he had both feet on the ground, then he cannot recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">This instruction was perfectly correct as applied to the fall as described by defendant\u2019s witnesses, but the difficulty is that it applied also to the plaintiff\u2019s narration of the occurrence, and thus cut him off from all chance of recovery. If the jury believed his statement we think they might well have found a verdict in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">For this reason the judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted, costs of appeal to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
