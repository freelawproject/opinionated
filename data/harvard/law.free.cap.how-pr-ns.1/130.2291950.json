The ground of the motion was that the plaintiff was a non-resident and Kings \u2022county was the proper county. JSTo demand was served.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-13\"><em>Oswald Prentiss Backus, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-14\"><em>W.

We think this was a misapprehension of the provisions of the Code relative to applications kindred to this. The section already mentioned declares that the application may be made by an order at any time after the joinder of an issue of fact and before the trial thereof, and does not require in express terms or by implication that any demand should be made for a change of place of trial prior to the notice of application. Whether the order should be granted or not is purely a matter of discretion <em>(Cornell </em>agt. <em>Evans, </em>7 <em>Hun, </em>299).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">It seems that the learned justice in the court below did not examine the case upon its merits, and, therefore, the element of discretion was not called into requisition. For these reasons we think that the order should be reversed with leave to renew the motion on its merits. It is proper to suggest that in this and all similar applications something more is required to be shown than the mere fact that the defendant is not a resident of the county where the action is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Order reversed, with ten dollars costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
