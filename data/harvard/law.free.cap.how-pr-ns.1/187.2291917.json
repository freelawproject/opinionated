This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>balance could have been sued for in a justice\u2019s court, and hence the defendant is entitled to the costs, the plaintiff\u2019s recovery being under fifty dollars. <em>Montagu on Set-offs (p. </em>1), published in 1806, says: \u201c When there are opposite demands between two persons, and the accounts are connected by originating in the same transaction, the balance is the debt, and is the sum recoverable by suit.\u201d And on page five he adds this note: \u201c <em>Barker </em>agt. <em>Braham </em>(2 <em>Blackst., </em>869 ; 3 <em>Wils., </em>396 ; <em>H. T., </em>13 <em>G., </em>111, <em>appendix </em>8), Blackstone, J., says, \u00a3 the courts have been gradually extending this equitable remedy. In the outset of a suit they compel the plaintiff to make a set-off in the affidavit to hold to bail, and will not suffer him to swear to only one side of the account.\u2019 \u201d The verdict found by the jury was for the balance due in this case, and if the plaintiff had given the defendant the proper credit, instead of suing on \u201c one side of the account \u201d only, his attorney would probably have selected the \u201cjustices\u2019 court \u201d as the proper tribunal in which to bring this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Under the circumstances the order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
