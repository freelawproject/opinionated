He alleged that he received no goods from plaintiff, but that all his dealings were with Richard Donovan, plaintiff\u2019s father, upon an agreement by which the latter was to consign sheep and lambs to defendant to be sold on commission; that under the custom of commission merchants in his line of business, he accounted to his consignee every Saturday, giving his individual check for the amount of sales, irrespective.of his having realized the proceeds, and dating the cheeks ahead for his accommodation; that lie gave his checks, after January, 1883, to the order of plaintiff, at the request of Richard Donovan; that <em>on </em>April 4, 1885, ho gave his chock (post dated April 8, 1885) to plaintiff\u2019s order for $913.26, in full of sales since the previous Saturday, which check was paid; that between April sixth and ninth lie received sheep and lambs alleged, which lie sold partly for cash, but mostly on terms of credit as theretofore; that on April ninth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>be made an assignment for tbe benefit of \u25a0 creditors, because he could not meet his check given to one Odenheimer, due April ninth, for $3,423, owing to his failing to realize on sales made by him, including those made for plaintiff, or itichard Donovan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-5\">The motion to vacate the order of arrest was denied. The judge, at special term, in his opinion, considered the question presented by the pleadings and affidavits, viz., whether the fiduciary relation existed between the plaintiff and defendant, or whether the defendant was authorized to mingle the money collected with his own, and so became a mere debtor to plaintiff for the amount due; but the judge would not decide the question, deeming it a proper one for the jury on the trial of the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-6\">The order denying the motion to vacate the order of arrest was affirmed at the general term of the city court, the opinion rendered stating that the cause of action and the cause of arrest are identical; that the complaint alleged that defendant received plaintiff\u2019s moneys in a fiduciary capacity; that in this view of the case the order of arrest should not be vacated at special term, except upon evidence so clear as to leave no possible doubt in the mind of the court upon the questions presented ; that this is not such a case, and even assuming that the order of arrest was granted upon extrinsic facts, the justice at special term was correct in refusing to vacate, and for these reasons and the grounds stated in the opinion of the special term the order must be affirmed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b129-7\"><em>Horace Secor, </em>for appellant</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b129-8\"><em>Joseph G.

F Daly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuT\">The complaint alleged a cause of action upon contract. The allegation of conversion of the proceeds of sale was mere surplusage. On the trial such allegation will be disregarded and plaintiff allowed to recover upon contract <em>(Conaughty </em>agt. <em>Nichols, </em>42 <em>N. Y., </em>83). Even if the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>alleged that tbe defendant received tbe proceeds in a fiduciary capacity, no proof of that allegation would be essential to plaintiff\u2019s recovery; a ground of arrest, based upon a claim that defendant acted in-a fiduciary capacity, is extrinsic to the cause of action. It is not necessary to make such an allegation in tbe complaint in order to sustain an order of arrest Where such allegation is contained in tbe complaint, but no order of arrest has been granted, tbe defendant, would not be subject to execution against tbe person <em>(Segelken </em>agt. <em>Meyer, </em>94 <em>N. Y., </em>473).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">It follows from these authorities that tbe cause of action here and tbe cause of arrest are not identical, and that tbe jury, upon tbe trial of this action, will not have to pass upon tbe questions which are involved in tbe arrest of defendant. It was tbe duty of tbe court to decide upon the pleadings and affidavits whether tbe relation between plaintiff and defendant was one of personal trust and confidence in tbe latter, or that of consignee and commission merchant, as alleged in tbe answer <em>(Feuntes </em>agt. <em>Mayorga, </em>7 <em>Daly, </em>103). And see on this subject <em>Merrill </em>agt. <em>Thomas, </em>7 <em>Daly, </em>395; <em>Clark </em>agt. <em>Pinckney, </em>50 <em>Barb., </em>226; <em>Duguid </em>agt. <em>Edwards, id., </em>288; <em>Sutton </em>agt. <em>De Camp, 4 Abb. (N. S.), </em>483; <em>Stoll </em>agt. <em>King, 8 How. Pr., </em>298.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The city court did not examine tbe question presented by tbe affidavits in tbe light of this duty, but referred it to tbe jury on tbe trial. This is tbe express decision of tbe special term; and tbe general term, while it does state that \u201cassuming that tbe order of arrest was granted on extrinsic facts, we are of opinion that tbe justice was correct in refusing to vacate,\u201d finally concludes that, for these reasons and \u201c upon tbe ground stated in the opinion of tbe court at special term,\u201d tbe order must be affirmed. This puts tbe affirmance upon tbe ground that in tbe language of tbe special term opinion \u201c the jury will be called upon to weigh and determine when tbe cause is tried \u201d tbe question of right to arrest, \u201c which cannot be intelligently decided in tbe present instance in advance of tbe trial.\" Under tbe decision in <em>Segelken </em>agt. <em>Meyer, </em>above cited, this view appears to be erroneous, and the.order should be reversed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the end that the motion to vacate the order of arrest may be heard upon its merits. ,</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b131-4\">Van Hoesen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AbL\">This action is not for the conversion of personal property, and an order of arrest could not be granted under section 549. The action is for money had -and received by a factor, and the only authority for an order of arrest is the third subdivision of section 550. The facts authorizing an arrest should not be set out in the complaint, nor is proof of them within the issues that the jury are to try. A jury could never, therefore, pass upon the question which chief justice McAdam said, in his opinion, he would leave to them for decision. The question is not to be decided by a jury, but by a judge at the special term, and therefore I concur with judge J. P. Daly in reversing the order.</p>\n<author id=\"b131-5\">Larremore, <em>P. </em>J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad1x\">The order is one affecting a substantial right, and is properly appealable within subdivision 3, section 3191 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The facts alleged in the complaint establish an action for conversion, the plaintiff claiming the identical proceeds realized from the property to be sold. That the prayer of the complaint demands a money judgment in no way changes the foim of the action <em>(Trunninger </em>agt. Busch, 7 Daly, 124; <em>King </em>agt. Arnold, 84 <em>N. Y., </em>668; <em>Greentree </em>agt. Rosenstock, 61 <em>id., </em>583). It is true that the answering affidavits used upon the motion to vacate the order of arrest' show that the transaction between the parties was one <em>ex contractu, </em>but the facts alleged in the complaint (as before stated) characterize the transaction, and the plaintiff must stand or fall upon their proof, as alleged in his complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
