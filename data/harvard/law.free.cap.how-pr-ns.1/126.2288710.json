All these questions were properly presented ter the jury as questions of fact, and their finding in defendant\u2019s favor is conclusive as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">We are of opinion from axi examination of the evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the jury could not well have found otherwise, as the proof was ample.</p>\n<p id=\"A2Uh\">The question that remains is whether these grievances were an obstruction to the beneficial enjoyment of the premises. <em>We </em>think they were. Apartment houses, represented to contain upon one floor all the conveniences of the usual and ordinary dwelling houses, are assumed to be constructed in a manner calculated to conduce to the comfort and enjoyment oi the inmates in the same manner as the more commodious dwelling houses, and the existence of any such unlooked for discomforts as shown to have existed here, seriously interfering with and affecting the tenant\u2019s beneficial enjoyment of the demised premises, would justify the tenant\u2019s abandonment and amount to a constructive eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"AHc\">A careful examination of the record discloses no error committed in the reception or rejection of evidence warranting interference with the verdict, nor do we find any objectional matter in the learned judge\u2019s charge to the jury, which on the whole we deem as favorable to the plaintiff as circumstances permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to respondent</p>\n<judges id=\"b156-7\">Hall and Hawes, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
