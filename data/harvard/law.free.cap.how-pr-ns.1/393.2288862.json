Thomas, </em>and <em>George Thomas </em>agt. <em>John C. Bennett </em>(56 <em>Barb., </em>197), which was brought in a justice\u2019s court by the general guardian in his own name, without the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem. </em>The county court of Onondaga and the general term of that county, affirming the judgment April 7, ,1868,^Poster, Morgan and Mullen being the judges, and Foster, J., delivering the opniion of the court. The suit was about pension money to be paid by the United States government to the- infants. Their general guardian employed the defendant to collect it for them, and he claimed he had forwarded it to them by mail. The plaintiff simply sued as guardian, and was allowed to amend by inserting the word \u201cgeneral\u201d before the word \u201cguardian.\u201d The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground the general guardian had no capacity to sue, and that a guardian <em>ad litem </em>must be appointed before the issuing of process, which was denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-9\">The only question raised on appeal was, whether the general guardian appointed by the surrogate could maintain the action in his own name as general guardian. The learned judge ad\u2022mits a guardian in socage could not sue about the personalty. Me describes the powers of a testamentary guardian from Revised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Statutes, part 2 <em>(1B. </em>8,150, <em>sec. </em>8), and those appointed by a surrogate, and argues that there is no reason why such guardians, haying charge of the personalty, should not have the right to sue' for it. He thinks the legislature intended, by the loose language, to give general guardians the same rights to sue about the personalty that testamentary guardians have to sue about the realty..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-5\">He then admits that a general guardian cannot bring a suit in his own name against personal representatives of an estate, to compel payment over to him of his ward\u2019s share, but he says that is because <em>the share </em>has not been ascertained; they must be called to account first. The learned judge\u2019s attention was not called to the cases of <em>Hoyt </em>agt <em>Hilton </em>(2 <em>Ed. </em>Gh., 202), or <em>Bradley </em>agt <em>Amidon </em>(10 Paige, 237), or many others, where suits brought to recover the <em>shares </em>of infants were dismissed, because of the general guardian had no right to sue, and not because -the shares had not been ascertained, or because the personal representatives cannot be reached in that way. The learned judge then says: Section 3 of 1 Eevised Statutes 150, received judicial construction <em>mWhite </em>agt. <em>Parker </em>(8 <em>Barb., </em>52), entirely ignoring part 3, chapter 8, title 2, page 731 of the Eevised Statutes, <em>\u201cProceedings by and against </em>Infants.,\u201d as if not knowing such a statute law existed, and that the question was determined by it, and not by 1 Eevised Statutes, section 3, page 150.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-6\">The learned judge also cites <em>Genet </em>agt. <em>Tabnadge </em>(1 <em>Johns. Gh., </em>5), that the general guardian is entitled to the possession and care of the personalty. This is not disputed, but it gives him no right to sue for it, as of course. The infants are wards-of the court</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-7\">The court has supervision over general guardians, and when there is a cause of action about the ward\u2019s property, the general guardian, or any other person, must apply to the court, and it will determine whether he is a proper person to be appointed to bring suit, and prosecute it, for its ward. The learned judge further said, \u201c the powers and duties of guardians is analogous to executors.\u201d Be that so, the legislature has expressly given to executors the right to sue about the personalty; it has not done so with general guardians; on the contrary, it had always enacted: special directions about suits in relation to infants\u2019 property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Part 3, chapter 8, titles 2, 3, Revised Statutes <em>(5th ed., p. </em>745), -original paging 446, 447, 3 Revised Statutes <em>(6th ed., p. </em>731). \u25a0Section 471 <em>(Old Gods) </em>superseded part of the above, and the two sections in the fifth edition were supposed to remain unaffected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-5\">In the sixth edition of the Revised Statutes, page 731, there are three sections, instead of two, as in the fifth edition. The two sections in the fifth edition are sections 1 and 3. Section 2 -of the sixth edition is not in the fifth edition</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-6\">The learned judge also cites cases that committees of the estates of lunatics and habitual drunkards could sue in their own names, and reasons, therefore, general guardians can do so, his attention not being called to the fact that by Laws of 1845 <em>\u2022(sec. </em>2, <em>p. </em>95) these committees were specially authorized and \u2022empowered to do so. No statute or law, however, can be found that general guardians <em>ever </em>had such authority or power,; on \"the contrary, because there never was any, the court of chancery, the supreme court and all other courts, and the Codes of Procedure, have always 'required a guardian <em>ad litem </em>to be appointed about infants\u2019 rights and personal property, and it was &gt;not obligatory, but only discretionary, whether the general guardian was appointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-7\">The rights and property of infants were never the rights and .property of the general guardian. The latter is only entitled to the <em>possession </em>and <em>care </em>of the personalty, but the personalty -and right are the property of, and belong to, the infant, and must be sued for in his own name and not in the name of the general guardian,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-8\">III. In <em>Segelken </em>agt. <em>Meyer </em>(14 <em>Him, </em>593), 2 Revised Statutes, 150, section 3, was again cited, and 2 Revised Statutes, 446, sections 1, 2 and 3 not alluded to. Judge Gilbert therefore, said, \u2018thinking a general guardian could sue as well as a guardian <em>ad litem: </em>\u201c Such right of action rests upon his duty to take the control and management of the infant\u2019s personal estate.\u201d He continues, however: \u201cThe legal title to the moneys in controversy is vested in the infant, and his general guardian is merely his bailiff or trustee. As the moneys belong to the infant, I see \u2022no objection to the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>to sue \u2022for the recovery in a proper case,\u201d and then he cites <em>Thomas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>agt. <em>Bennett </em>(56 <em>Barb., </em>197), saying: \u201c The only question heretofore has been, whether the general guardian could maintain an action to recover debts due the infants, and although that question has been set at rest, the converse one respecting the-right of the infant by guardian <em>ad litem,to </em>maintain such an action has not, to my knowledge, been authoritively denied. The infant having a right to sue on the ground of his general property, it must be done by a guardian <em>ad litem (Code of Giv. Pro., secs. </em>468, 469), who may, in some cases, be appointed on the application of the general or testamentary guardian. Section 476 also recognizes an appointment of the general guardian as guardian <em>ad litem (Shoul Bom. Bel, </em>592, <em>etseq., and authorities cited).\u2019'</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-4\">The same case is reported in 22 <em>Hun, </em>6, where the general term reiterates the action was properly brought in the name of the infant by guardian <em>ad litem. </em>It is also reported on appeal in 94 <em>N. Y., </em>473. The suit being brought by the guardian <em>ad' litem, </em>the point was taken it ought to have been brought by the general guardian, the contract being in writing, made by the general guardian with the defendant <em>(see </em>478) on page 77. <em>Thomas</em>agt. <em>Bennett </em>(56 <em>-Barb., </em>197) is contrasted with <em>Bradley </em>agt. <em>Amidon </em>(10 <em>Paige, </em>235, 239) in favor of the latter. The court unanimously say, the property is in the infant and possession in the-general guardian, and that a suit brought in the name of the infant by guardian <em>ad litem </em>is not improper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-5\">IY.

It was an action brought by the general guardian of infants to recover real estate, and it was held that their rights in such an action were enforcible by their mother as guardian in socage <em>(Id., </em>426).</p>\n<p id=\"AgM\">The case at bar is concerned with the assertion of the claim .of the infants, not to real estate, as to which alone a guardian in .socage could have represented them in an action, but only to personalty, and the case last cited throws, therefore, no light .on the present inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"Adsu\">In my opinion the necessity of clear and uniform practice \u25a0 under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure above referred to, requires that the rule should be recognized, that in cases such as that at bar, the actions should always be brought in the name of a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>properly appointed, and that if brought in the name of the general guardian they are not well brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">For these reasons this demurrer is sustained, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
