Upon the sale of the ore there was a deficiency, and on 21st March, 1882, a balance of $290.56 was ascertained to be due from this company to plaintiffs. That defendant Dodge was a trustee of the company during 1881 and 1882 is conceded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-11\">In July, 1881, the trustees were Edward H. Woodward, Mrs. Pauline Woodward and defendant Dodge. A meeting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>was held July 12, 1881, and Mrs. Pauline Woodward presented her resignation as trustee, to take effect \u201c on the legal election of a fourth trustee.\u201d Her resignation was accepted.

The case was tried before Ernest H. Crosby, Esq., referee, who wrote the following opinion:</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-7\">Ernest H. Crosby, <em>Referee.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aaj\">\u2014 The counsel for the defendants Dodge and Pond maintains that as the defendant Woodward was not served with a summons, the plaintiffs cannot recover against the other defendants. This view might be correct if the action were brought on contract, but such is not the case. The cause of action is created by section 12 of the manufacturing act of 1848, as amended, for the recovery of a penalty, and the defendants\u2019 liability therefore arises <em>ex delicto. </em>The ordinary rules of actions in tort are applicable and non-joinder is no defense <em>(Strang </em>agt. Sproul, 4 <em>Daly, </em>326, reversed, <em>but not on this point). </em>The failure to serve the defendant Woodward is equivalent to his non-joinder as a defendant under section 456 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The complaint brings the action under the provision of section 12 of the act of 1848, as amended by chapter 510 of the Laws of 18J5. This section expressly makes the defendants \u201c jointly and <em>severally </em>liable.\u201d Hence the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ants are \u201c alleged to be severally liable,\u201d as required by section 456 of the Code, and the plaintiffs may proceed against the defendants Dodge and Pond, as if they were the only defendants named in the summons. The cases cited by the defendants\u2019 counsel on this point <em>(Dean </em>agt. Whiton, <em>&amp;c.), </em>do not bear upon the question. They arose under section 18 of the act of 1848, and the courts treated these actions as if they were brought on contract. There is no similarity between the liability imposed by section 12 and that imposed by section 18 of the manufacturing act. The former is <em>ex </em>delicto, and the latter is not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-5\">The only other point in the case calling for comment is the trusteeship of the defendant Pond. The election of Arthur T. Woodward as trustee was not legal, as there was no provision for a fourth trustee. The validity of Pond\u2019s election depends upon the resignation of his predecessor Pauline Woodward. Her resignation was \u201cto take effect after the legal election of the fourth trustee.\u201d Such \u201c legal election \u201d never took place, and the defendants\u2019 counsel contends that consequently she never ceased to be trustee, and there was no vacancy. A resignation signed by a woman must not be construed as rigidly as a more formal document. All the persons interested evidently believed that a fourth trustee, Arthur T. Woodward, had been legally elected. Pauline Woodward\u2019s resignation was accepted on this understanding. It does not appear that she ever claimed to be a trustee thereafter. On the contrary, Arthur T. Woodward and the three defendants were from that time trustees <em>defacto. </em>The condition precedent mentioned in Pauline Woodward\u2019s resignation had occurred according to her intention and that of her co-trustee, and they all seem to have acquiesced in Pond\u2019s election to fill her place. Her resignation and its acceptance consequently made an actual vacancy, and Pond became trustee <em>de jure. </em>In signing the petition of June 3, 1882, both Pond and Dodge acted as trustees, and this alone, without the other acts testified to, is enough to show that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>held, over after December 27, 1884, when their terms might have expired <em>(Van Amburgh </em>agt. <em>Baker, </em>81 <em>N. </em>Y., 46). The fact that they signed this petition appears from Mr. Dodge\u2019s testimony and does not depend upon the admission as an exhibit of the petition itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b294-5\">On appeal from the opinion of the referee,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-6\"><em>Dill db Chandler, </em>for the appellants made and argued the following points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-7\">I. The statute under which this action is brought is a penal statute and all presumptions are in favor of the defendants. Every fact necessary to establish the liability of a trustee in a suit brought under this act must be affirmatively proven by the plaintiff, even to and including those facts which can only be established by proof in the \u00a1negative ( <em>Whitney Arms Co. </em>agt. <em>Barlow, </em>68 <em>N. </em>Y., 37; <em>Bruce </em>agt. <em>Platt, </em>80 <em>N. </em>Y., 381; <em>Cameron </em>agt. <em>Seamen, </em>69 <em>N. </em>Y., 401).</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-8\">II. The action is in form against three trustees, only two are served. The appellant concedes that if the action had been brought against two alone of the trustees, and a joint and several judgment had been demanded in the complaint, under the authority of <em>Strang </em>agt. <em>Sprowl </em>(4 <em>Daly, </em>302), the plaintiff would be entitled to the judgment, but the principle of law claimed by the appellant is that when the statute gives a joint and several remedy the plaintiff, by bringing his action against all, elects to treat the liability as joint and waives his several remedy <em>(Dean </em>agt. <em>Whiton, </em>16 <em>Hun, </em>204; <em>Berries </em>agt. <em>Platt, </em>21 <em>Hun, </em>132). Section 456 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not include this action, because the plaintiff, by bringing his action against all the defendants, elected to take his joint remedy, waived his several remedy and did not allege the defendants to be severally liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-9\">III. The defendant was called as a witness for the plaintiff and asked to testify concerning his acts as trustee. His counsel asked the referee to instruct the witness that it was his privilege to refuse to testify as to his trusteeship on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>that his answer would tend to expose him to a penal liability. The referee held that the witness was only excused from answering questions which would tend to render him criminally liable. The defendant\u2019s liability under the complaint is penal <em>(Vernon </em>agt. <em>Palmer, </em>48 <em>Supr. Ct., </em>231; <em>Whitney Arms Co. </em>agt. Barlow, 68 <em>N. Y., </em>37, <em>and cases cited under point </em>I). The question of privity was duly raised and properly presented by the request of counsel for the witness (who was the defendant), and it was error on the part of the referee to refuse to so instruct <em>(The People </em>agt. Brown, 72 <em>N. Y., </em>571; <em>Close </em>agt. <em>Olney, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>319; <em>Taylor </em>agt. <em>Wood, </em>2 <em>Edw., </em>94; <em>Southart </em>agt. <em>Retchford, </em>6 <em>Cow., </em>252). The instruction as given by the referee was error. A witness is excused from giving an answer which will tend to expose him to a penalty or forfeiture <em>(Code of Givil Pro., sec. </em>837). This is the c\u00f3mmon-law rule and extends to everything in the nature of a penalty or forfeiture <em>(Livingstone </em>agt. <em>Tompkins, </em>4 Johns. <em>Ch., </em>415; <em>Henry </em>agt. <em>Salina Bank, </em>1 <em>N. Y., </em>83).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-5\"><em>Baldwin ds Blackmar, </em>for respondents, made and argued the following points;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-6\">I. Defendant Pond was a trustee <em>de facto, </em>and as such is liable under the act <em>(Denning </em>agt. <em>Puleston, </em>55 <em>N. Y., </em>655 ; <em>Reed </em>agt. <em>Keese, </em>60 <em>N. Y., </em>616).</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-7\">II. As to the referee\u2019s ruling that defendant Dodge, who was called as a witness, was only excused from answering questions which would tend to render him liable criminally, if the refusal so to instruct was error it was not such error as to justify a reversal, because the defendant Dodge was in no wise injured by it <em>(Cloyes </em>agt. <em>Thayer, </em>3 <em>Hill, </em>566; <em>Foote </em>agt. <em>Beecher, </em>78 <em>N. Y., </em>158; 2 <em>Gra. &amp; Wat. on New Trials, </em>634; <em>Forrest agt. Forrest, </em>25 <em>N. Y., </em>510; <em>Lamb </em>agt. <em>Camden and Amboy R. R. Co., </em>2 <em>Daly, </em>475; <em>Bennett </em>agt. <em>Austin, </em>5 <em>Hun, </em>538).</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-8\">III. The defendant claims that the plaintiff, not having succeeded in serving defendant Woodward, cannot proceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>against the defendants actually served. The rule which defendant relies on is one of contract liability. It is true that when defendants are jointly liable on contract all should be joined, and if jointly and severally liable each should be served separately or all jointly, and if all are joined and part served, judgment may be taken against all to be satisfied out of the property of those served. On the other hand, in actions of tort one or any number can be served in the same action, but judgment can be taken only against those served. This is not an action on contract but on tort <em>(Miller </em>agt. White, 50 <em>N. Y., </em>137; <em>Jones </em>agt. Barlow, 62 <em>N. Y., </em>202; <em>Strang </em>agt. <em>Sproul, </em>4 <em>Daly, </em>302; <em>Roberts </em>agt. Johnson, 58 <em>N. Y., </em>613; <em>Tingley </em>agt. <em>Walters, </em>2 <em>Sweeney, </em>175; <em>Stannard </em>agt. <em>Mattice, </em>7 <em>How., </em>4; <em>Code of Civil Pro., sec. </em>456). The non-joinder or non-service of one of the defendants is, therefore, no defense as to the others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-5\">IT.
