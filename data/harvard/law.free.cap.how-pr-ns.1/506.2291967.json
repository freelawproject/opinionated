If the legislature, as the appellant argues, in these amended sections, intended that the courts should have power to relieve the bail,' whenever the death of the defendant occurs, pending the suit against the bail, as was the case under section 191 of the former Code, it is presumed that they would have left the provision as it was, it being the part of wisdom to leave what is well enough alone; but they have recast the previous provision, and limited the right of the bail to be exonerated upon the death of the defendant to the case of his death before the expiration of the time to answer i\u00f1 the'action brought against the bail, and if any other construction is to be put upon the plain language of sections 600 and 6\u00d31 that responsibility must be assumed by the tribunal of final resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Larremore and Van Hoesen, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
