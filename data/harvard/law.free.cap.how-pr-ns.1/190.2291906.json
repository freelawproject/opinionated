The commissioners heard the testimony and made report, awarding to Thorne $3,500 and to the tenants $2,200. Motion for con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>firmation was denied by the court, with instruction to commissioners to make their report more specific. They convened and made another report, which the court refused to confirm, and directed the commissioners to ascertain and report other damages which the tenants would suffer in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-5\">The commissioners reconvened, further testimony was taken and they then awarded to Thorne $3,500, and to Hemingway <em>&amp; </em>Co. $9,397. No motion was made for confirmation of that award, but the petitioner made a motion on 27th June, 1883, for leave to discontinue and abandon the proceedings, and an order was made by the court discontinuing the proceedings, without prejudice to the right of the petitioner to change the line of its road, and directing it to pay the respondents \u201c their reasonable disbursements and counsel fees therein,\u201d and referred it to H. Y. Howland to hear the proofs and determine the amount of such disbursements and counsel fees, to be paid by the petitioner. The parties appeared before the referee, gave testimony, and he reported that the reasonable disbursements of Thorne were ....................... $40 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-6\">That those of Hemingway &amp; Go. were.......... 668 12</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-7\">That the reasonable counsel fees of Thorne were.. 700 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-8\">And those of Hemingway &amp; Go............... 1$ 000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-9\">Making together......................... $2?408 12</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-10\">which, in his opinion, the petitioner should be required to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-11\">At Monroe special term, January, 1884, an order was made denying the petitioner\u2019s motion to amend the order of June 27, 1883, so as to restrict the allowance to respondents to simply costs and disbursements, &amp;c. And the respondent\u2019s motion to confirm the referee\u2019s report was granted by order made at the same term. From the latter order this appeal is taken, and a purpose expressed in the notice of appeal to bring up for review the intermediate orders referred to.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-12\"><em>J. M. </em>Davy, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-13\"><em>Brown &lt;&amp; </em>Garfield, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Bradley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFQ\">On confirmation of report of commissioners appointed, pursuant to statute, to appraise the damages or compensation to owners, &amp;c., of land sought to be acquired by a railroad company for the purposes of its i oad, the rights of the parties became so fixed that the company could not discontinue or abandon the proceedings until the right was given by Laws of 1876, chapter 198 <em>(In re R. &amp; C. R. R. Co., </em>67 <em>N. Y., </em>242).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">At any stage of the proceeding, prior to such confirmation, the company might do so, but this right was not absolute. The proceeding was in the court, and subject to its control in so far that it might deny or defeat the purpose to discontinue, and make it dependent on such conditions as to the court seemed reasonable. Hence it was usual to apply to the court for leave <em>(In re Anthony </em>Street, 20 <em>Wendell, </em>618 ; <em>In re Commissioners Washington Park, </em>56 <em>N. Y., </em>144; <em>In re Waverly Water-Works, </em>85 <em>N. </em>Y., 478; <em>reversing </em>16 <em>Hun, </em>57).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The reason and the rule in that respect are applicable alike to special proceedings and actions <em>(Carleton </em>agt. <em>Darey, </em>75 <em>N. </em>Y., 375; <em>Salmon </em>agt. <em>Gedney, id. </em>482; <em>Brownell </em>agt. <em>Ruckman, </em>85 <em>N. </em>Y., 648). It follows that the motion was properly made by the company for leave to discontinue the proceeding, and it was within the legitimate power of the court in granting it to annex such terms to go with the favor as under the circumstances justice and fairness to the respondents required.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">To reimburse them for their reasonable and proper expenses in the proceeding was evidently the purpose of the court, and we cannot say that the order in that respect was not a fair exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The amount of the disbursements and counsel fees, as ascertained and reported by the referee, was a large per cent-age of the amount involved in the proceedings; but by the testimony taken by him it appears to have been incurred, and not unreasonably. The respondents, Hemingway <em>&amp; Go., </em>had, as they believed, large and important interests involved, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>required and justified effort and expense, perhaps somewhat unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">While the provisions of the statute permitting extra allowance do not apply to special proceedings, and such allowance cannot be made under an order giving costs, in such case the limitation to those for similar services, &amp;c., in actions controls (C<em>ode Civ. Pro., see. </em>3240; <em>R. and S. R. R. Co. </em>agt. <em>Davis, </em>55 <em>N. Y., </em>145), that restriction has no application on a motion for favor ( <em>Waverly Water Works, 85 N. Y., </em>478; <em>Brownell </em>agt. <em>Ruckman, Id., </em>648.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The fact that at the time this motion was made the proceedings had not reached completion and no rights had vested under them in respect to the land or compensation, is not important for the purposes of the question here, nor is it important that the company might have entered an <em>ex parte </em>order of discontinuance without any application to the court, or do it by notice without order; if that be so (4 <em>Hun, </em>313), that would not take from the court the power, upon motion, to assume control of the proceeding, and declare the discontinuance thus sought to be produced ineffectual, and restore it for the purposes of the proper protection of the other party to the proceeding <em>(Carleton </em>agt. <em>Darcy, </em>75 <em>N. Y., </em>375). The determination of <em>Watson </em>agt. <em>New York, W. and B. Railway Company </em>gave nothing new to the rule or practice in such cases. There the discretion exercised by the special term was sustained and its order affirmed (30 <em>Hun, </em>649). Upon the notice of appeal, the appellant is permitted to bring up the intermediate order for review <em>(Code of Civil Pro., see. </em>1358).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">But it may be questionable whether, after voluntarily proceeding under the order of discontinuance upon the terms there prescribed, and of the reference, and taking the benefits of the order, the appellant has not waived the right to review that order <em>(Arbsdell </em>agt. <em>Root, </em>3 <em>Abb., </em>142; <em>Radway </em>agt. <em>Graham, </em>4 <em>Abb., </em>468 ; <em>People </em>agt. <em>R. &amp; S. L. R. R. Co., </em>15 <em>Hun, </em>188; <em>Strong </em>agt. <em>Jones, </em>25 <em>Hun, </em>319).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">In the view taken of the case it is unnecessary to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>that question and we do not give it consideration. The intermediate orders are within the properly exercised discretion of the special term; and the order confirming the report of the referee should be affirmed, with ten dollars costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
