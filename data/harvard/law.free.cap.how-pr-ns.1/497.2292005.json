They were reasonably well authenticated, and upon the affidavit the court was authorized to issue the injunction by subdivision 1 of section 604 of the Code of Civil Procedure. That the injunction may be issued upon affidavit without complaint, is not only provided for by this subdivision, but that intent has been made still more clear by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>section 628 of the Code, providing that an application to discharge it may be made, after the service of the complaint itself, when it may fail to set forth a cause of action appearing to entitle the plaintiff to the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The subject of the controversy in the action was seven patents issued for improvements relating to the cash car system\u00bb -in use in stores, issued to Hilton Clark. The plaintiff claimed to have acquired the title to these patents, and a like claim -was made to them under the same invention on behalf of the \u25a0 defendants, the New York Store Service Company having \u25a0 claimed finally to have acquired the superior title to these patents. As the affidavits were presented the title to the patents is the controverted fact upon which the disposition of the litigation will probably be required to depend, and as it was \u25a0deemed to be too uncertainly presented to be disposed of on .the affidavits, the court considered it to be its duty to order a .reference upon which the evidence could be orally produced before the referee affecting the rights of the parties. This reference was authorized by section 1015 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It was such a question of fact, and so important -.in its character, as could satisfactorily be determined in no \u25a0other way.</p>\n<p id=\"AIC\">The injunction itself, so far as it restrained the defendants \u201cfrom putting up or in use, implements, machines, contrivanees, inventions, appliances, or any of them, pertaining to said patents and systems in any way whatsoever,\u201d was made without authority. Its object was to prevent an infringement of the patented invention by the defendants, and that the state \u25a0courts have no authority to do <em>(De Witt </em>agt. <em>Elmira, &amp;c., Co., </em>66 <em>N. Y., </em>459). The courts of the United States have been \u25a0invested with exclusive jurisdiction over that subject, and it \u25a0cannot be exercised by the courts of the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">So much of the injunction order as provides for this restraint should be vacated, and, as so modified, the orders should be \u00a1affirmed, with costs to abid\u00e9 the event of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">Davis, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
