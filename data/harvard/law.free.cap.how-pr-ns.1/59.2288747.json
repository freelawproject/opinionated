Tn support of this proposition he cites <em>(Tunstall </em>agt. Winton, 31 <em>Hun, </em>220 [December, 1883, <em>affirmed by Court of Appeals, </em>92 <em>N. Y., </em>646]; <em>Marshall </em>agt. <em>Meech, </em>51 <em>N. Y., </em>143; <em>Naylor </em>agt. <em>Lane, </em>50 <em>Super. Ct. R., </em>97; <em>Re Knapp, </em>85 <em>N.

Dig., </em>310).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">The defendant relies on <em>(Garner </em>agt. <em>Gladwin, </em>12 <em>Week. Dig., </em>9 <em>[Supreme </em>Court, <em>General Term, March, </em>1881]; <em>Hoyt </em>agt. <em>Godfrey, </em>5 <em>Civ. Pro.

That the costs in this case are motion costs. That they</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u2022 cannot be offset against any costs in the action due by the plaintiff to the defendant That the plaintiff cannot pay the defend-</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u2022 ant out of money which legally belongs to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. And that these costs are collectible from the defendant under section 779 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The defendant\u2019s motion is, therefore, denied, with ten dollars \u25a0costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
