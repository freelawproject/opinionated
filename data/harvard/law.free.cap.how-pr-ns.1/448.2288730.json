Y., </em>212), in an action brought for the construction of a will, declined to pass upon the questions raised, for the reason that in an action of partition between the same parties the validity of the same will had been disposed of, the court of appeals holding that \u201c whatever may be the rule as to such matters as might have been, but were not litigated in a prior action, it is well settled that as to all matters, either of fact or law, which legally might have been and actually were litigated in an action or special proceeding between the same parties, in a court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment rendered therein is binding and conclusive in all litigation between the same parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Considering the questions now raised to have been distinctly passed upon in the case between the same parties <em>(reported in </em>4 <em>Hun, </em>446), it is for the general term to decide to what extent, if any, that judgment is affected by this subsequent case in the court of appeals. That judgment still stands unreversed, and its effect as an estoppel yet remains to be determined. I hold it to be conclusive here. The plaintiff must have judgment</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
