By a later article of his will he made a trust provision in favor of another beneficiary, directing that such trust be established \u201c as soon as possible,\u201d after his death, and that interest beginning at his death, be paid to the beneficiary ; but he provided that such trust should not be set up until after the payment of the legacy first referred to.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b405-10\"><em>Held, </em>that upon such legacy interest did not begin to run until a year after the death of the testator.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b405-11\">\n<em>New York county,</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AY1\"><em>March, </em>1885.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b405-12\">Rollins, <em>S.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ARv\">\u2014 I am asked to determine from what period interest should be computed upon a certain legacy bequeathed by the will of this testator to his daughter, Mrs. Yernet. It is not claimed by counsel for the legatee that there is any feature in this case which takes it out of the operation of the general rule that interest does not begin to run on a legacy until a year after the death of the testator, unless he has given by his will an express or implied direction for an earlier payment of such interest, or of the legacy itself. But it is insisted that such a direction has here been given, and that because of it Mrs. Yernet is entitled to interest from her father\u2019s death. The only direction immediately associated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>with the bequest is that the executors shall pay it \u201c as soon as practicable \u201d after testator\u2019s death. Now, have these quoted words any real importance <em>% </em>It is the policy of our law that legacies shall not ordinarily be paid until a year- from the testator\u2019s death. And in this State, and in other localities where the same policy prevails, it has been held that such words as are here relied upon cannot be regarded as a direction that that policy be departed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Said chancellor Eldon, in <em>Gibson </em>agt. <em>Bott </em>(7 Vesey, 89), commenting upon the words \u201c as soon as conveniently may be: \u201d <em>\u201c </em>Where those words occur as to legacies, interest is never given until the end of the year. The court is obliged to take the general rule, as it is impossible to make the inquiry in every particular case. Suppose a testator directed his executor to convert the property with all convenient speed to pay certain legacies, and then gave the interest of the residue for life, remainder over, the legatee could make no complaint until the end of the year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">In the earlier case of <em>Sitwell </em>agt. <em>Bernard </em>(6 <em>Vesey, </em>540), the same' chancellor, in commenting upon the inequalities attending the application of this doctrine said : \u201c Upon the principle that the inquiry as to the condition of the personal estate, when each and every part could be got in and made productive, is endless and immeasurable, the court cuts the knot by doing what in general cases is convenient, though in particular eases both convenience and justice may be disappointed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\"><em>Benson </em>agt. <em>Maude (Madd. &amp; Geld., </em>15) was a case in which a testator had directed his executors to set up a certain trust \u201c as soon as they should think-proper.\u201d In the opinion of the vice chancellor this direction \u201c amounted to the same thing as a direction to raise and pay a legacy as soon as the executors should find it convenient; and, as the court had adopted a year as the rule of convenience, the legacy could not be raised until the end of the year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">In the cases cited below it was held that the legatee was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>entitled to interest for the first year, though there was in each of them a testamentary direction substantially like that in the case at bar, and, in some instances, even more stringent in its terms <em>(Williamson </em>agt. Williamson, 6 Paige, 299; <em>Hoagland </em>agt. <em>Schenck's executors, </em>16 <em>N. J. Law, </em>377; <em>Kent </em>agt. <em>Dunham, </em>106 <em>Mass., </em>586 ; <em>Rogers </em>agt. <em>Rogers, </em>2 <em>Redf., </em>24; <em>Bradner </em>agt. <em>Faulkner, </em>12 <em>N. Y., </em>472; <em>Kerr </em>agt. <em>Dougherty, </em>17 <em>Hun, </em>341; <em>Sullivan </em>agt. <em>Winthrop, </em>1 <em>Sumner, </em>1; <em>Webster </em>agt. <em>Hale, </em>8 <em>Ves., </em>410).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">These cases must be taken as decisive of the present contention, unless the claim of the legatee finds support in some clauses of the will that have not yet been considered. It does not. The testator gives instructions regarding the payment of certain other beneficiaries in terms similar to those which he adopts in his bequest to Mrs. Yernet, and by a later provision he directs that \u201c after the payment \u201d of certain legacies, including the one to Mrs. Yernet, and \u201cas soon as possible \u201d after his decease, his executors shall invest the sum of $20,000, and pay to his wife during her life the interest and income, \u201c commencing,\u201d as he says, \u201c from my decease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">It is argued that the testator\u2019s use of the phrase \u201c as soon as possible,\u201d indicates his wish that the $20,000 trust should be speedily set up, and that therefore the direction that it should not be established until <em>after </em>the payment of Mrs. Yernet\u2019s legacy implies an ^emphatic wish that that legacy should be discharged at once. At first blush there seems to be some force in this suggestion; but on more careful consideration it will appear that this clause opposes more than it assists the contention of the legatee \u2014 for by it the testator explicitly declares that his wife shall receive interest from his death on the $20,000, and by one of the earlier clauses of his will he provides that his wife shall be paid $500 \u201cimmediately\u201d after.his death. Those express and positive directions enhance the significance of his failure to give special direction respecting interest on Mrs. Yernet\u2019s legacy, and make it plain that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>his injunction to his executors to discharge that legacy as soon as practicable did not call upon them to do so until after the lapse of a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Decree accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
