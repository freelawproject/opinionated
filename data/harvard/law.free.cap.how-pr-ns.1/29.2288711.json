To succeed, the plaintiffs should show the insolvency of the purchaser at the time of the sale to him. That he became insolvent a month afterwards would not give the plaintiff a right of action (6 <em>South. Law Lev., </em>481, <em>art.). </em>Insolvency is never presumed, and it was incumbent on the plaintiffs to prove it ( <em>Walrod </em>agt. <em>Ball, </em>9 <em>Barb., </em>271). 2. The offer of the plaintiffs was to show the insolvency of McGovern, but when ? At the date of the assignment was manifestly immaterial, as it would not be proof of a fact anterior \u2022 to its date, because it could not act retrospectively <em>{Lawson on Pre. Evi, </em>190). Elustrations are given by Mr. Lawson as fol* lows <em>{pp. </em>190, 191): 1. A deed is signed in 1854 by Henrietta. C., her maiden name There is evidence that in 1860 she was known as Mis. D. There is no presumption that she was mar- - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>tied in 1854 <em>(K-skine </em>agt <em>Davis, </em>25 <em>III., </em>251). 2. Harriet G. executes a deed in 1854. The question is, whether she was married at the time. There is evidence that she was then over twenty-five years old. This raises no presumption that she was then married <em>(JErslcine </em>agt <em>Davis, </em>25 <em>III., </em>251). 3. Depositions out of the state are allowed to be taken before \u201c any judge or justice of the peace.\u201d A commission is issued to Texas. Depositions are taken before one B., on June 5, 1848, and it is officially certified, on June 29th, that B. is a justice of the peace. There is no presumption from this that B. held that office on June 5th <em>(Bareli </em>agt <em>Lyile, </em>4 <em>La. Ann., </em>557). 4. A made a. contract in 1860. In 1864 he was insane. There is no presumption that he was insane in 1860 <em>(Taylor </em>agt <em>Oresswell, </em>45 <em>Md., </em>422). 5. M. committed a burglary in 1880, in the house of J. In 1881 M. was tried, and it appeared on the trial that J. was married. This raises no presumption that J. was married at the time of the burglary <em>(Murdock </em>agt <em>Slate, </em>68 <em>Ala., </em>567). 6. A bankrupt in 1837 makes a scheduled return of his property. It is afterwards discovered that in 1835 he owned certain property which was not included in the schedule There is no presumption that he owned this property in 1837, for the presrrmption is that he did not commit a fraud <em>(PowelT </em>agt <em>Knox, </em>6 <em>Ala., </em>634).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-4\">IL It was also error to admit the alleged schedule and inventory of McGovern in evidence, for the purpose of showing the insolvency of McGovern. It was error likewise to permit the plaintiffs counsel to read from schedule the amount of indebtedness and amount of property, as well to read from the affidavit, attached thereto, and the court erred in its charge relating thereto. 1. The assignment bears date January 9, 1884. The \u25a0 attachments were issued and property seized January 17, 1884. The schedule and inventory bear date and were verified January-26, 1884, and filed September 27, 1884, a few days before the-trial of this casa 2. See authorities under point L 3. After a. debtor has assigned, his acts or declarations are no longer admissible evidenca He is a stranger to the rights of the interested-; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>parties, and his doings and words are mere hearsay and irrelevant <em>{Minzesheimer </em>agt Mayer, 66 <em>How.

Daily Beg., Feb. </em>9,1884). Nor is the debtor\u2019s examination in proceedings supplementary to execution admissible ( <em>Wells </em>agt <em>O' Connor, 27 Hun, </em>426). 4. After the execution and delivery of an assignment in trust for the benefit of creditors, the assignor cannot, by his acts, declarations or admissions, affect the assignment or the rights of his creditors <em>(Ouyler </em>agt <em>McCartney, </em>40 <em>N. Y, </em>221). <em>5. </em>Such acts or declarations are not part of the <em>res gestee {Peck </em>agt <em>Crouse, </em>46 <em>Barb., </em>151). 6. Declarations made a week or two after the assignment are not competent evidence for any purpose <em>{Ogden </em>agt <em>Peters, </em>15 <em>Barb., </em>560). <em>7. </em>Schedules of a bankrupt are inadmissible in evidence in a conflict between third persons, and the admission thereof is ground for a new trial <em>{Turner </em>agt <em>Lee, 57 K Y., </em>667). 8. Nor are the schedules of a bankrupt admissible to show the insolvency of a bankrupt <em>{Tyler </em>agt. <em>Brock, </em>68 <em>N. Y, </em>418; <em>see opinion of </em>Rappalo, <em>J., at p. </em>425, <em>commenting on this evidence). </em>The case of <em>Sibley </em>agt <em>Killom </em>(19 <em>H Y. Week.

The objection, that it was not filed in time, is not good The inventory is to be filed by the assignee with the county judge within twenty days after the execution of the assignment, and the county judge shall file the same in the office of the clerk of the county where the assignment is recorded, but the statute does not say when he must do it It was filed before offered in evidence <em>(Laws </em>1877, <em>chap. </em>466, <em>sec. </em>3; <em>amended </em>1878, <em>chap. </em>318; <em>Produce Bank </em>agt Morton, 67 <em>N.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMP\">The plaintiffs sold goods to one McGovern, about December 12, 1883. Afterwards McGovern made a general assignment to one Hayfinger, January 9,1884. Afterwards creditors of McGovern sued him, and in such suits issued attachments under which the defendant sheriff, &amp;c., by his deputy, seized goods, among them those sold by plaintiffs. Subsequently the plaintiffs commenced this action of replevin, and took the goods; but the same were retaken and retained by giving the usual bond. The ground of plaintiffs\u2019 action, as .stated, is, that the goods were obtained from them by false and fraudulent representations when McGovern was insolvent, with the design of not paying for the sama</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">To show McGovern\u2019s insolvency at the time of the so-called sale of the goods, plaintiffs gave in evidence his assignment, dated January 9, 1884, and the inventory and schedule dated January 26, 1884, and filed in the county clerk\u2019s office September 27,1884. To this defendant objected. Plaintiffs read therefrom the amount of indebtedness and of property, and also the assignment, to all which defendant objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">At the conclusion of the charge the defendant asked the \u25a0court to charge that the inventory did not tend to establish. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>McGovern\u2019s liabilities. The court refused. We think that the-plaintiffs might prove the fact that McGovern made an assignment for the benefit of creditors as tending to show that, at the short time previous, when he bought, he had no \u2022 intention of paying, the act of making an assignment, whether he was then really insolvent or not, was a fact which might have some influence in deciding what his intentions were when he bought, just as if he had sold all his property to any other person. But. McGovern\u2019s statements in that assignment were not, and still less were the contents of the inventory and schedules, evidence against the defendant of the matters therein contained. These were mere statements made by McGovern out of court, and on the 29th day of January that on such a day, the 9th of January he owed so much and had so much property. Neither plaintiffs nor defendant claimed under the assignment <em>(Tyler </em>agt. <em>Brook, </em>68 <em>N. Y., </em>418; <em>Turner </em>agt. <em>Lee, </em>57 <em>id., </em>667).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The evidence of fraud in this case is this: plaintiffs asked McGovern how he was getting along. He said he was getting along good; all right He testifies that at that time he knew he was insolvent, owing $3,600 and having $1,900, and in a month\u2019s time he failed. He testifies that he had no intent to defraud plaintiffs when he made the purchase. Of course the question is whether the purchase was made with the design not to pay. We cannot say that there was no evidence to go to the jury on that point</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">McGovern\u2019s testimony was contradicted by what he had previously sworn to on another occasion, as to his knowledge of his financial condition when he made the purchase, and this was very material on the question of fraud. Therefore, we cannot disregard the error in the admission of evidence above mentioned, an error insisted upon by the defendant in various waya</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Judgment reversed.
