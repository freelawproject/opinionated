De Bost, respondent, agt. Albert Palmer Company, appellant.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b534-6\"><em>Code of Oivil Procedure, section </em>756 \u2014 <em>Proceedings upon transfer of </em>interest\u2014 <em>Power of court upon, motion to compel transferee of plaintiff\u2019s claim pending suit to be made party plaintiff\u2019.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b534-7\">The court has power, upon application of defendant to compel the sole transferee of plaintiff\u2019s claim pending suit to be made party plaintiff, changing the rule as declared in <em>Packard </em>agt. <em>Wood </em>(17 <em>Abb., </em>818) ; <em>Emmett </em>agt. <em>Bowers </em>(23 <em>How., </em>300): <em>Howard </em>agt. <em>Taylor </em>(6 <em>JDuer, </em>204); affirming the theory of <em>Shearman agt. Ooman </em>(22 <em>How., </em>517).</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b534-8\"><em>First Department, General Term, May, </em>1885.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b534-9\"><em>Before </em>Davis, <em>P. J., </em>Brady <em>and </em>Daniels, <em>JJ.</em></p>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-10\">Appeal from order denying motion to bring in party plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-11\">Pending suit the plaintiff transferred his entire cause of action to Henry Day. The defendant made a motion, under section 756 of the Code of Civil Procedure, for an order directing Henry Day to be substituted as party plaintiff. The court duly denied the motion on the ground of want of power, following <em>Packard </em>agt. <em>Wood.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b534-12\"><em>James B. Dill, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR2\">argued that the order was not discretionary with the court; that section 449 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that \u201c every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,\u201d and where a party transferred his entire interest he ceased to be the real party in interest; that section 756 of the Code permitted the original party to carry on the suit unless the court ordered the transferee to be substituted; that <em>Shearman agt. Coman </em>(22 <em>How. Pr., </em>517), although overruled in <em>Packard </em>agt. <em>Wood, </em>was the proper theory of the law; that the force of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>decision in <em>Packard </em>agt. <em>Wood </em>had been removed by an amendment to the Code <em>(Sec. 756, formerly sec. </em>121).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-5\"><em>Alexander c&amp; Green, </em>opposed, for the plaintiff, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-6\">I. That the court had no power to compel the transferee of a cause of action <em>pendente lite </em>to be made party plaintiff; that the order could only be made upon the application of the transferee (C<em>iting Packard </em>agt. <em>Wood, </em>17 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>322; <em>Slawson </em>agt. <em>Watkins, </em>95 <em>N. Y., </em>369; <em>Emmet </em>agt. <em>Bowers, </em>23 <em>How. Pr., </em>300; <em>see </em>note, <em>Bliss\u2019 Code, p. </em>638).</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-7\">II. Section 756 has not changed the effect of the decision in <em>Packard </em>agt. <em>Wood.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-8\">III. The defendant\u2019s proper remedy is given by section 3217 of the Code.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b535-9\">By the Court (Daniels, <em>J)</em></author>\n<p id=\"A2y\">\u2014 In this case section 756 seems to confer a very broad discretion on the court, without any qualification whatever, to bring in a party who may have an interest in the suit. It has not been made conditional that the motion should be made on behalf of the plaintiff, but a general power is given to the court to bring in a party in the exercise of its discretion. That discretion has not been made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">The order must be reversed in order that the court may exercise the power that the Code has conferred upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Note.\u2014Upon a rehearing of the motion before Lawrence, J., at special term, the motion was granted on the ground that while section 756 of the Code of Civil Procedure gave the court discretionary power, when a a case was made out under section 449 by proof of an absolute transfer, then as a matter of <em>right </em>the defendant was entitled to the order.\u2014 [Ed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
