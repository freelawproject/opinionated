The parties subsequently entered into an amendment to the stipulation in March 1990 and substantially complied with its terms, until the former husband allegedly was rendered legally blind as a result of health problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Thereafter, the former husband moved for downward modification of his support obligations and the former wife cross-moved for a money judgment for arrears in both maintenance and child support. The court granted the cross motion and denied the former husband\u2019s motion, without a hearing, on the ground that he had failed to make the requisite showing of extreme hardship or a substantial unanticipated change in circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Here, the former husband has come forward with a sufficient showing requiring a hearing to determine whether there exists an extreme hardship and a substantial and unanticipated change in circumstances so as to warrant a modification of his support obligations <em>(cf., Schnoor v Schnoor, </em>189 AD2d 809). The former husband may submit proof of any alleged discrepancies regarding the arrears he owes at the hearing <em>(see, Wiggins v Wiggins, </em>121 AD2d 534) so that the court can, if necessary, recalculate those arrears consistent with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>findings at the hearing. Mangano, P. J., Balletta, O\u2019Brien and Hart, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
