The evidence that was presented at trial shows that the defendant walked to the phone booth in which the victim was standing, shot him in the head, and, when the victim fell to the ground, removed a paycheck and some cash from him. The indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>charged that the defendant had committed intentional and felony murder by shooting the victim with a pistol and that the defendant had committed the robbery while armed with a deadly weapon <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [1], [3]; \u00a7 160.15 [2]). Since the defendant\u2019s convictions of murder in the second degree and robbery in the first degree are essentially based upon the same acts, the sentences imposed thereon must run concurrently <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 70.25 [2]).\u201d; and it is further,</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Ordered that the motion is otherwise denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The People have failed to establish that this Court\u2019s modification of the defendant\u2019s sentences was improper. However, we modify our decision and order dated May 23, 1994, to the extent indicated for the purpose of clarification. Ritter, J. P., Copertino, Santucci and Hart, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
