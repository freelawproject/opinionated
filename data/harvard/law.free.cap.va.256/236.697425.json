Among other options, employees may bring their concerns to upper management through a formal grievance procedure. \u00a72.1-116.05(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">As relevant to this dispute, the grievance process generally permits an employee, first, to present a complaint to the employee\u2019s immediate supervisor by filing a written grievance on a specified form. <em>Id. </em>at (D). The head of the agency for which the employee works must determine whether the grievance qualifies for a hearing. \u00a7 2.1-116.06(D). If the agency head rules the grievance does not qualify for a hearing, the employee may request the Director of the Department of Employee Relations Counselors (DERC), who has statutory authority to establish the grievance procedure, \u00a7 2.1-116.03(3), to qualify the grievance for a hearing. \u00a7 2.1-116.06(D). The Director of DERC may refer issues arising from the complaint to a hearing officer for adjudication. \u00a7 2.1-116.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">The next step in this process generates the issue in this appeal. Code \u00a7 2.1-116.07(D) provides that, after the hearing officer\u2019s decision, \u201c[e]ither party may petition the circuit court having jurisdiction in the locality in which the employee is employed for an order requiring implementation of the hearing officer\u2019s decision.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The statute also provides for an award of attorney\u2019s fees to either party. Here, we consider whether the circuit court exceeded its statutory jurisdiction in awarding certain relief to an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">The facts are not disputed. Appellee Steven B. Wright is an employee of the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia. In May 1995, he was employed as a Waste Management Supervisor in DEQ\u2019s regional office in Roanoke. In connection with a \u201crestructuring\u201d of DEQ that commenced in 1994 and was finally implemented in May 1995, the employee was transferred to a position labeled \u201cEnvironmental Engineer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Objecting to the transfer, the employee initiated a grievance under the state grievance procedure. On the grievance form, the employee claimed his transfer was disciplinary and retaliatory, as well as a misapplication of personnel policies, procedures, rules, or regulations. The agency head determined the grievance was not grievable under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The employee appealed to the Director of DERC, who ruled that only one issue the employee raised qualified for a hearing, that is, whether the employee\u2019s \u201creassignment and reclassification was disciplinary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Following a May 1996 hearing, a hearing officer rendered a written opinion dated June 14, 1996. He found that the supervisory job \u201cwas taken from Mr. Wright in order to create a position for a headquarters transfer.\u201d The hearing officer noted that, \u201c[a]t the time of transfer,\u201d a DEQ employee \u201cfrom the Richmond office\u201d had \u201cthreatened Mr. Wright with a layoff unless he took the new position of Environmental Engineer, which position apparently does not have management or supervisory responsibilities.\u201d The hearing officer, finding the employee \u201cvery well qualified for the job which he had previously held,\u201d determined that \u201cthe job created for Mr. Wright at the time of his transfer . . . was a new job in the department for which there was no job description or duties assigned at the time of the transfer and in fact, there was no similar job in any other region of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The hearing officer concluded \u201cthat the basis of Mr. Wright\u2019s having been removed as the Waste Management Supervisor was the result of the arbitrary action of\u201d the Richmond DEQ employee, and that \u201cthe Department then provided Mr. Wright\u2019s Supervisor\u2019s job to headquarters\u2019 people whose jobs were being abolished as the result of the Department downsizing.\u201d The hearing officer recommended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u201cthat Mr. Wright be reinstated as the Waste Management Supervisor because of the arbitrary action of [the DEQ employee], which was not related to discipline problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In a letter to the hearing officer dated June 21, 1996, Phyllis C. Katz, the Director of DERC, asked for \u201ca clarification of your decision,\u201d asserting the decision \u201cis ambiguous\u201d on the issue \u201cwhether the grievant\u2019s reassignment and reclassification was disciplinary.\u201d Elaborating, Katz explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">\u201cIf you found that the reassignment was disciplinary and such discipline was unwarranted, then you may order the agency to assign the grievant his former duties, and the agency must implement that decision. If, on the other hand, you found that the grievant\u2019s reassignment was not disciplinary, then you cannot order the agency to take certain action. However, you may, based on collateral findings of fact, recommend that the agency assign the grievant his former duties, but the agency would not be obligated to follow your recommendation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In a letter to Katz dated June 24, 1996, the hearing officer responded he had concluded that the employee\u2019s transfer \u201cwas not the result of disciplinary action\u201d by the DEQ, and \u201cwas not related to discipline problems.\u201d He further wrote: \u201cA collateral finding of facts is that the agency arbitrarily reassigned Mr. Wright and it is my recommendation that he be reassigned to his former position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Next, the DEQ requested the Director of the Department of Personnel and Training (DPT), who has final authority to interpret personnel policies and authority to assure compliance with such policies, Code \u00a7 2.1-114.5(13), to rule whether the hearing officer\u2019s \u201crecommendation\u201d was consistent with state policy. Responding, the DPT ruled \u201can agency is not bound to act on a hearing officer\u2019s decision if that decision is only a recommendation. Therefore, DEQ has no obligation to take further action.\u201d DEQ refused to proceed further on the employee\u2019s grievance, and this litigation ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The employee filed a pleading labeled \u201cBill of Complaint\u201d against the Commonwealth, Department of Environmental Quality. He noted that the hearing officer recommended reinstatement to his former position and asserted that the DEQ improperly had refused to implement the hearing officer\u2019s decision. Claiming the assignment to the new position was a \u201cfunctional demotion,\u201d the employee alleged that the DEQ\u2019s refusal to reinstate him \u201cviolates\u201d Code \u00a7 2.1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>116.07(D) (either party may petition circuit court \u201cfor an order requiring implementation of the hearing officer\u2019s decision\u201d). The employee asked the court to implement the hearing officer\u2019s decision and to award him attorney\u2019s fees. In various responsive pleadings, the Commonwealth asserted the circuit court had \u201cno authority to implement nonbinding recommendations made by hearing officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Following two hearings, during which many documents relating to the grievance were submitted by the parties, the trial court decided in favor of the employee on cross motions for summary judgment. In an August 1997 order, the court found that the hearing officer had ruled in favor of the employee, and not against him, \u201cas suggested by defendant in argument,\u201d and that the \u201cgrievance procedures established by the Commonwealth are sufficiently broad to permit the relief sought by the plaintiff.\u201d The court then ordered that the Commonwealth \u201cforthwith reinstate\u201d the employee \u201cto his former position as Waste Management Supervisor.\u201d Following another hearing, the trial court, in an October 1997 order, awarded the employee attorney\u2019s fees of $5,500 plus costs. The Commonwealth appeals both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Simply stated, this is a case in which the trial court exceeded the authority the General Assembly granted to circuit courts in Code \u00a7 2.1-116.07(D). Under the statute, an employee may petition the appropriate circuit court \u201cfor an order requiring implementation of the hearing officer\u2019s decision.\u201d Thus, a circuit court\u2019s authority, according to the statute, is limited to the act of implementing, or refusing to implement, the hearing officer\u2019s ruling. A circuit court lacks authority to consider the grievance <em>de novo, </em>to modify the hearing officer\u2019s decision, to substitute the court\u2019s view of the facts for those of the hearing officer, or to invoke its broad equitable powers to arrive at a decision that the court may think is fair; the court may only \u201cimplement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The verb \u201cimplement\u201d means \u201cto carry out.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1134 (1971). In the present case, there was nothing in the hearing officer\u2019s decision to carry out; the officer ordered no relief. Ruling against the employee on the only issue properly before him, the hearing officer explicitly determined that the employee\u2019s reassignment \u201cwas not the result of disciplinary action\u201d by the DEQ, and \u201cwas not related to discipline problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">However, the hearing officer made the \u201crecommendation,\u201d not an order, that the employee be reassigned to his former position. Then, the circuit court, purportedly \u201cimplementing\u201d the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>officer\u2019s decision, issued an order that the hearing officer did not make; the court directed the Commonwealth to \u201cforthwith reinstate\u201d the employee to his former position. This was error. The hearing officer\u2019s \u201crecommendation,\u201d while included within his written opinion, was not a \u201cdecision\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2.1-116.07(D) allowing implementation \u201cof the hearing officer\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">This Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Angle </em>v. <em>Overton, </em>235 Va. 103, 365 S.E.2d 758 (1988), heavily relied upon by the employee, is not controlling. <em>Angle </em>was \u201cdecided substantially in [the employee\u2019s] favor\u201d by a grievance panel. <em>Id. </em>at 104, 365 S.E.2d at 758. There, we concluded the grievance panel\u2019s decision, which used the word \u201crecommends,\u201d actually was \u201ccouched in mandatory, not discretionary, language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106, 365 S.E.2d at 760. We said that the panel\u2019s decision was binding and that it commanded the employer to act to implement it. Here, in contrast, the hearing officer\u2019s decision was not in the employee\u2019s favor. As supplemented by his June 1996 response to Katz, the hearing officer clearly decided in favor of the Commonwealth on the discipline issue and collaterally made a plain recommendation of reassignment that was not binding on the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Accordingly, because the trial court erred in deciding the merits of the controversy, we will reverse the August 1997 order. Our action thus nullifies the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the employee, so we will also reverse the October 1997 order. Finally, we will dismiss the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
