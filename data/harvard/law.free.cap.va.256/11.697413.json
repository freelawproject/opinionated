McGuffin, M.D., and Sears Curtiss Mull, M.D. In a November 1996 amended motion for judgment, plaintiff alleged defendants were negligent during a period in September 1993 when they failed promptly to diagnose and treat the condition of septic arthritis of plaintiff\u2019s left hip. According to the record, septic arthritis of the hip is an infectious process in which bacteria attacks the cartilage in the joint. An \u201cextraordinarily difficult diagnosis,\u201d the condition causes the hip joint to sustain \u201cirreversible and significant dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>age\u201d unless treatment is rendered within five to seven days of the onset of symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Responding to plaintiff\u2019s allegations, defendants admitted they were involved in plaintiff\u2019s care but denied they committed any negligence that was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s alleged injuries or damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Following a lengthy trial, a jury found in favor of the defendants. Overruling plaintiff\u2019s motion to set the verdict aside and to award a new trial, the court entered judgment on the verdict. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">A summary of the evidence will set the stage for discussion of the issue of law presented. On September 17, 1993, the plaintiff, 36 years of age, was employed by the State Department of Corrections in Roanoke as a probation and parole officer. After escorting an offender through an office security door, he turned and felt a \u201cpop ... around the left groin area.\u201d He \u201cjust walked it off\u201d and continued working. His hip did not \u201cbother\u201d him during the next three days.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">During the early morning hours of September 21, plaintiff, a diabetic, was unable to sleep because he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel what you\u2019d call exactly great.\u201d His \u201ctemperature\u201d was above normal, and he felt like he \u201chad the flu\u201d but reported to work. While working \u201cseeing offenders\u201d in his office, the plaintiff felt progressively worse. He left the office near midday and called his Blacksburg physician \u201cand told him my leg was hurting.\u201d The physician \u201ccalled in a prescription\u201d for pain relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s condition continued to worsen and he was taken by a friend to the Lewis-Gale Clinic in Salem where he was seen during the morning of September 22 by defendant Castem, who practices occupational medicine. Castem took a medical history from plaintiff. The physician testified that an accurate history is \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d and \u201cof ultimate importance\u201d to a proper diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">In addition, Castem examined plaintiff, who complained of pain of the left thigh. He was \u201cconcerned\u201d about plaintiff\u2019s condition because he \u201chad a lot of confusing symptoms and physical findings.\u201d Upon consideration of the medical history and the examination, Castem formed a \u201cdiagnostic impression\u201d that plaintiff\u2019s left thigh pain was due to muscle spasm or muscle strain. Castem prescribed medications for plaintiff and released him. The plaintiff stayed at home for the next two days and \u201cwent through living hell\u201d due to pain in his leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>On September 24, plaintiff was brought back to the Clinic where he was seen again by Castem. The physician found plaintiff \u201cwas in more pain and ... it was further down his leg.\u201d Following testing of plaintiff\u2019s blood, Castem became concerned that his problems were caused by either \u201can infectious or an inflammatory process.\u201d The plaintiff \u201cstill had this left thigh pain\u201d and the physician \u201ctender[ed]\u201d a diagnosis of acute myositis, an inflammatory process that was related to the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cinjury\u201d on September 17 when he felt the \u201cpop.\u201d The physician prescribed additional medication and instructed him to see his Blacksburg physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Pain in plaintiff\u2019s hip and leg \u201ccontinued to build\u201d to such a degree he \u201cwould go ballistic\u201d whenever he had to move. Near midnight on September 24, the plaintiff was carried to the emergency room at Lewis-Gale Hospital, a separate entity from the Clinic although in the same facility. Plaintiff was seen by defendant McGuffin, who practices emergency medicine. Following examination, the physician concluded: \u201cLeg pain of uncertain etiology possibly related to muscle spasm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s condition did not improve and on September 25, a Saturday, he presented to Dr. William T. Hendricks, Jr., a family medicine practitioner in Blacksburg, who took a history and examined plaintiff. The physician \u201cthought something was seriously wrong with him.\u201d Hendricks \u201cdid not suspect an infectious process going on.\u201d He made a \u201cdifferential diagnosis\u201d of aseptic (absence of infection) necrosis of the femoral head, a herniated disk, a tom ligament, or a femoral hernia. He recommended to plaintiff that he report to a hospital emergency room \u201cimmediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Plaintiff understood that, because the condition may be work related, state regulations required him to return to \u201cLewis-Gale.\u201d His parents attempted to transport him by vehicle to Salem, but the trip had to be interrupted due to plaintiff\u2019s pain. At that point, he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like living a whole lot longer.\u201d Eventually, he was carried to the Clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Defendant Castem saw plaintiff in the Clinic on September 27 and, after examination, referred him to defendant Mull, an orthopedic surgeon, who admitted plaintiff to the Hospital. Due to his condition, plaintiff did not recall seeing Castem on the 27th and remembered little of his \u201cencounter\u201d with Mull. While hospitalized, the plaintiff \u201cwent into some sort of septic shock.\u201d Later, surgery was performed on plaintiff\u2019s left hip, and the diagnosis of septic arthritis was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>During the trial, plaintiff\u2019s recollection of the symptoms he had related when his medical history was being taken and the nature of his examinations was different, in many instances, from what the medical records and the physicians\u2019 recollections established. In rebuttal, the plaintiff proffered testimony of his office supervisor who stated that plaintiff\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity in the community in which he lives and works is \u201coutstanding.\u201d The trial court sustained defendants\u2019 objection to this testimony and disallowed it, ruling \u201cthat this gentleman\u2019s character and reputation has not been put in dispute, is not in evidence, and consequently ... is not admissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that his \u201cdisability resulted from a failure of those attending to timely diagnose and treat an infected hip. At trial, the key questions were whether the diagnosis should have been made; and, should the <em>condition </em>have been diagnosed in time to save the Plaintiff\u2019s hip. The answers to these key questions depended in large measure on what the Plaintiff had told his treating physicians; specifically, did he accurately identify the area of his pain?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Continuing, plaintiff contends that his \u201ccharacter was repeatedly put in issue by contrary evidence as to the material fact of his history. For example, Defendant Castem testified directly to the jury, 1 know [the Plaintiff] described hip pain to us here in his testimony, but when he was with me I did not get a complaint of hip pain.\u2019 Defendant McGuffin; I \u2018know\u2019 I did a straight leg raising test. The Plaintiff testified emphatically to the contrary. Defendant Mull told the jury, T am surprised at [the Plaintiff\u2019s] testimony; he told me he was having pain in his back.\u2019 The Plaintiff testified emphatically and unequivocally to the contrary. Doctor eastern\u2019s expert testified that \u2018there is an obligation on the patient to be truthful\u2019 in connection with the giving of a history. The Plaintiff, of course, testified emphatically that he was truthful.\u201d (Alterations in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Summarizing, plaintiff argues his \u201ccharacter was also repeatedly put in issue by extensive cross-examination about prior inconsistent statements. Simply put, as a matter of law, \u2018imputation on [the Plaintiff\u2019s] veracity results from the fact of his having contradicted himself,\u2019 as time-honored evidence treatises consistently note. Among other things, the Plaintiff testified that his progressively painful symptoms started on the 21st of September. The defense sought to prove, by prior inconsistent statements, that his symptoms commenced on the 17th.\u201d (Alteration in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Finally, plaintiff contends he \u201cwas denied his one opportunity to rehabilitate his credit with the jury: that is, by proof that his reputation and character for truthfulness was \u2018outstanding.\u2019 This was prejudicial error.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Generally, in civil actions evidence of the reputation of the parties for truth and veracity is not admissible. <em>S. H. Kress &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>143 Va. 71, 77, 129 S.E. 244, 246 (1925). As an exception to the general rule, Virginia permits evidence of the general reputation of a party or a witness for truthfulness whenever such person\u2019s character for truth is attacked either directly or by cross-examination, or by proof of inconsistent statements regarding material facts, or by disproving through other witnesses material facts stated by such person during testimony. <em>Luck </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>240 Va. 445, 447, 397 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1990) (quoting <em>George </em>v. <em>Pilcher, </em>69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 299, 315 (1877)).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The key words in the exception are \u201cwhenever such person\u2019s character for truth is attacked.\u201d In the present case, contrary to plaintiff\u2019s contention, his character for truthfulness never was attacked. This was made abundantly clear throughout the trial. While the plaintiff\u2019s recollection of past events was challenged, there was no attempt to portray him as a liar.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">For example, one of defendants\u2019 expert witnesses, having reviewed the recorded medical history, stated there was \u201cno reason to believe\u201d that plaintiff had been \u201cother than completely candid with the physicians who examined him.\u201d That witness also testified, \u201cI\u2019m not accusing him of not telling the truth.\u201d Also, defendant Mull testified, \u201cI believe that he was giving me accurate information ... I absolutely believed it.\u201d Additionally, defendant Castem stated he never believed the plaintiff \u201cwas malingering or falsely exaggerating his pain or anything of that nature just to make a workers\u2019 compensation claim.\u201d Indeed, during plaintiff\u2019s rebuttal, defendants\u2019 attorney stated before the jury, \u201cWe will stipulate, if it will help, that Mr. Mottesheard didn\u2019t intentionally try to mislead anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The theme of the defense, in part, was that the plaintiff, because of his physical condition during some of the seven-day period in question, was unable to give an accurate medical history and that, at trial, his recollection differed from what other evidence revealed. For example, plaintiff testified that when he saw defendant McGuffin, he was \u201cso spaced out\u201d that he did not \u201cknow really what planet\u201d he was on. Also, he testified that when he saw Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Hendricks he was \u201ca mumbling fool\u201d and that the physician may have misunderstood his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">This challenge to plaintiff\u2019s recollection, and not to his character, was accentuated during closing argument of defendants\u2019 counsel. Among other things, he told the jury, \u201cThere is no question that a bad thing happened to a good person ... He is a very admirable person in a lot of ways. He is admirable in the way that he dealt with this. He continued to perform his job and he performed it at a high level. He is rated as high as he can be rated and I think that is significant. We have never suggested to you that he is untruthful. The evidence does not show that and we have never argued that for a minute.\u201d Later during argument, counsel said: \u201c[W]e are not suggesting to you that Mr. Mottesheard did not testify truthfully. I\u2019m sure that he testified the way that he thinks these things happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Our conclusions based upon study of the trial proceedings are confirmed by the trial judge\u2019s comments made when he denied the motion to set the verdict aside. He said: \u201cMr. Mottesheard\u2019s integrity was never questioned. I sat here for two weeks listening to testimony, listening to argument of the counsel on both sides; and I never got the impression that the Plaintiff\u2019s reputation in the community [in] which he lived was other than \u2014 or anyone was hinting or implying his reputation was other than \u2014 impeccable.\u201d The judge also stated: \u201cTestimony concerning memory skills of all the parties would have been more appropriate [than] testimony as to their character because no one questions their character or ever did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s reliance upon <em>Luck, supra, </em>and <em>Redd </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>207 Va. 939, 154 S.E.2d 149 (1967), is misplaced. In <em>Luck, </em>a personal injury action arising from a motor vehicle accident, we held the trial court erred in refusing to admit testimony regarding the plaintiff\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity \u201cafter her character for truthfulness had been impeached.\u201d 240 Va. at 446, 397 S.E.2d at 870-71. However, in that case, unlike the present case, cross-examination of the plaintiff \u201cwas structured to secure statements that admitted or implied\u201d that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were the result of a prior accident, that plaintiff had withheld information from attorneys in a previous suit, and that plaintiff misrepresented information about her injuries sustained in the prior accident. <em>Id. </em>at 447-48, 397 S.E.2d at 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">In <em>Redd, </em>another personal injury case arising from a vehicular accident, this Court held the trial court properly admitted evidence concerning the plaintiff\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity. There, defendant attempted to impeach plaintiff\u2019s character for truth by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>cross-examination of plaintiff and by introducing testimony to contradict him. 207 Va. at 943, 154 S.E.2d at 152. In that case, however, defendant attempted to impeach the truth of plaintiff\u2019s testimony respecting matters \u201cabout which [the plaintiff] could not have been honestly mistaken.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>154 S.E.2d at 153. Here, in contrast, impeachment of plaintiff dealt with matters about which he honestly could have been mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err in refusing to permit plaintiff to offer evidence of his general reputation for truth and veracity. Thus, the judgment below will be</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
