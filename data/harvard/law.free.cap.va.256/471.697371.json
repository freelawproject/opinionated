PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">On April 28, 1997, an Augusta County grand jury indicted Swisher for the following offenses: capital murder of Dawn McNees Snyder in the commission of abduction with the intent to defile the victim of such abduction or in the commission of or subsequent to rape or forcible sodomy in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-31; abduction with intent to defile Snyder in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-48; rape of Snyder in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-61; and forcible sodomy of Snyder in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Swisher was tried before a jury and found guilty of the charged offenses. The jury fixed Swisher\u2019s punishment at life imprisonment for the abduction with intent to defile conviction, Ufe imprisonment for the rape conviction, and life imprisonment for the forcible sodomy conviction. In the penalty phase of the capital murder trial, the jury fixed Swisher\u2019s punishment at death, finding that he represented a continuing serious threat to society and that his offense was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or aggravated battery to the victim. After considering a report prepared by a probation officer pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5, the trial court sentenced Swisher in accord with the jury verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">We have consolidated the automatic review of Swisher\u2019s death sentence with his appeal of the capital murder conviction. Former Code \u00a7 17-110.1(F).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Swisher\u2019s appeal of his non-capital convictions was certified from the Court of Appeals, former Code \u00a7 17-116.06, and was consolidated with his capital murder appeal and given priority on our docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">H. THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">On February 5, 1997, Dawn McNees Snyder disappeared from a florist shop where she worked in Stuarts Draft in Augusta County. Her body was found on February 21, 1997, near a riverbank about two miles from the florist shop. Animals had eaten extensive portions of her face, neck, and upper chest, and her identity was established by use of her dental records.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">On February 22, 1997, the defendant, age 20, was at an apartment with two friends, one of whom was Clarence Henry Ridgeway, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Jr. Swisher told Ridgeway that Swisher had abducted, raped, sodomized, and killed Snyder. Swisher stated: \u201cYou know the woman, Dawn Snyder ... I killed her.\u201d Swisher related the following details to Ridgeway.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">On February 5, 1997, about 7:15 p.m., Swisher\u2019s uncle drove Swisher by car to a grocery store located near the florist shop where Snyder worked. Swisher left the grocery store and walked to the florist shop. Swisher entered the shop, approached Snyder, and said, \u201cI have a gun in my pocket.\u201d Swisher showed Snyder a \u201cbutcher knife with ridges\u201d and directed her to go with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Swisher forced Snyder to leave the florist shop through a rear door, and they walked for some distance until they reached a field by the South River. Then, Swisher stopped Snyder and told her to \u201csuck his dick.\u201d He forced her to perform an act of oral sodomy upon him, and he made her remove her clothes. After he raped her, she put her clothes on, and he forced her to perform another act of oral sodomy upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Swisher decided to kill Snyder because she had \u201cseen his face.\u201d He \u201cpulled out the butcher knife\u201d that had \u201cridges around the edge of the blade,\u201d and he \u201cslit her across the left side of the face and was holding her; then slit her throat and then gouged her and then tossed her into a river.\u201d He walked along the riverbank, watching her in the river, asking her, \u201c[a]re \u2014 are you dead yet?\u201d After Snyder floated in the river for awhile, Swisher saw her \u201ccrawl up the bank.\u201d Then, \u201che got scared and took off running straight to his house from that field.\u201d Swisher threw his knife in the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">When Swisher finished his confession to Ridgeway, Swisher stated that \u201c[i]t feels like [I] could do it again.\u201d The following morning, Ridgeway informed the Augusta County Sheriff\u2019s Office of Swisher\u2019s crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">On February 23, 1997, Sergeant William E. Lemerise, Sergeant K.W. Reed, and two other deputies went to a house where Swisher resided with his uncles, Paul H. Swisher and William E. Swisher. Sergeant Reed advised Bobby Swisher that he was a suspect in the murder of Dawn Snyder and asked if Swisher would accompany the deputies to the Sheriff\u2019s Office for questioning. Swisher, who did not object, accompanied the deputies. Sergeant Lemerise informed Swisher that he would be required to wear handcuffs while en route to the Sheriff\u2019s Office because of a departmental policy which required that the sheriff\u2019s personnel transport suspects in restraints <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>for safety considerations. Lemerise told Swisher that he would have to wear these restraints even though he was not under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">When Swisher arrived at the Sheriff\u2019s Office, about 10:15 p.m., the handcuffs were immediately removed from him, and he was taken to a \u201cbriefing room.\u201d The briefing room is an open room with a coffee machine and a drink machine. There are no bars on the windows or door locks in that room. Swisher was permitted to smoke cigarettes, and he was given coffee.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Sergeant Lemerise explained to Swisher that he was not under arrest, that he was a suspect, that the sheriff\u2019s personnel were going to ask him some questions, and that he was free to leave. Lemerise asked Swisher \u201chow did he feel about the fact that he could walk out of there if he chose to, words to that effect . . . and [Swisher] appeared at that point in time, although he was nervous ... to be fine with the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Swisher spoke with the deputies, but did not confess to the commission of any crimes until after he was arrested and twice read his <em>Miranda </em>rights after midnight on February 24. Swisher admitted, in an audiotaped confession, that he had sodomized, raped, and murdered Snyder by cutting her throat. He also stated that after he cut her throat, he threw her into the South River.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Dr. David Oxley, a medical examiner who performed an autopsy on Snyder\u2019s body, was unable to render an opinion about the specific cause of Snyder\u2019s death. He did state, however, that it was an inescapable conclusion that Snyder\u2019s death was the result of violent causes \u201cprobably related to the neck.\u201d Dr. Oxley was not able to determine positively whether the victim\u2019s throat had been cut because animals had eaten her larynx, trachea, and the large arteries and veins that were in her neck. The highest concentration of blood on the victim\u2019s clothing appeared on a shirt around the neck area extending onto the chest area.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Patricia Taylor, a forensic scientist in the Forensic Biology Unit of the Western Regional Laboratory for the Commonwealth of Virginia, qualified as an expert witness on the subject of forensic DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). She examined some panties that were found on Snyder\u2019s body. Her examination revealed that DNA consistent with Swisher\u2019s DNA was found in semen deposited on Snyder\u2019s panties. Taylor testified that the odds of the DNA found on Snyder\u2019s panties belonging to someone other than Swisher were one in 380,000,000 in the Caucasian population.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Spots of blood were found on Swisher\u2019s coat. Taylor testified that the DNA profile obtained from that coat is consistent with the DNA profile of Snyder and different from the DNA profile of Swisher. Taylor testified that the probability of randomly selecting an individual unrelated to Snyder who had a DNA profile consistent with the DNA on Swisher\u2019s coat was approximately one in 1.3 billion in the Caucasian population. Dr. Taylor testified that the DNA profile obtained from spermatozoa heads extracted from the victim\u2019s stomach and esophagus were consistent with Swisher\u2019s DNA profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">HI. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR PROCEDURALLY DEFAULTED</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Swisher argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to \u201cdeclare the Virginia capital murder and death penalty statutes unconstitutional and to prohibit the imposition of the death penalty.\u201d Swisher claims that Virginia\u2019s death penalty statutes, \u201cspecifically . . . Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-2[6]4.2 through 19.2-264.5, [and former Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-110.1 and 17-110.2] ... on their face and as applied, violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, the Sixth Amendment guarantee to a fair trial, and the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u201d In support of his contentions, Swisher merely refers this Court to a memorandum of law that he filed in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">We hold that Swisher\u2019s assertions are insufficient and constitute a procedural default. \u201cAn appellant who asserts that a trial court\u2019s ruling was erroneous has an obligation to state clearly to the appellate court the grounds for that assertion. A cross-reference to arguments made at trial is insufficient.\u201d <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 78, 99, 393 S.E.2d 609, 622, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 908 (1990); <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 445, 460-61, 423 S.E.2d 360, 370 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 1036 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">IV. ISSUES PREVIOUSLY DECIDED</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Swisher raised certain issues on appeal which have been decided adversely to his claims by our previous decisions. We adhere to those rulings, and we will not discuss them further. The issues previously resolved are:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">(1) Whether the defendant should have been granted additional preemptory challenges. <em>See Strickler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 482, 489, 404 S.E.2d 227, 232, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 944 (1991); <em>Quesinberry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 364, 371, 402 S.E.2d 218, 223 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>(1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 834 (1991); <em>Spencer, </em>240 Va. at 84-85, 393 S.E.2d at 613; <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 389, 405, 384 S.E.2d 757, 767 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1063 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">(2) Whether the trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s request to mail a questionnaire to the potential jury venire. <em>See Goins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 454, 470 S.E.2d 114, 122, <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 887 (1996); <em>Strickler, </em>241 Va. at 489-90, 404 S.E.2d at 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">V. BILL OF PARTICULARS</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Swisher filed a motion for a bill of particulars, requesting that the trial court enter an order requiring the Commonwealth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">\u201ca) To identify the grounds, and all of them, on which it contends that defendant is guilty of Capital Murder under . . . Code \u00a7 18.2-31.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">\u201cb) To identify the evidence, and all of it, upon which it intends to rely in seeking a conviction of Defendant upon the charge of Capital Murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">\u201cc) To identify the aggravating factors, if any, upon which it intends to rely in seeking the death penalty, should defendant be convicted of Capital Murder. Additionally:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">\u201c1) If the Commonwealth intends to prove \u2018vileness\u2019 as an aggravating factor, as set out in . . . Code ... \u00a7 19.2-264.4C, to identify as many of the components of the factor, including torture, depravity of mind, and aggravated battery, on which it intends to offer evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">\u201c2) If the Commonwealth intends to prove \u2018vileness\u2019 as an aggravating factor, as set out in . . . Code . . . \u00a7 19.2-264.4C, to further identify every narrowing construction of that factor on which it intends to offer evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">\u201c3) If the Commonwealth intends to prove \u2018future dangerousness\u2019 as an aggravating factor, as set out in . . . Code ... \u00a7 19.2-264.4C and pursuant to . . . Code ... \u00a7 19.2-264.3:2, to identify any unadjudicated allegations of misconduct by defendant upon which it intends to offer evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>dence and any circumstances of the offense it contends are relevant to proof of the factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">\u201c4) If the Commonwealth intends to prove \u2018future dangerousness\u2019 as an aggravating factor, as set out in . . . Code ... \u00a7 19.2-264.4C and pursuant to . . . Code ... \u00a7 19.2-264.3:2, to further identify every narrowing construction of that factor on which it intends to offer evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">\u201cd) To identify the evidence, and all of it, on which it intends to rely in support of the aggravating factors identified, and all other evidence which it intends to introduce in support of its contention that death is the appropriate punishment for this Defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Swisher essentially contends that the Commonwealth should have been required to identify its evidence so that he could have made pretrial challenges to the application of Virginia\u2019s capital murder statute. Swisher also asserts that the aforementioned bill of particulars was needed to: insure that he would have effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment; assist him in challenging the suppression of certain evidence and; assist him in challenging the constitutionality of the vileness and future dangerousness factors in Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4, one of which must be established before the death penalty may be imposed. We disagree with Swisher.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u201cThe purpose of a bill of particulars is to state sufficient facts regarding the crime to inform an accused in advance of the offense for which he is to be tried. He is entitled to no more.\u201d <em>Hevener </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 802, 814, 54 S.E.2d 893, 899 (1949); <em>accord Goins, </em>251 Va. at 454, 470 S.E.2d at 123; <em>Quesinberry, </em>241 Va. at 372, 402 S.E.2d at 223, <em>Strickler, </em>241 Va. at 490-91, 404 S.E.2d at 233. A defendant is not entitled to a bill of particulars as a matter of right. <em>Quesinberry, </em>241 Va. at 372, 402 S.E.2d at 223. Rather, Code \u00a7 19.2-230 states that a trial court \u201cmay direct the filing of a bill of particulars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The trial court\u2019s decision whether to require the Commonwealth to file a bill of particulars is a matter that rests within its sound discretion. <em>Goins, </em>251 Va. at 454, 470 S.E.2d at 123; <em>Quesinberry, </em>241 Va. at 372, 402 S.E.2d at 223. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Swisher\u2019s motion. The indictment adequately informed Swisher of the charged offenses, and we are of opinion Swisher did not wish to use the bill to challenge the suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ciency of the indictment, but, as he has admitted in his brief, he desired the bill of particulars for other reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Furthermore, Paragraphs B and D are simply demands for pre-trial disclosure of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence to be introduced at trial and, as we have held, there is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, even when a capital offense is charged. <em>See Strickler, </em>241 Va. at 490-91, 404 S.E.2d at 233. We do note that the Commonwealth, as required by Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3:2, provided Swisher with evidence of unadjudicated conduct that the Commonwealth planned to use to establish his future dangerousness, and Swisher does not claim that such information was not given to him. Moreover, as the trial court observed, Swisher was aware, well before trial, of the entirety of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence through the Commonwealth\u2019s undisputed open file policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">VI. DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTIONS TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"A3L\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Swisher filed a motion to suppress a confession that he made to the deputies after he had been given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and the trial court denied the motion. On appeal, Swisher contends that his confessions were \u201cmade at a time when he had not been advised of his rights to remain silent and his right to counsel and were not made within the guidelines of the standards set forth in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966).\u201d We disagree with Swisher.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">In <em>Miranda, </em>the Supreme Court held that an individual must be warned before questioning by police of his right to remain silent and his right to an attorney only when that \u201cindividual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478. The Supreme Court subsequently explained in <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495 (1977), that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are implicated only during a custodial interrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">\u201cAny interview of one suspected of a crime by a police officer will have coercive aspects to it, simply by virtue of the fact that the police officer is part of a law enforcement system which may ultimately cause the suspect to be charged with a crime. But police officers are not required to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to everyone whom they question. Nor is the requirement of warnings to be imposed simply because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>questioning takes place in the station house, or because the questioned person is one whom the police suspect. <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required only where there has been such a restriction on a person\u2019s freedom as to render him \u2018in custody.\u2019 It was <em>that </em>sort of coercive environment to which <em>Miranda </em>by its terms was made applicable, and to which it is limited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">We have also observed that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not required in every instance when a suspect is interrogated at a police office. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 47, 307 S.E.2d 864, 872 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1109 (1984). We have stated that \u201c[i]t is the custodial nature rather than the location of the interrogation that triggers the necessity for giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 307 S.E.2d at 872; <em>accord Burket </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 596, 605, 450 S.E.2d 124, 129 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1053 (1995); <em>see Beckwith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>425 U.S. 341, 346 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Applying these principles, we hold that the deputies did not violate Swisher\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. Initially, we note that Swisher did not make any incriminating statements between the time he left his uncles\u2019 house and the time he was placed under arrest at 12:05 a.m. on February 24. Before Swisher was arrested, the deputies informed him that he was free to leave the Sheriff\u2019s Office. After Swisher was arrested, he was informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights twice. The record reveals that his confession was made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently, <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 475, and that his confession was \u201cthe product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker.\u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225 (1973); <em>accord Roach </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 324, 340-41, 468 S.E.2d 98, 108, <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 951 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Swisher filed a motion to suppress \u201call evidence, oral and physical, including any statements made by [him], whether prior to or subsequent to his arrest, and any property seized as a result of the arrest, detention or interrogation of [him]\u201d and any property \u201cseized by a warrantless search of the premises occupied by [him], and any property or goods seized by virtue of the search warrant for [his] body, which warrant was issued ... on [February 25, 1997].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Swisher contends that: his arrest was illegal; the deputies unlawfully searched and seized certain items from the house where he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>lived and; the deputies unlawfully searched his person by obtaining pubic hair, head hair, and blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">When the deputies went to Swisher\u2019s uncles\u2019 house, they knocked on the door, and one of Swisher\u2019s uncles permitted the deputies to enter. As we have already stated, the deputies asked Swisher to accompany them to the Sheriff\u2019s Office, and he voluntarily agreed to do so. As Swisher was about to leave the house, one of the deputies asked Swisher if he would like to take a jacket with him because it was cold outside. A deputy helped Swisher put the jacket on.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">At the Sheriff\u2019s Office, Sergeant A.C. Powers noticed a few dark spots on Swisher\u2019s jacket, and he asked Swisher for permission to test the jacket to determine whether the spots were blood. Swisher replied, \u201c[tjhat\u2019s all right with me, because I don\u2019t know nothing about what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d When the test showed that blood was present on the jacket, Sergeant Lemerise asked Swisher for permission to send the jacket to a forensic laboratory for further testing and Swisher agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">While Swisher was still at the Sheriff\u2019s Office, some of the deputies asked one of Swisher\u2019s uncles for permission to search two large \u201cbum barrels\u201d which were on the uncles\u2019 property. The uncle gave the deputies permission to search, and they recovered several items from the barrels, including burned sneakers and a green shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">On February 24, 1997, some deputies returned to Swisher\u2019s uncles\u2019 house and asked William Swisher for permission to search the premises. The deputies gave William Swisher a consent form and told him that he did not have to consent to a search. William Swisher gave the deputies permission to search, and he signed the consent form.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">We hold that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence because the defendant\u2019s uncles gave the deputies consent to search the house and the \u201cbum barrels.\u201d We also note that none of the items taken from the consensual search of the \u201cbum barrels\u201d was admitted in evidence at Swisher\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Additionally, the trial court did not err in refusing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the jacket. Swisher gave the deputies consent to test his jacket. The evidence of record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that in each instance, Swisher\u2019s consent was voluntary. <em>See Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 327, 356 S.E.2d 157, 164, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 873 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>We do not consider Swisher\u2019s conclusional statement that his arrest was illegal and, therefore, his pubic hairs, head hairs, and blood were illegally seized. Swisher does not assign as error that he was subject to an illegal arrest. Thus, this argument is beyond the scope of any assignment of error, and it is procedurally defaulted. Rule 5:17(c); <em>Burket, </em>248 Va. at 613, 450 S.E.2d at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">VH. VENUE</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Swisher argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a change of venue because the media coverage of his crime was purportedly inflammatory and contained information regarding his confession. Swisher asserts that these aspects of the media coverage required a change of venue in order to protect the rights afforded him under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">There is a presumption that a defendant can receive a fair trial from the citizens of the jurisdiction where the crimes occurred. The defendant must overcome this presumption by demonstrating that the feeling of prejudice on the part of the citizenry is widespread and is such that would \u201cbe reasonably certain to prevent a fair trial.\u201d <em>Mueller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 386, 398, 422 S.E.2d 380, 388 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 1043 (1993) (quoting <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 137, 314 S.E.2d 371, 380, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873 (1984) (citation omitted)). The decision whether to grant a change of venue rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Roach, </em>251 Va. at 342, 468 S.E.2d at 109. The trial court\u2019s ruling whether to change venue will not be disturbed on appeal unless the record affirmatively shows an abuse of discretion. <em>Mueller, </em>244 Va. at 398, 422 S.E.2d at 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Extensive media coverage about an accused and his crimes does not necessarily require a change of venue. <em>Buchanan, </em>238 Va. at 407, 384 S.E.2d at 767-68. Additionally, a significant factor that the trial court must consider is \u201cthe difficulty encountered in selecting a jury.\u201d <em>Mueller, </em>244 Va. at 398, 422 S.E.2d at 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Swisher did not overcome the presumption that he could receive a fair trial in Augusta County, and the evidence of record does not affirmatively show that the trial court abused its discretion. Our review of the record reveals that the trial court was able to empanel a jury with relative ease. Swisher does not challenge on the appeal the seating of any juror on the basis of pre-trial publicity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Swisher\u2019s motion for a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">VIH. <em>VOIR DIRE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Swisher argues that the trial court erred in refusing to permit him to ask certain questions to the jury panel during <em>voir dire. </em>Swisher says that because his trial was extensively covered by the media, he should have been permitted to ask a wide range of questions to potential jurors. We disagree with Swisher\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">As we stated in <em>LeVasseur </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 581, 304 S.E.2d 644, 653 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984), \u201c[a] party has no right, statutory or otherwise, to propound any question he wishes, or to extend <em>voir dire </em>questioning <em>ad infinitum. </em>The court must afford a party a full and fair opportunity to ascertain whether prospective jurors \u2018stand indifferent in the cause,\u2019 but the trial judge retains the discretion to determine when the parties have had sufficient opportunity to do so.\u201d Swisher fails to identify any questions that the trial court prohibited. Swisher\u2019s conclusional contention does not specify how the trial court abused its discretion, and he fails to demonstrate how he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">LX. DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Swisher asserts that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the indictment charging him with capital murder under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(1), which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">\u201cThe following offenses shall constitute capital murder, punishable as a Class 1 felony:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">1. The willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing of any person in the commission of abduction, as defined in \u00a7 18.2-48, when such abduction was committed with the intent to extort money or a pecuniary benefit or with the intent to defile the victim of such abduction;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">Swisher claims that the term intent \u201cto defile\u201d fails to inform \u201ca defendant or any person of ordinary intelligence of what conduct makes him eligible for a death sentence through commission of capital murder.\u201d Continuing, Swisher says that the term intent \u201cto defile\u201d does not provide sufficient guidance to the jury as it considers whether to impose the sentence of death. Swisher claims that these purported statutory deficiencies contravene his constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We find no merit in Swisher\u2019s contentions. An act which creates a statutory offense \u201cmust specify with reasonable certainty and definiteness the conduct which is commanded or prohibited . . . so that a person of ordinary intelligence may know what is thereby required of him.\u201d <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>198 Va. 454, 458, 94 S.E.2d 537, 540 (1956); <em>McCutcheon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 30, 35, 294 S.E.2d 808, 811 (1982). We have stated that the phrase intent \u201cto defile\u201d is interchangeable, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-48, with the phrase \u201csexually molest.\u201d <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 519, 525 n.2, 323 S.E.2d 572, 576 n.2 (1984); <em>see Wilson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 95, 103-04, 452 S.E.2d 669, 675, <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 841 (1995). We are of the opinion that a person of ordinary intelligence would also conclude that the term intent \u201cto defile\u201d is interchangeable with the phrase intent to \u201csexually molest.\u201d Thus, we hold that the indictment adequately informed Swisher of the charges against him and that the jury would have concluded that the term intent \u201cto defile\u201d was synonymous with the phrase intent to \u201csexually molest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">X. ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">As we have already stated, Patricia Taylor testified as an expert witness on the subject of DNA on behalf of the Commonwealth. During her direct examination, Taylor testified that the DNA profile obtained from sperm found in Snyder\u2019s rectum, vagina, esophagus, and stomach was consistent with the mixture of DNA profiles of Swisher and Snyder, that sperm found on the crotch of Snyder\u2019s panties was consistent with Swisher\u2019s DNA, and that blood found on Swisher\u2019s coat was consistent with the DNA profile of Snyder.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">During cross-examination, Swisher attempted to examine Taylor about \u201cgenetic material\u201d found on a pillowcase which had not been admitted in evidence. The Commonwealth objected to the defendant\u2019s questions about the pillowcase on the basis that the pillowcase had not been admitted in evidence, and the pillowcase was not relevant to any issues at trial. The trial court gave Swisher\u2019s counsel several opportunities to explain to the court the relevance of the pillowcase. The trial court ruled that Swisher\u2019s questions about the pillowcase were not relevant because the pillowcase had not been admitted in evidence, no chain of custody had been established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>which would permit the admission of the pillowcase in evidence, and testimony about the pillowcase would only be confusing to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The decision to refuse or admit evidence based on relevance rests within the discretion of the trial court, <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>253 Va. 373, 384-85, 484 S.E.2d 898, 905, <em>cert. </em>denied, _ U.S. _, 118 S.Ct. 608 (1997), and we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Indeed, Swisher\u2019s counsel was unable to demonstrate either in the trial court or on brief why the questions about the pillowcase were relevant to any issues at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">XI. JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Swisher proffered the following jury instructions which were refused by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">\u201cINSTRUCTION NO. R-l</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-12\">\u201cIf you find that the defendant was so greatly intoxicated by the voluntary use of alcohol and drugs that he was incapable of deliberating or premeditating, then you cannot find him guilty of capital murder or murder in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-13\">\u201cVoluntary intoxication is not a defense to second degree murder or manslaughter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-14\">\u201cINSTRUCTION NO. Q</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-15\">\u201cYou have been instructed on more than one grade of homicide and if you have a reasonable doubt as to the grade of the offense, then you must resolve that doubt in favor of the defendant, and find him guilty of the lesser offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-16\">\u201cFor example, if you have a reasonable doubt as to whether he is guilty of capital murder or first degree murder, you shall find him guilty of first degree murder. If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether he is guilty of first degree murder or second degree murder, you shall find him guilty of second degree murder or of voluntary manslaughter. If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether he is guilty at all, you shall find him not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-17\">Swisher, who stated in his confession to the deputies that he had consumed crack cocaine and alcohol on the day of the murder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>argues that the trial court erred by refusing to grant Instruction R-l. Swisher says that the trial court erred by refusing to grant Instruction Q because \u201cthe evidence was that [he] was on crack cocaine and one of the effects of the drug is that it inflames the passions of the user.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Swisher\u2019s assertions are without merit. Generally, voluntary intoxication is not an excuse for any crime. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 627, 629, 363 S.E.2d 711, 712 (1988). We have stated that the only exception to this general rule is in cases involving deliberate and premeditated murder. <em>Id. </em>Even though it has long been the rule in this Commonwealth that a defendant may negate the specific intent requisite for capital murder or first degree murder by showing that he was so greatly intoxicated that he was incapable of deliberation or premeditation, <em>Essex </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 273, 281-82, 322 S.E.2d 216, 219-20 (1984); <em>Fitzgerald, </em>223 Va. at 631, 292 S.E.2d at 807; <em>Giarratano </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1064, 1073, 266 S.E.2d 94, 99 (1980), \u201c[voluntary immediate drunkenness is not admissible to disprove malice or [to] reduce the offense to manslaughter.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>135 Va. 524, 531, 115 S.E. 673, 676 (1923) (quoting <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 929, 926 (1879)).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">We hold that the trial court properly refused the defendant\u2019s proposed instructions because these instructions contained incorrect statements of the law. The proposed instructions would have permitted the jury to find the defendant guilty of manslaughter because of his purported voluntary intoxication, which is contrary to the common law of this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Xfl. SENTENCE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Former Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(2) requires this Court to review the imposition of the sentence of death imposed upon Swisher, based on the trial record, to determine whether (i) the sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, or (ii) the sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant. We observe that Swisher does not contend that the death penalty was imposed under the influence of any of the above factors prohibited by the statute, nor does he contend that the sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Nevertheless, we have examined the records of all capital cases reviewed by this court, pursuant to former Code \u00a7 17-110.1(E). <em>See Barnabei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 161, 179-80, 477 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>270, 281 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 U.S. 1224 (1997); <em>Breard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 68, 89, 445 S.E.2d 670, 682, <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 971 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Upon review of these cases, as well as cases in which life imprisonment was imposed, we hold that Swisher\u2019s sentence of death is neither excessive nor disproportionate to sentences generally imposed by other sentencing bodies in Virginia for crimes of a similar nature. Furthermore, based upon our review of the record, we find nothing that suggests that Swisher\u2019s sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">xm. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">We find no reversible error in the issues presented here. Having reviewed all Swisher\u2019s contentions and the imposition of Swisher\u2019s sentence of death pursuant to former Code \u00a7 17-110.1, we hold that the conviction of capital murder and sentence of death will be affirmed, and we will also affirm the judgments entered for Swisher\u2019s non-capital convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Record No. 980677 \u2014 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AvJ\">Record No. 980678 \u2014 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b497-11\"> Effective October 1, 1998, Title 17 was superseded by Title 17.1.
