In a motion for judgment alleging negligence on the part of Massanutten, Thomas\u2019s wife and guardian, Patricia Stone Hoar (the Guardian), sought recovery of damages for Thomas\u2019s injuries. A jury returned a verdict in the Guardian\u2019s favor in the amount of $6,170,563.00. Upon motion of Massanutten, the trial court set the verdict aside and entered judgment in favor of Massanutten. We awarded the Guardian this appeal and granted Massanutten\u2019s assignments of cross-error.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">At the outset, Massanutten raises a question concerning the standard we should apply in reviewing the judgment of the trial court. Massanutten argues that when a trial court sets aside a jury verdict, the verdict is not entitled to the same weight as one that has been approved by the court. <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>249 Va. 555, 556-57, 457 S.E.2d 22, 23 (1995). Massanutten also asserts that the jury verdict in this case is entitled to little or no weight because it was in the exact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>amount of Thomas\u2019s special damages. When such a verdict is returned, Massanutten says, \u201cit bespeaks a compromise . . ., the integrity of the jury\u2019s finding on liability is suspect, and the . . . finding on liability is impeached.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Bartholomew, </em>224 Va. 421, 433-34, 297 S.E.2d 675, 681-82 (1982). Further, Massanutten maintains, the trial court was of opinion there was no evidence to support the verdict in any event. Additionally, Massanutten says, neither party seeks a new trial. \u201cUnder these circumstances,\u201d Massanutten concludes, \u201cthe standard of review should focus on whether there is evidence to support the trial court\u2019s action entering judgment for Massanutten rather than whether there is evidence to support the jury verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">However, it is the established rule that \u201c[e]ven though the trial court [has] set the verdict aside, we [will] state the facts and reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the [party] who prevailed before the jury.\u201d <em>Stump v. Doe, </em>250 Va. 57, 58, 458 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1995). <em>See also Griffett v. Ryan, </em>247 Va. 465, 467, 443 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1994). \u201c[A]nd if there is any credible evidence in the record that supports the verdict, we must reinstate that verdict and enter judgment thereon.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Stated in the light most favorable to the Guardian, the evidence shows that on January 17, 1992, two days before Thomas\u2019s accident, Massanutten opened to the public a new, more advanced ski trail, known as \u201cDiamond Jim.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This trail was built in a heavily wooded area by a \u201ccut and fill\u201d process, which is used when a ski run does not follow the natural \u201cfall line\u201d of a hill or mountain. According to an expert witness called by the Guardian, \u201c[t]he fall line of a hill or a slope is the direction a ball would roll if you were to let it go and it rolled slowly [or] the direction water would flow if left to itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In the cut and fill process, the side of a hill or mountain is cut away to form one side of a ski run and the excavated soil is used to fill in the opposite side to make the run even and to double its width. In the area of Diamond Jim where Thomas was injured, the cut and fill process created a \u201cdrop-off,\u201d having a vertical drop of some thirty feet, on the left side of the downhill ski run.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The bottom of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the drop-off contained rocks and logs. The drop-off also had a double fall line, meaning that the hypothetical ball \u201cwouldn\u2019t go straight down the middle of [the ski] run [but] would taper off [to the bottom of the drop-off].\u201d The cut and fill process also left a gap between the left edge of the ski run and the tree line, which bordered the remainder of the run on both sides, eliminating a \u201cvisual cue to the skier that this is the edge of the trail, don\u2019t go over here.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The groomed area of the ski run had a snow depth of two feet. The snow surface was \u201cvery hard packed\u201d and the ground was \u201cextremely hard.\u201d A \u201cberm\u201d of snow, one foot higher than the groomed area, ran along the left edge of the run and the snow tapered off to a depth of only a few inches at the bottom of the drop-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Prior to Thomas\u2019s accident, Massanutten had ordered and received a shipment of bright orange \u201cwarning barrier fencing\u201d for use on Diamond Jim. At the time of the accident, Massanutten had installed fence posts in the area where Thomas was injured, but had not yet attached the bright orange fencing; the fencing was installed \u201ca couple days later.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">As a result of his brain injury, Thomas is incompetent and was unable to testify. A friend, George Archer Marston (Marston), a civil engineer who accompanied Thomas to the Massanutten ski resort on the occasion in question, testified as a witness for the Guardian. According to Marston\u2019s testimony, he and Thomas, both experienced skiers, purchased lift tickets and began skiing about 9:00 a.m. on January 19, 1992. After warming up on some of the easier slopes, they took a chair lift to Diamond Jim. At the time, Diamond Jim had been groomed to its left edge, permitting skiers to ski all the way to that edge. In addition, snowmaking machinery was blowing snow across the ski run, blinding skiers using the right side of the run. Also, there were \u201cmoguls\u201d in the center of the ski run, but none on the edges.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Thomas and Marston skied down the left side of Diamond Jim without incident. They then took the chair lift for a second trip down Diamond Jim. After skiing about halfway down the run, they stopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>at a sign marked \u201cslow,\u201d below which the slope steepened, and talked for a couple of minutes. Thomas decided to ski down the left side of the run and, not \u201cgoing fast,\u201d skied to the left laterally across the slope, with Marston following.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Marston stated that shortly before Thomas reached the edge of the slope, he \u201ccaught an edge and lost his balance^<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] bent at the knees and kind of sat down on the back of his skis and then slid off the edge of the slope out of . . . sight.\u201d Marston skied \u201cright up to the edge expecting to find [Thomas] adjacent to the slope, maybe six to eight feet below the edge of the slope,\u201d but instead \u201cfound this very steep, large vertical drop.\u201d Thomas was lying between two logs at the bottom of the drop, \u201cprobably laterally a hundred feet away from [Marston and] over 30 feet vertically below [him].\u201d Thomas was unconscious and bleeding from his nose, mouth, and one ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Marston also testified that on his first trip down Diamond Jim on the morning of January 19, he did not see the steep drop-off. Marston stated further that, when he went to see what had happened when Thomas slid out of sight, he had to ski \u201cright up to the edge[,] . . . probably three to five feet from the edge,\u201d before he realized the extent of the drop-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Dr. James Broderson (Dr. Broderson), a dentist who had skied at the Massanutten resort many times, was called as a witness by Massanutten. He skied down Diamond Jim on the morning of January 19, 1992, just ahead of Thomas. Dr. Broderson stopped approximately twenty feet downhill from the \u201cslow\u201d sign to make sure the course was clear before he \u201chead[ed] on down.\u201d He observed Thomas skiing toward the left side of the slope, then trying \u201cto initiate a turn to the right\u201d but either catching an edge or crossing his skis, and falling forward \u201c[o]ut of control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">After Thomas was carried away, Dr. Broderson went to the bottom of the drop-off where Thomas had been lying to look \u201cfor some evidence of how it was that [Thomas] got hurt.\u201d There, Dr. Broderson found what appeared to be \u201can impact zone with a log.\u201d There was \u201c[e]ither skin\u201d or \u201cmaybe a little fiber something . . . that looked like he had . . . hit . . . there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Dr. Broderson had seen \u201cnumerous tumbles like [Thomas\u2019s where] no one had been hurt, so [he] didn\u2019t think [Thomas] would be hurt from what [he] saw.\u201d Dr. Broderson explained, however, that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>had \u201cnever been over to that edge and looked over.\u201d He thought that the ski \u201cslope possibly continued out\u201d and was approximately \u201clevel,\u201d that \u201cyou could probably ski around [the left side] like you did on the right side,\u201d where there was \u201ca little easier way to go down the slope.\u201d He \u201cdidn\u2019t realize there was an embankment\u201d; he \u201cknew there was a little drop-off, but . . . had no idea it was like what it was there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Dr. Gregory O\u2019Shanick, a specialist in brain injuries, began treating Thomas in June of 1994. Dr. O\u2019Shanick testified that the object which produced the injuries suffered by Thomas \u201cwould have to be something that was hard, something that was firm, that was not yielding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">At trial, the Guardian based her case for liability solely on the proposition that Massanutten was negligent in failing to warn skiers of the existence of the drop-off. In setting aside the jury verdict, the trial court, while approving the jury\u2019s finding in favor of Thomas on assumption of risk and contributory negligence, ruled: (1) that without expert testimony \u201cas to what was the standard of care in the industry,\u201d a lay jury could not \u201cdecide what would be an unreasonable risk\u201d; (2) that there was no evidence to demonstrate that, had a warning been provided, it \u201cwould . . . have made any difference\u201d; and (3) that there was no showing \u201cthat it was more probable . . . that the injury occurred after [Thomas] went over the bank than before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\n<em>Expert Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">At trial, the Guardian presented the testimony of Richard Penniman (Penniman), an expert in skiing safety. The Guardian asked Penniman whether he was familiar with \u201cthe skier\u2019s code of responsibility.\u201d Upon receiving an affirmative answer, the Guardian asked Penniman whether there was \u201ca written ski operator\u2019s responsibility.\u201d Massanutten objected to the question, and the trial court responded that \u201c[t]he standard of care in the industry may be a relevant matter for the jury to consider,\u201d and allowed the Guardian to proceed. Penniman replied that there was no operator\u2019s responsibility code.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The Guardian then asked Penniman if he had \u201can opinion whether a warning was necessary in the area where Tommy Hoar went off\u201d the ski slope. Massanutten objected to the form of the question, and the trial court sustained the objection. The Guardian did not rephrase the question or pursue the matter further but made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>proffer of the testimony Penniman would have given. Nor did the Guardian object when Massanutten later produced expert testimony concerning whether the Diamond Jim trail was marked appropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The Guardian now maintains that she \u201cwas not required to produce expert testimony as to the standard of care of ski area operators in the ski industry.\u201d She says that \u201c[wjhether a ski area ought to alert skiers to potential hazards or obstacles on a ski slope\u201d is a matter \u201cas to which [jurors] are as competent to form an opinion as the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Massanutten contends, on the other hand, that under <em>Burch </em>v. <em>Grace Street Building Corp., </em>168 Va. 329, 340, 191 S.E. 672, 677 (1937), the Guardian is estopped from taking a position inconsistent with one she assumed previously. Massanutten says that having \u201cattempted to create a factual issue of the standard of care ... by trying to elicit . . . testimony from [her] expert Penniman\u201d concerning the existence of the duty to warn, the Guardian \u201cis not permitted now to take the inconsistent position that the same duty exists as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The Guardian\u2019s present position that expert testimony was not required to establish the duty to warn is not inconsistent with, but alternative to, her unsuccessful attempt to establish the duty through expert testimony. It is not unusual in the trial of a case for a litigant to find himself blocked in an effort to establish a point in a certain manner and then have to resort to a different approach to make the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">It is the rule in Virginia that a litigant \u201cmay plead alternative facts and theories of recovery\u201d and \u201cstate as many separate claims or defenses as he has regardless of consistency.\u201d Rule 1:4(k). <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-281(A); <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Horn, </em>248 Va. 417, 423, 448 S.E.2d 403, 406 (1994). We perceive no reason why the considerations supporting this rule should not also support a litigant\u2019s shift to an alternative position in a situation like the present case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Citing Rule 5:25, Massanutten also contends that by failing to object to Massanutten\u2019s use of expert testimony to describe the standard of care and by trying to elicit such testimony herself, the Guardian has failed to preserve an objection to Massanutten\u2019s use of expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>testimony at trial. However, the Guardian is not complaining of <em>Massanutten\u2019s </em>use of expert testimony but of the trial court\u2019s ruling that <em>she </em>was required to produce expert testimony to establish a standard of care. Her assignment of error on the point states that the trial court erred in setting the verdict aside \u201con the grounds that expert testimony was required to prove whether the drop-off . . . posed an unreasonable risk of injury as to which [Massanutten] had a duty to warn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Next, Massanutten argues that \u201cthe introduction of expert testimony concerning the standard of care with respect to ski slope operators\u2019 duty to warn was appropriate and, indeed, required in this case.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In <em>Board of Supervisors v. Lake Services, Inc., </em>247 Va. 293, 440 S.E.2d 600 (1994), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">Expert testimony is inadmissible regarding \u201cmatters of common knowledge\u201d or subjects \u201csuch that [persons] of ordinary intelligence are capable of comprehending them, forming an intelligent opinion about them, and drawing their own conclusions therefrom.\u201d Thus, when the question presented can be resolved by determining what precautions a reasonably prudent person would have taken under like circumstances, no expert testimony is required or permitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">Further, expert testimony is admissible only when specialized skill and knowledge are required to evaluate the merits of a claim. Issues of this type generally arise in cases involving the practice of professions requiring advanced, specialized education, such as engineering, medicine, and law, or those involving trades that focus upon scientific matters, such as electricity and blasting, which a jury cannot understand without expert assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 297, 440 S.E.2d at 602 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Here, the issue, as framed by one of the instructions granted below, was whether Massanutten, in the exercise of ordinary care, was obligated to warn skiers of an unsafe condition that was not open and obvious. This was not a complicated or technical issue, and its resolution did not require specialized skill or knowledge. Rather, it concerned matters of common knowledge that jurors, with the application of a reasonable amount of common sense, are as competent of understanding and deciding as the expert witness. Indeed, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Kenneth Hess (Hess), Massanutten\u2019s assistant ski area manager, put it in his testimony: \u201cCommon sense tells you that you ought to tell people that there\u2019s a problem on a ski slope that\u2019s not easily identifiable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Finally, by way of cross-error, Massanutten contends that the trial court erred in refusing to exclude testimony of the Guardian\u2019s expert witness, Penniman, to the effect that Massanutten had created \u201ca gap in the cut and fill line\u201d and \u201ca recess of the trees [so that the] trees now are way, way back away from where the edge of the fill is [and] the skier no longer has the visual cue that this is the edge of the trail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Massanutten argues that Penniman\u2019s testimony that \u201cthe skier no longer has the visual cue\u201d was inadmissible because it was based upon an assumption not supported by the record, <em>i.e., </em>that \u201cthe edge [of the ski trail] was not visible.\u201d Massanutten also says that this assumption was contradicted by the Guardian\u2019s own witness, Marston, who testified that he \u201ccould tell where [he] thought the edge of the slope was . . . from where [he was] standing at the slow sign.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">However, Penniman\u2019s testimony concerning \u201cthe visual cue\u201d was not . based upon an unsupported assumption but upon his personal observations, made on two visits to the ski slope, and from his having \u201cskied at Massanutten . . . during [his] investigation of [Thomas\u2019s] accident.\u201d And, although Marston, the Guardian\u2019s witness, said he could tell where he thought the edge was from where he had stopped near the \u201cslow\u201d sign, he stated that he did not realize \u201cthe extent of that drop-off . . . until [he] skied right up to the edge\u201d and found \u201cthis very steep, large vertical drop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">But even if Penniman\u2019s testimony varied from Marston\u2019s, it does not follow that Massanutten was entitled to have Penniman\u2019s version excluded. Thomas is the real party plaintiff in this case, and he did not testify. Hence, this situation is not subject to the rule of <em>Massie v. Firmstone, </em>134 Va. 450, 114 S.E. 652 (1922), that a litigant\u2019s \u201cstatements of fact and the necessary inferences therefrom are binding upon him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462, 114 S.E. at 656. Rather, Thomas is entitled to the benefit of the corollary enunciated in <em>Massie v. Firmstone </em>that \u201cwhen two or more witnesses introduced by a party litigant vary in their statements of fact, such party has the right to ask the court or jury to accept as true the statements most favorable to him.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\n<em>Primary Negligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Massanutten cites <em>Whitfield v. Cox, </em>189 Va. 219, 52 S.E.2d 72 (1949), where we said that \u201c[t]he owner or proprietor of a place of [business has the] duty ... to exercise reasonable care for [his invitee\u2019s] safety and protection \u2014 such care as would be exercised by an ordinarily careful and prudent person in the same position and circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223, 52 S.E.2d at 73-74. Massanutten then states that \u201c[i]n order to prove negligence, [the Guardian] had to demonstrate that Massanutten clearly departed from the accepted standard of care followed by ordinary, prudent ski slope operators of similar slopes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Massanutten cites testimony by Marston that he had \u201cseen trails out West that \u2018have probably steeper vertical drops than this off the edge, but they are always either clearly marked <em>or they are clearly visible.' </em>\u201d Massanutten then asserts that, here, \u201cthe uncontradicted evidence of [the Guardian\u2019s] and Massanutten\u2019s witnesses [was] that the day was clear, the edge was visible from 100 feet, it created a horizon[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>], and there was a known drop-off of some unknown dimension.\u201d Thus, says Massanutten, \u201cbecause the condition was \u2018clearly visible,\u2019 there was no need for . . . [a] warning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Continuing, Massanutten submits that it is irrelevant that \u201csomeone else may have marked the trail differently.\u201d The issue, Massanutten states, \u201cis whether evidence exists to prove that Massanutten clearly departed from the accepted standard of care followed by ordinary, prudent ski slope operators of difficult courses when it did not mark the plainly visible edge of a trail beyond which skiers knew they should expect conditions they \u2018may need to avoid.\u2019 \u201d Such evidence, Massanutten concludes, \u201cdoes not exist,\u201d and, \u201c[b]ecause there is no conflict of evidence on this question, the judgment for Massanutten must be affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">However, there was a conflict in the evidence on the question whether the \u201ccondition\u201d existing \u201coff the edge\u201d was plainly visible. As Massanutten stresses, Marston, the Guardian\u2019s witness, said he could tell where he thought the edge was from where he had stopped near the \u201cslow\u201d sign. And Massanutten\u2019s expert witness, Larry D. Heywood (Heywood), testified it was his opinion \u201cthat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>edge of the run . . . where [Thomas] went off was visible from around 100 feet.\u201d But Dr. Broderson, Massanutten\u2019s witness, who also had stopped near the \u201cslow\u201d sign, stated that he thought the ski slope possibly \u201ccontinued out\u201d and was approximately \u201clevel,\u201d providing an \u201ceasier way to go down the slope.\u201d And Penniman, the Guardian\u2019s expert witness, stated that \u201cthe skier no longer has the visual cue that this is the edge of the trail.\u201d This conflict in the evidence presented a typical issue for jury determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">On a similar point, citing an instruction granted below, Massanutten points out that an occupant of premises has a duty to warn of an unsafe condition unless the \u201ccondition is open and obvious to a person using ordinary care for his own safety.\u201d Massanutten repeats what Marston said about seeing the edge from where he stopped at the \u201cslow\u201d sign and about a horizon being \u201ca key giveaway\u201d that there is \u201csteep terrain\u201d beyond it. Massanutten then opines that, with this information available, \u201cit is readily apparent that \u2018a person using ordinary care for his own safety\u2019 would have avoided skiing near the edge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Here again, however, Massanutten is unwilling to recognize there was a conflict in the testimony relating to whether the condition existing off the edge of the ski trail was plainly visible, a conflict that necessarily encompasses the question whether the condition was open and obvious. That question, therefore, was also a matter for jury determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Furthermore, there was a direct conflict in the evidence resulting from the \u201cbattle of the experts\u201d over the crucial issue whether Massanutten should have given warning of the existence of the drop-off, and this conflict alone was sufficient to make a jury issue of Massanutten\u2019s negligence. The Guardian\u2019s expert witness, Penniman, testified that the \u201chidden drop-off\u201d constituted a \u201cdangerous area\u201d and that, according to \u201cthe practice and custom in the ski industry,\u201d a warning in the form of \u201ca simple bamboo and rope fence,\u201d costing about $10, was needed to \u201cinform the skier . . . you don\u2019t want to go here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">On the other hand, Massanutten\u2019s expert witness, Heywood, testified that \u201cthe Diamond Jim run was maintained and marked appropriately [in conformity] with the custom and practice\u201d of the ski industry and, accordingly, that it was not necessary \u201cto put any type of marking on [the drop-off].\u201d Heywood further opined that, according to custom and practice, marking of the drop-off was unnecessary because \u201cskiers are aware that there are edges to the run\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>\u201c[o]ff the edge ... is a variety of things, trees, stumps, rocks, whatever.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Finally, there was a dispute concerning the purpose of the bright orange \u201cwarning barrier fencing\u201d Massanutten had ordered and received but, at the time of Thomas\u2019s accident, had not yet attached to the already-in-place fence posts in the area of the drop-off. Hess, Massanutten\u2019s assistant ski area manager, testified that the purpose of the fencing was \u201c[t]o retain snow on the slope.\u201d However, before Diamond Jim was opened to the public, a letter written by the engineer employed in the construction of Diamond Jim to the slope designer on the project stated that \u201c[fjencing of the high visibility, portable type will need to be installed at various locations to direct the flow of traffic and <em>to indicate possible </em>hazards.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Massanutten devotes a vague footnote to this subject in which it says that the Guardian \u201cjuxtapositions\u201d Massanutten\u2019s ordering of the fencing with the letter from the construction engineer \u201cto infer that Massanutten had planned, but not yet erected, warning fencing at the area of the drop-off.\u201d Not suprisingly, the Guardian does exactly what Massanutten accuses her of. She argues, and we think justifiably so, that \u201c[t]he jury was entitled to infer from this evidence that Massanutten obtained and used this bright orange fencing to warn skiers to maintain a safe distance away from dangerous areas, that it intended to do so at the drop-off on Diamond Jim, and that it was negligent for failing to do so in this instance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\n<em>Causation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">As noted previously, with respect to the issue of causation, the trial court made two rulings. First, the court ruled that there was no evidence to demonstrate that, had a warning been provided, it \u201cwould . . . have made any difference.\u201d Second, the court ruled that there was no showing \u201cthat it was more probable . . . that the injury occurred after [Thomas] went over the bank than before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Concerning the trial court\u2019s first ruling, Penniman, the Guardian\u2019s expert witness, was asked \u201c[w]hat good\u201d a warning would have been to a skier in Thomas\u2019s situation. Penniman responded that \u201ca fence or a rope barricade tells [skiers] that the ski area doesn\u2019t want them over there . . . that it\u2019s hazardous . . . [s]o they behave differently\u201d; \u201c[t]hey aren\u2019t as inclined to get close to that edge\u201d; they \u201cusually approach it much more cautiously\u201d; and if they lose balance, \u201cinstead of trying to regain their balance . . . they will just fall and let themselves come to a stop rather than fight it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Thomas, of course, was unable, because of his disability, to tell the jury whether, had a warning been provided, he would have heeded it in the manner suggested by Penniman. Nor could anyone have spoken for Thomas. But \u201c[frequently material facts are not proven by direct evidence. A verdict may be properly based upon reasonable inferences drawn from the facts. If facts are present from which proper inferences may be drawn this is sufficient.\u201d <em>Northern Virginia Power Co. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>194 Va. 464, 470, 73 S.E.2d 425, 429 (1952). Here, from the circumstances that were proven below, and \u201c[according to the ordinary experience of mankind,\u201d the jury was \u201cwarranted in the conclusion that [Thomas\u2019s] injury would not have occurred had [a warning] been given.\u201d <em>Southern Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Whetzel, </em>159 Va. 796, 807, 167 S.E. 427, 430 (1933). <em>See also Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Lassiter, </em>193 Va. 360, 370, 68 S.E.2d 641, 647 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Concerning the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to the issue whether Thomas\u2019s injury occurred before or after he \u201cwent over the bank,\u201d the issue could be disposed of easily by reference to an admission made by Massanutten in a memorandum supporting its motion to set aside the verdict: \u201cAlthough <em>we know that the injury must have occurred after Mr. Hoar fell and went over the edge, </em>there is no evidence to show in more detail how or why he hit his head so as to cause the brain injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Aside from the admission, Dr. Broderson\u2019s testimony showed clearly that Thomas\u2019s injury occurred <em>after </em>he \u201cwent over the bank.\u201d Dr. Broderson was asked: \u201c[W]hen [Thomas] fell forward, where was he in relation to the edge of the trail?\u201d Dr. Broderson replied that Thomas \u201cwas actually over \u2014 slightly over the embankment from the time he fell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Furthermore, there is Dr. Broderson\u2019s testimony that he found what appeared to be \u201can impact zone with a log\u201d and a substance that was \u201c[e]ither skin\u201d or \u201cmaybe a little fiber something . . . that looked like [Thomas] had . . . hit . . . there.\u201d This testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>sufficient to supply the final link in the chain of causation from Massanutten\u2019s negligence to Thomas\u2019s injury, permitting the jury to find from all the evidence that Thomas sustained his injury by striking the log after falling to the bottom of the drop-off and not, as Massanutten hypothesizes, by striking \u201cthe hard packed snow which he would have struck when he tumbled head first at the edge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\">\n<em>Assumption of Risk and Contributory Negligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">By way of cross-error, Massanutten contends that the trial court erred in failing to find as a matter of law that Thomas assumed the risk of injury and was guilty of contributory negligence. With respect to assumption of risk, Massanutten engages in a discussion of the theory of inherent risks, a theory, as Massanutten acknowledges, \u201cVirginia case law has not had an opportunity to develop\u201d in skiing cases. The courts of other jurisdictions, Massanutten says, have applied the theory and barred recovery for ski injuries where \u201cthe accident resulted from [risks] inherent [in skiing] and not from negligent operation of the course.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">However, the jury in this case was instructed according to familiar principles that if Thomas \u201cfully understood the nature and extent of a known danger, and if he voluntarily exposed himself to it, he assumed the risk of injuring himself from that danger\u201d and could not recover for his injuries. The jury was also instructed that Massanutten had the duty of proving the defense of assumption of risk by the greater weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Massanutten makes no complaint about these instructions. They constitute the law of the case, and they do not incorporate the theory of inherent risks. Accordingly, we will make our decision guided by the principles enunciated in the instructions independent of that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We agree with the trial court that whether Thomas assumed the risk of injury was a matter for the jury to determine. Here, again, Massanutten asserts that there was no conflict concerning the subject. Yet, there was dispute about practically every facet of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>relating to whether Thomas fully understood the nature and extent of the danger and voluntarily exposed himself to it. The standard to be applied in an assumption of the risk case \u201c \u2018is a subjective one, of what the particular plaintiff in fact sees, knows, understands and appreciates.\u2019 \u201d <em>Amusement Slides Corp. v. Lehmann, </em>217 Va. 815, 818-19, 232 S.E.2d 803, 805 (1977) (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 496D, Comment c (1965)). These were matters peculiarly within the province of the jury and properly left to it for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">We take the same view of the question of contributory negligence. The standard here is an objective one, whether Thomas acted for his own safety as a reasonable person would have acted under similar circumstances. <em>See Artrip v. E.E. Berry Equip. Co., </em>240 Va. 354, 358, 397 S.E.2d 821, 824 (1990). The jury was so instructed. The jury was also instructed that Thomas had the right to assume the premises were reasonably safe for his visit unless he knew or should have known of an unsafe condition or used the premises in a manner exceeding the scope of the invitation. Considering the conflicting evidence in this case in light of these principles, we think reasonable minds could differ on the question whether Thomas acted for his own safety as a reasonable person would have acted. Hence, the trial court did not err in submitting the question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">For the reasons assigned, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court, reinstate the jury verdict, and enter final judgment thereon in favor of the Guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\"> Ski trails are marked according to their relative difficulty at each ski resort.

There, the plaintiffs elicited expert testimony to create factual issues of the existence of the defendant\u2019s duties and then took the position that the same issues were matters of law, suitable for jury instructions. Here, the Guardian was unsuccessful in her attempt to elicit expert testimony and only then took the position that such testimony was not required.

Massanutten says that the testimony \u201conly compared Massanutten with other facilities and custom and practice\u201d and that \u201ccomparison with what others may do is not the question.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 25, 77 S.E.2d at 374. However, it should not escape notice that Massanutten presented precisely the same character of testimony on the same subject through its expert witness, Heywood. Hence, Massanutten will not be heard to complain. <em>See Hoier </em>v. <em>Noel, </em>199 Va. 151, 155, 98 S.E.2d 673, 676 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\"> The out-of-state cases cited by Massanutten are <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Sunday River Skiway Corp., </em>79 F.3d 204 (1st Cir. 1996) (applying Maine statute, moguls held inherent risk of skiing); <em>Connelly v.
