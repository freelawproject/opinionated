Brown, the plaintiff below, was injured-in a collision in Prince George County between a motorcycle he was operating and a motor vehicle driven by appellant Robert E. Meyer, the defendant below. In October 1996, the plaintiff filed the present negligence action against defendant in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond seeking recovery in damages for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The defendant filed an objection to venue and moved the trial court to transfer the action to either the Circuit Court of Prince George County or the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County. The defendant asserted that venue was not proper in the City of Richmond because the accident happened in Prince George County and defendant \u201cresides and works in Chesterfield County.\u201d Following a hearing, at which the parties presented defendant\u2019s deposition on the issue, the trial court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The case proceeded to trial before a jury, which fixed plaintiff\u2019s damages at $1 million. The court entered judgment on the verdict and we awarded defendant this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Defendant assigns three errors, but we shall discuss only the second: \u201cThe court erred in ruling that [defendant] was subject to venue in the City of Richmond when the accident sued upon happened in Prince George County and [defendant] lived and worked in Chesterfield County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Code \u00a7 8.01-260 provides, as pertinent to this appeal, that \u201cthe venue for any action shall be deemed proper only if laid in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-261 and 8.01-262.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-261, enumerating forums deemed \u201cpreferred\u201d places of venue, is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Code \u00a7 8.01-262, enumerating \u201cpermissible\u201d forums, applies. In subsection (3), the statute provides that a permissible forum shall be a county or city \u201c[w]herein the defendant regularly conducts affairs or business activity.\u201d The question then becomes whether, under the facts presented, this defendant regularly conducted affairs or business activity in the City of Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">According to defendant\u2019s deposition testimony, given upon examination by plaintiff\u2019s attorney, defendant was a 20-year employee of Tredegar Industries, which is \u201cbasically an aluminum and plastics company.\u201d The defendant, a resident of Chesterfield County, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>worked at the company\u2019s Chesterfield County business location since 1989. He was Tredegar\u2019s \u201cinsurance manager,\u201d administering company property and casualty insurance. Defendant\u2019s employer owned no facility within the City of Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Defendant\u2019s employment required him \u201cto go into\u201d the City \u201c[o]n occasion\u201d to confer with two separate insurance brokers, which maintained offices within the City. He would visit one broker \u201c[n]ot more than once a year\u201d and would \u201cbe in the office\u201d of the other \u201c[m]aybe six times during the year.\u201d Visits to the brokers were \u201cspaced out\u201d during the year but occurred \u201ca little more often in the fall\u201d in connection with discussions regarding January 1 renewals of insurance contracts. Defendant\u2019s job duties also required him to attend insurance seminars \u201cperhaps\u201d three times a year at private clubs within the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Defendant also testified he travelled through the City \u201c[tjwice a year, perhaps\u201d on \u201cpleasure\u201d trips en route to Northern Virginia to visit a son. Additionally, he said, he was \u201cin the City of Richmond either to pass through or stop somewhere for whatever reason no more than four or five times in a year on average.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">According to the testimony, defendant \u201cnever\u201d enters the City for entertainment, for \u201cshopping,\u201d or for medical attention. He belongs to no professional or social organizations located within the City and he has not been in the City \u201cwithin the last two years at any time for a social or recreational purpose of any kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Urging affirmance of the judgment, the plaintiff argues the trial court did not abuse its discretion in retaining venue. According to plaintiff, the \u201cdeposition transcript describes uniform business activities and affairs that the defendant conducts on a regular basis within the City of Richmond.\u201d Elaborating, plaintiff contends \u201cdefendant\u2019s activities in the City of Richmond are usual and customary by occurring approximately once per month for business purposes in addition to six or seven visits per year for personal affairs, occur at regular intervals because they are evenly distributed throughout the year, and are regular in destination because his almost monthly trips pursuant to his employment are to one of two businesses on seven occasions and to one of two clubs for educational seminars on the remaining occasions, such that these routine activities are clearly \u2018regular\u2019 business activity or affairs, according to the plain language of Virginia Code \u00a7 8.01-262(3).\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">An objection to venue is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and the court\u2019s action in overruling the objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>will not be reversed on appeal unless the record affirmatively reflects an abuse of discretion. <em>See Norfolk and W. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>239 Va. 390, 392, 389 S.E.2d 714, 715 (1990). The party objecting to venue has the burden of establishing that the chosen venue is improper. The defendant has met that burden in this case, even though the facts were developed by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In plain language, the General Assembly has specified that permissible venue under these circumstances shall be in the county or city \u201c[w]herein the defendant regularly conducts affairs or business activity.\u201d The customary meaning of the noun \u201caffairs\u201d in this context is, \u201ccommercial, professional, or public business,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 35 (1971), and \u201c[a] person\u2019s concerns in trade or property; business,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 57 (6th ed. 1990). The term refers to employment-related or personal business dealings as opposed to activity that is purely personal, such as recreational pursuits. Therefore, the evidence of defendant\u2019s pleasure trips through the City to visit a son and of his passing through the City or stopping there \u201cfor whatever reason\u201d fails to demonstrate that defendant \u201cconducts affairs or business activity\u201d within the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Thus, the issue remains whether evidence of defendant\u2019s seven visits per year to insurance brokerage firms and three appearances per year at business seminars qualifies under the statute as \u201cregularly\u201d conducting affairs or business activity within the City. We hold it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The customary meaning of the adverb \u201cregularly\u201d in this context is, \u201cin a regular, orderly, lawful, or methodical way,\u201d Webster\u2019s 1913. The customary meaning of the adjective \u201cregular\u201d in this context is, \u201cSteady or uniform in course, practice, or occurrence; not subject to unexplained or irrational variation.\u201d Black\u2019s 1285. Indeed, we have said, \u201cIn common parlance, a \u2018regularly\u2019 employed person is one required to work every working day. Similarly, a person \u2018regularly required to perform service at night\u2019 is one required to work at night every working day.\u201d <em>Gomes </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, 220 </em>Va. 449, 452, 258 S.E.2d 582, 584 (1979). Regular action is more frequent than casual or occasional action.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The evidence shows that defendant\u2019s activity within the City of Richmond on behalf of his employer was merely casual or occasional, and not conducted in an orderly, methodical way. Significantly, defendant said he was required to enter the City \u201con occasion\u201d to confer with the brokers, these sporadic visits being \u201cspaced out\u201d during the year but occurring \u201cmore often in the fall.\u201d In sum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>defendant\u2019s activity in the City was not so frequent as to be performed \u201cregularly\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 8.01-262(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Accordingly, because the record affirmatively reflects the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to sustain defendant\u2019s objection to venue, the judgment appealed from will be reversed and the case will be remanded for a new trial. Upon remand, the trial court shall conduct a hearing and shall order this action transferred to either Prince George County or Chesterfield County, in accordance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 8.01-264.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
