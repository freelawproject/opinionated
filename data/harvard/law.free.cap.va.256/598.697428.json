Hazel, Inc. (Hazel) furnished labor and materials in performing site development work for a townhouse project on real estate in Fairfax County owned by Detty/Anderson Hotel Limited Partnership (the owner). The real estate was encumbered by a recorded deed of trust securing payment of the owner\u2019s obligation to York Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association (York Federal).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Subsequent to the owner\u2019s failure to pay Hazel, it recorded a memorandum of mechanic\u2019s hen and filed this suit to enforce its hen against the property. Two of the defendants in the suit, York Federal and Marilyn C. Cunningham, P.C., (the substitute trustee under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>deed of trust) petitioned the court to release Hazel\u2019s lien against the real estate upon their posting a bond under the provisions of Code \u00a7 43-70 (the \u201cbonding off\u201d statute). Code \u00a7 43-70 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\">In any suit brought [to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien], the owner of the building and premises to which the lien, or liens, sought to be enforced shall have attached, the general contractor for such building or other parties in interest may . . . apply to the court in which such suit shall be pending ... for permission to . . . file a bond . . . conditioned for the payment of such judgment adjudicating the lien or liens to be valid and determining the amount for which the same would have been enforceable against the real estate as may be rendered by the court upon the hearing of the case on its merits ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The parties stipulated: (1) that the owner owed Hazel $56,226.25 under its enforceable mechanic\u2019s lien; (2) that Hazel\u2019s Bill of Complaint \u201csatisfied all of the requirements of the Virginia mechanic\u2019s lien statutes;\u201d (3) that York Federal had filed a bond pursuant to the bonding off statute, obtained a release of the property from the mechanic\u2019s lien claim, and later had the substitute trustee sell the property under the deed of trust; and (4) that although York Federal \u201cconcedes the validity and amount of Hazel\u2019s memorandum of mechanic\u2019s lien, it contends that Hazel\u2019s recovery is precluded by the priority of York\u2019[s]\u201d lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Hazel moved for summary judgment. Hazel contended that there was no material issue of fact to be decided since York Federal had stipulated as to the \u201cvalidity, amount and enforceability\u201d of Hazel\u2019s mechanic\u2019s hen, thus removing the issue of York Federal\u2019s alleged priority under the provisions of Code \u00a7 43-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">As pertinent, Code \u00a7 43-21 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">In the enforcement of [mechanic\u2019s] liens . . . any lien or encumbrance created on the land before the work was commenced or materials furnished shall be preferred in the distribution of the proceeds of sale only to the extent of the value of the land estimated, exclusive of the buildings or structures, at the time of sale, and the residue of the proceeds of sale shall be applied to the satisfaction of the liens provided for in the previous sections of this chapter. Provided that liens filed for performing labor or furnishing materials for the repair or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>improvement of any building or structure shall be subject to any encumbrance against such land and building or structure of record prior to the commencement of the improvements or repairs or the furnishing of materials or supplies therefor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">York Federal opposed entry of summary judgment on the ground that Hazel was still obligated to prove the value of the real estate without Hazel\u2019s improvements in order for the court to apportion the relative priorities of York Federal and Hazel to the bond. After considering the stipulations and the argument of counsel, the court sustained Hazel\u2019s motion for summary judgment. York Federal appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">York Federal contends that its stipulation did not resolve the issue of the relative priorities of the liens of the parties. Hazel responds that the issue has been resolved because of the stipulations and the fact that \u201cthe bond had replaced the real property as security and the trustee had sold the real property.\u201d Hazel concludes that \u201c[t]o recover from the bond, [Hazel] must only show that his lien is enforceable, not that his lien would have been collectable against the real property had the property been sold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">In <em>George </em>W. <em>Kane, Inc. </em>v. <em>NuScope, Inc. </em>243 Va. 503, 509, 416 S.E.2d 701, 704 (1992), we said that \u201cwith respect to a bond enforcement suit, the party-plaintiff has the burden of proving the same elements of his claim that he would have had to prove in a suit to enforce the [mechanic\u2019s] lien released by that bond.\u201d Hazel contends that the stipulation of the \u201cvalidity, amount, and enforceability of the lien\u201d establishes \u201cthe same elements of his claim\u201d referred to in <em>Kane.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">However, York Federal did not stipulate that Hazel could have <em>collected </em>its claim from the real estate if the bond had not been posted but only that Hazel\u2019s lien was <em>\u201cenforceable </em>under the memorandum of mechanic\u2019s lien.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Indeed, the stipulation states that \u201c[w]hile York Federal concedes the validity and amount of Hazel\u2019s memorandum of mechanic\u2019s hen, it contends that Hazel\u2019s recovery is precluded by the priority of York Federal\u2019s hen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Additionally, payment of the bond posted is expressly conditioned on the provisions of Code \u00a7 43-70. Further, the bonding off order uses substantially the same language found in the bonding off statute in conditioning payment of the bond upon the court\u2019s adjudication of \u201cthe amount for which the hens or any one hen would have been enforceable against the real estate.\u201d Accordingly, we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>think that the stipulation removed any burden of proof as to this issue which Hazel may have had under Code \u00a7\u00a7 43-21 and 43-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Hazel construes the bonding off statute as \u201csimply ensuring] that amounts enforceable against the bond are allowable under the mechanic\u2019s lien statute.\u201d According to Hazel, \u201c[t]he General Assembly could not have intended that the language requires proof of priority in this case because no competing interests exist once the mechanic\u2019s lien was released under [the bonding off statute].\u201d However, under Hazel\u2019s construction, few prior lienors would be willing to bond off the real estate if, by doing so, the lienor would be relieved of the necessity of proving the priority of his lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Because the language of the bonding off statute is clear and unambiguous, it will be applied as written. <em>Robbs v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 433, 436, 478 S.E.2d 699, 700 (1996); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985). In our opinion, the bonding off statute merely releases the real estate from the mechanic\u2019s lien claim by requiring that payment of the bond be \u201cconditioned for the payment of such judgment adjudicating the lien or liens to be valid and determining the amount for which the same would have been enforceable against the real estate.\u201d This provision substitutes the bond for the real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Hence, we conclude that the court erred in deciding that no issue remained as to the priority Hazel would have had in the bonded off real estate and consequently in entering summary judgment. Accordingly, the judgment will be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
