Lim is sufficient to convey Lim\u2019s interest in a certain parcel of real estate to Soo Myung Choi. Because the memorandum does not contain any words or language demonstrating an intent to convey an interest in real estate, we find that the memoran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>dum is not a valid deed. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Lim and Choi acquired title to residential real estate (the Property) in Fairfax County as joint tenants with right of survivorship by a deed dated October 1, 1973. On February 18, 1975, Lim wrote and signed the following memorandum (the Memorandum):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">To: Mr. Soo-Myung Choi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">Re: House at 3111 Graydon Street, Falls Church, Virginia, 22042 (Lot #318, Sq. 6)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">I purchased the above property on October 1, 1973, jointly with Mr. Soo-Myung Choi as a co-owner. However, I hereby state that the ownership of the above property belongs fully to Mr. Soo-Myung Choi, and that the above property is not a nature of thing for which I assume responsibility in paying mortgage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">In the event that Mr. Soo-Myung Choi sells or rents the above house and needs my signature for the release, I will gladly and without delay respond to the occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">I hereby make it clear that I shall not involve myself in the matter concerning financial gains or losses of the above house, and that all rights belong to Mr. Soo-Myung Choi alone.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">On May 25, 1982, Lim filed a bill of complaint requesting the court to partition the Property. Choi responded by filing a cross-bill to quiet title, asserting that Lim had surrendered any interest in the Property when she signed the Memorandum. Choi further alleged that he made all the mortgage payments on the Property. In her answer to Choi\u2019s cross-bill, Lim asserted that the Memorandum was invalid and denied most of the other allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">By a decree of reference, the circuit court appointed a commissioner in chancery and directed the commissioner to hear evidence related to this cause. The commissioner conducted a hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>March 16, 1988. At the hearing, Lim testified that she provided the funds for the down payment to purchase the Property as well as the settlement costs and security deposit. She further testified that she made payments on two mortgages on the Property until December 1975. With regard to the Memorandum, Lim stated that Choi forced her to write it by beating her and then threatening her with a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In contrast, Choi testified that Lim became a co-owner of the Property for the purpose of helping Choi obtain a loan since he did not otherwise qualify for one.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Choi also stated that he has made all the mortgage payments since January 1975.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, Choi denied owning a gun and claimed that he did not use violence or threats to force Lim to execute the Memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The commissioner filed his report in December 1994. In the report, the commissioner stated that neither party presented sufficient evidence to overcome the <em>prima facie </em>validity of the deed conveying the Property to them as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Accordingly, the commissioner recommended that a decree be entered directing the sale of the Property and also dismissing Choi\u2019s cross-bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">However, the chancellor ordered the commissioner to file a supplemental report and specifically requested the commissioner to amplify his findings of fact regarding the Memorandum\u2019s validity. The commissioner filed a new report on July 31, 1996, in which he found that \u201c[t]he \u2018memorandum\u2019 operated as a deed and served to quitclaim or release Ms. Lim\u2019s interest in the property to Mr. Choi\u201d and that sufficient consideration existed to support the transfer. The commissioner also found that Lim failed both to allege and to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Choi obtained the Memorandum from her by duress. Thus, the commissioner recommended that the court dismiss Lim\u2019s bill of complaint for partition and sustain Choi\u2019s cross-bill to quiet title and to vest title to the property in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Lim filed exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s supplemental report; however, the chancellor entered a November 5, 1996 decree sustaining the commissioner\u2019s findings. Subsequently, on June 6, 1997, the chancellor entered a decree vesting title in the Property to Choi. Lim appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>n.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In considering this appeal, we adhere to the established standard of review regarding a chancellor\u2019s decree which approves a commissioner\u2019s report. Such a decree will be affirmed \u201cunless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Chesapeake Builders, Inc. v. Lee, </em>254 Va. 294, 299, 492 S.E.2d 141, 144 (1997); see <em>also Firebaugh </em>v. <em>Hanback, </em>247 Va. 519, 525, 443 S.E.2d 134, 137 (1994). Although a commissioner\u2019s report does not carry the weight of a jury verdict, Code \u00a7 8.01-610, a chancellor should sustain it if the evidence supports the commissioner\u2019s findings. <em>Hill v. Hill, </em>227 Va. 569, 576-77, 318 S.E.2d 292, 296 (1984). This rule \u201capplies with particular force to the report\u2019s factual findings which are based on evidence heard by the commissioner;\u201d however, it does not apply to \u201cpure conclusions of law\u201d found in the commissioner\u2019s report. <em>Chesapeake, </em>254 Va. at 299, 492 S.E.2d at 144. In accord with this standard of review, we hold that the chancellor in this case erred in sustaining the commissioner\u2019s report concluding that the Memorandum constituted a valid, enforceable deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The requirements for a deed are \u201ccompetent parties, a lawful subject matter, a valuable consideration, apt words of conveyance, and proper execution.\u201d <em>Morison v. American Ass\u2019n., Inc., </em>110 Va. 91, 92, 65 S.E. 469, 470 (1909). Lim argues that the Memorandum lacks consideration and is, therefore, not a valid deed. Choi, however, contends that the Memorandum\u2019s language regarding Lim\u2019s refusal to assume responsibility for the mortgage payments is an implied promise by Choi to continue paying the mortgage. Thus, according to Choi, his implied assumption of the mortgage payments constitutes adequate consideration. However, we do not need to decide whether adequate consideration exists because the Memorandum lacks any words or language demonstrating an intent to convey property and is, therefore, not a valid deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">A writing need not be in any particular form to constitute a deed. <em>Albert v. Holt, </em>137 Va. 5, 8, 119 S.E. 120, 121 (1923). Nonetheless, a document purporting to convey title must contain operative words manifesting an intent to transfer the property. <em>See Morison, </em>110 Va. at 92-93, 65 S.E. at 470. In <em>Albert, </em>this Court addressed the validity of a deed in which the grantors did \u201cgive, bargain, and sell\u201d the property at issue. <em>Albert, </em>137 Va. at 7, 119 S.E. at 121. The grantors argued that the deed lacked words of conveyance and was, therefore, defective. In rejecting that argument, this Court noted that while Code \u00a7 5162 (now Code \u00a7 55-48) used the term \u201cgrant\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>providing the form for a deed of conveyance, it was not an \u201cindispensable requisite\u201d to a valid deed. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 119 S.E. at 121. Thus, the statutory form was not \u201cinvariable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 119 S.E. at 121. The Court then examined the deed\u2019s language and found \u201cthe intention to \u2018grant\u2019 ... so manifest. . . that no other construction could be put upon it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 119 S.E. at 122. Therefore, use of technical words or strict compliance with the form in Code \u00a7 55-48 is not necessary to effect a transfer if the language used \u201cplainly shows\u201d on the face of the document a clear intent to convey title. <em>Morison, </em>110 Va. at 92, 65 S.E. at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">To determine whether an intent to convey exists in the present case, we examine the Memorandum\u2019s language, and, in doing so, construe that language liberally so as to give effect to the parties\u2019 intention \u201cif there are sufficient words to declare clearly and legally the maker\u2019s meaning.\u201d Albert, 137 Va. at 10, 119 S.E. at 122. We find no words in the Memorandum indicating an intent by Lim to transfer her interest in the Property to Choi. Rather, the Memorandum is replete with contemporaneous statements by Lim regarding her belief as to the Property\u2019s current status. Lim claims that Choi is the owner of the Property, that she is not responsible for the mortgage, and that she is not involved in any financial matters concerning the Property. However, unlike the deed at issue in <em>Albert, </em>at no point in the Memorandum does Lim express an intent, through words of conveyance or otherwise, to transfer her interest in the Property to Choi. Thus, the Memorandum is void of any language indicating an intent to convey, and, finding no words of conveyance, we will not \u201crewrite [a] deed to express an intention that is otherwise indiscernible.\u201d <em>Walker v. Bowman, </em>227 Va. 209, 214, 315 S.E.2d 206, 209 (1984). Accordingly, we hold that the Memorandum does not constitute a valid deed and does not, therefore, transfer Lim\u2019s interest in the Property to Choi.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lim and Choi continue to own the Property as joint tenants with right of survivorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Thus, for the reasons stated, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand for entry of a decree of partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-14\"> Because Lim wrote the Memorandum in Korean, the above language is a translation of the \u2022 original document.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-9\"> Both Lim and Choi testified that Lim signed both deed of trust notes, yet the record contains neither the notes nor the deeds of trust. The record does, however, include a release of one mortgage to Choi.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b188-10\"> According to Choi, Lim sometimes made the mortgage payments in an effort to repay debts that she allegedly owed him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\"> Because we hold that the Memorandum is not a valid deed, we need not consider Lim\u2019s assignment of error regarding the defense of duress.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
