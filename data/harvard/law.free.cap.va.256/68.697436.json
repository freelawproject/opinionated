Sabre Construction Corporation (Sabre) submitted a timely bid. On February 27, 1997, the County notified Sabre <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>by letter that its bid was \u201cdetermined to be non-responsive\u201d because Sabre had failed to bid on \u201cAlternate No. 5.\u201d In the same letter, the County informed Sabre that it would recommend awarding the contract to another bidder,\u2019 the V.F. Pavone Construction Company (Pavone), and that its decision would be final, unless Sabre filed a protest within ten days of receiving the letter. After seeking clarification from the County regarding the appropriate procedures,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sabre filed a protest with the County on March 7, arguing that the omission of Alternate No. 5 from its bid was <em>\u201cde minimus\u2019'\u2019 </em>and should not constitute grounds for a finding of non-responsiveness. Sabre further argued that if the County added the amount of Pavone\u2019s bid on Alternate No. 5 to Sabre\u2019s bid, Sabre\u2019s bid would be the lowest, and Sabre should, therefore, be awarded the contract. On March 13, the County issued its written decision denying Sabre\u2019s protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">On March 12, one day before the County denied Sabre\u2019s protest, Sabre filed the instant action. In its motion for judgment, Sabre sought a determination that it was the low bidder, that its bid was responsive, and that the County\u2019s decision to award the contract to Pavone was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The County filed a motion to dismiss arguing that under \u00a7 11-66, the County\u2019s decision on a protest is final unless the bidder appeals or files legal action \u201cwithin ten days of the written decision.\u201d Since Sabre filed its legal action <em>before </em>the County issued its written decision on the protest, Sabre did not comply with the provisions of \u00a7 11-66 and, therefore, the court could not entertain Sabre\u2019s motion for judgment. The trial court agreed and dismissed the case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">On appeal, Sabre asserts that the trial court erred because 1) Sabre complied with the filing requirements of \u00a7 11-66, 2) any failure to comply with the filing requirements of \u00a7 11-66 was \u201cprocedural only\u201d and should not defeat Sabre\u2019s claim, and 3) Sabre\u2019s motion for judgment was properly filed under \u00a7 11-70(A). We consider these assertions in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Section 11-66 creates the procedure for protesting a public body\u2019s decision to award a contract. Under that section, a disappointed bidder must first protest the award or decision to award \u201cin writing to the public body ... no later than ten days after the award or announcement of the decision to award.\u201d The public body must respond in writing to the protest within ten days. The decision of the public body \u201cshall be final unless the bidder or offeror appeals within ten days of the written decision by invoking administrative procedures meeting the standards of \u00a7 11-71, if available,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or in the alternative by instituting legal action as provided in \u00a7 11-70.\u201d \u00a7 11-66(A). Subsection (C) of \u00a7 11-70 describes the procedure for filing an action in circuit court when the public body denies a bidder\u2019s protest of the award of a contract or proposed award of a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In the instant case, Sabre instituted its legal action before the County issued its written decision on Sabre\u2019s protest. Nevertheless, Sabre claims that it complied with the \u00a7 11-66 requirement that it institute legal action \u201cwithin ten days\u201d of the County\u2019s written decision on its protest. To reach this conclusion, Sabre interprets the phrase \u201cwithin 10 days\u201d as allowing an unsuccessful bidder to institute an action up to ten days <em>before </em>the public body releases its written response to a protest, as well as up to ten days after the decision. This interpretation, however, cannot stand when the phrase is read in the context of the entire provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Section 11-66 provides that the public body\u2019s written decision is final unless a bidder \u201cappeals\u201d within ten days. By describing the alternatives available to the protesting bidder as \u201cappeals,\u201d the General Assembly made it clear that the purpose of the action is to review the public body\u2019s written decision regarding the bidder\u2019s protest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If, as Sabre contends, the legal action could be filed prior to the release of the written decision, then the bidder would be \u201cappealing\u201d a decision which has not yet been issued. We conclude, therefore, that the phrase \u201cwithin ten days\u201d does not allow an \u201cappeal\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 11-66 to be filed prior to the public body\u2019s release of its written decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>n.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Sabre next argues that even if it failed to comply with the filing requirements of \u00a7 11-66, its failure was \u201cprocedural only\u201d and, under the rationale of <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Bestler, </em>239 Va. 166, 387 S.E.2d 753 (1990), did not require the trial court to dismiss the motion for judgment with prejudice. Sabre\u2019s reliance on <em>Morrison </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The Public Procurement Act not only creates the substantive right to file an action against a county, but also imposes a special limitation on that right, namely appealing the written decision of the public body within ten days. When a special limitation is part of the statute creating the substantive right, the limitation is not merely a procedural requirement, but a part of the newly created substantive cause of action. <em>Barksdale v. H.O. Engen, Inc., </em>218 Va. 496, 498-99, 237 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1977). The special limitation is a condition precedent to maintaining the claim and failure to comply with it bars the claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\"><em>Morrison </em>did not involve the application of procedural requirements which were part of a substantive cause of action. The cause of action in Morrison was a common law tort based on medical malpractice. The procedural requirements at issue were part of a statute addressing procedures for pursuing medical malpractice claims, Code \u00a7 8.01-581.2. Thus, these procedural requirements were not special limitations and the principles applied in <em>Morrison </em>are not relevant to the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Finally, Sabre argues that it had \u201ca second, independent remedy\u201d under Subsection (A) of \u00a7 11-70. That subsection provides, in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">[a] bidder or offeror, actual or prospective, who is refused permission or disqualified from participation in bidding or competitive negotiation, or who is determined not to be a responsible bidder or offeror for a particular contract, may bring an action in the appropriate circuit court challenging that decision ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">Sabre argues that when the County found its bid to be non-responsive, Sabre was effectively \u201cdisqualified from participation\u201d in the bidding process. The trial court concluded, however, that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>finding Sabre\u2019s bid to be non-responsive, \u201cthe County did not refuse or disqualify Sabre from participating in bidding.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Section 11-70(A) is limited to challenges of public body decisions which \u201cdisqualified\u201d a bidder or offeror from participating in the process in any manner. It applies to decisions which exclude the <em>bidder </em>from the process, not to decisions which exclude a particular <em>bid. </em>Were we to interpret the word \u201cdisqualified\u201d to encompass rejection of defective bids, we would be ignoring the phrase \u201cparticipation in bidding\u201d and would be creating a right of action against public bodies broader than that anticipated by the General Assembly. The Public Procurement Act constitutes a waiver of public bodies\u2019 sovereign immunity, is in derogation of the common law, and, therefore, must be strictly construed. <em>Halberstam </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 248, 250-51, 467 S.E.2d 783, 784 (1996); <em>Botetourt County v. Burger, </em>86 Va. 530, 533 (1889). Consequently, we conclude that \u00a7 11-70(A) does not provide a bidder with a remedy independent of the one created by Code \u00a7\u00a7 11-66 and -70(C) to challenge a public body\u2019s finding that a bid was non-responsive.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">For the above reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\"> The \u201cInformation for Bidders\u201d packet provided by the County to potential bidders contained directions for protesting and appealing from actions taken by the County in the bid award process. The County\u2019s directions were not identical to the statutory provisions in all respects. However, these directions do not supersede the statutory provisions at issue here because they were not part of a county ordinance or resolution adopting competitive procurement principles pursuant to \u00a7 11-35(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-8\"> The County did not create an administrative appeal pursuant to \u00a7 11-71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b89-9\"> The statute does not use the word \u201cappeal\u201d in its technical sense, such as an \u201cappeal\u201d of an administrative agency ruling pursuant to \u00a7 17-116.05(1). <em>See Allstar Towing, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Alexandria, </em>231 Va. 421, 423-24, 344 S.E.2d 903, 905 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
