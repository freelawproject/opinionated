Southside Electric Cooperative (Southside) is a Virginia electric distribution cooperative that provides retail electric service within an area that encompasses eighteen counties and five municipalities, including portions of Nottoway County.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">In 1992, pursuant to an agreement with Nottoway County, the Town annexed a 2.5 square mile area of Nottoway County (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>annexed area). Although the Town at that time provided electric service to customers in a portion of the annexed area, Southside, pursuant to a certificate issued by the Commission, provided electric service to customers in other portions of the annexed area as well as to customers in a subdivision of the Town known as Pickett Court. Virginia Electric and Power Company (Virginia Power) also provided electric service in the Town, serving three customers outside the annexed area.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In order to extend its electric service to all customers located within the annexed area, the Town engaged in discussions with Southside in attempts to acquire Southside\u2019s electric distribution facilities and associated rights of way (the facilities) within that area. After these discussions failed to achieve that goal, on June 25, 1996, the Town Council passed a resolution authorizing a condemnation proceeding, pursuant to Code \u00a7 56-265.4:2, to acquire the facilities. On June 28, 1996, the Town filed an application with the Commission requesting permission to acquire the facilities by a condemnation proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In its application, consistent with the requirements of Code \u00a7 25-233, the Town asserted that a \u201cpublic necessity\u201d or an \u201cessential public convenience\u201d required its acquisition of Southside\u2019s facilities and that these facilities were not essential to the purposes of South-side. In support of those assertions, the Town maintained that condemnation would: (1) end the fragmented service that results from having more than one electric provider in the area; (2) reduce rates for electric service; (3) improve the reliability of electric service in the annexed area; (4) allow more prompt service connections to customers in the annexed area; (5) give customers in the annexed area a greater voice in decisions regarding their electric rates and service; and (6) have no effect on Southside\u2019s remaining customers. South-side challenged these claims in its answer opposing the Town\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The Commission appointed a hearing examiner to consider the application, and hearings were held in December 1996. On August 21, 1997, the hearing ex\u00e1miner issued his report. In that report, the hearing examiner rejected the Town\u2019s assertion that Code \u00a7 56-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>265.4:2 does not require the Town to obtain the Commission\u2019s permission under Code \u00a7 25-233 prior to proceeding with condemnation of Southside\u2019s facilities in the annexed area. In addition, the hearing examiner rejected the Town\u2019s further assertion that under the circumstances of this case the Commission must apply a less stringent standard for determining whether a public necessity or an essential public convenience supports the Town\u2019s application. With respect to the merits of the application, the hearing examiner addressed each of the assertions made by the Town in support of its application and found that none of these demonstrated a \u201cpublic necessity\u201d or \u201cessential public convenience\u201d warranting condemnation. For purposes of our resolution of the issues presented in this appeal, we need not relate the facts supporting these findings, which are adequately supported by the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">The Town filed exceptions to the hearing examiner\u2019s report. Thereafter, the Commission reviewed the report and adopted the findings and recommendations of the hearing examiner in an order dated November 24, 1997, denying the Town\u2019s application. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">On appeal, the Town asserts that the Commission erred in finding that it was required to obtain the Commission\u2019s permission under Code \u00a7 25-233 prior to exercising its right under Code \u00a7 56-265.4:2 to acquire, by condemnation, Southside\u2019s facilities in the annexed area. The Town further asserts that even if it was required to obtain the Commission\u2019s permission prior to exercising its right under Code \u00a7 56-265.4:2, the Commission applied an erroneous legal standard in determining whether the requirements of Code \u00a7 25-233 were met, by requiring the Town to establish a \u201cpublic necessity\u201d or an \u201cessential public convenience\u201d under the traditional standard, instead of some \u201cless stringent\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Both issues raised by the Town are essentially matters of statutory construction. Code \u00a7 56-265.4:2, in relevant part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">A. Any city or town in the Commonwealth which provides electric utility service for the use of its residents may, at any time following annexation of additional territory to such city or town, acquire the distribution system facilities of the electric utility serving the annexed area <em>in the manner provided by Title 25.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">At all times relevant to this appeal, Code \u00a7 25-233, provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">No corporation or authority created under the provisions of Chapter 39 (\u00a7 15.1-1603 <em>et seq.) </em>of Title 15.1 shall take by condemnation proceedings any property belonging to any other corporation possessing the power of eminent domain, unless, after hearing all parties in interest, <em>the State Corporation Commission shall certify that a public necessity or that an essential public convenience shall so require, and shall give its permission thereto-, </em>and in no event shall one corporation take by condemnation proceedings any property owned by and essential to the purposes of another corporation possessing the power of eminent domain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">The Town contends that a proper construction of Code \u00a7 56-265.4:2 would exclude such condemnation actions from the review of the Commission under Code \u00a7 25-233 by limiting the phrase \u201cin the manner provided by Title 25\u201d to mean that a city or town need only employ the procedures of the Virginia General Condemnation Act, Code \u00a7 25-46.1 <em>et seq. </em>In short, the Town contends that Code \u00a7 56-265.4:2 was enacted to permit a city or town to do the very thing prohibited by Code \u00a7 25-233, that is to condemn the property of a public utility with the power of eminent domain without first seeking permission from the Commission. In making this contention, the Town does not expressly state that Code \u00a7 56-265.4:2 is ambiguous, but supports its argument with extensive reference to external <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>aids to construction, raising the obvious implication that the statute cannot be construed from its plain language.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">When considering a legislative act, a court may look only to the words of the statute to determine its meaning, and when the meaning is plain, resort to rules of construction, legislative history, and extrinsic evidence is impermissible. <em>Harrison &amp; Bates, Inc. v. Featherstone Assoc., </em>253 Va. 364, 368, 484 S.E.2d 883, 885 (1997). Accordingly, unless we find that any words of the statute are \u201cinherently difficult to comprehend, of doubtful import, or lacking in clarity and definiteness ... it is not necessary to look beyond the plain language of the statute to ascertain its underlying legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369, 484 S.E.2d at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Utilizing this standard, we find no merit to the Town\u2019s contention that the phrase \u201cin the manner provided by Title 25\u201d can be reasonably read to have a limited construction. Nothing in that phrase suggests that the legislature intended other than what the plain language imports, which is that the right afforded to cities and towns seeking to acquire by condemnation the electric utility distribution facilities within newly annexed areas is subject to all the provisions of Title 25 relevant to such actions. No resort to external aids to construction is necessary to reach that self-evident conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Accordingly, we hold that a city or town seeking to exercise the right provided by Code \u00a7 56-265.4:2 must comply with Code \u00a7 25-233, which provides that permission must first be obtained from the Commission by any public corporation or authority seeking to take by condemnation proceedings the property of any other entity also possessing that power. To do so, the city or town must demonstrate \u201cthat a public necessity or that an essential public convenience shall so require.\u201d Code \u00a7 25-233.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The Town contends, however, that unless a \u201cless stringent\u201d standard is applied by the Commission in its determinations under Code \u00a7 25-233, Code \u00a7 56-265.4:2 is rendered meaningless. This is so, the Town asserts, because \u201cit is highly unlikely that a municipality can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>ever demonstrate that a regulated public utility is failing to provide adequate service at reasonable rates\u201d and, thus, no municipality could ever demonstrate that the condemnation of electric utility distribution facilities is a public necessity or essential to public convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The Town\u2019s contention on this issue rests on a faulty premise. Nothing in the record before us suggests that the Commission limited its consideration of the Town\u2019s application solely to the question of adequacy of service and reasonableness of rates, or that it would so limit itself in the future. Rather, the Commission focused its inquiry on whether the public would benefit under the entire circumstances of the proposed condemnation, and noted that while there would be certain benefits, including a slight reduction of rates, the evidence on balance did not support such a finding. The record adequately supports that finding. Moreover, we reject the Town\u2019s contention that no municipality would be able to effectively compete with a public utility in the provision of or cost of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In sum, we hold that all of the provisions of Code \u00a7 25-233 as traditionally applied by the Commission apply to the condemnation of electric utility distribution facilities under Code \u00a7 56-265.4:2 by a city or town. The decision of the Commission, as an expert tribunal, is presumed to be just, reasonable, and correct unless without support in the record or manifestly in error. <em>Central Telephone Co. of Virginia v. State Corporation Commission, </em>219 Va. 863, 874, 252 S.E.2d 575, 581-82 (1979). Here, the record supports the decision of the Commission and the Commission correctly applied the law. For these reasons, the order of the Commission will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-7\"> In its application, the Town recognized that the Commission had previously ruled, in a divided opinion, that a municipality seeking to condemn facilities under Code \u00a7 56-265.4:2 was required to obtain Commission permission under Code \u00a7 25-233. <em>See Petition of City of Franklin, </em>Case No. PUE890069, 1990 S.C.C. Ann. Rep. 301, 302. However, the Town did not concede the issue, and the Commission, therefore, expressly addressed it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\"> The hearing examiner also addressed the issue of whether the facilities are essential to Southside, as required by Code \u00a7 25-233. Noting that the Commission has construed \u201cessential\u201d to mean \u201conly when the acquisition would adversely affect service to [the relinquishing] utility\u2019s remaining customers,\u201d the hearing examiner concluded that the facilities are not essential to Southside\u2019s purposes. The Commission subsequently determined that it need not reach this issue since the Town had failed to establish that condemnation was appropriate. The Town does not assign error to this determination, and accordingly, we express no opinion on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\"> The Town further contends that Code \u00a7 56-265.4:2 must be read to provide more expansive powers of condemnation than are provided elsewhere in the Code, otherwise its enactment would merely be redundant of other statutes. However, as the Town itself notes, Code \u00a7 56-265.4:2 was enacted following this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Town of Culpeper </em>v. <em>VEPCO, </em>215 Va. 189, 207 S.E.2d 864 (1974), in order to provide the express right of condemnation in annexed areas which we had found lacking elsewhere in the Code. Accordingly, the purpose of this statute is clearly not redundant of the existing scheme for condemnation of electric distribution facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
