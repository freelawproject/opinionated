Code \u00a7 46.2-355 authorizes revocation of an habitual offender\u2019s driving privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A) provides, \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to drive any motor vehicle ... on the highways of the Commonwealth while the revocation of the person\u2019s driving privilege remains in effect.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(1) provides that if an habitual offender is convicted of driving a motor vehicle while the revocation determination is in effect the person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(3), the basis of the present dispute, provides, \u201cIf the offense of driving while a determination as an habitual offender is in effect is a second or subsequent such offense,\u201d the person shall be guilty of a felony and punished as set forth in another portion of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">The main issue in this appeal is whether \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(3) subjects a defendant to the specified enhanced punishment for a subsequent offense if, at the time of commission of that offense, the defendant has not been convicted of the earlier offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">On August 9, 1996, defendant Nehemiah Thomas, Jr., was convicted after a bench trial in the Circuit Court of the City of Lynch-burg of the felony of driving after having been adjudicated an habitual offender, second offense. He was sentenced to confinement in the penitentiary for one year. After the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>25 Va. App. 256, 487 S.E.2d 289 (1997), we awarded defendant this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">The facts are undisputed; the chronology is important. On April 5, 1995, the circuit court adjudicated defendant an habitual offender. On August 30, 1995, defendant was charged with driving after having been declared an habitual offender, but he was not convicted of that offense until March 19, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>On February 11, 1996, defendant was apprehended following his operation of a motor vehicle on the streets of Lynchburg. Following indictment for a felony violation of \u00a7 46.2-357, the defendant was tried in the circuit court in June 1996. At trial, he admitted to commission of the crime. Defendant argued, however, that he had been charged improperly with a felony because he had not been convicted of the August 1995 first offense when he committed the second offense in February 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Affirming defendant\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals said: \u201cCode \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(3) establishes that a second \u2018offense\u2019 is punishable as a felony. The statute does not require that for a first offense to be cognizable as such, it must not only occur prior to the second offense, but also result in conviction <em>prior </em>to the occurrence of the second offense.\u201d 25 Va. App. at 260, 487 S.E.2d at 291. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Initially, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the Court of Appeals erred by refusing to find that the language \u201csecond or subsequent such offense\u201d in Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(3) is unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous. \u201cA penal statute is void for vagueness if it fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute and if the enactment encourages selective law enforcement.\u201d <em>Woodfin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 89, 92, 372 S.E.2d 377, 379 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1009 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">In the context of the habitual offender statutes, there is nothing uncertain or ambiguous about the phrase \u201csecond or subsequent such offense\u201d when applied to defendant\u2019s conduct. As the Court of Appeals said, the meaning of the statute \u201cis clear on its face. A person of ordinary intelligence would understand that any second or subsequent driving in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357 would make him eligible for the enhanced punishment provision, whether or not he had been convicted of the earlier offense before the occurrence of the second driving offense.\u201d 25 Va. App. at 260, 487 S.E.2d at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Additionally, because the statutory language is free of ambiguity, the Court of Appeals correctly rejected defendant\u2019s reliance upon proffered legislative history to construe the language. When, as here, the language is clear, settled rules of statutory construction do not permit resort to legislative history because courts take the words as written to determine their meaning. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Turning to the focus of this appeal, we hold that the General Assembly\u2019s choice of the word \u201coffense\u201d in \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(3), rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>than the word \u201cconviction,\u201d clearly demonstrates an intent to authorize punishment enhancement without a prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Plainly, the purpose of \u00a7 46.2-357 is to deter criminal conduct by punishing those who repeatedly drive after having been declared an habitual offender, rather than to reform habitual offenders. <em>See Ansell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 762-63, 250 S.E.2d 760, 762 (1979); <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>16 Va. App. 260, 262-63, 430 S.E.2d 543, 543-44 (1993). If the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute were adopted, an offender could commit multiple unlawful acts of driving without fear of being punished for a felony merely because the offender could not be tried and convicted quickly enough between offenses. An interpretation of the statute that allows a defendant to violate it with impunity would be contrary to the clear legislative intent. <em>See Ansell, </em>219 Va. at 763, 250 S.E.2d at 763; <em>Mason, </em>16 Va. App. at 263, 430 S.E.2d at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Finally, defendant argues the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s action allowing the indictment to be amended. We do not agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The indictment charged that defendant \u201cunlawfully, feloniously and after having been declared an habitual offender\u201d operated a motor vehicle, \u201csaid person having been once or more previously convicted and sentenced for a like offense, in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7 46.2-357.\u201d After the trial, but before the defendant was found guilty, the court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to amend the indictment to read that defendant operated a motor vehicle as an habitual offender, \u201cbeing a second or subsequent offense, in violation of Virginia Code section 46.2-357.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-231 permits amendment of an indictment for any defect in form or for any variance between the allegations and proof \u201cat any time before . . . the court finds the accused guilty or not guilty, provided the amendment does not change the nature or character of the offense charged.\u201d The Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the amendment did not change the nature or character of the offense charged, stating, \u201cThe amended indictment charged Thomas under the same code section and alleged the same actions in substantiation of the charge. The changes effected by the amendment were semantic in nature and did not substantively alter the charge against Thomas.\u201d 25 Va. App. at 262, 487 S.E.2d at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Consequently, the judgment of the Court of Appeals will be</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
