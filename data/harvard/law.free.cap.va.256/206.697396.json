Perkins, the predecessor in interest to CaseLin Systems, Inc. (CaseLin) and later its president, proposed to locate a medical waste incinerator in Bland County. In an April 1990 public meeting of the Board of Supervisors of Bland County (the Board), representatives of the incinerator manufacturer and state and regional air pollution control agencies, interested citizens, and Perkins were given an opportunity to participate in a discussion of his proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">During that meeting, the Board resolved to give Perkins a \u201cletter of support\u201d regarding his proposal. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s chairman wrote to state and regional waste management and air pollution agencies in May 1990 that the Board had \u201cvoted to support\u201d the Perkins proposal to locate \u201ca medical waste incinerator in Bland County.\u201d Also, pursuant to a Board resolution adopted on May 21, 1990, and the provisions of Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(B)(1), the chairman sent a \u201ccertification\u201d to the State Department of Waste Management that \u201cthe location and operation of a medical waste incinerator in Bland County by Mr. Michael Perkins is in accordance with all local ordinances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Relying on the Board\u2019s actions, CaseLin: (1) purchased land in December 1990 for the location of its proposed medical waste incinerator from the Bland County Development Corporation; (2) contracted with its grantor to build an access road into the grantor\u2019s recently platted industrial park for CaseLin\u2019s use and that of future lot owners; and (3) applied for the required state air pollution and waste management agency approvals. Citing the Board\u2019s April 1990 resolution to write a letter of support, the Board chairman joined in the deed from the Bland County Development Corporation to Case-Lin, purportedly on behalf of the Board, to \u201cirrevocably acknowledge and confirm [CaseLin\u2019s] right... to use the . . . land ... as a medical waste incinerator facility.\u201d After CaseLin purchased the land, the county administrator wrote letters to the state air pollution and waste management agencies on February 25, 1991, stating that \u201cBland County is anxiously awaiting [their] completion of [Case-Lin\u2019s] permit application reviews.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">However, citizens opposing the proposed incinerator appeared before the Board on March 25, 1991, and asked for an additional public hearing on the issue. At two Board-scheduled public meetings held in the following months and attended by CaseLin officials, it appeared that a large number of citizens opposed the plan. Consequently, at the second meeting the Board voted to \u201crescind\u201d its April 1990 resolution of support and so notified the Department of Waste Management, the Air Pollution Control Board, and other state and regional officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Despite the Board\u2019s rescission of its support, CaseLin continued to actively pursue the required state approvals until the General Assembly imposed a moratorium on state approval from April 1992 until December 1993. 1992 Va. Acts, c. 751, p. 1151 (imposition); 1993 Va. Acts, c. 721, p. 1009 (termination). Although CaseLin resumed its active pursuit of the required state approvals, it had not secured them by the time the county enacted its comprehensive zoning ordinance on July 21, 1995, more than 18 months after the moratorium ended. At that time, CaseLin\u2019s property was zoned as a part of an agricultural district in which its incinerator was not a permitted use.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In the 54-month period between its acquisition of the property in December 1990 and the enactment of the zoning ordinance in July 1995, CaseLin had a number of surveys conducted on the property and cleared a minimum amount of brush and trees to enable it to establish \u201ca road to go in to do soil and geo-technical boring.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>record does not indicate whether this work was done before or after the Board withdrew its support in May 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">On July 31, 1995, the county\u2019s zoning administrator notified CaseLin of the enactment of the zoning ordinance and of his decision that CaseLin did not have a vested right to use its property for construction and operation of a medical waste incinerator. CaseLin appealed that decision, and the subsequent denial of its applications for permits to build the incinerator, to the Board of Zoning Appeals (the BZA). Upon the BZA\u2019s affirmation of both decisions, CaseLin appealed to the circuit court. The appeals were consolidated by the court and heard on the records certified by the BZA.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In a written opinion, the court concluded that because CaseLin had acquired a vested right to use its property in the operation of a medical waste incinerator prior to the adoption of the zoning ordinance, the BZA\u2019s decision was \u201cvoid and of no effect.\u201d The BZA appeals the circuit court\u2019s final judgment entered in conformity with that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We begin with a discussion of property rights in relation to zoning. Privately held land is subject to applicable local zoning ordinances whether enacted before or after the property was acquired. Generally, landowners have no property right in anticipated uses of their land since they have no vested property right in the continuation of the land\u2019s existing zoning status. <em>Snow v. Amherst County Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>248 Va. 404, 408, 448 S.E.2d 606, 608-09 (1994); <em>Town of Vienna Council v. Kohler, </em>218 Va. 966, 976, 244 S.E.2d 542, 548 (1978). However, in limited circumstances, private landowners may acquire a vested right in planned uses of their land that may not be prohibited or reduced by subsequent zoning legislation. <em>See Holland </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>247 Va. 286, 290-91, 441 S.E.2d 20, 22-23 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The limited circumstances are outlined in a \u201cbright line test\u201d which enables such landowners to determine the point at which they have acquired a vested right. <em>Town of Rocky Mount v. Southside Investors, Inc., </em>254 Va. 130, 132, 487 S.E.2d 855, 856 (1997); <em>Holland, </em>247 Va. at 292, 441 S.E.2d at 23. The test is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">[A] landowner who seeks to establish a vested property right in a land use classification must identify a <em>significant official governmental act </em>that is manifested by the issuance of a <em>permit or other approval </em>authorizing the landowner to conduct a use on his property that otherwise would not have been allowed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Additionally, and equally important, our test requires that the landowner establish that he has diligently pursued the use authorized by the government permit or approval and incurred substantial expense in good faith prior to the change in zoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><em>Snow, </em>248 Va. at 407, 448 S.E.2d at 608 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The parties do not dispute the evidence as to their respective actions with relation to the sole issue in this case: whether those actions were sufficient to vest a property right in CaseLin. Because the proper application of the test to the governmental acts in this case poses a question of law, we do not accord a presumption of correctness to the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Board of Supervisors v. Omni Homes, Inc., </em>253 Va. 59, 65-66, 481 S.E.2d 460, 463, <em>cert. denied, </em>_U.S._, 118 S.Ct. 58 (1997); <em>see also Town of Rocky Mount, </em>254 Va. at 133, 487 S.E.2d at 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">CaseLin has not obtained any governmental permit to build and operate its incinerator. However, it claims, and the BZA denies, that the Board\u2019s actions represented \u201cother approval\u201d and constituted the \u201csignificant governmental act\u201d required under our bright line test.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">CaseLin correctly notes on brief that we have never defined the term \u201cother approval\u201d as used in the test. However, a review of the other language we have used in establishing the test, related statutes, and our prior cases gives some indication of the parameters of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">The term \u201cother approval\u201d is used in the context of the identification of a \u201csignificant official governmental act that is manifested by the issuance of a permit or other approval.\u201d \u201cSignificant official governmental act,\u201d \u201cissuance,\u201d and \u201cpermit,\u201d coupled with the word \u201cor\u201d imply that such \u201capproval\u201d is of similar character and formality as a \u201cpermit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Furthermore, statutes dealing with related subjects suggest that sufficient \u201capproval\u201d requires some formality. Code \u00a7 10.1-1442(C), which envisions a hazardous waste facility siting agreement with local governing bodies that is \u201cbinding ... in any court of competent jurisdiction,\u201d Code \u00a7 10.1-1438(A)(3), requires such an agreement to be \u201cexecuted by the signatures of . . . the chief executive officer of the host community, who has been so directed by a majority vote of the local governing body.\u201d Code \u00a7 15.1-475(B)(1) (now Code \u00a7 15.2-2259) requires that local commissions act on proposed subdivision plats \u201cofficially submitted for approval.\u201d Under Code \u00a7 15.1-11.02 (now Code \u00a7 15.2-929), governing bodies are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>required to \u201cgrant or deny siting approval\u201d of solid waste facilities within 120 days of their submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Our rejection of a number of claims of \u201capproval\u201d within the meaning of the test gives further evidence that the scope of an \u201capproval\u201d is limited to an official response to a detailed request for a use of a particular property that would not otherwise be allowed under the law. Neither the granting of a variance nor the previous rezoning of particular property is a sufficient manifestation of \u201capproval\u201d under the bright line test. <em>See Snow, </em>248 Va. at 408, 448 S.E.2d at 608-09 (grant of variance); <em>Town of Rocky Mount, </em>254 Va. at 133, 487 S.E.2d at 857 (zoning classification change). Similarly, the partial processing of a proposed and filed subdivision plat and site plan does not constitute the necessary \u201capproval.\u201d <em>Town of Stephens City v. Russell, </em>241 Va. 160, 164, 399 S.E.2d 814, 816 (1991). Nor are informal assurances of future approval made by individual board members and the county administrator sufficient to demonstrate \u2019\u2019approval\u201d under the test. <em>Notestein v. Board of Supervisors, </em>240 Va. 146, 151-52, 393 S.E.2d 205, 207-08 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">With these considerations in mind, we consider the actions of the county asserted by CaseLin as evidence of the required approval. The April 1990 resolution stated only that the Board resolved to write a letter of support, not that the Board had approved a specific proposal regarding the operation of a medical waste incinerator. Cf<em>. Town of Rocky Mount, </em>254 Va. at 133, 487 S.E.2d at 857 (significant governmental act authorizes specific use to be made of the property). Rather, the resolution was merely a short-lived expression of the Board\u2019s enthusiasm for the project which was later withdrawn in the face of public criticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The letters to the state agencies were simply statements of the Board\u2019s general support of the plan, not a specific authorization of the project. Moreover, the administrator\u2019s certification that the location and operation of the planned incinerator were in accordance with the local ordinances was nothing more than a statement of the facts existing at that time, not an authorization to proceed. Accordingly, we hold that the April 1990 resolution and the May 1990 letters of the Board and county administrator to the state agencies were not an \u201capproval\u201d of CaseLin\u2019s planned incinerator within the meaning of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">However, CaseLin also contends that such an approval is contained in the deed to CaseLin which states that the Board \u201cirrevocably acknowledge[d] and confirm[ed] the right of [CaseLin] to use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the herein described parcel of land ... as a medical waste incinerator facility.\u201d We find no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Nothing in the Board\u2019s April 1990 resolution of general support for the project authorized the chairman to bind the Board to CaseLin\u2019s \u201cirrevocabl[e]\u201d right to use the land for the incinerator. Therefore, the chairman could not bind the Board as its agent. <em>See Leachman v. Board of Supervisors, </em>124 Va. 616, 621, 626-27, 98 S.E. 656, 658, 659 (1919) (chairman not board\u2019s agent to sign unauthorized checks).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that CaseLin failed to secure governmental approval sufficient to acquire a vested right to construct and operate a medical waste incinerator. Our decision makes unnecessary a consideration of whether CaseLin has established the other elements required to create its asserted vested property right.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter final judgment for the Board of Zoning Appeals of Bland County.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\"> Additionally, we do not consider what effect, if any, Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(F) may have had on this case because the issue was not raised by either party. Code \u00a7 10.1-1408.1(F) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APP\">There shall exist no right to operate a landfill or other facility for the disposal, treatment or storage of nonhazardous solid waste or hazardous waste within the Commonwealth. Permits for solid waste management facilities shall not be transferable except as authorized in regulations promulgated by the Board.
