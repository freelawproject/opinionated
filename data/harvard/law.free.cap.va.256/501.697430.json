One morning in February 1993, seven-year-old Johnny Calvin Newman waited for his assigned school bus alongside the eastbound lane of Route 57 in Henry County. Route 57 is a two-lane highway at this location. The bus came to a stop in the westbound lane, across the road from Johnny. The bus driver activated the bus\u2019 warning lights and its \u201cstop arm.\u201d To board the bus, Johnny had to walk across the eastbound lane of Route 57 and then cross in front of the bus. As Johnny was walking across the eastbound lane, he was struck by a motor vehicle operated by Ephriam Drake Sayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">The school bus, which was owned by the Henry County School Board, was insured under the Board\u2019s \u201ccommercial automobile lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>bility\u201d insurance policy issued by Erie Insurance Exchange (Erie). The policy listed the Henry County School Board as the named insured and included within its uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage \u201canyone while occupying\u201d a vehicle insured under the policy. The policy defined \u201coccupying\u201d as \u201cin or upon, getting into or out of, or getting off.\u201d The policy also was subject to Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, which mandates UM/UIM coverage for, among others, \u201cany person who uses the motor vehicle to which the policy applies, with the expressed or implied consent of the named insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Johnny, by his parents and next friends Randall and Brenda Newman, filed a motion for judgment seeking damages for personal injuries against, among others, the personal representative of Sayers\u2019 estate, the school bus driver, and the School Board. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(F), a copy of the motion for judgment was served on Erie as an insurer providing potential UM/UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Erie filed a bill of complaint for declaratory judgment, asking the trial court to declare that Johnny was not an insured under the UM/ UJM provisions of the School Board\u2019s policy. For purposes of determining the availability of UM/UIM coverage, Erie and the Newmans stipulated the above-stated facts concerning how the accident occurred. They further agreed that at the time of the accident, Johnny was not riding the bus as a passenger, was not a guest in the bus, and was not a named insured or family member residing in the same household as a named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Erie moved for summary judgment, arguing that no material facts remained in dispute and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stern v. Cincinnati Insurance Company, </em>252 Va. 307, 477 S.E.2d 517 (1996). The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment and entered an order concluding that Johnny was not an insured under the UM/UIM provisions of the Erie policy. The court stated in its order that Johnny was not \u201cusing, occupying, getting on or getting off of the school bus at the time of the accident, as per <em>Stern v. Cincinnati Insurance </em>Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">On appeal, the Newmans argue that Johnny was \u201coccupying\u201d the school bus at the time of the accident, as that term is defined in the Erie policy. They assert that since a school bus is a specialized type of vehicle, the differences involved in boarding that type of vehicle must be recognized when interpreting this policy term. They contend that the term \u201cgetting into\u201d an insured vehicle, considered in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>context of boarding a school bus, encompasses the very activity in which Johnny was engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The Newmans also argue that Johnny was \u201cusing\u201d the school bus at the time of the accident, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206. They contend that since Johnny was struck while walking across the road after the bus driver had activated the bus\u2019 specialized safety devices, he was using those devices and was injured while engaged in an activity essential to the use of the bus as a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In response, Erie argues that our decision in <em>Stem </em>controls both issues raised in this case. Erie contends that the facts in <em>Stem </em>are indistinguishable from the facts presented here, and that the policy language at issue in that case was very similar to the policy language before us. Thus, Erie asserts that the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>requires a conclusion that Johnny was not occupying or using the school bus insured by Erie.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In considering these issues, we determine first whether Johnny was \u201coccupying\u201d the school bus under the terms of the Erie policy. As stated above, the policy defines \u201coccupying\u201d as \u201cin or upon, getting into or out of, or getting off.\u201d The portion of the definition most applicable to the facts of this case is the term \u201cgetting into.\u201d The Newmans agree with Erie that the facts in <em>Stem </em>are indistinguishable from the facts before us. There, a child was struck and injured by an oncoming motorist while walking across a road to board a school bus. <em>Id. </em>at 309, <em>All </em>S.E.2d at 518. To board the bus, the child was required to walk across one complete lane of traffic and then proceed in front of the bus that was stopped in the other lane. She was struck in the lane opposite the lane in which the bus was stopped, two or three feet from the center fine in the road. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Under policy language that defined \u201coccupying\u201d as \u201cin, upon, getting in, on, out or off,\u201d we held that the child was not \u201coccupying\u201d the school bus. <em>Id. </em>at 310-11, <em>All </em>S.E.2d at 519. We explained that the policy definition must be interpreted in relation to the term defined and stated that the word \u201coccupying\u201d \u201cdenotes a physical presence in or on a place or object.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311, 477 S.E.2d at 519. We held that, considered in this context, the terms \u201cgetting in\u201d and \u201cgetting on\u201d required a close proximity to the bus that was not demonstrated by the child\u2019s location since she was across the center line of the road from the bus when she was struck. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Under the facts before us, there is no material difference between the policy language at issue in <em>Stem </em>and the language of Erie\u2019s policy. When Johnny was struck, his location in the lane opposite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>lane in which the bus was stopped did not place him in such close proximity to the bus as would constitute a physical presence in or on it. <em>See id. </em>Thus, under the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms in the Erie policy, Johnny was not \u201coccupying\u201d the school bus at the time he was struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In arguing that he was \u201cusing\u201d the bus within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, Johnny acknowledges that acceptance of his position would require us to overrule the portion of <em>Stern </em>in which we concluded that the child was not using the bus when struck. There, we held that a bus driver used a bus and its equipment to create a safety zone for the child, but that \u201cthe safety measures did not constitute a use of the bus by [the child].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312, 477 S.E.2d at 520. We stated that the child was not using the bus, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, at the time she was struck \u201cbecause she was not yet a passenger of the school bus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313, 477 S.E.2d at 520. In reaching this conclusion, we stated that our holding was governed by our prior decisions in <em>Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>204 Va. 833, 836, 134 S.E.2d 418, 420 (1964), and <em>United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Parker, </em>250 Va. 374, 463 S.E.2d 464 (1995). <em>Stern, </em>252 Va. at 312, 477 S.E.2d at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) defines \u201cinsured,\u201d in material part, as \u201cany person who uses the motor vehicle to which the policy applies, with the expressed or implied consent of the named insured.\u201d The coverage mandated by the statute is limited to injuries that the permissive user sustained while actually using the insured vehicle. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>GEICO, </em>256 Va. 128, 132, 500 S.E.2d 819, 821 (1998); <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>255 Va. 62, 65, 496 S.E.2d 54, 55 (1998); <em>Perry, </em>204 Va. at 838, 134 S.E.2d at 421. In determining whether Johnny was actually \u201cusing\u201d the school bus at the time he was injured within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, the relevant inquiry is whether \u201cthere was a causal relationship between the accident and the use of the insured vehicle as a vehicle.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>256 Va. at 132, 500 S.E.2d at 821 (quoting <em>Randall, </em>255 Va. at 66, 496 S.E.2d at 56); <em>accord Parker, </em>250 Va. at 377, 463 S.E.2d at 466; <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>LaClair, </em>250 Va. 368, 372, 463 S.E.2d 461, 463 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">We have illustrated the nature of this causal relationship in two groups of cases. The first group includes such cases as <em>Stern, Parker, </em>and <em>Perry, </em>in which we concluded that the injured persons were not \u201cusing\u201d the vehicles in question within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206. In <em>Parker, </em>a landscape gardener drove a pickup <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>truck containing some tools and ornamental cabbage plants to the entrance of a residential development, where she parked the truck in a manner to provide a safety barrier from passing traffic. She left the truck door open in order to hear a two-way radio located inside the truck and was struck while planting the cabbages. We concluded that the gardener was not \u201cusing\u201d the truck as a vehicle at the time she was injured by an uninsured motorist, because she was not \u201cengaged in a transaction essential to the use of the pickup truck when she was injured.\u201d 250 Va. at 376-78, 463 S.E.2d at 465-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">In <em>Perry, </em>we held that a police officer was not \u201cusing\u201d his vehicle when he was struck and killed while attempting to serve a warrant. At the time he was struck, the officer had turned off the engine, left the vehicle, and was walking along a roadway 164 feet from his police cruiser. 204 Va. at 834, 134 S.E.2d at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The second group of cases discussing the causal relationship between an accident and the use of an insured vehicle as a vehicle includes such decisions as <em>Randall </em>and <em>Great American Insurance Co. v. Cassell, 239 </em>Va. 421, 389 S.E.2d 476 (1990). In those cases, we concluded that the injured party was \u201cusing\u201d the insured vehicle at the time of injury, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206. In <em>Randall, </em>a highway worker was struck and killed by a vehicle while placing lane closure signs along the side of a highway. He had driven the insured vehicle to the site, left the engine running, and kept on the flashing yellow bubble light on top of the truck\u2019s cab while completing his assigned task. The worker was six to ten feet behind the truck on the shoulder of the road at the time he was struck. 255 Va. at 64, 496 S.E.2d at 55. We held that the worker was \u201cusing\u201d the insured truck as a vehicle when he was struck because he was utilizing the truck\u2019s specialized equipment to perform his mission. <em>Id. </em>at 67, 496 S.E.2d at 56-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In <em>Cassell, </em>a fire fighter was standing 20 to 25 feet away from a fire truck when he was struck and killed by an uninsured motor vehicle. The insured fire truck had transported to the scene of the fire both the fire fighter and the equipment used to fight the fire. The truck also was used at the scene as a physical barrier to restrict the flow of traffic. At the time the fire fighter was struck, he was using a writing pad and a clipboard that he had removed from the truck to complete a required fire incident report. We concluded that the fire fighter was \u201cusing\u201d the fire truck at the time of the accident because the truck was an integral part of his mission, which had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>completed when he was struck and killed. 239 Va. at 424, 389 S.E.2d at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In <em>Randall, </em>which we decided after <em>Stem, </em>we emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">actual use of the vehicle for purposes of UM/UIM coverage mandated by \u00a7 38.2-2206 is not restricted to the transportation function of a vehicle. If the injured person is using the insured vehicle as a vehicle and as an integral part of his mission when he is injured, he is entitled to UM/UIM coverage under \u00a7 38.2-2206. In this context, the use of a vehicle \u201cas a vehicle\u201d requires that at the time of the injury, the vehicle is being used in a manner for which it was specifically designed or equipped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">255 Va. at 66, 496 S.E.2d at 56 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Our holding in <em>Randall </em>raises a question in this case concerning our earlier holding in <em>Stem. </em>That question is whether there is coverage under Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 when an individual, who has not occupied an insured vehicle, utilizes the vehicle\u2019s specialized safety equipment as an integral part of performing his mission, with the immediate intent to occupy the vehicle. Applying the principles expressed in <em>Randall, </em>as well as those set forth in <em>Edwards v. GEICO, </em>256 Va. 128, 500 S.E.2d 819, we answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">A school bus driver is required by regulation to activate a school bus\u2019 warning devices \u201cto warn approaching traffic to stop and allow pupils to cross the highway safely.\u201d 8 VAC 20-70-80. This regulation, enacted pursuant to the Board of Education\u2019s authority under Code \u00a7 22.1-177, illustrates the fact that the school bus\u2019 warning devices are intended for the child\u2019s use. Therefore, there is a dual use of the bus\u2019 specialized safety equipment. The bus driver uses the bus\u2019 specialized safety equipment to warn approaching traffic to stop, and the child uses the safety equipment as an integral part of his mission of walking across the street to board the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Our decision in <em>Stem, </em>however, recognized only the bus driver\u2019s use of the specialized safety equipment. The decision effectively equated \u201cuse\u201d of the bus with occupancy by stating that the child \u201cclearly was not utilizing the bus as a vehicle because she was not yet a passenger of the school bus, and, therefore was not using the bus, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, when she was injured.\u201d 252 Va. at 313, 477 S.E.2d at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>In no other case have we held that \u201cuse\u201d of an insured vehicle, under Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, requires that an injured party be an occupant of the insured vehicle at some time prior to sustaining an injury. Moreover, we held to the contrary in <em>Edwards, </em>our most recent case addressing \u201cuse\u201d of an insured vehicle under Code \u00a7 38.2-2206. There, a man was injured in the process of removing a flat tire from an automobile owned by an acquaintance. He did not drive or ride in the insured vehicle prior to being struck by the uninsured vehicle. Instead, he was using the insured vehicle\u2019s tire jack and spare tire to change the tire with the intention of driving the car to have the flat tire repaired. We concluded that he was \u201cusing\u201d the insured vehicle, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, because he utilized the insured vehicle\u2019s equipment as an integral part of his mission with the immediate intent to drive the vehicle after replacing the tire. 256 Va. at 133, 500 S.E.2d at 821.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In light of <em>Randall </em>and <em>Edwards, </em>we are compelled to overrule the holding in <em>Stem </em>that a child injured under the facts presented was not \u201cusing\u201d the school bus, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206. Thus, under the facts now before us, we conclude that Johnny was using the school bus as a vehicle at the time he was injured, based on his use of the bus\u2019 specialized safety equipment and his immediate intent to become a passenger in the bus. Those facts establish the required causal relationship between the accident and Johnny\u2019s use of the bus as a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In reaching this decision, we have given deliberate consideration to the critical role that the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>serves in insuring the stability of the law. <em>See Selected Risks Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>233 Va. 260, 265, 355 S.E.2d 579, 581 (1987). However, we have a duty of equal dignity to reexamine critically our precedent and to acknowledge when our later decisions have presented an irreconcilable conflict with such precedent. <em>See Nunnally v. Artis, </em>254 Va. 247, 253, 492 S.E.2d 126, 129 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Under <em>Stem, </em>only children who have exited a school bus under the protection of the bus\u2019 safety equipment could be entitled to UM/UIM coverage when injured in a lane opposite the lane in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the bus was stopped. Yet, children injured in the <em>same </em>location while walking across the street to board the <em>same </em>bus under the protection of the <em>same </em>specialized safety equipment would be denied such coverage. Our action today also is taken to eliminate this paradox resulting from the application of <em>Stem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">For these reasons, we will affirm in part, and reverse in part, the trial court\u2019s judgment. We will enter final judgment declaring that Johnny was \u201cusing\u201d the school bus at the time of the accident, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, and was entitled to coverage under the UM/UIM portion of the Erie policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\"> Unlike the present case, the facts presented in <em>Edwards </em>did not place our ruling in <em>Stem </em>before us for reconsideration. In Edwards, we were presented with two certified questions from the United States Court of Appeals that did not involve the use of an insured vehicle\u2019s specialized safety equipment by the injured motorist. Thus, in restating the ruling in <em>Stem </em>that the child was not using the bus, we were not addressing the merits of that decision, but were stating only why that holding was inapplicable to the facts in <em>Edwards.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b532-6\">JUSTICE COMPTON, with whom CHIEF JUSTICE CARRICO</author>\n<p id=\"AHI\">joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\u201cIn Virginia, the doctrine of stare decisis is more than a mere clich\u00e9. That doctrine plays a significant role in the orderly administration of justice by assuring consistent, predictable, and balanced application of legal principles. And when a court of last resort has established a precedent, after full deliberation upon the issue by the court, the precedent will not be treated lightly or ignored, in the absence of flagrant error or mistake.\u201d <em>Selected Risks Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>233 Va. 260, 265, 355 S.E.2d 579, 581 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Established precedents ought not to vary with every change in the appellate court\u2019s personnel. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Trehy, </em>133 Va. 160, 169, 112 S.E. 757, 760 (1922). Frequent overruling of an appellate court\u2019s decisions tends to bring adjudications of the tribunal \u201cinto the same class as a restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Allwright, </em>321 U.S. 649, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting). Responsible decisionmaking leaves no room for \u201cjurisprudence of doubt.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>505 U.S. 833, 844 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">In common law cases, the interest in stability demands uniformity and certainty, particularly when rules of property and contract have been established. W. M. Lile, <em>Some Views On The Rule of Stare Decisis, </em>4 Va. L. Rev. 95, 101 (1916). Dean Lile expressed the doctrine of stare decisis in general terms: \u201cA decision by a court of last resort, in a litigated controversy, on a question of law necessarily involved in the judgment, becomes a precedent within that jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>tion, for subsequent cases involving substantially similar facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">But the interest in stability is not the only interest stare decisis serves in common law cases. There are other concerns relating to the manner in which appellate judges decide cases. For example, \u201crespect for precedent encourages the Court to be fair by reminding the Justices to treat like cases alike.\u201d Note, <em>Constitutional Stare Decisis, </em>103 Harv. L. Rev. 1344, 1349 (1990). Moreover, \u201crespect for precedent helps promote public confidence in the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If an appellate court does not respect its own precedent, then the public, the bench, and the bar are less likely to have confidence in the decisions that are made. Furthermore, employing the doctrine of stare decisis assures the public that an appellate court\u2019s judgments are not arbitrary and that the court is controlled by precedent that is binding without regard to the personal views of its members. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Against the background of these settled principles, a bare majority of this Court, in a case construing a contract, today overrules a holding that is merely two years old. The accident facts here and in <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>252 Va. 307, 477 S.E.2d 517 (1996), are substantially identical; the contract provisions are the same; and, the issues are identical. Yet a Court majority (including three members who were in the minority in <em>Stem, </em>and who ought to feel bound by it), strains to draw distinctions that make no difference and says that the holding on \u201cuse\u201d in <em>Stem </em>should be jettisoned. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The decision on that question of law was necessarily involved in the judgment in <em>Stem </em>and should be binding, as here, in a subsequent case with substantially similar facts. No flagrant error or mistake was made in <em>Stem, </em>which was decided after full deliberation upon the issue by the Court. Parenthetically, I note the \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d with the <em>Stern </em>precedent, mentioned by the majority, is created by the analysis it advances in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Accordingly, I would affirm the declaratory judgment of the trial court in all respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b533-8\">JUSTICE KOONTZ,</author>\n<p id=\"AWl\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">I respectfully dissent. In my view, the sole issue presented in this appeal is whether case law subsequent to <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Insurance Company, </em>252 Va. 307, <em>477 </em>S.E.2d 517 (1996), warrants reconsideration of the issues decided by that case. The majority, relying upon <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>255 Va. 62, 496 S.E.2d 54 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>(1998), and <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>GEICO, </em>256 Va. 128, 500 S.E.2d 819 (1998), reasons that this Court has adopted a more expansive view of what constitutes \u201cusing\u201d an insured vehicle within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) and, thus, our holding in <em>Stem </em>has been called into question. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><em>Randall </em>dealt with an individual who was struck and killed by a vehicle while placing lane closure signs along the side of the highway. At that time, he was using the specialized safety equipment of the insured vehicle, which he had driven to the site, to create a safety zone in which to complete his assigned task. We held that these circumstances constituted a use of the insured vehicle with the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B). <em>Randall, </em>255 Va. at 67-68, 496 S.E.2d at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In <em>Edwards, </em>we held that an individual who was neither the driver nor a passenger of the insured vehicle was nonetheless \u201cusing\u201d the vehicle within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) since he was using specialized equipment associated with the vehicle to change a flat tire on the vehicle. Moreover, when he was struck and injured by another vehicle, Edwards was in physical contact with the insured vehicle. We held that his utilization of the insured vehicle\u2019s equipment coupled with his intent to drive the vehicle immediately after replacing the tire constituted \u201cusing\u201d the vehicle within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B). <em>Edwards, </em>256 Va. at 133, 500 S.E.2d at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The underlying rationale of <em>Randall </em>and <em>Edwards </em>was that in each case the action of the injured person constituted a use of the insured vehicle within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) because there was a causal relationship between the accident and the use of the vehicle as a vehicle even though the actual use was unrelated to the transportation function of the vehicle. This was a logical extension of our decision in <em>Great American Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Cassell, 239 </em>Va. 421, 424, 389 S.E.2d 476, 477 (1990). However, nothing in <em>Randall </em>suggests that this rationale would apply to every individual injured while located within a safety zone created by specialized equipment of an insured vehicle. Nor does the application of this rationale in <em>Edwards </em>to a non-passenger, who was actually using specialized equipment while in physical contact with the vehicle, necessarily extend coverage under the statute to every individual who incurs an incidental benefit from specialized equipment of a vehicle. Indeed, both of these questions were previously resolved in <em>Stern.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In <em>Stern, </em>the student, when injured, was within a safety zone created by the activation of the specialized safety equipment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>insured bus by the bus driver for the student\u2019s benefit prior to completing her intended mission of becoming a passenger on the bus. Under those specific facts in <em>Stem, </em>we determined that the student was not \u201cusing\u201d the school bus within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B). Unlike the circumstances in <em>Randall, </em>the student in <em>Stem </em>was not within the safety zone as a user of the vehicle. Unlike the circumstances in <em>Edwards, </em>the student in <em>Stern </em>was not physically in contact with the vehicle, nor was she utilizing the bus\u2019s specialized safety equipment in a manner that constituted a use of the vehicle as a vehicle. Thus, at the time of her injury, Stem was not yet \u201cusing,\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, the bus she intended to board. The facts of the present case are indistinguishable from those in <em>Stern, </em>and accordingly, I would hold that our decision in <em>Stem </em>remains viable and controls the outcome of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">For these reasons, I would affirm the declaratory judgment of the trial court in all respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
