The questions involve the application of Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-302 and -319. We accepted the questions by order entered February 13, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The facts, as presented in the certification order, are as follows.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> On January 28, 1995, James A. Hilfiger (Hilfiger) filled out an application for a life insurance policy with Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company (Transamerica) seeking insurance upon the life of his father, Paul L. Hilfiger. On the application form, Hilfiger answered all questions on his father\u2019s behalf, and where the form required the \u201csignature of proposed insured,\u201d Hilfiger signed his father\u2019s name. Deborah C. Highsmith, a Licensed Resident Agent of Transamerica, signed the application as a \u201cwitness to all signatures.\u201d Highsmith knew that Hilfiger was signing the application on behalf of his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Hilfiger\u2019s father did not see the life insurance application, nor did he give Hilfiger written consent to sign his name. However, Hilfiger claims that he spoke to his father about the policy, and that his father gave him oral authorization to take out the policy. The application named Hilfiger as the sole beneficiary for the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In May 1995, Hilfiger\u2019s father underwent a medical examination in connection with the life insurance application. At the medical examination, Hilfiger\u2019s father signed a form entitled \u201cPART II of an Application for Insurance to the <em>Transamerica Occidental Life.\u201d </em>This form did not identify the type of insurance applied for, who the proposed beneficiary was, or the amount of coverage sought. Transamerica issued the insurance policy on October 9, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">On November 13, 1995, Hilfiger\u2019s wife, Donna C. Hilfiger, became a broker for Transamerica. Shortly thereafter, she executed an amendment to the insurance policy as a Transamerica resident agent. As with the original application, Hilfiger signed his father\u2019s name to the form. Hilfiger\u2019s father did not see the document, but Hilfiger asserts that he discussed the amendment with his father. Nine days after the amendment was executed, Hilfiger\u2019s father became ill. He died four days later on December 3, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Transamerica refused to pay the proceeds of the life insurance policy. Hilfiger filed a motion for judgment against Transamerica in the Circuit Court of the City of Virginia Beach seeking the proceeds of the policy, additional damages, and costs. Transamerica removed the case to file United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and later filed a motion for summary judgment. The federal district court granted Transamerica\u2019s summary judgment motion, con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>eluding that the execution of the policy did not comply with Code \u00a7 38.2-302 and, therefore, was void. Hilfiger appealed to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">In certifying the questions to this Court, the Court of Appeals stated that the answers would be determinative of the proceeding pending before it. We address the three questions in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The Court of Appeals first asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">Whether the son\u2019s signing his father\u2019s name as \u201cproposed insured\u201d violates Va. Code \u00a7 38.2-302, where the son discussed the policy with his father, had verbal authorization to apply for the policy, and his father later submitted to a medical examination and signed a form entitled \u201cPART II of an Application for Insurance to the <em>Transamerica Occidental LifeT\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">At common law, a policy of insurance taken out on the life of an insured without the insured\u2019s knowledge or consent by someone other than the insured was usually held void as against public policy. 1 Bertram Harnett &amp; Irving I. Lesnick, <em>The Law of Life and Health Insurance </em>\u00a7 3.04[1][a] (1997). The reason for this rule was the risk to the insured that a beneficiary would be tempted to \u201chasten by improper means the time when he will receive the benefits of the policy.\u201d <em>Wood </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>336 S.E.2d 806, 809 (Ga. 1985); <em>Hopkins v. Hopkins, </em>614 A.2d 96, 100 (Md. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Code \u00a7 38.2-302(A) codifies this common law principle, stating in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">No contract of insurance upon a person shall be made or effectuated unless at the time of the making of the contract the individual insured, being of lawful age and competent to contract for the insurance contract (i) applies for insurance, or (ii) consents in writing to the insurance contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">The statute provides the requisite protection for an insured by identifying two alternative conditions for creating a valid contract of life insurance. The specific conditions identified by the General Assembly reflect an intent to require unequivocal evidence that an insured approved the creation of a contract of insurance on his or her life. With this purpose in mind, we conclude that the facts in this case, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>recited in the certification order, do not establish proof of either condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">First, the evidence in this case, that Hilfiger\u2019s father knew about the policy and orally authorized Hilfiger to apply for the policy, does not constitute an application for the policy by the insured as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">At one time, the insured\u2019s knowledge of the policy alone was sufficient to establish compliance with the requirements of the Code. Former Code \u00a7 38.1-330, the predecessor to Code \u00a7 38.2-302, provided in relevant part that \u201c[n]o contract of insurance upon the person . . . shall be made or effectuated unless . . . the individual insured . . . applies therefor, has knowledge thereof, or consents thereto . . . .\u201d In 1986, however, the General Assembly eliminated the phrase \u201chas knowledge thereof,\u201d leaving the two current alternative conditions as the only means of creating a valid contract of life insurance. Acts 1986, ch. 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">We also conclude, as Hilfiger acknowledges, that orally authorizing another to take out a policy does not alone constitute \u201capplying\u201d for the policy. If oral authorization alone were enough to satisfy the application requirement, the written consent alternative would be rendered superfluous. <em>Wren </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>493 F.2d 839, 841 (5th Cir. 1974) (interpreting a similar statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Nevertheless, Hilfiger asserts that the application prong of the section was satisfied in this case because his father \u201cmaterially participated\u201d in the application process by providing a medical history and submitting to a medical examination. We disagree. \u201cMaterial participation\u201d in the application process is not synonymous with <em>applying </em>for the policy. As we have said, the purpose of the conditions required for a valid contract of life insurance is to eliminate any doubt that the insured knew about and agreed to the issuance of the insurance contract. Here, providing medical information in conjunction with the issuance of an insurance policy did not reflect consent to the contract of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">For the same reason, we reject Hilfiger\u2019s contention that his father\u2019s signature on the medical examination form qualified as a consent in writing to the insurance contract. The insured\u2019s signature on the medical form affirmed only that the information provided on the form was correct. Although the form itself stated that it was a part of an application for insurance, it contained none of the terms of the contract. It was not, and could not have been, a written consent \u201cto the insurance contract\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 38.2-302.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>For these reasons, we conclude that the facts of this case do not satisfy either alternative required by Code \u00a7 38.2-302 for the creation of a valid contract of life insurance. Accordingly, we answer the first question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In the second certified question the Court of Appeals asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">Whether the insurance policy should be enforced on behalf of the beneficiary despite the violation of \u00a7 38.2-302, in light of Virginia Code \u00a7 38.2-319\u2019s provision that \u201c[a]ny insurance contract made in violation of the laws of this Commonwealth may be enforced against the insurer?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">We answer this question in the negative. If Code \u00a7 38.2-319 required enforcement of a policy issued in violation of Code \u00a7 38.2-302, the protection for an insured intended by Code \u00a7 38.2-302 could never be realized, and Code \u00a7 38.2-302 would be meaningless. Code \u00a7 38.2-319 does not compel such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">By its own terms, Code \u00a7 38.2-319 applies to a contract of insurance which is \u201cmade\u201d in violation of a law of the Commonwealth. Code \u00a7 38.2-302 declares that if the statutory requirements are not met, no life insurance policy can be \u201cmade or effectuated.\u201d Thus, in the absence of compliance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 38.2~302(A), no contract of insurance is created, and any policy issued under those circumstances must be void <em>ab initio. Wood, </em>336 S.E.2d at 809, 811-12 (interpreting a similar statute). <em>Contra Jackson Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co. v. Receconi, </em>827 P.2d 118, 131 (N.M. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Here, no contract of life insurance was \u201cmade or effectuated\u201d because there was no compliance with Code \u00a7 38.2-302(A). Therefore, Code \u00a7 38.2-319 does not require enforcement of the insurance policy issued by Transamerica in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">Finally, the Court of Appeals asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-12\">Whether an insurance company can be estopped to rely on \u00a7 38.2-302 because its agent knew about the incorrectness of the signature on the application?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">Estoppel is an equitable principle that prevents one \u201cwhose action or inaction has induced reliance by another from benefiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>from a change in his position at the expense of the other.\u201d <em>Employers Commercial Union Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Great American Ins. Co., </em>214 Va. 410, 412, 200 S.E.2d 560, 562 (1973). Hilfiger argues that Transamerica should be estopped from relying on Code \u00a7 38.2-302 to avoid payment on the life insurance policy because it is charged with the knowledge of its agents, both of its agents knew that the insured did not sign the application form, and both agents failed to inform Hilfiger of the consequences of that omission. This failure, Hilfiger asserts, prevented him from taking the appropriate corrective measures to secure a valid life insurance policy for his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">We have addressed the application of equitable estoppel in the context of enforcing insurance policies against an insurer. <em>Id.; Reserve Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ferebee, </em>202 Va. 556, 118 S.E.2d 675 (1961); <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Eicher, </em>198 Va. 255, 93 S.E.2d 269 (1956); <em>Gilley </em>v. <em>Union Life Ins. Co., </em>194 Va. 966, 76 S.E.2d 165 (1953). And, as Hilfiger points out, we have applied the doctrine to enforce an insurance policy based on imputing to the insurer its agent\u2019s knowledge of false statements on the application. <em>See Gilley, </em>194 Va. at 974, 76 S.E.2d at 170. These cases all involved the level of knowledge and complicity of both the agent and applicant in supplying such false information. None of these cases, however, involved consideration of whether the equitable doctrine of estoppel should be applied in a manner which negates a significant public policy codified by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Jurisdictions addressing that situation have not been unanimous in their conclusions or rationales. One court applied equitable estoppel based on the theory that the statutory requirements for a valid life insurance contract reflect a public policy to protect the insured and the beneficiary, rather than to preserve the public order and morals and, therefore, the statutory requirements can be waived by the beneficiary. <em>Adam Miguez Funeral Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>First Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>234 So.2d 496, 499 (La. Ct. App. 1970). Another court concluded that the failure to apply equitable estoppel under these circumstances would allow insurers to perpetrate a fraud upon policyholders by accepting premiums on a policy, knowing that the policy was void from the beginning. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>244 N.Y.S.2d 148, 153 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In contrast, equitable estoppel has not been applied in these circumstances on the theory that its application would invite beneficiaries and insurers\u2019 agents to create a binding contract of insurance on the life of another in direct contravention of the policy addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>by the common law and statutes in imposing requirements for a valid policy. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Pyramid Life Ins. Co., </em>732 S.W.2d 167, 169 (Ark. Ct. App. 1987); <em>Time Ins. Co. v. Lamar, </em>393 S.E.2d 734, 735-36 (Ga. Ct. App. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">We are persuaded that the better rationale is not to apply equitable estoppel to enforce a life insurance policy issued in contravention of Code \u00a7 38.2-302. That statute was not enacted for the protection of the beneficiary but to protect the insured against potentially improper motives of the beneficiary. Thus, contrary to the conclusion reached elsewhere, we conclude that a beneficiary is not entitled to waive the statutory requirements. As we have already stated, applying Code \u00a7 38.2-319 to enforce a contract which Code \u00a7 38.2-302 renders void <em>ab initio </em>eliminates the very purpose of the statute. To apply equitable estoppel in these circumstances also:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">would permit the unreasonable result that [the conduct of an insurance company or its agent] would breathe life into an insurance contract which the General Assembly [for reasons of individual and public protection] intended to have no life, and would frustrate the strong public policy that no contract for life insurance should be made unless the insured applies for or consents in writing to the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\"><em>Lamar, </em>393 S.E.2d at 736 (citing <em>Wood, </em>336 S.E.2d at 812).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Accordingly, we answer the third certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\n<em>First certified question answered in the affirmative.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\n<em>Second certified question answered in the negative.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">\n<em>Third certified question answered in the negative.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\"> Because the federal district court granted summary judgment in favor of Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company, the facts are presented in the light most favorable to Hilfiger. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leak, </em>123 F.3d 787, 794 (4th Cir. 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b291-11\">JUSTICE KINSER, with whom JUSTICE KOONTZ</author>\n<p id=\"A5F\">joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">I would construe Code \u00a7 38.2-302(A) differently from the majority and would, therefore, answer the first certified question in the negative. I agree that the statute identifies \u201ctwo alternative conditions\u201d for making a valid life insurance contract, allowing a proposed insured either to apply for life insurance or to consent to such a contract. However, as I understand the majority\u2019s position, a proposed insured\u2019s oral authorization combined with \u201cmaterial participa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>tion\u201d in the application process does not constitute \u201capplying\u201d for the insurance contract. I disagree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The part of Code \u00a7 38.2-302(A) at issue provides that no life insurance contract is made or effectuated unless \u201cthe individual insured . . . (i) applies for insurance, or (ii) consents in writing to the insurance contract.\u201d The statute fails to define \u201capplies;\u201d therefore, the term must be \u201cgiven its ordinary meaning, given the context in which it is used.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Taxation v. Orange-Madison Coop. Farm Serv., </em>220 Va. 655, 658, 261 S.E.2d 532, 533-34 (1980). \u201cThe context may be examined by considering the other language used in the statute.\u201d <em>City of Virginia Beach v. Bd. of Supervisors of Mecklenberg County, 246 </em>Va. 233, 236-37, 435 S.E.2d 382, 384 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Examining the language chosen by the legislature, I find it significant that the phrase \u201cin writing\u201d appears after the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d and immediately following \u201cconsents\u201d and that the two phrases, \u201capplies for insurance\u201d and \u201cconsents in writing,\u201d are separately identified by the designations \u201c(i)\u201d and \u201c(ii).\u201d As a general rule, \u201cproper grammatical effect will be given to the arrangement of words in a sentence of a statute,\u201d <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>142 Va. 620, 624, 128 S.E. 578, 579 (1925), and a presumption exists that the General Assembly understood basic rules of grammar when drafting the statute. <em>Frere v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va. App. 460, 464, 452 S.E.2d 682, 685 (1995). Fundamental rules of grammar require the placement of a phrase so as to indicate clearly what the phrase modifies. John C. Hodges et al., Harbrace College Handbook 249 (12th ed. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Applying this rule to Code \u00a7 38.2-302(A), the phrase \u201cin writing\u201d modifies \u201cconsents,\u201d the word immediately preceding the phrase, and does not modify \u201capplies.\u201d <em>But see Alleman v. Lincoln Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>636 F.2d 1195, 1196 (10th Cir. 1981) (holding that writing provision in Utah statute, which states that \u201c[n]o life . . . insurance contract . . . shall be made . . . unless ... the individual insured ... in writing applies therefore [sic] or consents thereto,\u201d modifies not only \u201capplies\u201d but also \u201cconsents\u201d). By choosing not to modify \u201capplies\u201d with the phrase \u201cin writing,\u201d the General Assembly intended not to restrict the method by which an individual can apply for insurance. <em>See Forst </em>v. <em>Rockingham Poultry Mktg. Coop., Inc., 222 </em>Va. 270, 278, 279 S.E.2d 400, 404 (1981) (\u201cWhen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>the General Assembly uses two different terms in the same act, it is presumed to mean two different things.\u201d). Moreover, when the General Assembly has intended for a proposed insured to apply for insurance in writing, it has so stated. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 38.2-3737(A) (\u201cNo contract of insurance upon a debtor shall be made or effectuated unless . . . the debtor . . . applies for the insurance in writing . . . .\u201d). Thus, the General Assembly knows what language to use when it wants to condition the making of an insurance contract upon submission of a written application.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Therefore, in my view, under the provisions of Code \u00a7 38.2-302(A), consent to an insurance contract must be in writing, but the act of applying for insurance is not confined to any particular form. In other words, the mode of applying for a life insurance contract is not limited to a written application personally signed by the proposed insured. <em>Accord Walker v. Jackson Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>20 F.3d 923, 924-25 (8th Cir. 1994) (holding that insured can apply for insurance without signing application).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">While rules of grammar are not permitted to defeat the purpose of a statute, <em>Harris, </em>142 Va. at 624, 128 S.E. at 579, construing \u201capplies\u201d to denote more than the narrow meaning of an application signed by the proposed insured does not thwart the common law principle that Code \u00a7 38.2-302(A) embodies. A proposed insured\u2019s signature on an application form is not critical to proving that the individual applied for insurance if other facts evidence the proposed insured\u2019s intent to apply. <em>See Walker, </em>20 F.3d at 925 (finding that signature of insured on insurance application was not crucial to proving his knowledge of policy and identity of beneficiary); <em>Crump v. Northwestern Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>236 Cal. App.2d 149, 155 (1965) (holding insured\u2019s signature not essential where insured\u2019s agent prepared application and insured later ratified insurance contract). In other words, if the facts show that the proposed insured acted with the purpose of obtaining life insurance, then no risk exists of \u201callowing one person to have insurance on the life of another without the knowledge of the latter.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>20 F.3d at 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In the instant case, the actions of Hilfiger\u2019s father show that he applied for insurance as contemplated by the provisions of Code \u00a7 38.2-302(A). Because the district court granted summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>to Transamerica, the facts and inferences must be construed in the light most favorable to Hilfiger. <em>United States v. Leak, </em>123 F.3d 787, 794 (4th Cir. 1997). <em>See also Anderson </em>v. <em>Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986) (\u201cat the summary judgment stage the judge\u2019s function is not . . . to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter\u201d). The facts show that Hilfiger orally discussed the policy with his father and that the father verbally authorized his son to obtain the policy. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated in its certification order, \u201cwe can infer that the insured father \u2018authorized\u2019 Hilfiger to sign for him and provided the answers which Hilfiger filled in on the application forms.\u201d Moreover, the father underwent a medical exam during which he signed a form titled \u201cPart II of an Application for Insurance to the Transamerica Occidental Life.\u201d Thus, the evidence shows not only oral authorization, but also undisputed overt actions on the part of the father that not only corroborate his oral authorization but also establish his participation in the application process. This is not a case of mere oral authorization, which, as the majority observed, would render the written consent alternative superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Given these facts, I conclude that Hilfiger\u2019s signing his father\u2019s name as the \u201cproposed insured\u201d does not violate Code \u00a7 38.2-302. As the majority stated, \u201c[Tjhe purpose of the conditions required for a valid contract of life insurance is to eliminate any doubt that the insured knew about and agreed to the issuance of the insurance contract.\u201d That purpose is fulfilled in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Accordingly, for these reasons, I dissent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\"> Notably, the majority states only what action is insufficient to apply for a life insurance contract and fails to delineate or define specifically the requirements necessary to apply for insurance under Code \u00a7 38.2-302(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\"> An example of a statute that plainly requires a written application signed by the insured is Mass.
