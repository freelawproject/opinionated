Haigh had leased that truck on March 11, 1993 for a two-year term from Beach Ford, Inc. (Beach Ford), a car dealership. By language and signatures incorporated in the body of the lease document, Beach Ford assigned \u201call of Lessor\u2019s right, title and interest in and to the Lease and the Vehicle described therein\u201d to Ford Credit. The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles issued an owner\u2019s certificate of title to Ford Credit, and Ford Credit paid the property taxes assessed upon the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">At the time of the accident, Ford Motor was the primary named insured under an automobile insurance policy issued by Michigan Mutual providing a maximum liability coverage of $12 million.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A policy endorsement defined \u201cNamed Insured\u201d as \u201cFord Motor Company, its subsidiary, associated and affiliated companies, and its owned or controlled companies as are now or may hereafter be constituted.\u201d Ford Credit is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford Motor.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Appellants asked the trial court to declare that \u201cthe [Michigan Mutual] insurance policy affords liability coverage which would be available to satisfy plaintiffs\u2019 claims ... or to pay any judgments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>recovered by plaintiffs against Haigh in the lawsuits\u201d. The appellants filed a motion for summary judgment. The appellees, having filed their grounds of defense and a cross-motion for summary judgment, joined with the appellants in a \u201cSTATEMENT OF FACTS NOT IN DISPUTE\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Based upon that statement, exhibits related to the several stipulations, other exhibits filed with the cross-motions, and oral argument by counsel, the trial court issued a letter opinion sustaining the cross-motions in part and denying them in part. In a final judgment order entered June 20, 1997, the court ruled: (1) that \u201cHaigh is an insured under the subject Michigan Mutual . . . policy ... as a permissive user of the vehicle owned by Ford Credit, as provided in Va. Code \u00a7 38.2-2204\u201d; (2) that, \u201cbecause Haigh was a permissive user, liability coverage under the Policy extends to claims of the plaintiffs arising from the accident which prompted this suit for declaratory judgment\u201d; and (3) that \u201cthe Defendants in this case are entitled to the limitation on liability set forth in Va. Code \u00a7 38.2-2205 and ... the amount of liability coverage under the Policy applicable to any liability of Haigh arising from the accident which prompted this suit for declaratory judgment is limited to $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident as set forth in, and subject to the provisions of, Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-2205 and 46.2-472\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error addresses the trial court\u2019s third ruling. They contend that the appellees are not eligible for the coverage limitation fixed in Code \u00a7 46.2-472 because, they say, Ford Credit is not engaged in the business of leasing vehicles within the intendment of Code \u00a7 38.2-2205 but only in the business of financing leases. In pertinent part, \u00a7 38.2-2205(A)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">Each policy ... of bodily injury . . . liability insurance which provides insurance to a named insured in connection with the business of . . . leasing . . . motor vehicles, against liability arising from the . . . use of any motor vehicle incident thereto shall contain a provision that the insurance coverage . . . shall not be applicable to a person other than the named insured ... if there is any other valid and collectible insurance applicable to the same loss covering the other person under a policy with limits at least equal to the financial responsibility requirements specified in \u00a7 46.2-472. Such provision shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>apply to motor vehicles which are . . . leased to the other person for a period of six months or more. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In the language of this statute, Ford Credit is a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under Michigan Mutual\u2019s policy covering a vehicle leased to the \u201cother person [Haigh] for a period of six months or more\u201d and Haigh is the \u201cperson other than the named insured\u201d covered under that policy because there is no \u201cother valid and collectible insurance . . . covering the other person under a policy with limits at least equal to the financial responsibility requirements specified in \u00a7 46.2-472.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The dispositive question, then, is whether Michigan Mutual\u2019s policy provides insurance to a named insured \u201cin connection with the business of . . . leasing\u201d. The appellants insist that Ford Credit\u2019s very name identifies it as an entity engaged in the business of financing rather than leasing. The trial court ruled that \u201cFord Credit did more than just \u2018finance\u2019 the lease of the subject truck.\u201d As explained in its letter opinion, the court\u2019s ruling was based upon the record and the stipulated facts before it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">Ford Credit provides the blank lease documents for use by Ford dealerships, approves the leases before the dealerships enter into them, purchases the vehicles, takes assignments of the leases, assumes all of the duties and rights of ownership of the leased vehicles, and performs administrative duties during the term of the leases. Under the terms of the . . . leases, Ford Credit becomes the lessor of the vehicles, not just a financial backer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling that Michigan Mutual\u2019s policy provides insurance within the intendment of Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-2205(A)(1) and 46.2-472.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Yet, appellants maintain that Ford Credit is bound by an admission stated in its \u201cAnnual Report on Form 10-K\u201d filed in 1993 with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission that it was in the business of financing. In an alternative assignment of error, they contend that, if that admission was not sufficient to \u201cestablish conclusively that Ford Credit is in the business of financing rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>leasing, then the trial court erred in granting [the appellees] summary judgment . . . because a material fact is genuinely in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We disagree. Ford Credit\u2019s acknowledgement that it was \u201cin the business of financing\u201d is not factually inconsistent with its contention that it is a \u201cnamed insured\u201d in Michigan Mutual\u2019s insurance policy issued \u201cin connection with the business of . . . leasing . . . motor vehicles\u201d. Consequently, we agree with the trial court that Ford Credit was a lessor of the vehicle and that \u201cno material facts remain in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Finding no merit in the appellants\u2019 assignments of error, we will affirm the final judgment entered June 20, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-9\"> The appellants are Corrie L.
