Acts 1984, ch. 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">The Act, Virginia\u2019s so-called \u201cLemon Law,\u201d generally provides that if a consumer has purchased a motor vehicle for nonbusiness purposes and reports, within a specified period of time, a defect or nonconformity covered by the motor vehicle manufacturer\u2019s express warranty, the manufacturer or its agent must perform the repairs necessary to correct the problem. If the vehicle cannot be conformed to the warranty after a reasonable number of attempts, the consumer is entitled to replacement of the vehicle or refund of the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">The first state lemon law was enacted by the Connecticut legislature in 1982. Since that time, a majority of states has enacted similar legislation, although no two lemon laws are identical. Noralyn O. Harlow, Annotation, <em>Validity, Construction, and Effect of State Motor Vehicle Warranty Legislation (Lemon Laws), </em>51 A.L.R.4th 872, 877 (1987).

Rev. 405, 425 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">A consumer suffering a loss by reason of a violation of any provision of the Act may bring a civil action to enforce such provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>sion. Code \u00a7 59.1-207.14. The Act does not impair or limit a consumer\u2019s rights under any other law. Code \u00a7\u00a7 59.1-207.10 and -207.13(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">In 1996, appellee Debora C. Peters filed this action against appellant Subaru of America, Inc., arising from the plaintiff\u2019s purchase of a used motor vehicle manufactured by defendant. Even though plaintiff, in an amended motion for judgment, sought recovery against defendant on several theories, the case evolved into an action based solely on the Act and its remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The defendant denied plaintiff is entitled to the relief sought. Additionally, it filed a pre-trial motion for summary judgment asserting \u201cthe Act applies only to the purchase by a consumer of a new motor vehicle.\u201d The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">During a jury trial, the court denied defendant\u2019s motions to strike plaintiff\u2019s evidence both at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case-in-chief and at the conclusion of all the evidence. The jury found in favor of the plaintiff and, after assessing attorney\u2019s fees against defendant, the trial court entered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $23,987.35. We awarded defendant this appeal from the May 1997 judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The facts are virtually undisputed. The subject of this controversy is a 1994 Subaru Legacy four-door station wagon.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The first sale of the vehicle occurred on April 7, 1994 when defendant sold it to Hertz Corporation, Greensboro, North Carolina, for use as a rental car. The second sale took place in November 1994 when defendant purchased the vehicle from Hertz and consigned it to the Greensboro Auto Auction for sale. The third sale occurred in December 1994 when Star Imports, Inc., purchased the vehicle at auction for resale at the Star Imports dealership in Lynchburg, Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">The fourth sale was to the plaintiff, a resident of Appomattox County. On March 20, 1995, she purchased the vehicle from Star Imports for her \u201cpersonal use.\u201d The odometer registered 18,919 miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">At the time of purchase, the plaintiff was entitled to the benefits of the balance of the defend\u00e1nt\u2019s vehicle warranty. The warranty\u2019s \u201cbasic coverage\u201d lasted for three years or 36,000 miles, \u201cwhichever comes first.\u201d Warranty coverage began on April 7, 1994, the date the car was \u201cdelivered to the first retail purchaser,\u201d according to the warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of the summary judgment motion and denial of its \u201cmotion to strike at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence.\u201d These assignments of error present three questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The first question is whether the Act applies only to the purchase of new as opposed to \u201cused\u201d vehicles. We hold that it applies to both, as will be demonstrated by analysis of pertinent provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We look first to the Act\u2019s title, \u201cVirginia Motor Vehicle Warranty Enforcement Act.\u201d Unlike some other state lemon laws, the General Assembly made no distinction in the title between \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cused\u201d vehicles. See Connecticut\u2019s lemon law entitled \u201cNew Automobile Warranties.\u201d Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann., Title 42, \u00a7 179 <em>et seq. </em>(West 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Moreover, in Code \u00a7 59.1-207.10, a preamble setting forth the intent of the Act, the General Assembly referred throughout to \u201ca\u201d motor vehicle and not to a \u201cnew\u201d motor vehicle. This is a plain indication that the Act is meant to apply to the vehicles, new and used, that qualify for coverage under the Act. For example, the statute\u2019s first sentence provides: \u201cThe General Assembly recognizes that a motor vehicle is a major consumer purchase, and there is no doubt that a defective motor vehicle creates a hardship for the consumer.\u201d Likewise, the statute\u2019s third sentence provides: \u201cIt is further the intent of the General Assembly to provide the statutory procedures whereby a consumer may receive a replacement motor vehicle, or a full refund, for a motor vehicle which cannot be brought into conformity with the express warranty issued by the manufacturer.\u201d In both the Act\u2019s title and preamble, the focus is upon the warranty, and not upon the vehicle\u2019s status as new or used.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on references in the Act to a \u201cnew\u201d motor vehicle, to support its contention that the Act applies only to new vehicles, is misplaced. The term \u201cnew\u201d is employed five times in the Act. The word is found at four places in Code \u00a7 59.1-207.11, where the terms \u201clemon law rights period,\u201d \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s express warranty,\u201d \u201cserious safety defect,\u201d and \u201csignificant impairment\u201d are defined; it is found in Code \u00a7 59.1-207.12, dealing with warranty conformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">However, the word \u201cnew\u201d is employed each time in the context of warranties issued when the vehicle is indeed \u201cnew.\u201d Instead of limiting the Act\u2019s applicability to a \u201cnew vehicle,\u201d the Act focuses upon the new vehicle warranty. In other words, the Act concentrates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>on the manufacturer\u2019s written factory warranty for the particular vehicle, and whether that vehicle can be brought into conformity with the warranty\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The second question is whether this plaintiff qualifies as a \u201cconsumer,\u201d as defined in the Act, so that she is entitled to claim the benefits of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">According to Code \u00a759.1-207.11, the term \u201cconsumer\u201d means \u201cthe purchaser, other than for purposes of resale, of a motor vehicle used in substantial part for personal, family, or household purposes, and any person to whom such motor vehicle is transferred for the same purposes during the duration of any warranty applicable to such motor vehicle, and any other person entitled by the terms of such warranty to enforce the obligations of the warranty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The defendant contends the plaintiff is not a \u201cconsumer.\u201d It says, \u201cThe purpose of this provision is to preclude the application of the Act to business vehicles or vehicles used for business purposes.\u201d Defendant continues: \u201cHertz Corp., the original owner, was not a consumer. When Hertz purchased the automobile and placed it into service as a rental car, the Act no longer applied to the automobile because it was being used substantially for business purposes. Accordingly, subsequent purchasers, including Peters, do not meet the definition of a consumer because no one after Hertz purchased from a consumer.\u201d In other words, according to defendant, \u201cThose who purchased \u2018downstream\u2019 from Hertz cannot bring a claim under the Act because they do not qualify as consumers. Peters\u2019 rights under the Act can rise no higher than the rights of her predecessors in title.\u201d We do not agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">We will assume this vehicle had been employed substantially for business purposes by Hertz, a fact not shown by the record. Nonetheless, the vehicle\u2019s subsequent sale to a nonbusiness transferee caused it to be included within the Act\u2019s \u201cconsumer\u201d definition. The record shows the plaintiff devoted the vehicle to her personal use for approximately 66% of the total odometer mileage at the time of trial. This clearly shows the vehicle was \u201cused in substantial part for personal . . . purposes,\u201d according to the first clause of the definition. Also, she was \u201cany person to whom such motor vehicle [was] transferred\u201d for those purposes \u201cduring the duration of [the] warranty applicable to such motor vehicle,\u201d according to the second clause of the definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the definition of \u201cconsumer\u201d nowhere denies benefits to a subsequent transferee who is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>\u201cdownstream\u201d from a business buyer. Thus, a buyer, such as this plaintiff, experiencing a \u201csignificant impairment,\u201d as defined in the Act, during the balance of the express factory warranty qualifies as a \u201cconsumer,\u201d whether or not a prior owner had employed the vehicle for business purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The third question is whether the plaintiff established a claim for benefits under the Act. Several portions of the Act are relevant to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Code \u00a7 59.1-207.12 requires conformity to all warranties. It provides: \u201cIf a new motor vehicle does not conform to all warranties, and the consumer reports the nonconformity to the manufacturer, its agents, or its authorized dealer during the manufacturer\u2019s warranty period, the manufacturer, its agent or its authorized dealer shall make such repairs as are necessary to conform the vehicle to such warranties, notwithstanding the fact that such repairs are made after the expiration of such manufacturer\u2019s warranty period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Code \u00a7 59.1-207.13(A) provides that \u201c[i]f the manufacturer, its agents or authorized dealers do not conform the motor vehicle to any applicable warranty by repairing or correcting any defect or condition, including those that do not affect the driveability of the vehicle, which significantly impairs the use, market value, or safety of the motor vehicle to the consumer[,] after a reasonable number of attempts during the lemon law rights period,\u201d the manufacturer shall either replace the motor vehicle, or accept return of the vehicle and refund to the consumer the full purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Subsection (B) of the foregoing statute creates a presumption that may be employed, if needed, by a consumer to establish \u201ca reasonable number of attempts\u201d and significant impairment under subsection (A). As relevant, subsection (B) provides: \u201cIt shall be presumed that a reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to conform a motor vehicle to any warranty and that the motor vehicle is significantly impaired if during the period of eighteen months following the date of original delivery of the motor vehicle to the consumer either: 1. The same nonconformity has been subject to repair three or more times by the manufacturer, its agents or its authorized dealers and the same nonconformity continues to exist;\u201d or \u201c3. The motor vehicle is out of service due to repair for a cumulative total of thirty calendar days. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">The \u201clemon law rights period\u201d is defined as \u201cthe period ending eighteen months after the date of the original delivery to the consumer of a new motor vehicle. This shall be the period during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>which the consumer can report any nonconformity to the manufacturer and pursue any rights provided for under this chapter.\u201d Code \u00a759.1-207.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The word \u201cnonconformity\u201d is defined as \u201ca failure to conform with a warranty, a defect or a condition, including those that do not affect the driveability of the vehicle, which significantly impairs the use, market value, or safety of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Dwelling on the presumption set forth in \u00a7 59.1-207.13(B), and other language of the subsection, the defendant argues the plaintiff failed to establish that the \u201csame nonconformity\u201d was \u201csubject to repair\u201d three times during the 18-month lemon law period. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The case was not submitted to the jury on the presumption. Instead, the jury was instructed on the provision of subsection (A) of the statute requiring replacement of the vehicle or refund of the purchase price if there was a failure to conform the vehicle to the warranty \u201cafter a reasonable number of attempts during the lemon law rights period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to find, without the benefit of the presumption, that the defendant or its agents were afforded a reasonable number of attempts to conform the vehicle during the 18-month period commencing April 7, 1994 and ending October 7, 1995. It is unnecessary to embark upon a detailed recital of the evidence of plaintiff\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to have defendant and its dealers conform the vehicle to defendant\u2019s warranty. Through her testimony supplemented by documentary evidence, the plaintiff established she experienced \u201cconstant\u201d problems with the operation of the vehicle following its purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">She repeatedly reported defects to defendant and its dealers. These reports commenced June 2, 1995 (\u201cbrakes were messing up\u201d) and continued: June 19 - \u201cmotor was coughing and then it was going into neutral\u201d; July 20 - \u201cmotor was still cutting off and the transmission . . . was jerking and would go in and out of neutral\u201d; July 26 - \u201ctransmission was still slipping and cutting off and the brakes were still the same thing because they had never fixed them\u201d; August 30 - brake problems and \u201cremanufactured transmission was put in it\u201d; and September 8 - \u201ctransmission was whining.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Additionally, the plaintiff made repeated complaints beyond the basic lemon law rights period because the warranty problems had not been corrected by defendant or its agents. Code \u00a7 59.1-207.13(C) provides, \u201cThe lemon law rights period shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>extended if the manufacturer has been notified but the nonconformity has not been effectively repaired by the manufacturer, or its agent, by the expiration of the lemon law rights period.\u201d The plaintiff notified the defendant by letter dated September 18, 1995 of the \u201cconstant problems with my car.\u201d She wrote: \u201cMy car cuts off while you are driving &amp; when you slow down it will cut off. The transmission goes into neutral while you are driving. The car jerks when you pull off. The brakes grab and do not properly stop my car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Finally, in arguing plaintiff failed to establish the necessary elements of a claim under the Act, defendant maintains plaintiff did not \u201cprove a nonconformity covered by the warranty.\u201d The warranty covers \u201cany repairs needed to correct defects in material or workmanship reported during the applicable warranty period which occur under normal use.\u201d Defendant argues plaintiff merely \u201ctestified about her complaints, but admitted that she was not a mechanic or expert.\u201d According to defendant, plaintiff offered no testimony \u201cregarding the applicability of the warranty to the alleged nonconformity.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Our previous summary of the facts demonstrates there was abundant evidence presented by the plaintiff, testimonial and documentary, to permit the jury to find that the engine, transmission, and brake problems resulted from defects in material or workmanship. Indeed, numerous repair orders and invoices from Star Imports, and an Amherst Subaru dealer to which plaintiff also took the vehicle for repair, show that, in most instances, plaintiff was not charged for work done in connection with her complaints. For example, plaintiff was not charged for replacing the transmission in August 1995. The jury was justified in concluding that, because no charges were assessed, the dealers considered the warranty applied to the nonconformities about which complaint was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Consequently, we conclude the trial court did not err, and the judgment below will be</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
