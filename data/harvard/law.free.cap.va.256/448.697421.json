Atkinson (Atkinson), filed a motion for judgment against Daniel W. Scheer, a doctor of osteopathic medicine. The estate alleged that Dr. Scheer breached the standard of care owed to Atkinson and that her death was caused by Dr. Scheer\u2019s negligence. Dr. Scheer filed a grounds of defense and denied any acts of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">During a jury trial, Dr. Scheer was permitted to ask the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, over the plaintiff\u2019s objection, whether another physician who had also treated Atkinson had committed acts of negligence. The trial court permitted Dr. Scheer to elicit such testimony, and at the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Dr. Scheer. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">We will state the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of Dr. Scheer, the recipient of a jury verdict confirmed by the trial court. Atkinson began to experience symptoms of a heart attack around 5:00 p.m. on September 12, 1994. She had pain and nausea, and she vomited. She arrived at Richmond Memorial Hospital\u2019s emergency room at 6:50 p.m., and she complained of pain in her chest, neck, and left shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">An emergency room nurse placed Atkinson on oxygen, extracted a blood sample from her, and connected her to a continuous heart monitor. The nurse gave Atkinson certain fluids intravenously and attached her to an electrocardiograph. Dr. Scheer examined Atkinson around 7:15 p.m., performed a physical evaluation, and ordered certain diagnostic tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Dr. Scheer testified that even though he did not make a final diagnosis of Atkinson on September 12, he made a working diagnosis that \u201cher etiology was probably cardiac in origin, probably cardiac ischemia.\u201d Dr. Scheer stated that a working diagnosis is \u201cthe one most likely to be what was going on with the person.\u201d Dr. Scheer described an ischemia as \u201ca lack of oxygen going to the heart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Subsequently, Dr. Scheer ordered that a patch of nitroglycerin paste be placed on Atkinson\u2019s chest to be absorbed through her skin into her body. The nitroglycerin paste dilated her blood vessels, thereby reducing the strain on her heart which, in turn, decreased her heart\u2019s need for oxygen. According to Dr. Scheer, after the nitroglycerin paste was administered, Atkinson\u2019s pain abated. Atkinson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>daughter, however, testified that her mother continued to experience pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Dr. Scheer ordered a blood test to ascertain the presence of enzymes in Atkinson\u2019s body which would have been indicative of heart damage. Dr. Scheer had not received the results of the blood test when his emergency room shift ended at 10:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Dr. Scheer also contacted Dr. Selwyn Goodwin by telephone. Dr. Goodwin was a physician who was \u201con call\u201d for Atkinson\u2019s regular treating physician. Dr. Goodwin was aware of Atkinson\u2019s past history of pulmonary embolism, a condition which could also cause chest pain. Dr. Goodwin suggested to Dr. Scheer that he order a ventilation protrusion scan which would detect the presence of this condition. This scan is commonly referred to as a VQ scan. The scan was performed, but the results were not available when Dr. Scheer\u2019s shift ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">When Dr. Scheer left the emergency room at about 10:00 p.m., Dr. Gayle Wampler-Adams, another emergency room physician, began treatment of Atkinson. Dr. Wampler-Adams testified that it was her \u201crecollection . . . that [Atkinson] had been cleared for discharge, that we were awaiting VQ scan results as a final diagnostic test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Dr. Wampler-Adams received the results of the VQ scan, which were negative. Dr. Wampler-Adams spoke with Atkinson, performed a physical examination, and reviewed the EKG and laboratory results available to her. Dr. Wampler-Adams noted in the emergency room record that her diagnosis of Atkinson\u2019s condition was \u201c[ajtypical chest pain, probable GE Reflux.\u201d Dr. Wampler-Adams also spoke by telephone with Dr. Goodwin. Dr. Wampler-Adams discharged Atkinson at 11:40 p.m. that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Dr. Wampler-Adams testified, without contradiction, that she relied upon Dr. Scheer\u2019s \u201cworkup\u201d of Atkinson when making the decision to discharge Atkinson. Shortly after her discharge, Atkinson began to experience symptoms associated with a heart attack. She began to vomit, and she complained of pain in her shoulder \u201cdown through her arm.\u201d Her regular physician diagnosed her condition the next day as \u201ca heart attack in progress,\u201d and she was admitted to Richmond Memorial Hospital. She died on October 4, 1994, as a result of her heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Dr. Scheer did not present any expert witnesses at trial. His expert witnesses were disqualified from testifying in a pretrial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Dr. David Munter, who qualified as an expert witness on behalf of the plaintiff on the subject of \u201cemergency room care medicine,\u201d testified within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Dr. Scheer breached the standard of care owed to Atkinson. Specifically, Dr. Munter testified that Dr. Scheer had enough information to admit Atkinson as a patient to the hospital and that he breached the standard of care in failing to do so. Dr. Munter also opined that Dr. Scheer should have been more aggressive in his treatment of Atkinson and that Atkinson would have \u201chad a very high probability of surviving had she been admitted\u201d to the hospital on the evening she was treated in the emergency room and that her \u201chigh likelihood of survivability was lost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">During Dr. Scheer\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Munter, the trial court permitted him to ask, over the plaintiff\u2019s objection, whether Dr. Wampler-Adams, who had settled the estate\u2019s claims against her, breached the standard of care owed to Atkinson. Dr. Munter testified that Dr. Wampler-Adams had breached the standard of care by discharging Atkinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Atkinson, relying upon <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>251 Va. 122, 465 S.E.2d 795 (1996), argues that the trial court erred by permitting Dr. Scheer to introduce evidence at trial that Dr. Wampler-Adams was negligent in her care and treatment of Atkinson. Dr. Scheer responds that the trial court properly admitted this testimony in evidence because Dr. Wampler-Adams\u2019 conduct was negligent and such conduct was a superseding intervening cause of Atkinson\u2019s injury. We disagree with Dr. Scheer.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">In <em>Jenkins, </em>we considered \u201cwhether the trial court erred in excluding from the jury\u2019s consideration (1) opinion evidence that another physician, who had settled the plaintiff\u2019s claim against him, was negligent in his treatment of the decedent, and (2) the defendants\u2019 argument that the settling physician was the sole proximate cause of the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>251 Va. at 124, 465 S.E.2d at 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Veronica L. Payne filed a motion for judgment against Harold S. Jenkins, M.D., Jill W. York, R.N., P.N.P., Barry S. Rothman, M.D., and Doctors Rothman, Grapin, and McKnight, PC. Payne alleged that these health care providers breached the applicable standards of care owed to her. Payne died before trial, and her husband, Troy R. Payne, the personal representative of her estate, was substituted as plaintiff, and the motion for judgment was amended to allege a cause of action for wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Veronica Payne had Paget\u2019s Disease, which is a cancer of the nipple and milk ducts. While this cancer remains non-invasive, it grows slowly and is highly curable. There is about a 90% survival rate for patients with Paget\u2019s Disease who receive treatment before the cancer becomes invasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Veronica Payne first sought treatment for her breast abnormalities when she was examined by York, a nurse practitioner working under the supervision of Dr. Jenkins. She was seen and treated twice by York, who referred her to a dermatologist. Subsequently, Payne sought treatment from Dr. Rothman, a gynecologist, who prescribed oral antibiotics and a topical steroid to treat problems she was having with her breast. <em>Id. </em>at 125-26, 465 S.E.2d at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Payne made several additional visits to both York and Dr. Roth-man because she was concerned about sores on her breast which had not healed properly. Subsequently, York examined Payne and discovered the presence of multiple masses in her breast, and Payne was referred to a surgical oncologist, who determined that she had aggressive cancer which had spread to her lymph nodes. An expert witness testified at trial that Payne\u2019s death was the result of a misdiagnosed breast cancer and that she would have had a 10-year survival probability of about 90% had her cancer been diagnosed when it was still non-invasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Before trial, the personal representative of Payne\u2019s estate settled his claim against Dr. Rothman and his professional corporation. The plaintiff made a motion in limine requesting that the trial court exclude any opinion evidence that Dr. Rothman was negligent in his treatment of Veronica Payne. The defendants objected, asserting that their defense would be based on a theory that Dr. Rothman\u2019s negligence was the sole proximate cause of Veronica Payne\u2019s death. The trial court ultimately granted the motion, ruling that Dr. Rothman\u2019s conduct was \u201cat the very best . . . concurrent negligence as opposed to [superseding negligence].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124, 465 S.E.2d at 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">On appeal, the defendants in <em>Jenkins </em>argued that the trial court erred in refusing to permit them to present testimony that Dr. Rothman breached the standard of care owed to Payne because there was evidence that Dr. Rothman was the sole proximate cause of Veronica Payne\u2019s death. Rejecting their contentions, we stated the following principles which are equally pertinent here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201cIssues of negligence and proximate causation ordinarily are questions of fact for the jury\u2019s determination. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Koulizakis, </em>229 Va. 524, 531, 331 S.E.2d 440, 445 (1985). A court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>decides these issues only when reasonable persons could not differ. <em>Hadeed </em>v. <em>Medic-24, Ltd., </em>237 Va. 277, 285, 377 S.E.2d 589, 593 (1989).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">\u201c \u2018The proximate cause of an event is that act or omission which, in natural and continuing sequence, unbroken by an efficient intervening cause, produces the event, and without which that event would not have occurred.\u2019 <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>210 Va. 519, 522, 171 S.E.2d 851, 853 (1970). There may be more than one proximate cause of an event. <em>Panousos </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>245 Va. 60, 65, 425 S.E.2d 496, 499 (1993).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">\u201cIn order to relieve a defendant of liability for his negligent act, the negligence intervening between the defendant\u2019s negligent act and <em>the injury must so entirely supersede the operation of the defendant\u2019s negligence that it alone, without any contributing negligence by the defendant in the slightest degree, causes the injury. Id.; Coleman </em>v. <em>Blankenship Oil Corp., </em>221 Va. 124, 131, 267 S.E.2d 143, 147 (1980); <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>103 Va. 320, 324, 49 S.E. 482, 483 (1905). Thus, a superseding cause of an injury \u2018constitutes a new effective cause and operates independently of any other act, making it and it only the proximate cause of injury.\u2019 <em>Maroulis </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>207 Va. 503, 511, 151 S.E.2d 339, 345 (1966).\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>Jenkins, </em>251 Va. at 128-29, 465 S.E.2d at 799.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">We applied these principles in <em>Jenkins, </em>and we held that reasonable persons could not conclude from the evidence that Dr. Rothman\u2019s negligence alone, without any contributing negligence by the defendants in the slightest degree, caused Payne\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">We also note that we stated in <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>103 Va. 320, 324, 49 S.E. 482, 483 (1905):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">\u201cTo be a superseding cause, whether intelligent or not, it must so entirely supersede the operation of the defendant\u2019s negligence, that it alone, without the defendant\u2019s contributing negligence thereto in the slightest degree, produces the injury.\u201d <em>Accord Panousos </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>245 Va. 60, 64-65, 425 S.E.2d 496, 499 (1993); <em>Philip Morris, Inc. </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>235 Va. 380, 397, 368 S.E.2d 268, 277 (1988); <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Mabe, </em>214 Va. 705, 708, 204 S.E.2d 253, 256 (1974); <em>Savage Truck Line </em>v. <em>Traylor, </em>193 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Va. 579, 585-86, 69 S.E.2d 478, 482 (1952); <em>Jefferson Hospital, Inc. </em>v. <em>Van Lear, </em>186 Va. 74, 81, 41 S.E.2d 441, 444 (1947).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Applying the principles that we enunciated in <em>Jenkins </em>and <em>Gay, </em>we hold, as a matter of law, that Dr. Wampler-Adams\u2019 conduct was not a superseding intervening cause of Atkinson\u2019s injury and, thus, the trial court erred by permitting Dr. Scheer to elicit testimony of Dr. Wampler-Adams\u2019 negligence. Dr. Scheer sought to relieve himself of liability for his purported negligent acts because of a claimed superseding intervening cause. Therefore, he was required to prove that Dr. Wampler-Adams\u2019 failure to admit Atkinson to the hospital entirely superseded the operation of Dr. Scheer\u2019s own alleged negligence so that Dr. Wampler-Adams\u2019 negligence alone, without any contributing negligence, even in the slightest degree by Dr. Scheer, caused Atkinson\u2019s injuries. Dr. Scheer failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The uncontradicted evidence of record demonstrates that Dr. Scheer\u2019s alleged negligence contributed at least \u201cin the slightest degree\u201d to Atkinson\u2019s death because Dr. Wampler-Adams testified without contradiction that she relied upon Dr. Scheer\u2019s \u201cworkup\u201d when she made the decision to discharge Atkinson. Even though Dr. Wampler-Adams, just as Dr. Rothman in <em>Jenkins, </em>had the last opportunity to take acts which would have substantially increased the patient\u2019s probability of survival, Dr. Wampler-Adams\u2019 failure to act did not entirely sever the chain of proximate causation set in motion by Dr. Scheer\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Finding no merit in Dr. Scheer\u2019s remaining arguments, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b477-9\">JUSTICE KOONTZ, with whom JUSTICE COMPTON and JUSTICE LACY</author>\n<p id=\"Aq6\">join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">The parties agree on appeal, as they did at trial, that the broad issue to be resolved is whether our decision in <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>251 Va. 122, 465 S.E.2d 795 (1996), is controlling in the factual context of the present case. The specific issue presented is whether it can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>properly determined as a matter of law that the conduct of Dr. Wampler-Adams was not a superseding intervening cause or the sole proximate cause of Ruby Atkinson\u2019s death, or whether that conduct created an issue of fact with regard to causation to be determined by the jury. I dissent because the majority resolves that issue as a matter of law and, although inadvertently, effectively invades the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">As we initially noted in <em>Jenkins, </em>ordinarily issues of negligence and proximate causation are questions of fact for the jury\u2019s determination and only become questions of law when reasonable persons could not differ. \u201cIn order to relieve a defendant of liability for his negligent act, the negligence intervening between the defendant\u2019s negligent act and the injury must so entirely supersede the operation of the defendant\u2019s negligence that it alone, without any contributing negligence by the defendant in the slightest degree, causes the injury.\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>251 Va. at 129, 465 S.E.2d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Guided by these well established principles, we held in <em>Jenkins </em>that two medical practitioners were not entitled to present opinion evidence that the negligence of a third defendant, against whom claims had been nonsuited following settlement of the claims against him, was the sole proximate cause of the patient\u2019s death. In that case, the evidence showed that all of the defendants concurrently treated the patient and were subject to the same standard of care of the patient. Therefore, the evidence would not support a finding that only the nonsuited defendant\u2019s negligence contributed to the patient\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we agreed with the trial court that while evidence establishing the facts surrounding the treatment of the patient by the nonsuited defendant was admissible, <em>id. </em>at 124 n.1, 465 S.E.2d 796 n.1, expert opinion as to whether he had breached the standard of care in his treatment of the patient was irrelevant to the issue of whether the defendants also were negligent in their treatment of the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">I begin my analysis by noting the obvious distinction between the factual context in which the causation issue arises in the present case and that existing in <em>Jenkins. </em>Unlike <em>Jenkins, </em>the present case does not involve concurrent medical treatment of a mutual patient. Here, Dr. Scheer and Dr. Wampler-Adams, while subject to the same standard of care in their treatment of Atkinson, did not concurrently treat her. Rather, Dr. Munter\u2019s testimony established that, consistent with the standard of care for patients in the emergency room, Scheer\u2019s treatment of Atkinson terminated at the end of Scheer\u2019s shift in the emer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>gency room, and Atkinson thereafter became solely the patient of Wampler-Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">This factual distinction is significant. This is particularly so in light of plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability and additional undisputed facts in this case. The thrust of plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability is that Dr. Scheer was negligent in failing to diagnose Atkinson\u2019s cardiac condition and, moreover, in failing to promptly admit her to the hospital for appropriate intensive cardiac care treatment. Indeed, plaintiff called Dr. Munter, as an expert witness, in support of that theory of liability. Dr. Munter, as noted by the majority, opined that Dr. Scheer was negligent in not admitting Atkinson to the hospital and that her very high probability of survivability was lost because she was not admitted to the hospital on the evening she was treated in the emergency room.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">However, Dr. Munter did not testify that this probability of survivability was lost solely as a result of Dr. Scheer\u2019s failure to admit Atkinson to the hospital. At that point in the succession of events to which Dr. Munter\u2019s testimony related, it is undisputed that when Dr. Scheer terminated his treatment of her, Atkinson remained in the emergency room. In addition, it is undisputed that Atkinson\u2019s condition was then stable. Plaintiff\u2019s other expert witness, Dr. Archer Baskerville, a board certified cardiologist, testified that Atkinson had suffered an \u201cincomplete heart attack\u201d before arriving at the emergency room and that the application of nitroglycerin stopped the heart attack for the period during which it was applied. Finally, it is also undisputed that Dr. Wampler-Adams did not admit Atkinson to the hospital, but, rather, after reviewing Dr. Scheer\u2019s notes on Atkinson\u2019s chart and the results of prior tests, conducting a physical examination, and receiving the negative results from the VQ scan, she discharged Atkinson with what proved to be an erroneous diagnosis of \u201c[ajtypical chest pain, probable GE Reflux.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">On cross-examination, Dr. Munter conceded that it was not a breach of the standard of care for Dr. Scheer to turn the treatment of Atkinson over to Dr. Wampler-Adams at the end of his shift, but \u201cit should never have reached that point.\u201d As Dr. Scheer\u2019s counsel proceeded to question Dr. Munter about Dr. Wampler-Adams\u2019 treatment of Atkinson, plaintiff objected, asserting that \u201c[tjhe case is not about Dr. Adams.\u201d Dr. Scheer contended that he was attempting to show a superseding cause arising from the negligence of Dr. WamplerAdams. Plaintiff renewed the motion in limine and the trial court replied, \u201cI think that\u2019s relevant,\u201d and noted plaintiff\u2019s objection. Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Munter then testified that Dr. Wampler-Adams had a duty to conduct her own examination and evaluation of the patient and that, based on the information available, Dr. Wampler-Adams or \u201canybody associated with this case in the emergency department should have admitted\u201d Atkinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">It is then in this factual context, in contrast to that in <em>Jenkins, </em>that the majority holds, as a matter of law, that Dr. Wampler-Adams\u2019 conduct was not a superseding intervening cause of Atkinson\u2019s death and, thus, that the trial court erred by permitting Dr. Scheer to elicit testimony of Dr. Wampler-Adams\u2019 negligence. The majority correctly notes that Dr. Scheer had the burden to prove that Dr. WamplerAdams\u2019 failure to admit Atkinson to the hospital entirely superseded the operation of Dr. Scheer\u2019s own alleged negligence so that Dr. Wampler-Adams\u2019 negligence alone, without any contributing negligence, even in the slightest degree, by Dr. Scheer, caused Atkinson\u2019s death. However, the majority then finds, as a matter of law, that Dr. Scheer failed to meet this burden because Dr. Wampler-Adams testified without contradiction that she relied upon Dr. Scheer\u2019s \u201cworkup\u201d when she made the decision to discharge Atkinson. In addition, the majority reasons that even though Dr. Wampler-Adams had the last opportunity to take acts which would have substantially increased Atkinson\u2019s probability of survival, Dr. Wampler-Adams\u2019 failure to act did not entirely sever the chain of proximate causation set in motion by Dr. Scheer\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The majority fails to consider the effect of the testimony of Dr. Baskerville that the application of nitroglycerin stopped Atkinson\u2019s heart attack for the period during which it was applied. This evidence establishes that, at the time Scheer terminated his treatment of Atkinson, she was in a stable condition and had not been discharged from the emergency room and was available to be admitted to the cardiac unit of the hospital at that time by Dr. Wampler-Adams. These facts distinguish this case from <em>Jenkins. </em>Moreover, they create a jury issue on causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Dr. Wampler-Adams\u2019 reliance upon Dr. Scheer\u2019s \u201cworkup\u201d may well explain in part her decision to discharge Atkinson. However, that reliance at best creates a factual issue whether Dr. WamplerAdams\u2019 conduct was a superseding intervening cause or the sole proximate cause of Atkinson\u2019s death. This is so simply because, on the evidence presented, reasonable persons could have differed as to whether Dr. Wampler-Adams\u2019 conduct so entirely superseded the operation of Dr. Scheer\u2019s failure to admit Atkinson to the hospital, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>that it alone, without Dr. Scheer\u2019s alleged negligence contributing thereto in the slightest degree, caused Atkinson\u2019s subsequent death. Accordingly, since a factual issue was presented in the context of this causation issue, Scheer was entitled to present expert opinion in support of his theory of non-liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
