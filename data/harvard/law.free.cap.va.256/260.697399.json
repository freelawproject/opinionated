The trial court dismissed the motion for judgment, holding that the defendants were entitled to sovereign immunity under Code \u00a7 22.1-194. We will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings because we conclude that the accident arose out of the \u201cloading\u201d of the school bus as defined by the School Board\u2019s liability insurance policy and, therefore, the defendants were not entitled to sovereign immunity pursuant to Code \u00a7 22.1-194.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Just before seven o\u2019clock in the morning on December 5, 1995, Stacy Wagoner drove her daughter Amanda to the school bus stop. She parked the car north of the westbound lane of State Route 57. A school bus driven by Benson approached the bus stop in the eastbound lane of Route 57 with its headlights on. When the bus was approximately 700 feet from the bus stop, Benson turned on the flashing red safety lights and, approximately thirty feet from the stop, she extended a mechanical stop sign. When the bus reached the stop, Wagoner got out of her mother\u2019s car and began crossing the westbound lane of Route 57 toward the front of the bus. When Wagoner was approximately half-way across the westbound lane, she was struck by a car driven by Mildred V. Brown and sustained serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Wagoner subsequently instituted this litigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The School Board and Benson filed a plea of sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court sustained the plea and dismissed the motion for judgment, concluding that sovereign immunity was not waived pursuant to Code \u00a7 22.1-194 because the School Board\u2019s liability insurance policy did not provide valid, collectible insurance for Wagoner\u2019s injuries. We awarded Wagoner an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">A public school board is entitled to sovereign immunity from liability for injuries resulting from the school board\u2019s simple negligence unless that immunity is abrogated by statute. <em>Kellam v. School Bd. of the City of Norfolk, </em>202 Va. 252, 255, 117 S.E.2d 96, 98 (1960). Code \u00a7 22.1-194 abrogates a school board\u2019s sovereign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>immunity to a limited degree. If the school board is an insured under a policy covering a vehicle involved in an accident, the school board is \u201csubject to action up to, but not beyond, the limits of valid and collectible insurance in force to cover the injury complained of . . . and the defense of governmental immunity shall not be a bar to action or recovery.\u201d Code \u00a7 22.1-194.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">In this case, the School Board was an insured under a motor vehicle liability policy covering the school bus involved in the accident. Whether the School Board is entitled to the defense of sovereign immunity depends upon whether its policy was \u201cvalid and collectible insurance in force to cover the injury complained of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The relevant portion of the policy states that the insurer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">will pay all sums anyone we protect legally must pay as damages caused by an accident covered by this policy. The accident must arise out of the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of an auto we insure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Wagoner argues that the accident in which she was injured arose out of the \u201cloading\u201d of the school bus, and, therefore, the School Board and Benson were not entitled to sovereign immunity because valid and collectible insurance was available. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\u201cLoading\u201d is not defined in the liability insurance policy. While the word \u201cload\u201d can be used as either a noun or a verb, it is used as a verb in this insurance policy. <em>Webster\u2019s </em>defines the verb \u201cload\u201d as putting \u201ca load in or on\u201d or \u201cto place in or on a means of conveyance.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary </em>1325 (1993). Neither the dictionary definition nor common usage limits \u201cloading\u201d to a single point in time or single action. \u201cLoading\u201d is a process which moves a \u201cload\u201d from one place to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">In this case, loading the school bus was a function performed by the bus driver. The loading process, that is moving the students from the road onto the bus, involved a number of steps. Those steps, viewed from the perspective of the driver performing the process, include turning on flashing warning lights and extending the mechanical stop sign and the metal safety gate, all of which remain engaged until all students are inside or have been \u201cloaded onto\u201d the school bus. Under the facts of this case, the accident clearly arose during the \u201cloading\u201d of the school bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Contrary to the argument of the School Board and Benson, our decision in <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>252 Va. 307, 477 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>517 (1996), does not require a different result. The similarity between <em>Stem </em>and this case is limited to the fact that both cases involve students who were injured while approaching a school bus with the intent of entering the bus. The legal issues involved in the two cases are not similar. First, <em>Stem </em>was not concerned with whether valid and collectible <em>liability </em>insurance was available to cover the injuries sustained by the student pursuant to Code \u00a7 22.1-194. Rather, the issue in <em>Stem </em>involved <em>uninsured motorist coverage, </em>specifically whether the injured student qualified as an insured under the uninsured motorist provisions of a school board\u2019s liability policy or was entitled to coverage under the provisions of the uninsured motorist statute, Code \u00a7 38.2-2206. <em>Stern, </em>252 Va. at 310, <em>All </em>S.E.2d at 519. Consequently, the focus of the inquiry in <em>Stern </em>was the student\u2019s use of the insured vehicle, not the use of the insured vehicle by the school bus driver, as it is in this case. Furthermore, <em>Stem </em>addressed the interpretation of the words \u201cusing\u201d and \u201coccupying\u201d in the context of uninsured motorist coverage, not the meaning of the word \u201cloading\u201d in the context of an automobile liability policy. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the holding in <em>Stem </em>simply is not applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In summary, we conclude that Wagoner\u2019s injuries were sustained in an accident arising out of the loading of a school bus insured by a motor vehicle liability policy in which the School Board was an insured. Because valid and collectible insurance was available to cover Wagoner\u2019s injuries, the defense of sovereign immunity does not bar an action against the School Board and Benson for recovery of damages in an amount up to the limits of the insurance policy. Code \u00a7 22.1-194.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\"> Wagoner also named Brown as a defendant, but dismissed that claim following a settlement agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-9\"> For purposes of this appeal, we need not distinguish between the availability of the sovereign immunity defense for Benson and the School Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
