We affirmed the conviction and death sentence. <em>Mickens </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 395, 442 S.E.2d 678 (1994) <em>(Mickens I). </em>The Supreme Corn! of the United States, however, vacated the judgment and remanded the case to this Court for reconsideration in light of <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>512 U.S. 154 (1994). <em>Mickens </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>513 U.S. _, 115 S.Ct. 307 (1994). Upon remand, we concluded that the holding in <em>Simmons </em>required a remand of the case to the trial court for a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>sentencing hearing. <em>Mickens </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 423, 457 S.E.2d 9 (1995) <em>(Mickens </em>II).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">On February 5-8, 1996, the trial court conducted the new sentencing hearing, and, after hearing evidence in aggravation and in mitigation, the jury fixed Mickens\u2019 punishment at death, based upon both the \u201cvileness\u201d and the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicates. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. After considering a probation officer\u2019s report and additional evidence presented during a post-sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced Mickens in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In this appeal of right, we review Mickens\u2019 death sentence and consider Mickens\u2019 assignments of error to various rulings by the trial court during the new sentencing hearing. Code \u00a7 17-110.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">A full statement of the facts surrounding the crime is set forth in <em>Mickens I, </em>247 Va. at 398-401, 442 S.E.2d at 681-83. At the new sentencing hearing, however, evidence of the crime was limited to the testimony of two witnesses, an Identification Technician with the Crime Scene Search Unit of the Newport News Police Department and an Assistant Chief Medical Examiner for the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">In the early afternoon of March 30, 1992, the police technician was dispatched to the crime scene on the shoreline of the James River, near 29th Street, in the City of Newport News. There she saw the body of the victim, later identified as Timothy Jason Hall. The body was nude from the waist down, except for white athletic socks, and the victim\u2019s legs were spread apart approximately 12 inches. Pubic hairs were recovered from the victim\u2019s buttocks. Bloody \u201ctransfer\u201d stains were apparent on the outsides of the victim\u2019s thighs, and a \u201cwhitish\u201d fluid was evident around the victim\u2019s anus and on his inner thighs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">An autopsy on the victim\u2019s body, performed by the medical examiner, revealed 143 separate \u201csharp force injuries.\u201d Of these, 62 were paired stab wounds which were present over the victim\u2019s head, neck, back, and shoulders. There also were 13 single stab wounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>and three paired incised wounds. The medical examiner concluded that the victim had bled to death and that 25 of the 143 wounds were fatal. The fatal wounds included a stab wound to the right neck that severed the carotid artery and the jugular vein, four paired stab wounds that punctured the right lung, three stab wounds that punctured the left lung, seven stab wounds to the skull that penetrated the brain, a stab wound to the forehead that also penetrated the brain, and one pair of stab wounds that perforated the liver. The medical examiner opined that the fatal wounds may not have caused instant death, and she estimated that the victim could have survived for as long as 30 to 40 minutes after the last wound had been inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In the new sentencing hearing, as in the first trial, the Commonwealth proved that Mickens had been convicted of six prior felonies, which are summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Date Offense Punishment</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">March 16, 1973 Attempted larceny from the person 3 years\u2019 imprisonment</p>\n<p id=\"AY5N\">June 3, 1974 Sodomy 3 years\u2019 imprisonment</p>\n<p id=\"A4P-\">June 3, 1974 Robbery 6 years\u2019 imprisonment</p>\n<p id=\"AMO\">June 3, 1974 Grand larceny from the person 4 years\u2019 imprisonment</p>\n<p id=\"AF1\">February 4, 1980 Sodomy 10 years\u2019 imprisonment</p>\n<p id=\"Akq\">February 4, 1980 Robbery 7 years\u2019 imprisonment</p>\n<p id=\"b334-19\">The evidence also established that Mickens had been paroled from prison three times. His initial parole on October 30, 1973, was revoked on August 16, 1974, because he had been convicted of robbery, grand larceny from the person, and sodomy. Mickens\u2019 second parole on July 1, 1979, was revoked on April 11, 1980, because he had been convicted of sodomy and robbery. His third parole commenced on December 19, 1991, and he was on parole when Hall was murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Charles Edward Siron, one of Mickens\u2019 sodomy victims, testified that, on February 14, 1974, when he was 18 years old, he and Mick-ens were incarcerated in the Newport News City Jail. While Siron was sleeping, Mickens put a razor blade to Siron\u2019s throat and forced him out of bed and into the shower area where Mickens attempted to sodomize him.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Ruby Bunn, one of Mickens\u2019 robbery victims, testified that, on February 7, 1974, she was teaching her second grade class at Erwin School in the City of Newport News. Mickens appeared at the classroom door holding a knife and demanding her pocketbook. Bunn went to get her money from her purse, and, when she looked up, she saw Mickens standing near a small boy and holding the knife a few inches from the boy\u2019s head. Bunn gave Mickens her money, and he left the classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Mickens called three witnesses, Darius L. Robinson, Jacquelyn Carter Brown, and his mother, Catherine Mickens. Robinson, a correctional officer who supervises Mickens in prison, testified that Mickens does his assigned chores \u201cvery well.\u201d Also, Mickens participates in a Literacy Incentive Program that teaches inmates mathematics, spelling, and reading. Robinson stated that Mickens has not been a problem to him while in prison and that he has no \u201cpersonal apprehension\u201d of Mickens. Robinson further stated that, if Mickens were given a life sentence, he first would be \u201choused in an area of people of the same type of conviction,\u201d and, if he \u201cprogresses,\u201d he probably would be placed in a \u201cless secure area,\u201d with nonviolent offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Brown, a counselor with the Department of Corrections, talks to prisoners \u201cabout family situations, personal problems, [and] things of that nature.\u201d She has provided counseling services to Mickens and has found him to be receptive to her counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Mickens\u2019 mother testified that Mickens has two siblings and that the three children lived with her dining their \u201cdevelopmental years.\u201d The children\u2019s father was not at home and did not provide assistance, and Mrs. Mickens worked and supported the family with the help of her grandfather. Mrs. Mickens testified that her son began to get into trouble when he was about 12 or 13 years old. During that time, she said, the \u201ccourt system\u201d did not provide any help for Mickens or services to assist her. She expressed hope that the jury would give her son a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>DI</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In this appeal, Mickens revisits many claims that he asserted, and we rejected, in <em>Mickens I. </em>After reconsidering those claims, we adhere to our previous decisions and, therefore, reject the following claims:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The death penalty is unconstitutional <em>per se </em>in that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and the use of electrocution to carry out a death penalty also violates the Eighth Amendment. Both claims were rejected in <em>Mickens </em>I, 247 Va. at 402, 442 S.E.2d at 683.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The aggravating factors set forth in Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C) as predicates for the imposition of the death penalty are unconstitutionally vague and unreliable. This claim was rejected in <em>Mickens I. Id. </em>at 402-03, 442 S.E.2d at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">Virginia\u2019s death penalty statutes are unconstitutional because they do not require a jury to find that aggravating circumstances \u201coutweigh\u201d mitigating circumstances and because they do not require jury instructions defining mitigating evidence, specifying the burden of proof for such evidence, and specifying how jurors must consider such evidence. This claim was rejected in <em>Mickens I. Id. </em>at 403-04, 442 S.E.2d at 684.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">Virginia fails to provide meaningful appellate review of death penalty cases. This claim was rejected in <em>Mickens I. Id. </em>at 405, 442 S.E.2d at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">An accused in a capital case is entitled to additional peremptory jury strikes. This claim was rejected in <em>Mickens I. Id. </em>at 404, 442 S.E.2d at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The trial court erred in admitting into evidence five photographs of the victim\u2019s body. This claim was rejected in <em>Mickens I. Id. </em>at 407-08, 442 S.E.2d at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Mickens contends that the trial court erred in refusing to remove prospective juror Frank Johnson for cause. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">During the jury <em>voir dire, </em>the prospective jurors were examined individually. The trial court excluded prospective juror Robin Johnson, who is Frank Johnson\u2019s sister, because she told the court that one of her brothers had been murdered and that she would be unable to be impartial in judging Mickens. She stated that she would be more prone to vote for the death penalty than for life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">The next prospective juror to be examined was Frank Johnson. After a thorough examination, he unequivocally stated that his brother\u2019s murder would not influence his decision as a juror or prevent him from judging Mickens impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">The trial court retained Frank Johnson as a juror. The court observed that he \u201cwas emphatic about [his] being able to be impartial\u201d and that it had no reason to believe otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">An appellate court must give deference to a trial court\u2019s decision whether to exclude or retain a prospective juror because the trial court \u201c \u2018sees and hears the juror;\u2019 \u201d therefore, a trial court\u2019s decision in the matter will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of manifest error. <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 246, 397 S.E.2d 385, 391 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 824 (1991) (quoting <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 426 (1985)). <em>Accord Sheppard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 379, 386-87, 464 S.E.2d 131, 136 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 U.S. _, 116 S.Ct. 1332 (1996); <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 192, 200, 402 S.E.2d 196, 200, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 902 (1991). Additionally, there is no rule of automatic exclusion \u00f3f a prospective juror simply because a family member was the victim of a violent crime. <em>Stockton, </em>241 Va. at 200, 402 S.E.2d at 200; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>Mackall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 240, 252, 372 S.E.2d 759, 767 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>492 U.S. 925 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In the present case, it is clear from Frank Johnson\u2019s answers that his brother\u2019s murder would not have prevented him from judging Mickens impartially or made him more inclined to impose the death penalty. Thus, giving the trial court the deference it is due, the record fully supports the trial court\u2019s ruling, and we cannot say that the ruling constituted manifest error.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Mickens contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a bill of particulars, seeking the Commonwealth\u2019s identification of all the evidence \u201con which it intends to rely in support of the aggravating factors . . . and its contention that the death penalty is the appropriate punishment.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">An accused is not entitled to a bill of particulars as a matter of right. Code \u00a7 19.2-230. Whether to require the Commonwealth to file a bill of particulars is a matter that rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Goins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 454, 470 S.E.2d 114, 123 (1996). It is not the proper function of a bill of particulars to require the Commonwealth to identify all the evidence it intends to produce in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial. <em>Quesinberry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 364, 372, 402 S.E.2d 218, 223, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 834 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">In the present case, the record shows that Mickens had full knowledge of all evidence to be used against him. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney advised the court and Mickens that \u201cthe evidence . . . will be substantially the same as the evidence . . . produced [in the first trial],\u201d and, except in one particular of which Mickens was advised, the evidence was the same. Clearly, therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mickens\u2019 motion for a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C) requires us to review Mickens\u2019 death sentence on the record to determine whether the sentence (1) was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>trary factor; or (2) is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant. We conduct this review even though Mickens has not claimed that his death sentence was the product of any arbitrary factor or that it is excessive or disproportionate.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">From our independent review of the record, we have found nothing to suggest that the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In making the proportionality review, we must determine whether other sentencing bodies in this jurisdiction generally impose a death sentence for similar or comparable crimes, considering both the defendant and his crime. <em>Goins, </em>251 Va. at 469, 470 S.E.2d at 131-32. In <em>Mickens I, </em>we concluded that Mickens\u2019 death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to penalties generally imposed by other sentencing bodies in the Commonwealth. 247 Va. at 412, 442 S.E.2d at 689. In discharging the same duty here, we have compiled and examined the records of all capital murder cases reviewed by this Court since <em>Mickens I, </em>Code \u00a7 17-110.1(E), giving particular attention to the cases in which the death sentence was based upon both the \u201cvileness\u201d and the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicates. From this review, we conclude that Mickens\u2019 death sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate to penalties generally imposed by other sentencing bodies in the Commonwealth for similar and comparable crimes. <em>See, e.g., Barnabei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 161, 179, 477 S.E.2d. 270, 281 (1996); <em>Goins, </em>251 Va. at 469-70, 470 S.E.2d at 132; <em>Sheppard, </em>250 Va. at 395, 464 S.E.2d at 141; <em>Breard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 68, 89, 445 S.E.2d 670, 682, <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 971 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">vn</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that there is no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s judgment and that the sentence of death should be affirmed. Consequently, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\"> In <em>Mickens II, </em>we ruled that the jury was entitled to be informed of Mickens\u2019 parole ineligibility. 249 Va. at 425, 457 S.E.2d at 10. To this end, the trial court, upon remand, instructed the jury that \u201cimprisonment for life\u201d meant life imprisonment \u201cwithout possibility of parole.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b333-12\"> Bloody \u201ctransfer\u201d stains occur when a bloody object comes into contact with a surface, thereby leaving a stain on the surface.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b336-14\"> On appeal, Mickens also challenges the use of lethal injection, the alternate method of execution provided for in Code \u00a7 53.1-233, contending that it too is cruel and unusual punishment This claim was not made in the trial court, and, therefore, we will not consider it for the first time on appeal. Rule 5:25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b336-15\"> On appeal, Mickens also challenges the trial court\u2019s giving of Instructions 1 and 3, which governed the jury\u2019s consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. We reject this contention, finding that the jury was properly instructed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b338-12\"> The Commonwealth did not intend to introduce any unadjudicated criminal conduct by Mickens. Therefore, Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3:2, which requires notice of such intention and a description of such conduct, was not applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
