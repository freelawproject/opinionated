Because the speedy trial statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> defines a breach of the right in terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>expiration of stated time periods, we will summarize the relevant chronology.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">January 9, 1992 The General District Court of the City of Richmond conducted a preliminary hearing on warrants charging Steven Jerome Johnson with robbery and with the use of a firearm in the commission of robbery. That court found probable cause and certified the case to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">April 27, 1992 Convicted by a jury on both counts and sentenced to a total of nine years\u2019 imprisonment, Johnson appealed to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">December 14, 1993 A panel of the Court of Appeals entered an order finding \u201cerror in the judgment\u201d and remanding the case \u201cfor a new trial\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">March 11, 1994 Alleging denial of his statutory right to a speedy trial, Johnson filed a motion to dismiss. Following a hearing, the circuit court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">May 9, 1994 Johnson entered a guilty plea, conditioned upon his right to appeal the speedy trial issue. The trial court imposed sentence, and Johnson appealed the final judgment to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>October 24, 1995 A panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Invoking \u201cthe last unnumbered paragraph of 19.2-243\u201d, Johnson contends that the \u201crunning of the [five-month] statutory period was tolled during the pendency of the appeal\u201d and that the \u201cstatutory period resumed on [December 14, 1993], leaving the Commonwealth with the unexpired balance of time within which to try the case or take other action.\u201d We disagree with that construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The statute expressly provides that an accused felon must be \u201cforever discharged from prosecution ... if no trial is commenced in the circuit court within five months from the date . . . probable cause was found by [a] district court\u201d when the accused has been \u201cheld continuously in custody\u201d for that period; if at liberty during that period, the accused will be discharged from prosecution if \u201cno trial is commenced . . . within nine months from the date such probable cause was found.\u201d The same time periods, with the same distinctions concerning custody, apply to an accused on appeal of a district court conviction of a misdemeanor or traffic infraction, that is, the accused must be discharged from prosecution \u201cif the trial de novo in the circuit court is not commenced\u201d before expiration of the applicable time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-243 uses the word \u201ccommenced\u201d repeatedly and purposefully to define compliance with the time periods prescribed as the statutory measure of the right of an accused to a speedy trial. Nowhere does the statute, including the last unnumbered paragraph, require that the trial, once timely commenced, be concluded before the termination of the time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">This Court reached that conclusion in <em>Butts </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>145 Va. 800, 133 S.E. 764 (1926). There, the appellant argued, as Johnson argues here, that the speedy trial statute required that final judgment be entered before expiration of the applicable time period. Rejecting that contention, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">The object of the statute is to secure a \u201cspeedy trial,\u201d and where the accused is actually brought to trial within the time required by the statute, but from some adventitious cause, without fault on the part of the Commonwealth, . . . final judgment cannot be entered during such [time], the statute has been sufficiently complied with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 808, 133 S.E. at 766; <em>accord Howell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 894, 898, 45 S.E.2d 165, 166-67 (1947)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Johnson\u2019s challenge addresses only the speedy trial statute. Neither the Sixth Amendment of the federal Constitution nor article 1, \u00a7 8 of the Constitution of Virginia was invoked in the trial court or on appeal to this Court. In <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514 (1972), the Supreme Court concluded that, in the enactment of such statutes, \u201c[t]he States ... are free to prescribe a reasonable period\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 523, and that when required to determine \u201cwhether a particular defendant has been deprived of his [constitutional] right\u201d, courts should consider \u201c[l]ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Reaffirming our construction of the statute in <em>Butts </em>and <em>Howell, </em>we hold that when, as here, the trial of an accused has been commenced within the applicable time period prescribed by the Virginia statute and, on appeal, a conviction is reversed and the case is remanded for retrial, the time for retrial rests within the discretion of the trial court, a discretion measured and controlled by the constitutional standards of reasonableness and fairness explicated in <em>Barker. </em>Stated differently, upon retrial following reversal on appeal, the right of an accused to a speedy trial is governed exclusively by the constitutional mandate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">In a second assignment of error, Johnson contends that the panel of the Court of Appeals whose judgment is under review erred in holding that it was \u201cbound by the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>to apply\u201d an earlier ruling made by another panel in <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>19 Va. App. 637, 453 S.E.2d 914 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>240 Va. 171, 174, 395 S.E.2d 456, 457 (1990), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>As used in Code \u00a7 17-116.02(C), acting independently merely means that each panel must decide on its own the cases it hears, not that it is free from traditional rules of decision, such as stare decisis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Complaining that the <em>Burns </em>court \u201cdid not consider the provision in Code \u00a7 17-116.02(D)(ii)\u201d authorizing an <em>en banc </em>hearing by the Court of Appeals, Johnson characterizes our statutory interpretation as <em>dictum. </em>The Court of Appeals has repeatedly applied our interpretation as a rule of law. <em>See Rocco Turkeys, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lemus, </em>21 Va. App. 503, 510, 465 S.E.2d 156, 160 (1996); <em>In Re Baskins, </em>16 Va. App. 241, 245, 430 S.E.2d 555, 558 (1993), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Jamborsky v. Baskins, </em>247 Va. 506, 442 S.E.2d 636 (1994); <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 892, 894 n.2, 421 S.E.2d 455, 457 n.2 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Reaffirming our statutory interpretation in <em>Burns </em>we hold that a decision of a panel of the Court of Appeals becomes a predicate for application of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>until overruled by a decision of the Court of Appeals sitting <em>en banc </em>or by a decision of this Court. Finding no error below, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-15\"> In relevant part, Code \u00a7 19.2-243 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-16\">Where a general district court has found that there is probable cause to believe that the accused has committed a felony, the accused, if he is held continuously in custody thereafter, shall be forever discharged from prosecution for such offense if no trial is commenced in the circuit court within five months from the date such probable cause was found by the district court; and if the accused is not held in custody but has been recognized for his .appearance in the circuit court to answer for such offense, he shall be forever discharged from prosecution therefor if no trial is commenced in the circuit court within nine months from the date such probable cause was found.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>If there was no preliminary hearing in the district court, or if such preliminary hearing was waived by the accused, the commencement of the running of the five and nine months periods, respectively, set forth in this section, shall be from the date an indictment or presentment is found against the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-13\">If an indictment or presentment is found against the accused but he has not been arrested for the offense charged therein, the five and nine months periods, respectively, shall commence to run from the date of his arrest thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-14\">Where a case is before a circuit court on appeal from a conviction of a misdemeanor or traffic infraction in a district court, the accused shall be forever discharged from prosecution for such offense if the trial de novo in the circuit court is not commenced (i) within five months from the date of the conviction if the accused has been held continuously in custody or (ii) within nine months of the date of the conviction if the accused has been recognized for his appearance in the circuit court</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-15\">But the time during the pendency of any appeal in any appellate court shall not be included as applying to the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b445-10\"> The speedy trial statute construed in <em>Butts </em>and applied <em>in Howell, former </em>Code \u00a7 4926, contained the same language contained \u201cin the last unnumbered paragraph of 19.2-243\u201d invoked by Johnson in support of his construction of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b445-11\"> A number of courts in other states have agreed that the time limitations of speedy trial statutes do not apply on retrial and that when a retrial is required, an accused must rely on the constitutional guarantee. <em>See e.g., Lahr </em>v. <em>State, </em>615 N.E.2d 150, 151-52 (Ind. App. 2 Dist. 1993); <em>Carlisle </em>v. <em>State, </em>393 So.2d 1312, 1314 (Miss. 1981); <em>Ruester </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>250 So.2d 264, 267 (Fla. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b446-8\">JUSTICE LACY, with whom JUSTICE KEENAN</author>\n<p id=\"AvH\">joins, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">I write separately because, while the majority\u2019s disposition resolves the case, its rationale does not address the principal issue raised by the defendant in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Steven Johnson has consistently based his claim that he was denied a speedy trial on his interpretation of the final sentence of Code \u00a7 19.2-243, the speedy trial statute. That sentence provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">But the time during the pendency of any appeal in any appellate court shall not be included as applying to the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">Johnson asserts that when his first trial began, approximately one month and 14 days of the five-month period prescribed by the statute remained unused. Johnson construes the quoted portion of the statute as \u201ctolling\u201d the running of this unused period until December 14, 1993, when the Court of Appeals reversed his conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. At that point, under Johnson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>theory the tolling ceased and the Commonwealth was required to commence his second trial within the unused one month and 14 days. Because his second trial did not commence within that period, he concludes that the speedy trial statute was violated and the charges against him must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The lynchpin of Johnson\u2019s argument is that if the time periods established in the speedy trial act only apply to the commencement of his initial trial, as the Court of Appeals concluded, the reference in the statute to time elapsed \u201cduring the pendency of any appeal\u201d is meaningless. I disagree with Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The Court of Appeals construed the sentence in question as applying only to pre-trial appeals. This sentence was added to the speedy trial statute in 1894. Acts of Assembly, 1893-94, p. 464. Although there were no specific statutory procedures for pretrial appeals at that time, defendants nevertheless pursued appeals prior to the commencement of the first trial. <em>See e.g. Saunders </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>79 Va. 522, 523 (1884) (appeal of denial of double jeopardy plea dismissed when case had not \u201cprogressed further than the order of the court rejecting the second plea tendered by the defendant\u201d). Furthermore, in its very next session 1895-96, the General Assembly enacted legislation providing statutory procedures for pretrial appeals in certain situations. Acts of Assembly, 1895-96, p. 365-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Construing the statute as suggested by Johnson and thereby allowing dismissal of criminal charges under these circumstances is not required in order to provide a defendant with the protection of a speedy trial, and I cannot ascribe such an intent to the General Assembly. The Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of the statute imposes statutory periods that guarantee a timely commencement of a defendant\u2019s first trial, and leaves evaluation of the timeliness of second and subsequent trials to the standards developed under the state and federal constitutions. <em>See Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Although this Court has not addressed the specific issue presented in this appeal, we have previously stated that the statutory requirement for a speedy trial is satisfied if the trial is commenced within the requisite period. <em>Butts </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>145 Va. 800, 133 S.E. 764 (1926) (statute satisfied although trial court\u2019s final judgment not entered within the statutory period). The Court of Appeals\u2019 construction of the last paragraph of the statute is consistent with this statement and is the proper interpretation of \u00a7 19.2-243. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>for the reasons stated, I concur in the disposition reached by the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
