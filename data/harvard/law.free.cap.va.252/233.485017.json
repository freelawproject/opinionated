Gerald provided therapy and counseling services to the plaintiff, Katrina Q. Plummer, who was suffering from depression. Gerald was \u201ccognizant of [the] [p]laintiff\u2019s psychological and emotional history, which included her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>prior attempts at suicide,\u201d and he knew \u201cthat she was suffering from suicide ideation, and depression.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">On February 8, 1989, while the plaintiff was receiving counseling from Gerald at the defendant\u2019s place of business, Gerald committed \u201can act of sexual intercourse upon [p]laintiff [which] constituted an assault and battery upon her since, Dr. Roque Gerald, through his education, experience and knowledge of [p]laintiff overcame her will so that she was unable to act with volition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The plaintiff filed her motion for judgment against the defendant seeking to recover, <em>inter alia, </em>damages caused by the assault and battery. The plaintiff alleged that Gerald was an employee, agent, and servant of the defendant and that he was acting within the scope of his employment when he engaged in sexual intercourse with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The defendant filed a demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment asserting, among other things, that as a matter of law, it cannot be liable to the plaintiff because Gerald was not acting in the course of his employment when he committed the act of sexual intercourse and, therefore, the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>is not applicable. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s demurrer. We awarded the plaintiff an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court erred by dismissing her claim for assault and battery against the defendant because she pled sufficient facts in her motion for judgment which, if proven at trial, would create a jury issue on the question whether Gerald was acting within the course of his employment when he committed an act of sexual intercourse upon her. The defendant argues that, as a matter of law, Gerald was not acting within the scope of his employment, but <em>\u201csolely </em>for his own personal interests.\u201d We disagree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Initially, we observe that pursuant to the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>an employer is liable for the tortious acts of its employee if the employee was performing his employer\u2019s business and acting within the scope of his employment when the tortious acts were committed. <em>Kensington Associates </em>v. <em>West, </em>234 Va. 430, 432, 362 S.E.2d 900, 901 (1987); <em>McNeill </em>v. <em>Spindler, </em>191 Va. 685, 694, 62 S.E.2d 13, 17 (1950). Additionally, \u201c[w]hen an employer-employee relationship has been established, \u2018the burden is on the [employer] to prove that the [employee] was <em>not </em>acting within the scope of his employment when he committed the act complained of, and ... if the evidence leaves the question in doubt it becomes an issue to be determined by the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kensington Associates, </em>234 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>at 432-33, 362 S.E.2d at 901 (quoting <em>Broaddus </em>v. <em>Standard Drug Co., </em>211 Va. 645, 653-54, 179 S.E.2d 497, 504 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">We recently discussed the principles which are dispositive of this dispute in <em>Commercial Business Systems </em>v. <em>BellSouth, </em>249 Va. 39, 453 S.E.2d 261 (1995). BellSouth awarded Commercial Business Systems a contract to repair certain equipment manufactured by Digital Equipment Corporation. William Jordan, a BellSouth employee, had negotiated and administered the contract with Commercial Business Systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Jerry H. Waldrop, another BellSouth employee, replaced Jordan as the contract negotiator and administrator. Subsequently, Waldrop made false statements about Commercial Business Systems\u2019 financial status and its performance under the contract. Waldrop also informed Commercial Business Systems that the contract would not be renewed, and he awarded another company the contract. We observed that the record in <em>Commercial Business Systems</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\u201cclearly established that Waldrop committed serious violations of BellSouth\u2019s conflict-of-interest rules. Waldrop established his own company, called EntraCom Corporation, as a means to conduct business with Halifax and other companies that provided services to BellSouth, and he accepted bribes from Halifax in the form of \u2018kickbacks\u2019 on transactions between Halifax and EntraCom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 43, 453 S.E.2d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">In <em>Commercial Business Systems, </em>we noted that \u201c[i]n determining whether an agent\u2019s tortious act is imputed to the principal, the doctrine\u2019s primary focus is on whether the activity that gave rise to the tortious act was within or without the agent\u2019s scope of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44, 453 S.E.2d at 265. We also stated the test that we believe is applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">\u201cThe courts . . . have long since departed from the rule of non-liability of an employer for wilful or malicious acts of his employee. Under the modem view, the wilfulness or wrongful motive which moves an employee to commit an act which causes injury to a third person does not of itself excuse the employer\u2019s liability therefor. The test of liability is not the motive of the employee in committing the act complained of, but whether that act was within the scope of the duties of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>employment and in the execution of the service for which he was engaged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 45, 453 S.E.2d at 266 (quoting <em>Tri-State Coach Corp. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>188 Va. 299, 305-06, 49 S.E.2d 363, 366 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Applying this test in <em>Commercial Business Systems, </em>we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">\u201cUnquestionably, Waldrop\u2019s conduct was outrageous and violative of his employer\u2019s rules. His motive was personal \u2014 to advance his self-interest, rather than the interest of BellSouth. And yet, Waldrop\u2019s willful and malicious acts were committed while Waldrop was performing his duties as BellSouth\u2019s contract negotiator and administrator and in the execution of the services for which he was employed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">We hold, therefore, that the evidence presents a jury issue whether Waldrop acted within the scope of his employment when he committed the wrongful acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\"><em>Commercial Business Systems, </em>249 Va. at 46, 453 S.E.2d at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">We are of opinion that, here, the facts alleged in the motion for judgment are sufficient to support the plaintiff\u2019s legal conclusion that Gerald acted within the scope of his employment when he committed the wrongful acts against the plaintiff. According to the plaintiff\u2019s allegations, Gerald\u2019s act was committed while he was performing his duties as a psychologist in the execution of the services for which he was employed, in this instance, counseling and therapy. Additionally, Gerald\u2019s education, experience, and knowledge of the plaintiff, who was depressed and had suicidal ideations, enabled him \u201c[to overcome] her will so that she was unable to act with volition.\u201d Furthermore, at this stage of the proceedings, there simply are not sufficient facts which would permit us to hold, as a matter of law, that the defendant has met its burden of showing that its employee was <em>not </em>acting within the scope of his employment. <em>See Broaddus, supra, </em>211 Va. at 653-54, 179 S.E.2d at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">The defendant asserts that our recent decision in <em>Tomlin </em>v. <em>McKenzie, </em>251 Va. 478, 468 S.E.2d 882 (1996), supports his contention that Gerald\u2019s acts, as a matter of law, were outside the scope of his employment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">In <em>Tomlin, </em>the plaintiffs filed their motion for judgment against Patsye D. McKenzie, a licensed clinical social worker, and her employer, a professional corporation owned solely by McKenzie. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The motion for judgment alleged that McKenzie provided family therapy to the plaintiffs pursuant to an order of referral by the Juvenile &amp; Domestic Relations District Court of the City of Chesapeake. The motion for judgment further alleged that in the course of providing that therapy, McKenzie and her employer intentionally and maliciously committed certain acts constituting malpractice and defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The defendants filed a plea in bar, seeking dismissal of the action on the basis that McKenzie and her employer were entitled to common law and statutory immunity. McKenzie and her employer asserted that common law sovereign immunity protected them from civil suits for actions performed in McKenzie\u2019s capacity as a court-appointed officer. We reversed the judgment of the trial court which had sustained their motions because McKenzie\u2019s conduct was outside the scope of the court-ordered referral.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><em>Tomlin </em>is not implicated here. McKenzie\u2019s employer did not claim that she was acting outside the scope of her employment when she committed the allegedly tortious acts. Rather, we reviewed the facts pled in the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment, considered her specific factual allegations, applied the principles relevant to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, and held that the intentional torts alleged were outside the scope of McKenzie\u2019s court-appointed role. Here, however, we do not concern ourselves with sovereign immunity, but with the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior. </em>Our review of the facts and reasonable inferences therefrom alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment compels us to conclude that she has pled sufficient facts which, if proven, would create a jury issue whether Gerald was acting within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b254-8\">JUSTICE KOONTZ, with whom CHIEF JUSTICE CARRICO and JUSTICE COMPTON</author>\n<p id=\"Aga\">join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">In my view, the trial court correctly determined that the facts alleged and those impliedly alleged in Katrina Q. Plummer\u2019s motion for judgment are insufficient, as a matter of law, to support her legal conclusion that Dr. Roque Gerald, her psychologist, acted within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>scope of his employment with Center Psychiatrists, Ltd. when he \u201cseduced [her] into an act of sexual intercourse.\u201d Accordingly, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Plummer\u2019s allegations present a jury issue and that <em>Commercial Business Systems </em>v. <em>BellSouth, </em>249 Va. 39, 453 S.E.2d 261 (1995), is dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Surely it is undisputed that sexual intimacy between professional counselors and their clients is unethical, has no place in the therapy process, and is universally condemned. <em>See, e.g., </em>American Psychological Association, Standard 4.05 (1992) (\u201cPsychologists do not engage in sexual intimacies with current patients or clients\u201d). Although we have not previously addressed a case involving a sexual assault by a counselor in violation of these accepted standards to determine the liability of the counselor\u2019s employer under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>I agree with the majority that the critical issue becomes whether the employee was acting within the scope of his employment when he committed the tortious act.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Our cases have made it clear that the employer is not a surety for the conduct of the employee. Rather, we have said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201c[An employer] is not liable for every wrong which [an employee] may commit during the continuance of an employment. ... If the [employee] steps aside from his [employer\u2019s] business and is engaged in an independent venture of his own, the relation of [employer] and [employee] is for the time suspended. The test is whether the act complained of was done in the course of the [employee\u2019s] employment, or outside of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\"><em>Abernathy </em>v. <em>Romaczyk, </em>202 Va. 328, 332, 117 S.E.2d 88, 91 (1960) (quoting <em>McNeill v. Spindler, </em>191 Va. 685, 694-95, 62 S.E.2d 13, 18 (1950)).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In <em>Tri-State Coach Corp. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>188 Va. 299, 49 S.E.2d 363 (1948), we noted that: \u201cthe exact line of demarcation between what acts are within the scope of employment and what are not is, at times, difficult of ascertainment. The inferences to be drawn from the facts proved are often within the province of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308, 49 S.E.2d at 367. In <em>Kensington Associates </em>v. <em>West, </em>234 Va. 430, 362 S.E.2d 900 (1987), we further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">when the undisputed evidence shows that an employee\u2019s deviation from his employer\u2019s business is slight and not unusual, or, on the other hand, great and unusual, a court shall determine, as a matter of law, whether the employee was acting in the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of his employment. When, however, the evidence places the case between these two extremes, the issue is for a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 433, 362 S.E.2d at 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Assuming that all the allegations in Plummer\u2019s motion for judgment are true, they clearly establish that Dr. Gerald\u2019s \u201cseduction\u201d of Plummer was not an act intended by him to advance or maintain his employer\u2019s business. It is equally clear that in undertaking that seduction, Dr. Gerald must have stepped aside from the business of Center Psychiatrists, Ltd. and that he engaged in an independent venture of his own. Under such circumstances, and as we held in <em>Kensington Associates, </em>a jury issue was not presented and the trial court correctly determined that Dr. Gerald\u2019s act was a \u201cgreat and unusual\u201d deviation from his employer\u2019s business and, thus, not committed within the scope of his employment <em>as a matter of law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Our decision in <em>Commercial Business Systems </em>does not dictate a contrary conclusion. There the tortious act of the employee was committed while the employee was performing the duties of his employment and in the execution of the services for which he was employed. Thus, we held that the facts presented a jury issue whether he acted within the scope of his employment when he committed the wrongful acts. In the present case, the deviation from the employer\u2019s business is so extreme that no jury issue is implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">In short, while the limits of the scope of employment in a given case may be sufficiently broad to include various willful and malicious acts of the employee, a sexual assault upon a client by a professional counselor or psychologist falls well beyond that scope as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Finally, I am compelled to relate that the majority of our sister jurisdictions are in accord with the view I would take of this appeal. <em>See, e.g., P.S. and R.S. </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Coverage, Ltd., </em>887 S.W.2d 622, 625 (Mo. Ct. App. 1994) (adopting majority view and citing exemplar decisions, <em>Id. </em>at n.4); <em>Sharples v. State, </em>793 P.2d 175, 176-77 (Haw. 1990) <em>(respondeat superior </em>does not apply even though counselor maintained sexual intercourse \u201cwas part of his therapy,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176 n.1). <em>See generally </em>Russell G. Donaldson, Annotation, <em>Liability of Hospital or Clinic for Sexual Relationships with Patients by Staff Physicians, Psychologists, and Other Healers, </em>45 A.L.R.4th 289 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
