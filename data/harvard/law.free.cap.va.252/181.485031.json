Swann was injured when the automobile in which he was riding was involved in an accident with another vehicle driven by William L. Wild, a resident of Delaware. Wild died on January 18, 1991, from causes unrelated to the accident. Swann learned of Wild\u2019s death in July 1992, and on December 18, 1992, filed a motion for judgment against \u201cEstate of William L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Wild.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Almost two years later, on October 5, 1994, Steven L. Marks qualified as the personal representative of Wild\u2019s Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">On February 3, 1995, a number of events happened. <em>In an ex parte </em>proceeding, Swann was allowed to amend his pleading and substitute Steven L. Marks, personal representative of the estate of William L. Wild, for the named defendant \u201cEstate of William L. Wild.\u201d The trial court\u2019s order indicates that the substitution was \u201cto correct [a] misnomer\u201d and that it related back to the filing date of the original pleading pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-6. Following the entry of this order, Swann asked for and was granted a nonsuit. An hour later Swann refiled his motion for judgment naming \u201cSteven L. Marks, Esq., Personal Representative of the Estate of William L. Wild and as Administrator C.T.A. of This Estate\u201d as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Marks filed a special plea asserting that the refiled suit was barred by the statute of limitations. Following a hearing and further proceedings, the trial court granted Marks\u2019 plea and dismissed Swann\u2019s motion for judgment. We awarded Swann an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Swann argues that his action is not barred by the statute of limitations because the filing of the motion for judgment against the \u201cEstate of William L. Wild\u201d was timely and tolled the statute of limitations; that the substitution of Marks was the correction of a misnomer under Code \u00a7 8.01-6; that the nonsuit was properly granted; and that the nonsuit order was a final judgment precluding reconsideration of those issues in the refiled suit. Swann\u2019s arguments are grounded on the proposition that a motion for judgment against the \u201cestate\u201d of a deceased person is valid and tolls the statute of limitations. Because this premise is erroneous, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The statute of limitations period for Swann\u2019s personal injury action would have expired on March 29, 1992, two years after the accident. Code \u00a7 8.01-229(B)(2)(a) provides, however, that when a party against whom a personal action may be brought dies before the suit is commenced, the suit will be considered timely if it is filed \u201cwithin one year after the qualification\u201d of the decedent\u2019s personal representative. The provisions of \u00a7 8.01-229(B)(6) in effect at the times relevant here, provided that, if the personal representative qualified more than one year after the death, the personal representative was \u201cdeemed to have qualified on the last day\u201d of the one year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>period extending the limitations period. Applying these provisions to the facts of this case, Marks is deemed to have qualified as personal representative on January 18, 1992, and the limitations period was extended until January 18, 1993. Thus, Swann\u2019s motion for judgment pending on that date, the action against the \u201cEstate of William L. Wild,\u201d must qualify as a valid action to avoid the statute of limitations bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Marks contends that suit against an \u201cestate\u201d is a nullity and cannot toll the statute of limitations. We agree. To toll the statute of limitations, a suit must be filed against a proper party. Virginia statutes do not authorize an action against an \u201cestate.\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-229(B)(1) and (B)(2) direct the decedent\u2019s personal representative to file any personal action which the decedent may have been entitled to bring and to defend any personal action which could be brought against the decedent. This limitation is further highlighted by the language of the statute which allows <em>claims </em>to be filed against the property of tiie estate, but provides that <em>actions </em>may only be filed against the decedent\u2019s personal representative. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-229(B)(2) and (B)(4). This statutory scheme is consistent with the principle that \u201csuits and actions must be prosecuted by and against living parties.\u201d <em>Rennolds </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>147 Va. 196, 198, 136 S.E. 597, 597 (1927).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A motion for judgment against an \u201cestate\u201d is a nullity and cannot toll the statute of limitations. Furthermore, the substitution of a personal representative for the \u201cestate\u201d is not the correction of a misnomer. Misnomer arises when the right person is incorrectly named, not where the wrong defendant is named. <em>Rockwell </em>v. <em>Allman, </em>211 Va. 560, 561, 179 S.E.2d 471, 472 (1971). The personal representative of a decedent and the decedent\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d are two separate entities; the personal representative is a living individual while the \u201cestate\u201d is a collection of property. Thus, one cannot be substituted for another under the concept of correcting a misnomer.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Swann also contends that the trial court erred because the nonsuit order was a final order, and therefore the order allowing substitution was not subject to modification in the refiled action. To challenge the substitution order, Swann contends that Marks was required to appeal the nonsuit order. A nonsuit order, however, is ordinarily not considered a final judgment for purposes of appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>McManama </em>v. <em>Plunk, </em>250 Va. 27, 32, 458 S.E.2d 759, 761 (1995). A nonsuit order is a final, appealable order only when a dispute exists regarding the propriety of granting the nonsuit. <em>Id. </em>Here, there is no dispute as to the entry of the nonsuit order. The nonsuit order is not a final judgment as to the substitution order and did not clothe the substitution order with the force of <em>res judicata. </em>Thus, the trial court\u2019s consideration of Marks\u2019 special plea of the statute of limitations, including consideration of the substitution order, was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">For the reasons expressed, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-9\"> Swann had filed a motion for judgment on February 5, 1992, naming William L. Wild as the defendant No further action was taken on that motion for judgment, and it is not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\"> Swann erroneously cites <em>McManama </em>v. <em>Plunk, </em>250 Va. 27, 458 S.E.2d 759 (1995), for the proposition that a suit against a dead person is not a nullity. In that case, the plaintiff\u2019s suit was filed against a living person within the statute of limitations period. <em>Id. </em>at 29, 458 S.E.2d at 760.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
