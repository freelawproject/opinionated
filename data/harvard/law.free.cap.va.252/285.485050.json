Harrah, Deceased, filed this action against appellees James E. Washington, Jr., and Rite Cable Construction, Inc., seeking damages for the wrongful death of the plaintiff\u2019s decedent. The plaintiff alleged that on April 20, 1992 the decedent, his wife, was operating an automobile proceeding in an easterly direction ascending the western slope of Afton Mountain on Interstate 64 in Augusta County. The plaintiff further alleged that defendant Washington, an employee acting within the scope of his employment with the corporate defendant, was operating a truck that was stopped in the eastbound lane of 1-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The plaintiff further alleged that Washington\u2019s negligence at the time and place caused the decedent\u2019s death. In responsive pleadings, the defendants denied Washington was guilty of negligence and denied they owed the plaintiff any sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">In an August 1994 trial, a jury found in favor of the defendants. Overruling the plaintiff\u2019s post-verdict motions, the trial court entered judgment on the verdict. We awarded the plaintiff this appeal from the September 1995 final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Following established appellate procedure, we shall summarize the evidence, some of which was conflicting, in the light most favorable to the defendants, the prevailing parties below.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Interstate 64 crosses Afton Mountain in a generally east-west direction. There are two eastbound travel lanes, separated by a broken white line, with a \u201cbreakdown shoulder\u201d adjacent to the right lane. The accident in question occurred in an eastbound lane on a long, gradual, sweeping curve to the left near the top of the moun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>tain. A wide median, with grass and bushes, separates the eastbound and the westbound lanes.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Although the weather conditions were constantly changing on the slopes of Afton Mountain during the morning of the day in question, the evidence showed that visibility near the scene at the time of the 11:15 a.m. incident was greatly reduced by fog. An investigating police officer testified the \u201cweather was very foggy,\u201d saying he had not encountered worse fog in the area during the 17 years he had been assigned there.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Prior to the incident in question, a series of fog-related accidents had occurred in the westbound lanes of 1-64 on the western slope of the mountain. A Waynesboro volunteer rescue squad crew had been dispatched to render first aid there. A crew-member testified that as he was riding in the rescue vehicle, proceeding eastbound up the mountain on 1-64 in an effort to find die westbound \u201cwreck,\u201d \u201cthe only way we could see the wreck is if you looked out the driver\u2019s side. You couldn\u2019t see it coming head on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Eventually, the crew \u201cfound the front of the wreck.\u201d The rescue vehicle\u2019s driver stopped \u201cthe crash truck\u201d partly on the narrow left shoulder of the eastbound lanes. Part of die vehicle rested in the travel portion of the left eastbound lane that was 11 feet 3 inches wide.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The \u201ccrash truck\u201d was a heavy vehicle 30 feet long, 8 feet wide, and approximately \u201c11 foot tall.\u201d It was \u201cpredominantiy white with green stripes.\u201d Testimony showed that the lighting on the rear of the vehicle included six red emergency lights, three on each side, with \u201cfour of them going on and off and two of them being . . . like a strobe.\u201d A photograph received in evidence of the rear of the vehicle appears to show ten red lights (five on each side) as well as two large strobe lights near the top (one on each side) and two smaller white lights near the bottom (one on each side).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Approximately ten minutes before the accident sued upon, State Trooper Frank Pyanoe, rushing from Staunton to the scene of the westbound accidents, travelled eastbound on 1-64 until he \u201ccame upon\u201d the stopped crash truck. He said it \u201cextended out to the travel area\u201d of the left eastbound lane. He noticed \u201ca major accident over on the westbound side.\u201d The officer stopped his police vehicle behind the rescue squad truck because \u201cthere were no emergency lights flashing at the time\u201d on the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">During a conversation between the trooper and a rescue squad member over \u201csome type of electronic . . . difficulty with the vehi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>cle,\u201d the trooper advised the member that \u201che either had to turn the lights on or move to a safer spot, preferably over to the right side of the interstate.\u201d Immediately, the lights were activated.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The trooper, driving a 1988 Ford Crown Victoria police cruiser, then proceeded \u201centirely in the eastbound lanes on the left-hand side\u201d around the crash truck to go to the westbound accident scene. At this time, \u201cthe accident had not begun in the eastbound lane.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Defendant Washington, age 38 and a Louisa County resident, left the corporate defendant\u2019s Charlottesville office near 8:00 a.m. on the day in question to travel to Staunton to pick up two rolls of cable. The defendant drove his employer\u2019s white Dodge Ram truck that had been modified with a \u201cwork cab\u201d for storing tools. He was towing a red two-wheel trailer that was ten feet long and about seven feet wide.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Washington testified that, as he crossed Afton Mountain travel-ling westbound on 1-64 en route to Staunton, it was raining and there was \u201cvery dense fog on the mountain itself. It was bad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">After loading the cable on the trailer in Staunton, Washington proceeded to return to Charlottesville, travelling eastbound on 1-64. Washington testified that when he reached the foot of the mountain on the west near 11:00 a.m., the weather was not \u201cbad\u201d although, he said, \u201cI knew it was bad on the mountain because I just came across it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Proceeding up the mountain, defendant had the vehicle\u2019s lights \u201con.\u201d As he \u201cwent up, it got foggier,\u201d so he turned his \u201cflashers on.\u201d Driving in the right eastbound lane at a speed of 30-35 miles per hour, he \u201cgot behind a tractor-trailer.\u201d He said that because the \u201cweather was real bad and [he] couldn\u2019t see very far,\u201d he decided to pass the truck in order \u201cto see better\u201d and to know where he was \u201cheaded.\u201d He testified that he activated his left-turn signal, looked into his left side mirror, and, seeing no vehicle to his left, \u201cproceeded to the left-hand lane.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">When Washington reached the left lane, he saw flashing lights about 50 yards ahead in the left lane. Washington said, \u201cit looked as if there were two ambulances up there.\u201d He slowed his vehicle and stopped in the left lane because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t go any further at that time\u201d due to \u201ctraffic in the right-hand lane.\u201d Then Washington \u201clooked in the mirror\u201d and saw a white automobile \u201con the left-hand side of the road off onto the median.\u201d This was a 1990 Honda Accord operated by the witness Deborah F. Branstetter.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Branstetter had been travelling eastbound in the left lane of 1-64. She described the weather conditions at the time as cool and \u201cvery overcast.\u201d The pavement was dry and there was \u201cfog on the mountain.\u201d She said the density of the fog would change; visibility improved and \u201cthen it would become very thick suddenly.\u201d As she ascended the mountain, Branstetter gradually reduced her speed from 65 to 35 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The witness observed defendant\u2019s vehicle ahead in the right lane. As she was in the process of overtaking it, and when her vehicle was \u201ceven\u201d with defendant\u2019s trailer, she could see lights burning on the rear of defendant\u2019s truck. At that point, Washington \u201csimply changed lanes.\u201d She said that \u201che did not give a signal.\u201d A state trooper testified that a vehicle\u2019s \u201cturn signals are cancelled out\u201d when four-way emergency \u201cflashers\u201d are activated.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">According to Branstetter, there was no contact between the vehicles because she swerved \u201cout of the way of the trailer into the median strip.\u201d She stopped her vehicle with all four wheels in the grassy median.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Alighting from his stopped truck, Washington ran back to the Honda and asked the operator \u201cwhat had happened.\u201d She responded, \u201cYou ran me off the road.\u201d After determining that she was \u201call right,\u201d Washington ran back to his vehicle and moved it forward in the left lane \u201ca very short distance. A few feet at the most.\u201d Washington testified that he desired to move to the right lane but could not because of traffic there and that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t go further up because of the crash truck that was in front of me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\u201cShortly\u201d after he moved his truck forward, Washington looked \u201cinto the mirror\u201d and saw a \u201cgray Cadillac coming,\u201d which struck his trailer and truck from the rear. This vehicle was operated by the witness David L. Gooden, who was travelling eastbound on 1-64 in the left lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Gooden said that as he ascended the western slope of the mountain, the weather conditions changed as he left the bottom of the mountain; the fog \u201cgot thicker at the top.\u201d He testified there \u201cwere spots that you couldn\u2019t hardly see at all and spots I could see probably 20 yards.\u201d As Gooden came out of \u201ca real dense area of fog,\u201d he observed defendant\u2019s \u201cpickup with a trailer\u201d stopped 20-25 yards ahead in the left lane. Gooden \u201chit\u201d his brakes but, travelling at a speed of 45 miles per hour, struck defendant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">After being struck by the Gooden vehicle, Washington \u201cgot out\u201d of his truck to assist a passenger in the Gooden vehicle who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>having difficulty extricating herself from the automobile. At this moment, another automobile crashed into the Gooden vehicle. This was a 1989 yellow Cadillac Seville operated by the plaintiff\u2019s decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The collision of the decedent\u2019s vehicle with the Gooden vehicle caused the Gooden passenger and a rescue squad member to be pinned under the Gooden vehicle. Washington, rescue squad personnel, and bystanders joined in lifting the gray Cadillac, freeing the trapped persons. Shortly thereafter a white truck \u201ccame through\u201d and collided with the decedent\u2019s vehicle. This truck was a Ford Ranger pickup operated by the witness Paul W. Burch.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">As Burch proceeded eastbound on 1-64, the weather \u201cwas pretty sunny at the bottom and increasingly cloudy going up the mountain.\u201d According to Burch, \u201cit was very foggy\u201d at \u201cthe top of the mountain\u201d until \u201cthere was no visibility whatsoever.\u201d Travelling at a speed of 25 to 35 miles per hour in the left lane, Burch applied brakes when \u201cthe visibility was reduced to almost nothing,\u201d and struck the decedent\u2019s vehicle without seeing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Riding in the vehicle operated by the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, age 43, were the Harrahs\u2019 two children and their paternal grandmother. The grandmother was seated in the front passenger seat as they drove in the left, eastbound lane ascending the mountain. She testified the decedent was driving about 30 miles per hour with the headlights burning \u201cbecause of the fog.\u201d At the time of impact with the Gooden vehicle, the grandmother\u2019s attention was directed to the children riding in the back seat. She described the impact as \u201clight because it did not knock any of us out of our seat belts.\u201d Following the impact, the decedent said, \u201cWhat have we hit\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">After the collision, the decedent and the grandmother became involved in assisting the children from the vehicle, which was on the roadway, to the grassy median. Shortly thereafter, as Burch\u2019s truck struck die decedent\u2019s vehicle, a rescue worker \u201csaw what appeared to be a body fly through the air.\u201d This was the decedent, who was seriously injured and found \u201cdraped across\u201d the red trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, the court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the defendants\u2019 evidence on the issue of liability. Then, the court gave the jury a profusion of 31 instructions. Among the issues covered in the jury charge were Washington\u2019s primary negligence, the decedent\u2019s contributory negligence, proximate cause, superseding and intervening cause, concurrent negligence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>unavoidable accident, sudden emergency, and duties of drivers of vehicles stopping on highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff first argues the trial court \u201cerred by not ruling, as a matter of law, that defendant Washington was negligent when he failed to keep a proper lookout and failed to give a visible signal before changing lanes and pulling directly into the path of an oncoming vehicle.\u201d Focusing solely on defendant\u2019s alleged involvement with Branstetter, the plaintiff contends the evidence establishes that Branstetter was driving her Honda in the left lane when Washington suddenly turned into her lane to pass a tractor-trailer, and forced her vehicle off the highway. Continuing, plaintiff says that either Branstetter was in plain view and Washington failed to see her, or it was so foggy that Washington could not see if the left lane was clear to make a lane change. Under either set of circumstances, the plaintiff argues, Washington breached his duty to maintain a reasonable lookout when he changed lanes.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Furthermore, the plaintiff argues, Washington violated Code \u00a7 46.2-848, which requires every driver who intends to turn from a direct line to give a plainly visible signal of such intention whenever the operation of any other vehicle may be affected by such movement. Recalling the testimony to the effect \u201cthat flashing hazard lights cancel any attempted turn signal,\u201d the plaintiff says it is \u201cuncontradicted that no such signal was given by Washington.\u201d Plaintiff contends the fact that \u201cWashington may have pressed down on his turn signal lever is no defense to his failure to give a plainly visible signal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">We do not agree with plaintiff\u2019s argument. We are of opinion that the question whether Washington\u2019s negligence, if any, was a proximate cause of the collision resulting in decedent\u2019s death was, at the very least, a question for the jury. We say, \u201cat the very least,\u201d because we do not have the question whether, as a matter of law, Washington\u2019s negligence, if any, in changing lanes was <em>not </em>a proximate cause of decedent\u2019s death. Thus, given the issues on appeal, we shall go no further than to rule on the question presented by the plaintiff relating to Washington\u2019s duties owed to the decedent vis-avis the Branstetter incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The evidence establishes that Washington initially stopped, not because of any interaction with Branstetter, but due to the crash truck\u2019s position ahead. It was for the jury to determine whether Washington reasonably believed the truck was blocking his passage through the left lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Other testimony confirmed Washington\u2019s belief that the crash truck blocked his way. For example, the investigating state trooper testified \u201cthree to four feet\u201d of the truck was \u201cin the travel portion of the left-hand lane of 64.\u201d Another witness testified he recalled \u201ca substantial portion of the crash truck being in the left-hand lane.\u201d Yet another witness testified the crash truck \u201cwas predominantly in the left-hand lane of travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Likewise, it was for the jury to say whether Washington reasonably believed that \u201cbumper-to-bumper traffic\u201d proceeding in the right lane prevented him from moving into that lane and around the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Therefore, the trial court did not err in submitting to the jury questions relating to Washington\u2019s conduct as it affected Branstetter and the ultimate role that conduct played in the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Second, the plaintiff argues the trial court erred by giving an una- . voidable accident instruction. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In a mere abstract statement of law, the trial court charged the jury: \u201cAn unavoidable accident or incident is one which ordinary care and diligence could not have prevented or one which occurred in the absence of negligence by any party to this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The defendants seek to justify tihe granting of the instruction by arguing, in part, that inclusion of the phrase \u201cby any party to this action\u201d has significance here. They say that despite all the vehicles involved, \u201cthe extreme weather conditions and the crash truck blocking the left travel lane, plaintiff chose only to sue Mr. Washington and his employer in this action, and to file a separate action against the rescue squad which is currently pending in Augusta County.\u201d The defendants contend that \u201cWashington was entitled to defend on the basis that this accident was unavoidable from his standpoint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">As we understand the defendants\u2019 argument, they contend that if there are nonparties who are negligent in connection with a motor vehicle accident, then a party defendant may invoke the unavoidable accident doctrine to establish such defendant\u2019s freedom from fault. We disagree. The fact that all potentially liable parties are not joined in this action does not remove the case from the application of our decisions disapproving use of an unavoidable accident instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">New motor vehicle collisions occur without fault. For this reason, we have emphasized that an unavoidable accident instruction is rarely appropriate in motor vehicle accident cases, although we have not abolished the doctrine or limited it to cases involving accidents resulting from unknown causes. <em>Chodorov </em>v. <em>Eley, </em>239 Va. 528, 531, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>391 S.E.2d 68, 70 (1990). Such an instruction has the tendency to afford a jury \u201can easy way of avoiding instead of deciding the issue made by the evidence in the case.\u201d <em>Mawyer </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>199 Va. 897, 901, 103 S.E.2d 217, 220 (1958). <em>Accord Gardner </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>250 Va. 256, 261, 462 S.E.2d 91, 94 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In the present case, the decedent\u2019s death resulted from the negligence of one or more of the several vehicle operators who were involved in this bizarre series of events. Thus, the trial court committed reversible error by instructing on unavoidable accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Because the case must be remanded, we shall discuss the other issues raised by the plaintiff, for they may arise upon a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Third, the plaintiff contends the trial court erred by giving an instruction on the sudden emergency doctrine. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The trial court charged the jurors that if they believed from the evidence that Washington, \u201cwithout negligence on his part, was confronted with a sudden emergency and acted as a reasonable person would have acted under the circumstances of this case, he was not negligent.\u201d Further, the instruction provided: \u201cA sudden emergency is an event or a combination of circumstances that calls for immediate action without giving time for the deliberate exercise of judgment.\u201d Although the instruction correctly sets forth the sudden emergency doctrine, <em>see Carolina Coach Company </em>v. <em>Starchia, </em>219 Va. 135, 141, 244 S.E.2d 788, 792 (1978), Washington is not entitled to its benefit under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">For the doctrine to apply, the condition confronting the operator must be an \u201cunexpected happening.\u201d <em>Gardner, </em>250 Va. at 260, 462 S.E.2d at 94. In other words, where a set of circumstances has existed and the party has been exposed to them before, the situation is not \u201cunexpected.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">In the present case, Washington was thoroughly familiar with the weather conditions on the mountain at the time, based on both his experience earlier in the morning and his observations as he ascended the mountain just before he stopped his vehicle. Given those conditions, Washington knew, or should have known, that a vehicle might be stopped ahead in his lane of travel. Such an occurrence was foreseeable and not unexpected. <em>See Chodorov, 239 </em>Va. at 531, 391 S.E.2d at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Moreover, Washington was not confronted with a sudden emergency after he reentered his truck and moved it forward a few feet. Then, he had time for the deliberate exercise of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Finally, the plaintiff contends the trial court\u2019s instruction relating to the duties of an operator who stops his vehicle on a highway was incomplete and thus erroneous. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Code \u00a7 46.2-888 prohibits a person from stopping a vehicle in such a manner as to impede or render dangerous the use of a highway, \u201cexcept in the case of an emergency, an accident, or a mechanical breakdown.\u201d The statute further provides that in the event of such emergency, accident, or breakdown, the stopped vehicle \u201cshall be moved from the roadway to the shoulder as soon as possible and removed from the shoulder without unnecessary delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The trial court charged the jury: \u201cThe driver of a vehicle has a duty not to stop his vehicle so as to interfere with traffic on the highway or so as to make the highway dangerous to others who are using it, unless there was an emergency or an accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Arguing the instruction was incomplete, the plaintiff correctly says the trial court should have instructed the jury on \u201cWashington\u2019s additional duty to move his vehicle off the roadway as soon as possible, even though it was properly stopped for an emergency.\u201d The instruction was misleading because it ignored Washington\u2019s statutory duty to take further action after he stopped. <em>See Armstrong </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>170 Va. 190, 202, 196 S.E. 613, 617 (1938). Parenthetically, we observe that our ruling applying the \u201cemergency\u201d provision of this statute, is not inconsistent with our previously expressed view that the sudden emergency doctrine does not apply to Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Consequently, although the trial court correctly decided the first issue, the judgment below will be reversed and vacated because of the court\u2019s misdirection of the jury, and the case will be remanded for a new trial on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
