Based on the terms of a five-year commercial lease, the landlord sought possession of the demised premises located in Sterling, Virginia, and sought recovery of rent delinquent for a three-month period before the tenant vacated the premises, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The tenant was served personally with the summons for unlawful detainer and failed to appear in the proceeding either in person or by counsel. On the return date, the landlord presented testimonial evidence and exhibits in the tenant\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court entered judgment in favor of the landlord against the tenant for possession of the premises, and for rent due of $7,257.60 with interest, attorney\u2019s fees of $856.60, and costs of $18.00. The judgment was not appealed and became final. The tenant satisfied the judgment eight months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">In July 1994, the landlord filed the present action by motion for judgment against the tenant in the circuit court below for breach of the lease, seeking recovery of rent that had accrued after the default judgment, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs. The tenant appeared and denied the landlord was entitled to any further recovery under the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Following a bench trial, the circuit court applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel and ruled that the issue of the tenant\u2019s liability under the lease previously had been determined in the related district court proceeding. Consequently, the circuit court entered judgment in April 1995 in favor of the landlord against the tenant for rent plus interest, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Subsequently, the circuit court granted the tenant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, vacated the April order, reversed its prior decision, and entered a June 1995 order in favor of the tenant dismissing the motion for judgment. The court refused to apply collateral estoppel, ruling that \u201ca default judgment does not actually litigate issues for the purposes of collateral estoppel.\u201d The landlord appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">Virginia law on collateral estoppel is clear. The doctrine \u201cprecludes parties to a prior action and their privies from litigating in a subsequent action any factual issue that actually was litigated and was essential to a valid, final judgment in the prior action.\u201d <em>Angstadt </em>v. <em>Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co., </em>249 Va. 444, 446, 457 S.E.2d 86, 87 (1995); <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Devers, </em>214 Va. 667, 671, 202 S.E.2d 917, 921 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">For the doctrine to apply, the parties to the two proceedings, or their privies, must be the same; the factual issue sought to be litigated actually must have been litigated in the prior action and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>must have been essential to the prior judgment; and the prior action must have resulted in a valid, final judgment against the party sought to be precluded in the present action. <em>Glasco </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>249 Va. 61, 64, 452 S.E.2d 854, 855 (1995). Additionally, collateral estoppel in Virginia requires mutuality, that is, a party is generally prevented from invoking the preclusive force of a judgment unless that party would have been bound had the prior litigation of the issue reached the opposite result. <em>Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. </em>v. <em>Bailey Lumber Co., </em>221 Va. 638, 640, 272 S.E.2d 217, 218 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">In the present case, the tenant contends that a default judgment cannot be the basis for application of collateral estoppel in Virginia. Relying on the Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a727 cmt. e. (1982), and federal decisions, including <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ringley, </em>750 F. Supp. 750 (W.D. Va. 1990), <em>aff'd, </em>985 F.2d 185 (4th Cir. 1993), the tenant argues that \u201can issue must have been the subject of actual litigation for collateral estoppel to apply.\u201d According to the tenant, nothing is actually litigated in a default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The <em>Ringley </em>court, in a suit by the government to recover federal reclamation fees under a mining control and reclamation statute, refused to apply collateral estoppel when a default judgment had been rendered in a prior action. Citing the foregoing Restatement comment, the court said: \u201cA default judgment cannot be used for collateral estoppel purposes, because no issues are \u2018actually litigated.\u2019 \u201d 750 F. Supp. at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">We do not agree with the tenant\u2019s contention, nor do we agree with the view typified by the Restatement comment (in \u201cthe case of a judgment entered by . . . default, none of the issues is actually litigated\u201d). Virginia law does not support a blanket exemption from the application of collateral estoppel in the case of a default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Here, there is no dispute that most of the requirements for application of the doctrine have been established. The parties in the two actions are the same. The district court action resulted in a valid, final judgment against the tenant. <em>See Petrus </em>v. <em>Robbins, 196 </em>Va. 322, 329, 83 S.E.2d 408, 412 (1954) (estoppel may be successfully invoked upon final judgment of court not of record). And, mutuality exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The disputed questions are whether the tenant\u2019s personal liability was actually litigated in the district court proceeding and whether that factual issue was essential to the judgment in the prior proceeding. We answer both queries in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>First, the tenant\u2019s personal liability for rent and other charges, including attorney\u2019s fees, under the lease actually was litigated in the prior action. Testimonial and documentary evidence was presented ex parte in the district court hearing. The circuit court record established that proof was presented in the district court through a bookkeeper for the landlord and through the landlord\u2019s attorney, who presented the lease and other documents including an affidavit supporting the attorney\u2019s fees claimed. We disagree with the tenant\u2019s argument that before an issue may be \u201cactually litigated\u201d in a court proceeding, the defendant must personally appear at the hearing and contest the matter. Indeed, this Court has said that a final default judgment \u201cimports absolute verity, and is as effectual and binding as if pronounced upon a trial upon the merits.\u201d <em>Neale </em>v. <em>Utz, </em>75 Va. 480, 488 (1881).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Second, the tenant\u2019s personal liability was essential to the district court judgment. That court could have merely awarded the landlord possession of the premises without imposing personal liability for rent and fees, but it did not. Thus, the factual issue existing in the present proceeding, the tenant\u2019s liability for rent and fees, was a necessary part of the judgment in the prior proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Finally, we reject die tenant\u2019s contention that <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>248 Va. 304, 448 S.E.2d 629 (1994), established a blanket exemption in Virginia from application of collateral estoppel in the case of a default judgment. There, vehicles operated by Morrison and Horton collided. Horton\u2019s minor son, Travis Lee Shaver, was a passenger in his mother\u2019s vehicle. Both Horton and Shaver were injured, and each sued Morrison for damages, alleging Morrison negligently operated her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In response to Shaver\u2019s action, Morrison filed a third-party motion for judgment against Horton, alleging that Horton negligently operated her vehicle and that she was liable to Morrison for all or part of any sum recovered by Shaver. Horton failed to respond to the third-party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Subsequently, the trial court sustained Morrison\u2019s motion for a default judgment against Horton. On the same day, the court entered an order dismissing Shaver\u2019s action with prejudice because, according to the appellate record on file in the clerk\u2019s office of this Court, Shaver failed to comply with discovery orders. Later, the trial court sustained Morrison\u2019s motion to dismiss Horton\u2019s action, concluding that Horton\u2019s action had been adjudicated when judgment was granted Morrison against Horton in the third-party action.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Reversing the trial court, we held that Horton\u2019s action was not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. We noted the requirement that an issue must be the subject of actual litigation for collateral estoppel to apply. <em>Id. </em>at 306, 448 S.E.2d at 631. We did not create a blanket exemption, but merely said that no issues relating to Horton\u2019s negligence were actually litigated when the court entered a default judgment in the third-party action against Horton. Because Shaver\u2019s action against Morrison was dismissed with prejudice, Morrison could no longer be liable to Shaver. Thus, Morrison\u2019s inchoate claim for contribution based upon Horton\u2019s alleged negligence became moot. <em>See Snead </em>v. <em>Bendigo, </em>240 Va. 399, 401, 397 S.E.2d 849, 850 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Consequently, we hold that the circuit court erred in refusing to apply collateral estoppel in favor of the landlord under these circumstances, and the judgment below will be reversed. We will reinstate the April 1995 judgment, and will enter final judgment here in favor of the landlord against the tenant for rent of $29,306, plus interest at the rate of nine per cent per annum from April 25, 1995, attorney\u2019s fees of $11,000, and costs of $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
