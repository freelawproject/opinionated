Section 18.2-268.3, referred to in \u00a7 46.2-391.2, prescribes the procedures to be followed if a person, after having been arrested for driving under the influence, refuses to permit blood or breath samples to be taken for chemical tests to determine the alcohol or drug content of his blood. Section 18.2-268.4 provides that if a person is found guilty of violating \u00a7 18.2-268.3, the court shall suspend his privilege to drive for a period of one year, in addition to the administrative suspension imposed under \u00a7 46.2-391.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The record shows that on February 16, 1995, the defendant, Joseph M. Simmons, upon his refusal to submit to a blood or breath test, was served with a notice of administrative suspension pursuant to \u00a7 46.2-391.2, and his license was \u201ctaken\u201d for a period of seven days. He was also charged in a warrant with refusing to permit the taking of a breath sample to determine the alcohol content of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>blood. In general district court, the defendant was found guilty as charged in the warrant, and his operator\u2019s license was suspended for a period of one year. On a de novo appeal to circuit court, he was again found guilty, and his license was again suspended for a period of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Citing <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>164 Va. 245, 252, 178 S.E. 884, 886 (1935), the defendant correctly points out that for <em>res judicata </em>to bar the prosecution of a second action, the judgment in the former action must have been rendered on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction and the parties and the matters in controversy must be the same in the two actions. The defendant also correctly points out that the plea of <em>res judicata </em>and the plea of collateral estoppel, while not identical, \u201care based upon similar principles of law, namely the conclusiveness of judgments of the Court, and the effect of a judgment as estoppel.\u201d The difference between the two pleas, the defendant notes, lies in what is concluded by the first judgment. Under <em>res judicata, </em>the first judgment bars the parties and their privies not only from relitigating the issues actually determined but \u00bfso from litigating those that might have been determined; under collateral estoppel, only those issues actually litigated and determined are concluded. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Devers, </em>214 Va. 667, 670-71, 202 S.E.2d 917, 920-21 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Here, the defendant argues that \u201cthe issue is the same, namely that the defendant refused to take the breath or blood test.\u201d That issue, the defendant opines, \u201chas already been decided by a Court of competent jurisdiction\u201d in the form of the administrative suspension of his license for seven days. Therefore, the defendant concludes, the administrative suspension \u201cis <em>res judicata </em>and estoppel and the Commonwealth should be estopped from taking a person\u2019s Operator\u2019s License for twelve months for refusing to take a breath or blood test after having taken the Operator\u2019s License administratively for seven days for the same act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The difficulty with the defendant\u2019s argument is that by his own statement of the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel, the establishment of a prior judgment rendered by a com\u00ed of competent jurisdiction is a condition precedent to the allowance of any plea in bar asserting either doctrine. Yet, by no stretch of the imagination can it be said that an administrative suspension of an operator\u2019s license for failure to take a blood or breath test is a judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction. What is involved is neither more nor less than the term administrative suspension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>implies, an administrative act, not a judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Accordingly, we hold that the suspension by the trial court of the defendant\u2019s operator\u2019s license for one year was not barred by the earlier administrative suspension of the license for seven days, and we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-12\"> The defendant in this case uses the term \u201cestoppel by judgment\u201d; however, we prefer the term \u201ccollateral estoppel.\u201d <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Devers, </em>214 Va. 667, 671 n.5, 202 S.E.2d 917, 921 n.5 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b135-13\"><em> </em>Because a charge of unreasonably refusing to submit to a blood or breath test is not criminal but administrative and civil in nature, an appeal lies directly from the trial court to this Court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rafferty, </em>241 Va. 319, 323-24, 402 S.E.2d 17, 20 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
