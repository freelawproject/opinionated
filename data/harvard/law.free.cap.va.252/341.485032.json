In 1988, Brar Associates-McLean Limited Partnership began the development of the Mayfair of McLean project, a luxury townhouse community. During 1991 and 1992, Balbir S. Brar, president of Balbir Brar Associates, Inc., a Virginia corporation, sought investors to complete the project. In January 1992, Loran M. Adams, president of Atwood Development Corporation, a construction management firm, introduced Balbir Brar to Benjamin Kopf, HI, president of Consolidated Trading and Services Corporation (Consolidated). Consolidated is engaged in the business of real estate investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\">Subsequently, Balbir Brar Associates, Inc. (Brar Associates), Consolidated, and Adams executed an agreement to create a joint venture to complete the project. The joint venture agreement required Consolidated to purchase the project from Brar Associates-McLean Limited Partnership for $5,200,000. The joint venturers retained Brar Associates as the project construction contractor for a fee of $10,000 per month, to be paid by Consolidated. The joint venturers also agreed that Consolidated would receive a return on its investment based upon a figure, described as the internal rate of return, and that if the internal rate of return became less than 20%, Consolidated would be entitled to terminate the joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">In November 1994, Consolidated and Atwood filed a complaint in a federal district court in Virginia against Brar Associates and others. Consolidated alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Brar Associates had violated the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 <em>et seq., </em>which creates civil remedies for the false representation of the origin of goods in commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Brar Associates did not file a counterclaim in the federal action. The federal district court granted Brar Associates\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Brar Associates initiated this proceeding by filing its bill of complaint against Consolidated, Adams, and Atwood. Brar Associates alleged that these defendants \u201ctampered with and artificially reduced\u201d the internal rate of return to 18.5% and \u201cunlawfully terminated the joint venture agreement.\u201d Brar Associates sought specific performance of the joint venture agreement, the appointment of a receiver, and an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Consolidated asserted in the trial court that Brar Associates\u2019 claims are barred because it failed to file a compulsory counterclaim in the federal district court proceeding as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>13(a). The trial court agreed and entered a final order dismissing Brar Associates\u2019 claims against Consolidated. We awarded Brar Associates an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Brar Associates argues that Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(a) does not bar it from pursuing its claims in a state proceeding. Brar Associates asserts that the federal district court litigation involved the Lanham Act, which did not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as Brar Associates\u2019 state law causes of action. In response, Consolidated asserts that its Lanham Act claim, as well as Brar Associates\u2019 state law claims, arose out of the same transaction and occurrence and, therefore, Brar Associates was required to raise its claims as a compulsory counterclaim and, having failed to do so, is forever barred from asserting such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Rule 13(a) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">\u201c(a) Compulsory Counterclaims. A pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Initially, we observe that a litigant who fails to file a compulsory counterclaim as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(a) is thereafter barred from asserting that claim. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Gold Seal Liquors, </em>417 U.S. 467, 469 n.1 (1974); <em>Mesker Bros. Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Donata Corp., </em>401 F.2d 275, 279 (4th Cir. 1968). When determining whether a claim must be asserted as a compulsory counterclaim, we look to the original court\u2019s construction of its compulsory counterclaim rule. <em>Nottingham </em>v. <em>Weld, </em>237 Va. 416, 420, 377 S.E.2d 621, 623 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit utilizes the following four-part test to determine whether a counterclaim is compulsory under Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">\u201c[T]his circuit suggested four inquiries to determine if a counterclaim is compulsory: (1) Are the issues of fact and law raised in the claim and counterclaim largely the same? (2) Would <em>res judicata </em>bar a subsequent suit on the party\u2019s counterclaim, absent the compulsory counterclaim rule? (3) Will substantially the same evidence support or refute the claim as well as the counterclaim? and (4) Is there any logical relationship between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the claim and counterclaim? .... A court need not answer all these questions in the affirmative for the counterclaim to be compulsory. . . . Rather, the tests are less a litmus, more a guideline.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><em>Painter </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>863 F.2d 329, 331 (4th Cir. 1988). The Court of Appeals pointed out that when making these inquiries, \u201cthere is an underlying thread to each [factor]: evidentiary similarity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">\u201c[w]here ... the same evidence will support or refute both the claim and counterclaim, the counterclaim will almost always be compulsory. The .\u2018same evidence\u2019 test thus accomplishes the purposes of Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(a), because the \u2018very purpose of making certain types of counterclaims compulsory is to prevent the relitigation of the same set of facts.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 332. <em>Accord Sue &amp; Sam Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>B-L-S Constr. Co., </em>538 F.2d 1048 (4th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The first element of the four-part test that we consider is whether the issues of fact and law raised in Consolidated\u2019s Lanham Act claim and the claims asserted in Brar Associates\u2019 bill of complaint are \u201clargely the same.\u201d The Lanham Act \u201cwas intended to make \u2018actionable the deceptive and misleading use of [trade]marks\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018to protect persons engaged in ... commerce against unfair competition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Two Pesos, Inc. </em>v. <em>Taco Cabana, Inc., </em>505 U.S. 763, 768 (1992). Consolidated alleged in its Lanham Act claim that Balbir Brar and Brar Associates \u201cfalsely represented that they rather than [Consolidated] owned Mayfair of McLean.\u201d As we have already mentioned, however, Brar Associates alleged in its bill of complaint that Consolidated manipulated certain financial information to create an internal rate of return below 20%, thus, permitting Consolidated to terminate the joint venture and escape its obligations under the joint venture agreement. Brar Associates sought the appointment of a receiver for the joint venture to \u201ctake charge\u201d of the joint venture\u2019s operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Brar Associates also sought an accounting because it believed that certain profits and losses had been \u201cmisapplied and fraudulently utilized to drive the \u2018Internal Rate of Return\u2019 of the joint venture below Twenty Percent (20%) and [had] increased] budget costs, thereby triggering the termination mechanisms established by the Joint Venture.\u201d Thus, the issues of fact and law raised in Brar Asso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>dates\u2019 bill of complaint are not \u201clargely the same\u201d issues as those raised in Consolidated\u2019s Lanham Act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Applying the second part of the test, we are of opinion that <em>res judicata </em>would not bar a subsequent suit on Brar Associates\u2019 state law claims, absent the compulsory counterclaim rule. We have held that four elements must be present before <em>res judicata </em>may be asserted to bar a subsequent proceeding: \u201c(1) identity of the remedies sought; (2) identity of the cause of action; (3) identity of the parties; and (4) identity of the quality of the persons for or against whom the claim is made.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>244 Va. 374, 376, 421 S.E.2d 444, 445 (1992) (quoting <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Castles, </em>232 Va. 218, 222, 349 S.E.2d 125, 128 (1986)). Here, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>would not have barred a subsequent proceeding because there was neither an identity of remedies sought nor an identity of the causes of action between Consolidated\u2019s Lanham Act claim and Brar Associates\u2019 state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We now consider the third element of the test; will substantially the same evidence support or refute Consolidated\u2019s Lanham Act claim as well as Brar Associates\u2019 claims? We answer this inquiry in the negative. Even a cursory examination of the litigants\u2019 claims asserted in the federal and state proceedings reveals that the evidence that Brar Associates must present to substantiate its claims would be substantially different from any evidence on the issue whether Brar Associates misrepresented the ownership of the Mayfair project.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Finally, we are of opinion that there is no logical relationship between Consolidated\u2019s Lanham Act claim and Brar Associates\u2019 claims. Brar Associates\u2019 bill of complaint alleges certain causes of action arising out of the performance of the joint venture agreement, and those claims are separate and distinct from Consolidated\u2019s purported Lanham Act claim. Furthermore, as our application of each of the elements of the four-part test established in <em>Painter </em>illustrates, there is simply no \u201cunderlying thread of evidentiary similarity\u201d between the litigants\u2019 federal and state claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In view of the foregoing, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">\n<em>Reversed and. remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
