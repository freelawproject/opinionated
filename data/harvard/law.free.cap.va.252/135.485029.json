As originally platted, the subdivision consisted of 13 sites, labelled \u201cA\u201d through \u201cM.\u201d Initially, the 13 sites were conveyed as twelve lots and sold to 11 landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">In 1982, appellees Henry C. Morgan, Jr., and Mamie J. Morgan, his wife, defendants below, purchased Lot K and the existing residence, known as 420 52nd Street. This lot, as well as the others in the subdivision, had been originally conveyed by the Masury Corporation subject to nine restrictive covenants. After the initial sales, the subsequent deeds contained the usual language making the conveyances subject to all the unexpired conditions, restrictions, easements, and reservations of record affecting the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">The restriction at issue in this dispute is No. 5, which provides: \u201cThat not more than one residence exclusive of outbuildings shall be erected upon one lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>In 1989, the defendants resubdivided Lot K, creating two lots designated \u201cK-l\u201d and \u201cK-2.\u201d Lot K-l, upon which the residence is situated, encompasses approximately 0.45 acre. Lot K-2 contains approximately 0.116 acre and is currently vacant. The defendants propose to construct a residence upon Lot K-2; this spawned the present lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">In January 1995, appellants Adin K. Woodward, Lucille Woodward, Everett W. Foote, Laura Foote, Charlotte Y. Dashiell, Richard L. Walthall, and Juliette Walthall, plaintiffs below, filed a bill of complaint against the defendants. The plaintiffs, owners of property in the subdivision, contended that the language of the Ubermeer Annex No. 1 deeds is clear and unambiguous: a lot was conveyed, and only one residence was to be constructed upon it even though the original lot was resubdivided. Asserting they are parties intended to be benefitted by the deed restriction, the plaintiffs asked the court to rule that the restriction will be violated by the construction of a dwelling on Lot K-2 and asked the court to enjoin the construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Responding to the bill of complaint, the defendants contended that the word \u201clot\u201d has no relation to the originally platted sites or to the originally conveyed lots, and therefore the restriction permits construction of as many residences as there are legally created lots in the subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Following a June 1995 ore tenus hearing, at which the chancellor considered testimonial and documentary evidence, the court ruled in favor of the defendants. In an oral opinion, the chancellor stated, and counsel for the parties agreed, that the \u201cdispositive\u201d question involved interpretation of covenant No. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The court found the covenants to present \u201can ambiguous situation\u201d and, examining the intention of the original grantor, rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the word \u201clot\u201d meant a lot as originally conveyed. Rather, the court decided that the word means a parcel that may at any time become a lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Consequently, the court ruled in the August 1995 final decree dismissing the bill of complaint, from which the plaintiffs appeal, that \u201cerection of the proposed single family residence on K-2 does not violate any of the restrictive covenants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Parenthetically, we note that the trial court, both during the oral opinion and in the final decree, ruminated upon certain \u201cadditional\u201d findings of fact without making any conclusions of law, dealing with what the defendants describe as \u201cwaiver and acquiescence.\u201d As the defendants properly note on brief, however, those findings \u201cdo not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>affect the court\u2019s ruling\u201d because counsel for \u201cboth sides agreed\u201d that the court\u2019s decision regarding ambiguity was \u201cdispositive of the issues.\u201d Thus, we shall not address further the chancellor\u2019s \u201cadditional\u201d findings but shall focus upon interpretation of the restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Virginia law on the subject of restrictive covenants in deeds is settled. Valid covenants restricting the free use of land, although widely used, are not favored and must be strictly construed. The burden is upon the party seeking to enforce deed restrictions to demonstrate that the covenants are applicable to the acts of which complaint is made. Substantial doubt or ambiguity is to be resolved against the restrictions and in favor of the free use of property. <em>Friedberg </em>v. <em>Riverpoint Bldg. Comm., </em>218 Va. 659, 665, 239 S.E.2d 106, 110 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u201cNevertheless, equity will enforce restrictions when they are reasonable and the intention of the parties is clear.\u201d <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Wingfield, 229 </em>Va. 573, 577, 331 S.E.2d 463, 465 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In <em>Renn </em>v. <em>Whitehurst, </em>181 Va. 360, 25 S.E.2d 276 (1943), this Court considered the intention of the same grantor (Masury Corporation) regarding an identical restriction (\u201cThat not more than one residence exclusive of outbuildings shall be allowed upon one lot\u201d) in the deeds of a subdivision (\u201cUbermeer\u201d) adjacent to the subdivision that is the subject of the present dispute. This Court declared the restrictions \u201cvalid and enforceable,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 365, 25 S.E.2d at 278, and determined they formed part of a general plan for disposing of lots \u201cas highly restricted residential property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362, 25 S.E.2d at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Like this Court\u2019s prior ruling in <em>Renn </em>based on the evidence in that case, we hold, based on the evidence in the present case, that this restriction is valid and enforceable, forming part of a general plan to keep density low, preserve an area of large residential lots, and maintain property values. From a reading of restriction No. 5, together with die other restrictions, we believe that the original grantor and its immediate grantees, in plain and unambiguous language, intended the term \u201clot\u201d to mean a lot as originally conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Each of the source deeds for Ubermeer Annex No. 1 is part of the appellate record. When applied to the subdivision as a whole, the term \u201clot\u201d clearly means the sites as originally conveyed. For example, the grantees of sites D and K, the first sites conveyed, each received a \u201clot,\u201d identified as a particular \u201clot\u201d as designated by a letter on a plat. Likewise, the grantees of sites C, E, F, J, L, and M each received a \u201clot,\u201d identified as a particular \u201csite\u201d as designated by a letter on a plat. The single grantee of sites A and B received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>two \u201clots,\u201d identified as two individual sites. Thus, eight grantees received one \u201clot\u201d each while another grantee received a pair of \u201clots.\u201d Each conveyance was subject to the restriction, and the term \u201clot\u201d in each means the sites as originally conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The defendants, urging affirmance of the judgment below, point to the evidence showing that sites G, H, and I were originally conveyed differently than the other sites. The record shows that these three lots were sold as a site and one-half to two different purchasers. Site I and the western one-half of site H were sold originally to one purchaser and called one \u201clot.\u201d Site G and the eastern one-half of site H were sold originally to another buyer and called one \u201clot.\u201d One residence was placed later on each of the two lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The defendants argue that this constituted the placing of more than one residence per lot because a portion of the structures on \u201cnew\u201d Lot G with one-half of site H, and on \u201cnew\u201d Lot I with one-half of site H, amounted to placing parts of two residences on original site H. Thus, defendants contend, the argument that the grantor, in creating the subdivision, wanted to limit the purchaser\u2019s right to build only one residence on the original lots \u201cignores the grantor\u2019s resubdivision and ignores the reality of what actually occurred \u2014 the subsequent erection of two different residences on Lot H.\u201d We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In the first place, there is no evidence that representatives of the grantor corporation knew where any future structures would be located on the properties. In the second place, and more important, each grantee obtained a \u201clot,\u201d described as one and one-half sites. The manner of these conveyances, providing for less density and less construction, was consistent with the overall plan for a highly restricted residential subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Finally, one other contention made by the defendants merits discussion. They say that \u201cfurther confusion\u201d is added to the restrictions when No. 7 is considered. It provides: \u201cThat all residences erected upon said property shall be at least fifteen feet from the line [sic] and at least three feet from the side line of each lot.\u201d \u201cObviously,\u201d argue the defendants, \u201crestriction 7 contemplates more than one residence on the property conveyed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">We disagree. Manifestly, as the plaintiffs contend, restriction No. 7 addresses the construction of successive, not coexisting, structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Consequently, we will reverse the final decree in this suit because it is plainly wrong and contrary to law. We will enter final judgment declaring that construction of a residence on Lot K-2 will violate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>applicable restrictive covenants for Ubermeer Annex No. 1. Additionally, we will remand the cause to the trial court for entry, if necessary, of an appropriate injunction to enforce our judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\n<em>Reversed, final judgment, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b156-6\">JUSTICE KEENAN, with whom JUSTICE KOONTZ</author>\n<p id=\"AM7\">joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">I agree with the trial court that this restrictive covenant is ambiguous. As the majority has stated, any substantial doubt or ambiguity must be resolved against the restriction and in favor of the free use of the property. <em>Friedberg </em>v. <em>Riverpoint Bldg. Comm., </em>218 Va. 659, 665, 239 S.E.2d 106, 110 (1977). Moreover, because restrictive covenants are disfavored, they will not be aided or extended by implication. <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Spivey, </em>132 Va. 115, 119, 110 S.E. 367, 368 (1922); <em>see Mid-State Equipment Company, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>217 Va. 133, 140, 225 S.E.2d 877, 884 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The majority assumes that \u201clot\u201d in the restrictive covenant has the same meaning as \u201clot\u201d in the property description. There is no basis for such an assumption. As used in the restrictive covenant, \u201clot\u201d can be interpreted with equal force as meaning \u201cany lot in Ubermeer Annex No. 1,\u201d or as meaning \u201cany lot appearing on the original plat for Ubermeer Annex No. 1.\u201d If the grantor had intended in the restrictive covenant that \u201clot\u201d mean \u201cany lot appearing on the original plat,\u201d the grantor could have imparted that meaning by using the same term it used elsewhere in the restrictive covenants, \u201cupon the property hereby conveyed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">I also believe that the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Renn </em>v. <em>Whitehurst, </em>181 Va. 360, 25 S.E.2d 276 (1943), is misplaced. <em>Renn </em>is inapposite to the issue before us, because its holding was based on a property, owner\u2019s attempt to enlarge her house and convert it into \u201cduplex\u201d housing on one lot. <em>Id. </em>at 365, 25 S.E.2d at 278. In contrast, the Morgans are seeking to build only one dwelling on Lot K-2. Accordingly, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
