Allen, waived his double jeopardy objections and by affirming the trial court\u2019s order that the appellant be tried again, after the jury had been empaneled, reached a verdict, recommended a sentence and had been dismissed by the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">On February 23, 1993, a jury convicted Allen of breaking and entering in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-91 and grand larceny in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95 and fixed his punishment at \u201cconfinement in jail for 12 months\u201d and at \u201ca term of imprisonment for 2 years.\u201d The Circuit Court of Albemarle County dismissed the jury and continued the case for sentencing. The next day, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney moved for a mistrial on the ground that one of the jurors was a non-resident of the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">The trial court\u2019s letter opinion indicates that \u201cthe defendant concurred that there was an improper jury but requested that the case be dismissed on the basis that jeopardy had already attached and the case could not be retried.\u201d The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to a new trial, sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a mistrial, ordered the case continued to the next criminal docket call, and remanded the defendant to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">The defendant\u2019s second trial ended in a hung jury and a second declaration of mistrial. The trial court ruled that \u201cthe defendant has not waived his right to object to a [third] trial . . . based on the double jeopardy clause\u201d but that \u201ca third trial... will not amount to double jeopardy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">At the third jury trial, a police officer testified that Allen had refused to make a statement to the police. Invoking the Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination, the defendant moved for a mistrial. While the court made a finding for the record that the testimony was \u201cinadvertent and not a deliberate attempt by the Commonwealth to prejudice the Defendant\u201d, the court granted the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>motion for mistrial, denied his objection to a fourth trial, and ordered that the case be reset for trial at the next criminal docket call.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">At the fourth trial, a jury convicted Allen of both offenses charged in the indictments and fixed his punishment at \u201c8 years imprisonment\u201d and at \u201c5 years imprisonment.\u201d The trial court confirmed the convictions by order entered October 4, 1993 and, by final judgment entered December 6, 1993, imposed the sentences fixed by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">On appeal to the Court of Appeals of Virginia, the defendant contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe indictments should have been dismissed on double jeopardy grounds\u201d. Addressing that contention, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">By agreeing that the jury was improperly constituted and that the verdicts were invalid, the appellant invited the trial judge to set aside the verdicts. We hold that in doing so, the defendant waived his double jeopardy protections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\"><em>Allen </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>20 Va. App. 630, 636, 460 S.E.2d 248, 251 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">In effect, the Court of Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s several orders rejecting the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claims. We disagree with that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">\n<em>DOUBLE JEOPARDY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">The double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, made applicable to the states by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784 (1969), provides that no person shall be \u201csubject for the same offense, to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\u201d; <em>accord </em>Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8. That guarantee was grounded on the \u201cuniversal maxim of the common law of England\u201d. 4 St. George Tucker, <em>Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries </em>335 (1803). The common law of England \u201cnot only prohibited a second punishment for the same offence, but it went further and forbid a second trial for the same offence, whether the accused had suffered punishment or not, and whether in the former trial he had been acquitted or convicted.\u201d <em>Ex parte Lange, </em>85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 163, 169 (1873).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">The reasoning underlying this principle of Anglo-American jurisprudence is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\"><em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 187-88 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Since ratification of our Bill of Rights, the English and American rules have differed only in part. Under the English rule, reprosecution is barred only after final judgment is entered in the first trial. 11 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, Criminal Law, Evidence, and Procedure 1242 (4th ed. 1976). Under the American rule, jeopardy attaches when an accused is put to trial before a jury. <em>Kepner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>195 U.S. 100, 128 (1904). The accused has a \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal\u201d, <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 689 (1949), that is, \u201cthe right... to have his trial completed before the first jury empaneled to try him\u201d, <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 673 (1982). \u201c[A] verdict of acquittal is final, ending a defendant\u2019s jeopardy, and even when \u2018not followed by any judgment, is a bar to a subsequent prosecution for the same offence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Green, </em>355 U.S. at 188, (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>163 U.S. 662, 671 (1896)).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">That bar is activated by a plea of <em>autrefois convict </em>as well as a plea of <em>autrefois aquit. United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 87 (1978). In our opinion, a verdict of conviction, even when \u201cnot followed by any judgment\u201d, is also \u201cfinal, ending a defendant\u2019s jeopardy\u201d. Here, the jury rendered a verdict of conviction fixing the penalties to be imposed. That verdict was never confirmed by final judgment. Instead, based upon a conclusion that the jury, because it included one member who was a non-resident of the county, was unqualified to render that verdict, the trial court declared a mistrial and overruled Allen\u2019s double jeopardy objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">In an early case in which a trial judge had declared a mistrial on his own motion, Mr. Justice Story, writing for the Supreme Court, held that trial judges could declare mistrials \u201cwhenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580 (1824). In accord with that holding, the General Assembly enacted a statute providing that \u201cthe court may discharge the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>when it appears . . . that there is manifest necessity for such discharge.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-361.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">That statute must be read in conjunction with Code \u00a7 8.01-352, entitled \u201cObjections to irregularities in jury lists or for legal disability; effect thereof.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-352(B) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">[Ujnless it appears that the ... irregularity or disability be such as to probably cause injustice in a criminal case to the Commonwealth or to the accused, . . . then such irregularity or disability shall not be cause for summoning a new panel or juror or for setting aside a verdict or granting a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Although the defendant agreed that the jury was not properly constituted, Allen claimed no danger of \u201cinjustice\u201d related to the juror\u2019s residence; and the prosecutor, who had won a verdict of conviction and who was required to \u201cshoulder the burden of justifying the mistrial if he is to avoid the double jeopardy bar\u201d, <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 505 (1978), makes no claim of injustice to the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Citing <em>Thurman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>107 Va. 912, 915, 60 S.E. 99, 100 (1908) (objection that juror resides outside court\u2019s jurisdiction comes too late after conviction), the Commonwealth concedes that \u201cthere was no manifest necessity for ending Allen\u2019s first trial\u201d. We agree. It follows that the trial court erred in granting the motion for mistrial unless, as the Court of Appeals held, \u201cthe defendant waived his double jeopardy protections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">\n<em>WAIVER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">As the Commonwealth says on brief, \u201c[wjhen a defendant has moved for a mistrial <em>or consents to its declaration, </em>the double jeopardy clauses generally will not bar his retrial.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Commonwealth contends that \u201cAllen expressly agreed that the judge should vacate the jury verdict due to the juror\u2019s lack of competency.\u201d In support of that contention, the Commonwealth cites the order entered by the trial court rejecting Allen\u2019s motion to deny a third trial and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>court\u2019s letter opinion, stating that \u201cthe defendant concurred that there was an improper jury but requested that the case be dismissed on the basis that jeopardy had already attached and the case could not be retried.\u201d The Commonwealth \u00bfIso relies upon the reason assigned by the Court of Appeals in support of its waiver ruling that \u201c[b]y agreeing that ... the verdicts were invalid, the appellant invited the trial judge to set aside the verdicts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">As we read the record, Allen never consented to the prosecutor\u2019s motion for mistrial. That motion had multiple objectives, viz., vacation of the penalty verdict rendered by a jury mistakenly believed to be unqualified, the assembly of a new jury, and a new trial by that jury. Allen, laboring under the same misconception, \u201cconcurred that there was an improper jury\u201d. Nowhere does the record before us show that Allen ever agreed that \u201cthe verdicts were invalid\u201d; or that the judge should \u201cset aside the jury verdicts\u201d; or that there should be a new trial by a new jury. Rather, as the letter opinion indicates, he merely \u201crequested that the case be dismissed on the basis that jeopardy had already attached and the case could not be retried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u201c[Wjaiver is ordinarily an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege\u201d, <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938); <em>accord Stanley\u2019s Cafeteria </em>v. <em>Abramson, </em>226 Va. 68, 74, 306 S.E.2d 870, 873 (1983); <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 389, 396, 363 S.E.2d 440, 444 (1987); and with respect to fundamental constitutional rights, \u201ccourts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver\u201d, <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>301 U.S. 389, 393 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In the same letter opinion upon which the Commonwealth relies, the trial court ruled that Allen had \u201cpreserved the objection to a [second] trial ... by noting his objection on the record\u201d and that \u201cthe defendant has not waived his right to object to a [third] trial. .. based upon the double jeopardy clause\u201d. We agree with that ruling, and we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the judgment orders entered by the trial court at the fourth trial on October 4, 1993 and December 6, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Rejecting the defendant\u2019s suggestion that \u201cthe charges [be] dismissed\u201d, but granting his prayer that \u201cthe case [be] remanded for resentencing\u201d, we will return this case to the Court of Appeals with the following instructions. The Court of Appeals shall remand the case to the trial court. The trial court shall reinstate and confirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>verdict entered by the jury on February 23, 1993 and proceed with the imposition of sentence and entry of final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b126-12\"> <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, 400 </em>U.S. 470, 484-85 (1971) (general rule). <em>But see United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 611 (1976) (general'rule does not apply when conduct by judge or prosecutor was \u201cintended to provoke mistrial requests\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
