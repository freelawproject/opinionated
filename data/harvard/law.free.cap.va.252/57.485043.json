Rose in the Richmond City General District Court. Conner alleged in her warrant in debt that she had purchased a home from Rose and that he breached certain warranties that he had made to her. Conner sought damages in the amount of $4,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">On Rose\u2019s motion, the action was transferred to the Henrico County General District Court. Subsequently, Conner nonsuited her action in that court and refiled her action in the Circuit Court of Henrico County. Her motion for judgment included causes of action for breach of warranty and fraud in connection with the purchase of the house. She sought compensatory and punitive damages totaling $11,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Relying upon Code \u00a7 8.01-380(A), Rose requested that the circuit court transfer Conner\u2019s action to the general district court. Rose argued, and the trial court held, that Code \u00a7 8.01-380(A) requires that Conner refile her action in the general district court because her non-suit was taken in that court. We awarded Conner an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Conner asserts that Code \u00a7 8.01-380(A) permits her to file her action in the circuit court because the <em>ad damnum </em>clause in her motion for judgment exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the general district court and, therefore, the general district court lacks jurisdiction over her action. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">The applicable statutory language quoted in Code \u00a7 8.01-380(A) is clear and unambiguous and, therefore, we apply its plain meaning. <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Town &amp; Country Properties, Inc., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990). This language permits Conner to refile her action in the circuit court because the <em>ad damnum </em>clause in her motion for judgment exceeds the general district court\u2019s jurisdictional limit of $10,000, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-77. Therefore, the general district court is without jurisdiction to adjudicate her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
