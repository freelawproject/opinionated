NCR Corp., </em>546 F.2d 682 (6th Cir. 1976), the district court specifically denied Scarboro\u2019s request for a jury trial made at the time he filed his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\"><em>Morelock, </em>however, has been superseded by <em>Lorillard v. Pons, </em>434 U.S. 575, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978), in which the Supreme Court recognized a general statutory right to trial by jury in Age Discrimination in Employment Act suits. We acknowledged and adopted this rule in <em>Ott v. Midland-Ross Corp., </em>600 F.2d 24 (6th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-15\">The Act itself was amended two months after <em>Lorillard. </em>Section 7 now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-16\">(2) In an action brought under paragraph (1) , [29 U.S.C. 626(c)] a person shall be entitled to a trial by jury of any issue of fact in any such action for recovery of amounts owing as a result of a violation of this chapter, regardless of whether equitable relief is sought .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-18\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(c)(2). <em>See Slatin </em>v. <em>Stanford Research Institute, </em>590 F.2d 1292 (4th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-19\">The defendant, First American National Bank, contends that Scarboro waived his right to a jury trial and urges us to accept the substantive determination of the district court. Defendant points out that <em>Lor-illard </em>was decided six weeks before plaintiff filed his brief on appeal and argues against retrospective application of that case, citing <em>Chevron Oil v. Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-20\">We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s arguments. The Supreme Court has held, and Congress has provided, that private litigants under the Act are entitled to a jury trial. We must apply the statute in its present form unless our doing so would result in \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d or unless \u201cthere is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.\u201d <em>Bradley v. School Board of City of Richmond, </em>416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974); <em>Hercules, Inc. v. EPA, </em>598 F.2d 91 (D.C. Cir. 1978). In this case, neither limiting condition exists. The new legislation does not evince a nonretroactive scheme, and we do not believe that a jury resolution of plaintiff\u2019s claims poses any threat of \u201cinjustice\u201d to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for a trial by jury pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(c)(2).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
