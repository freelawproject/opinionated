Wehr had been employed as an engineer by the Burroughs Corporation since May 1967. He was discharged on August 1, 1975, ostensibly for unsatisfactory work performance, at the age of forty-four. Believing that he was a victim of age discrimination because of the company\u2019s expressed desire to replace some older employees with \u201cyoung tigers,\u201d Wehr sought relief in district court in the form of lost wages, including both back and front pay, statutory liquidated damages, compensatory damages for pain and suffering, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury returned a ver-diet of $126,760 in Wehr\u2019s favor for back pay and liquidated damages, and the court awarded $83,382.13 in counsel fees and costs. In the appeal at No. 79-1265, Burroughs contends that the district court erred in its interpretation and application of the liquidated damages provision of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-16\">The rights created by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) are \u201cenforced in accordance with the powers, remedies, and procedures\u201d of specified sections of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b). Following the model of the FLSA, Congress has established two primary enforcement mechanisms within the ADEA. The Secretary of Labor may bring suit on behalf of an aggrieved individual for injunctive and monetary relief. In addition, private actions are authorized by the incorporated FLSA provisions together with \u00a7 7(c) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(c), for \u201csuch legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of\u201d the ADEA. In a private action for damages under the ADEA, a plaintiff may initially recover lost wages. In addition, he may recover liquidated damages in an amount equal to the unpaid wages, see FLSA \u00a7 16(b), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b), but only when the violation is \u201cwillful.\u201d ADEA \u00a7 7(b), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b). In this respect the district court charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Members of the jury, the Act provides that the plaintiff is entitled to liquidated damages if the defendant\u2019s conduct in violating the Act was willful. . [Y]ou will have to determine whether the defendant\u2019s violation of the Act was willful. That is, did the defendant willfully use age as a determining factor in its decision to terminate plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">What do we mean by \u201cwillfully\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">An act is done willfully if it is done intentionally, deliberately and knowingly. Thus, an employer acts willfully in violation of the Act if the employer deliberately, intentionally and knowingly discharged the employee because of his age. In other words, if the employer intended to act consciously and intentionally in the discharge of the employee because of age, the employer acted willfully. The act of the employer must be intentional and cannot be an accident or it would not be willful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Appendix to Briefs at 437a-38a.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Burroughs finds two faults with this charge. First, it contends that the ADEA incorporates the good faith test of \u00a7 11 of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> From this Burroughs would infer that, procedurally, the final decision to award liquidated damages properly rested with the court rather than the jury, and substantively, that the court should have considered whether Burroughs believed in good faith that it had a legitimate reason to discharge Wehr, notwithstanding the jury finding of age discrimination. We reject this contention, and for the reasons stated in <em>Loeb v. Textron, Inc., </em>600 F.2d 1003, 1020 (1st Cir. 1979),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we determine that \u00a7 11 of the Portal-to-Portal Act is not incorporated into the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-18\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-19\">Burroughs second attack on the court\u2019s jury charge centers on the definition of the term \u201cwillful\u201d in ADEA \u00a7 7(b). Burroughs contends that the proviso in ADEA \u00a7 7(b) that allows liquidated damages only upon a showing of a \u201cwillful violation of [the Act]\u201d should be interpreted to mean that an employer is subject to liability for liquidated damages only if he intentionally violates the Act. The district court instructed the jury that \u201can employer acts willfully in violation of the Act if the employer deliber<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>ately, intentionally and knowingly discharged the employee because of his age.\u201d Appendix to Briefs at 437a-38a.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Although this is a civil case, the degree of culpability known as \u201cwillful\u201d comes to us from criminal law. The National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws has said that \u201c[t]here may be no word in the Federal criminal lexicon which has caused as much confusion as the word \u2018willfully\u2019 (or \u2018willful\u2019).\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree. The Senate Judiciary Committee has explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEy\">the term \u201cwillful\u201d has been construed by the courts in a variety of ways, often inconsistent and contradictory. The courts have defined a \u201cwillful\u201d act as an act done voluntarily as distinguished from accidentally, an act done with specific intent to violate the law, an act done with bad purpose, an act done without justifiable excuse, an act done stubbornly, an act done without grounds for believing it is lawful, and an act done with careless disregard whether or not one has the right so to act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">The Judicial Conference of the United States has recommended the abolition of \u201cwillfully\u201d as a degree of culpability in the proposed revision of the Federal Criminal Code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are encouraged that the Senate Judiciary Committee endorses the same concept. The Senate Committee Report accompanying S.1722,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> summarizes the welcomed new approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The Federal Criminal Code, as reported, discards the confused and inconsistent <em>ad hoc </em>approach to culpability that now characterizes Federal criminal law. Instead it reduces the number of terms used to describe the requisite mental state to four: <em>intentional, knowing, reckless, or negligent. </em>All other statutory formulations within title 18, United States Code, are eliminated. The four degrees of culpability that are retained express the significant distinctions found by the courts and are sufficient for all the distinctions in defining offenses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUB\">Until Congress excises \u201cwillfully\u201d from our statutes, however, we must distill from the case law some semblance of a consensus in order to decide whether the district court here erred by instructing the jury that \u201c[a]n act is done willfully if it is done intentionally, deliberately and knowingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ayc\">Although there is an abundance of confusion in the cases about the actual meaning of \u201cwillful,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it has been generally accepted that the term does not denote the same state of mind when used to describe civil violations of statutes as when used to describe criminal violations. Thus, in <em>United States v. Murdock, </em>290 U.S. 389, 54 S.Ct. 223, 78 L.Ed. 381 (1933), the decision cited as the leading authority for the proposition that \u201cwillful\u201d denotes evil motive, the Court held that a defendant in a criminal prosecution for willful violation of the tax laws was entitled to a jury charge with respect to his good faith and actual belief. In considering whether the word \u201cwillfully,\u201d as used in the statute under which the indictment was brought, required more than a showing of voluntary action, the Court stated: \u201cThe word often denotes an act which is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental. But when used in a criminal statute it generally means an act done with a bad purpose . . . .\u201d 290 U.S. at 394, 54 S.Ct. at 225. This distinction between the civil and criminal uses of. the word was further elaborated in <em>United States v. Illinois Central R. R., </em>303 U.S. 239, 58 S.Ct. 533, 82 L.Ed. 773 (1938), a case involving a civil violation by the railroad for improperly transporting livestock. The Court addressed the meaning \u201cwillfully\u201d should have for civil violations by reaffirming its statement in <em>Murdock:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-17\">In statutes denouncing offenses involving turpitude, \u201cwillfully\u201d is generally used to mean with evil purpose, criminal intent or the like. But in those denouncing acts not in themselves wrong, the \u25a0 word is often used without any such implication. Our opinion in <em>United States v. Murdock, </em>290 U.S. 389, 394, 54 S.Ct. 223, 78 L.Ed. 381, shows that it often denotes that which is \u201cintentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental,\u201d and that -it is employed to characterize \u201cconduct marked by careless disregard whether or not one has the right so to act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 242-43, 58 S.Ct. at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-19\">Although it is apparent that this unfortunate word is capable of a multitude of meanings and that neither the Supreme Court nor Congress has been willing to fashion a precise meaning for it, we are able to draw some conclusions to assist us in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>this case. First, only three degrees of culpability are associated with the term \u201cwillful\u201d: intentional, knowing, or reckless. Merely negligent conduct is never deemed \u201cwilful.\u201d <em>E. g., Anderson v. Commissioner, 81 </em>F.2d 457, 460 (10th Cir. 1936). Second, when the Supreme Court speaks of \u201cbad faith,\u201d \u201cbad purpose,\u201d \u201cevil intent,\u201d or \u201cevil nature\u201d in connection, with violations of criminal statutes, it is in fact describing the highest degree of culpability. The Court is saying that proof of any of these mental states is equivalent to proof of conduct that is \u201cintentional,\u201d as distinguished from \u201cknowing\u201d or \u201creckless.\u201d Third, unless legislative history or the statutory context compels proof of an intentional violation of the statute, or proof of the judicial equivalents \u201cbad faith,\u201d \u201cbad purpose,\u201d \u201cevil intent,\u201d or \u201cevil nature,\u201d any conduct that is intentional, knowing, or reckless should be considered \u201cwillful.\u201d This last approach comports with the National Commission\u2019s suggestion to Congress in 1970 that \u201c[a] person engages in conduct . . \u2018willfully\u2019 if he engages in the conduct intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and finds precedential authority in <em>United States v. Murdock, </em>290 U.S. 389, 394-95, 54 S.Ct. 223, 225-226, 78 L.Ed. 381 (1933), and <em>United States v. Illinois Central R. R., </em>303 U.S. 239, 242-43, 58 S.Ct. 533, 534-535, 82 L.Ed. 773 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">The starting point in any case is to ascertain the degree of culpability intended by Congress when using \u201cwillful.\u201d In the absence of enlightenment from legislative history, the term must be construed within its statutory context, civil or criminal. As the Court has directed, we \u201ccontinue to recognize that context is important in the quest for the word\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>United States v. Bishop, </em>412 U.S. 346, 356, 93 S.Ct. 2008, 2015, 36 L.Ed.2d 941 (1973).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Unfortunately, a review of the legislative history of the ADEA and its assimilated acts uncovers nothing helpful on this question. We note, however, that \u00a7 6(a) of the Portal-to-Portal Act,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which extends by one year the statute of limitations for willful civil violations of the FLSA, is specifically incorporated into the ADEA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(e)(1). In <em>Hodgson v. Hyatt, </em>318 F.Supp. 390 (N.D.Fla.1970), a case defining a willful violation of the FLSA, the court offered the following definition of \u201cwillful,\u201d which we find to be helpful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Since the Portal-to-Portal Act limitations apply to civil actions, the term \u201cwillful\u201d which was added by the 1966 amendment must be construed in the civil sense. It therefore applies to violations which are intentional, knowing or voluntary as distinguished from accidental and it is used to characterize conduct marked by careless disregard whether or not one has the right to act. <em>United States v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., </em>303 U.S. 239, 243, 58 S.Ct. 533, 535, 82 L.Ed. 773.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 392-93.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We believe this definition of \u201cwillful\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 6(a) of the Portal-to-Portal Act, incorporated into the ADEA by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(e), also applies to ADEA \u00a7 7(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that Congress did not intend to restrict the meaning of \u201cwillful,\u201d as Burroughs suggests, to intentional violations of the ADEA. It is sufficient to prove that the company discharged the employee because of age and that the discharge was voluntary and not accidental, mistaken, or inadvertent. In our view, it would also be sufficient to prove that the discharge was precipitated in reckless disregard of consequences. Using these standards, we reject Burrough\u2019s contention that the district court erred in charging the jury that \u201c[a]n act is done willfully if it is done intentionally, deliberately and knowingly.\u201d By charging the jury as it did, the district court actually placed a higher burden on the plaintiff in this case than would be required under our formulation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It required the jury to find that Burroughs acted intentionally, and it omitted the culpability degree of \u201creckless\u201d which, in a civil context, describes a much lower threshold of culpability than does \u201cintentional.\u201d <em>Compare </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 8A (1965) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">In sum, we find no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s jury charge on willful violation of the ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">Wehr makes several arguments in his appeal at No. 79-2403. Although he was awarded backpay from the date of discharge to the date of trial, Wehr argues that he is also entitled to future damages, or front pay, to some date in the future\u2014 possibly to the age of retirement \u2014 as a substitute for the equitable remedy of reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">We will not decide whether future damages may be awarded in ADEA cases, however, because we are persuaded that Wehr has removed this issue from consideration. Any basis for calculating front pay would include the amount Wehr would have received had he continued to be employed by Burroughs beyond the trial date. Of necessity, Wehr\u2019s argument that he is entitled to future damages in lieu of reinstatement presupposes that he wanted to be reinstated.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> At pre-trial, however, Wehr specifically disclaimed any desire for reinstatement.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the question whether future damages may be recovered in ADEA cases is not properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>before us at this time.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Wehr\u2019s further contention, that the court erred by refusing to permit compensatory damages for pain and suffering including emotional distress, is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Rogers v. Exxon Research and Engineering Co., </em>550 F.2d 834, 839 \u2014 42 (3d Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1022, 98 S.Ct. 749, 54 L.Ed.2d 770 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Also in the appeal at No. 79-2403, Wehr\u2019s counsel complain that the court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs was inadequate. <em>See Wehr v. Burroughs Corp., </em>477 F.Supp. 1012 (E.D.Pa.1979).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Although ultimately awarded a total of $80,651.79, Wehr\u2019s counsel sought $161,879 in fees for the litigation on the merits, and $11,816.25 for time expended in preparing the fee petition. In addition, counsel requested reimbursement of $11,053.79 in costs. After Burroughs objected to the reasonableness of the proposed figures, the district court examined the documentation under the standards enunciated by this court in <em>Lindy Brothers Builders, Inc. v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>487 F.2d 161 (3d Cir. 1973) <em>(Lindy I), Lindy Brothers Builders, Inc. v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>540 F.2d 102 (3d Cir. 1976) (in banc) <em>(Lindy II), </em>and their progeny. The court disallowed certain discrete amounts from the proposed lodestar and adjusted that figure downward. It also declined to augment the lodestar by a multiplier. Counsel complain that by doing so, the district court misused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">On review, except for two modifications of the award mentioned below, we will affirm the district court\u2019s determination concerning fees and costs, and we reject counsel\u2019s various contentions regarding the court\u2019s exercise of discretion over whether to multiply the award. Indeed, it appears, to us that this should not have been a difficult case for counsel, yet it was ov-erprepared, over-discovered, and overtried by counsel for both sides. Significantly, in its instructions to the jury, the trial court recognized the absence of complexity in this case and summarized the controlling issue in one sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">Although there has been considerable testimony in this case, your task, members of the jury, is not complicated. You must simply determine whether plaintiff has proven his claim by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff\u2019s age was a determining factor in defendant\u2019s decision to discharge him and if you resolve that issue in favor of the plaintiff, whether, in discharging plaintiff, plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant acted willfully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG9\">Appendix to Briefs at 425a.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">We will modify the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in two minor respects. First, we note an arithmetical error in the court\u2019s computation regarding the award for the fee petition. The district court awarded $4,167 as attorneys\u2019 fees for litigating the fee petition. When computing this award, the district court incorrectly stated that counsel\u2019s request for $7,877.50 in compensation was for 164.7 hours when, in fact 117.6 hours was the actual figure requested. The district court believed that 164.7 hours greatly exceeded the time reasonably necessary to litigate a fee petition. 477 F.Supp. at 1020-21. It therefore subtracted 50 hours and made a corresponding deduction in fees. This computation resulted in an inaccurately reduced amount, however, because the figure used by the court as the minuend of its equation was the amount ($7,877.50) representing 117.6 hours and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the 164.7 hours that the court believed were billed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Thus, because the court evidently would have allowed 114.7 hours (164.7 minus 50) to litigate the fee petition, and because counsel\u2019s billable rates for the fee petition were not determined to be too high, we have decided for the sake of judicial economy not to remand for a redetermination of this calculation, but instead to allow recovery for the entire 117.6 hours requested. Therefore, the district court\u2019s award of $4,167 will be increased to $7,877.50, an amount that accurately represents recovery for 117.6 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Second, we will modify the district court\u2019s award of costs because we disagree with the court\u2019s refusal to allow recovery for computer-aided legal research as a reasonable cost of litigation. We will allow recovery of these costs. Use of computer-aided legal research such as LEXIS, or WEST-LAW, or similar systems, is certainly reasonable, if not essential, in contemporary legal practice. Indeed, in at least one other case decided in this circuit, this type of cost has been awarded as a reimbursable expense. <em>See Pitchford Scientific Instruments Corp. v. Pepi, Inc., </em>440 F.Supp. 1175, 1178 (W.D.Pa.1977), <em>aff\u2019d without opinion, </em>582 F.2d 1275 (3d Cir. 1978),- <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 981, 99 S.Ct. 1790, 60 L.Ed.2d 242 (1979). We think this is the better rule, but we are careful to note that the amount of use must be reasonable in order to be allowed. We conclude that the $440 requested by counsel in this case was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be affirmed in all respects except that the award for the fee petition will be increased by $3,710.50 and an additional $440 will be added to the district court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Each side to bear its own costs in the appeals before us.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\">.

In addition, Burroughs contends that the court erred in its treatment of the question of mitigation of damages. We have concluded that the court properly framed the jury interrogatories to place the burden on defendant to demonstrate both that plaintiff failed to exercise reasonable diligence to mitigate his damages, and that there was a reasonable likelihood that plaintiff might have found comparable work if he had exercised reasonable diligence. Mitigation was properly a question for the jury, and, as such, was resolved against Burroughs. Finally, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of Burrough\u2019s motion for mistrial based on overall prejudice of the Platt testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b339-10\">.

Pons, </em>[434 U.S. 575, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978)], read the ADEA to permit liquidated damages awards where an ADEA violation is \u201cwillful,\u201d 434 U.S. at 581, 98 S.Ct. 866, and noted that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-14\">\u201cAlthough \u00a7 7(e) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(e), expressly incorporates \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 10 of the Portal-to-Portal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 255 and 259, the ADEA does not make any reference to \u00a7 11, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-21\">434 U.S. at 581-82 n.8, 98 S.Ct. at 870.

The reason is clear: under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b), standing alone, liquidated damages must be awarded once a violation is shown. Section 11 mitigates this result in FLSA cases. <em>Id. </em>at 581 n. 8, 98 S.Ct. 866.
