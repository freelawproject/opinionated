Stat. \u00a7 516.120 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">On November 12, 1971, plaintiffs filed suit in Missouri state court alleging that defendant refused to process a grievance concerning termination of certain contractual rights resulting in plaintiffs\u2019 layoff and loss of seniority rights on August 1, 1969. December 17,1971, defendant moved to dismiss the suit because defendant, as an unincorporated labor organization, is not an entity capable of being sued under Missouri law. No further action took place until 1976 when plaintiffs requested and were granted removal of the case from the state court\u2019s dismissal docket. July 10, 1978, the original suit was dismissed by the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">February 20, 1979, plaintiffs filed the present action in federal court alleging essentially the same charges as raised in the state proceedings. The district court granted d\u00e9fendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment because plaintiffs\u2019 claim was untimely under the appropriate state statute of limitations, Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 516.120 (1969). However, the district court allowed plaintiffs to amend their complaint to allege the applicability of the Missouri savings statute, Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 516.230 (1969). The district court again granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment finding that under the facts of the case the savings statute was not applicable and the suit was barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">We have carefully reviewed the record, including the district court\u2019s memorandum, the briefs and the arguments of the parties to this action. We find no merit to plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, and accordingly affirm the order of the district court pursuant to Rule 14 of the Rules of this court on the basis of the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
