Unlike those considered in a long line of past cases, the newly promulgated HUD regulations which we must consider, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 403.1, 403.8, <em>et seq. </em>(1979), specifically preempt <em>all </em>local rent control laws as applied to federally subsidized insured projects.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the HUD regulations were validly promulgated and thus operate through the Supremacy Clause, U.S.Const. Art. VI, cl. 2, to preempt local rent control regulations in these instances. We also conclude that HUD procedures and regulations satisfied the tenants\u2019 due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The rental housing which both parties seek' to regulate in this case is federally insured subsidized units developed under the National Housing Act (NHA), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1701 <em>et seq. </em>(1976). The general purpose of federal housing regulation has been to meet the national goal of a \u201cdecent home and a suitable living environment for every American family.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701t (1976); 1968 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 2873, 2877. In order to achieve its goal, Congress has elected to utilize the financial resources and expertise of the private sector rather than to develop projects itself. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No. 281, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1961). The NHA programs administered by HUD are intended to stimulate the development of low and moderate income housing by providing subsidies or insured mortgages designed to lower the cost of building a project and thus lower the rent which owners must charge to make a fair return on their investments. The rental housing which the City of Boston purports to regulate involves four HUD programs combining insured mortgages and subsidized rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">The first of these four programs, section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701q (1976), allows HUD to make 3% loans for 50 year terms <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to eligible developers <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to provide housing facilities for elderly or handicapped families<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with inadequate income to pay private market housing rentals. \u25a0 To start the program Congress set up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>a revolving fund, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 1701q(a)(4), which depends upon repayment of mortgages or Congressional appropriations for its continued success. Section 202 makes money available for mortgages which is otherwise unavailable. <em>Id. </em>at section 1701q(a)(2)(A). In order to insure that section 202 objectives are met, HUD requires an applicant to enter into a regulatory agreement providing that the Secretary of HUD shall establish rental levels and tenant eligibility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The second of these four programs, NHA sections 221(d)(3), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 17151(d)(3) (Supp. II 1978), and (5), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 17151 (d)(5) (1976), establishes a subsidized mortgage program. Section 221(d)(3) assists \u201cprivate industry in providing housing for low and moderate income families and displaced families.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at section 17151(a). As Chief Judge Coffin explained in <em>Hahn v. Gottlieb, </em>430 F.2d 1243, 1245 (1st Cir. 1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkT\">\u201cThis assistance to the private sector takes two forms. First, the FHA provides insurance on long-term mortgage loans covering up to 90 per cent of the project\u2019s cost, thus encouraging private investment in projects which would otherwise be too risky. Second, eligible borrowers can obtain below-market interest rates on FHA-insured loans, thus reducing the rentals necessary to service the landlord\u2019s debt obligations. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 17151(d)(5).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">Again, Congress provided the Secretary with broad discretion to manage and control the rental housing. <em>Id. </em>at 1246. HUD is authorized to control rents and operation through a regulatory agreement, although the Secretary may defer to other federal or local law. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 17151(d)(3) (Supp. 1978).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While a project owner may apply for rent increases, the Secretary controls the determination and strict limitations are placed on the permissible return on investment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Once more, defaults on mortgages directly cause the mortgagee to draw upon the insurance fund. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 17151(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">A third program, section 236 of the NHA, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-l (1976), is designed to encourage private enterprise to develop rental and cooperative housing for lower income families and provide periodic subsidy payments to the mortgagee which effectively reduced the interest payments on the mortgage to 1% on qualified rental housing. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-l(c) (1976). The Secretary is expressly directed by Congress to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>establish rental charges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Secretary may also enter into regulatory agreements and establish necessary rules and procedures. <em>Id. </em>at section 1715z-l(h) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The final program here involved is a Rent Supplement Program (RSP), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701s (1976), which empowers the Secretary to make annual payments on behalf of eligible low income families or individuals unable to afford section 221(d)(3) rents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The maximum payment which the Secretary can make for an eligible tenant is that amount by which the rent approved by the Secretary exceeds 25 percent of the tenant\u2019s income. <em>Id. </em>at section 1701s(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In examining these four programs it becomes apparent that their success \u201crequires a flexible exercise of administrative discretion.\u201d <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Gottlieb, </em>430 F.2d 1243, 1246 (1st Cir. 1970). Moreover, Congress has granted the Secretary broad general rule making authority for the NHA<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and again in each specific section.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For project sponsors, the rent received from tenants provides the major source of income from which to maintain the housing and meet the debt service requirements. Although the Secretary originally permitted local governments to operate their rent control programs freely, the Secretary nonetheless engaged extensively in the regulation of rent in HUD insured and subsidized projects through leases and regulatory agreements. In order to increase the rents for units in the project, a landlord must submit a request and justification to HUD.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rental increases are only permissible for justifiable increased costs and, in general, HUD allows a landlord to receive a six percent return on equity. <em>Kargman v. Sullivan, </em>552 F.2d 2, 4 (1st Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">While Congress was coping with rental housing problems through the N.HA, local government concerned with spiraling rents began imposing direct limits on the amount of rent which a landlord could charge. One of the earliest programs of local rent control was that instituted by the City of Boston in 1970, ch. 797, 1969 Mass.Acts, as amended, ch. 863, 1970 Mass.Acts. Originally initiated under statewide local option rent control legislation, the city itself adopted a comprehensive regulatory scheme upon the expiration of the statewide legislation in 1975. Ch. 15, City of Boston Ordinances (1975). Since 1972, privately owned, federally insured and subsidized sections 202, 221(d)(3) and (5) and 236 housing had been covered by Boston\u2019s rent control. <em>See City of Boston v. Hills, </em>420 F.Supp. 1291 (D.Mass.1976), <em>reconsidered and reversed by district court, </em>461 F.Supp. 1201 (D.Mass. 1978). Under the local legislation, the City of Boston\u2019s rent control legislation sets maximum rents for covered projects. The basic rent established under the 1975 ordinance is that which was previously established in 1970 or 1972.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Generally, those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>base rents were the 1968 rent of the unit or first rent in effect thereafter.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Board is authorized to adjust the established maximum rent upon the petition of either the tenant or landlord.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Adjustments are allowable to remove hardships or correct inequities. The governing principle is to maintain maximum rents at levels which will yield landlords a fair net return on operating income from the rental unit. In determining whether a landlord is receiving a fair yield on net operating income, the Board is directed to consider the effect of property taxes, operating and maintenance expenses, capital improvements, depreciation, and increases or decreases in living space or housing services.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Finally, the Board may deny an increase to the landlord if the housing does not satisfy local codes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">While Boston\u2019s procedure for setting maximum rents has similarities to HUD\u2019s rent setting formula, we have previously noted that differences exist. <em>Kargman v. Sullivan, </em>552 F.2d 2, 5 (1st Cir. 1977). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Nevertheless, this circuit decided that no such actual, impermissible conflict existed between local regulation and the NHA provisions as effected preemption. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 13-14. <em>Kargman, </em>however, specifically left open the question we face here: whether a HUD regulation could preempt local rent control. <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">As noted, HUD originally left the field open for local rent control of its subsidized insured projects. In 1975, however, HUD promulgated an interim rule, 40 Fed.Reg. 8189 (1975), to deal with the problems it found local rent control was causing. HUD\u2019s reasoning was set forth as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH7\">\u201c[HUD] has received numerous inquiries relating to the jurisdiction of local rent control boards over FHA projects. This has become an area of great concern to the Department, because it has been de- \u25a0 termined that local rent control is a significant factor in causing owners of FHA projects, especially subsidized projects, to default on their mortgage payments. The defaults are leading to a substantial number of mortgage insurance claims by mortgagees upon HUD and to the withdrawal from the nation\u2019s housing stock of an increasing number of units for low income families. Since HUD already regulates, pursuant to the National Housing Act, the maximum permissible rents that an owner of a project financed by a mortgage insured by HUD may charge, and since each mortgage insurance claim typically requires the expenditure of several millions of dollars by the Department, HUD has an overriding interest to preempt state and local actions which contribute to such claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The interim rules were adopted later in 1975 and <em>bar all local rent control applying to subsidized insured projects. </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 403.1, 403.8-03.10 (1979); 40 Fed.Reg. 8189, 8190 (1975). As to unsubsidized housing which HUD insures, local regulation is permitted except where HUD determines that such local control jeopardizes its economic interest in the project. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 403.1-403.7; <em>see also Gramercy Spire Tenants\u2019 Association v. Harris, </em>446 F.Supp. 814, 821 (S.D.N.Y.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">After promulgation of 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 403.-1-403.10 (1979), the City of Boston filed suit against the Secretary of HUD challenging the constitutionality of HUD\u2019s preemptive regulation. Certain tenants of section 202, 221(d)(3) and (5) or 236, rent supplemented housing also intervened as plaintiffs. The City and tenants sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and HUD counterclaimed arguing that Boston\u2019s ordinance violated the Supremacy Clause. U.S.Const. art. VI, cl. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">The district court, applying <em>Jones v. Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 51 L.Ed.2d 604, reh. denied, 431 U.S. 925, 97 S.Ct. 2201, 58 L.Ed.2d 240 (1977), stated that \u201cthe only determination necessary is whether the express preemption provision promulgated by the Secretary of HUD was authorized by a valid delegation of Congressional authority and properly promulgated pursuant to that delegation.\u201d <em>City of Boston v. Harris, </em>461 F.Supp. 1201, 1202 (D.Mass.1978). Since the lower court had earlier determined that HUD\u2019s regulations were valid and had the full effect of federal law, <em>City of Boston v. Hills, </em>420 F.Supp. 1291, 1298 (D.Mass.1976), it granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. 461 F.Supp. at 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Plaintiffs-tenants appealed arguing (1) that the Secretary acted in excess of delegated authority in promulgating 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 403.1, 403.8-403.10 because Congress never intended to authorize the Secretary to preempt local rent control and (2) that the preemption regulation deprived tenants in federally subsidized insured housing of their entitlement to the protection of rent control without due process. We examine both of these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">In analyzing whether HUD\u2019s regulations validly preempt Boston\u2019s local rent control ordinance, we start with the obvious fact, conceded by plaintiffs, that HUD\u2019s regulations and Boston\u2019s local rent control ordinances directly conflict. Indeed, the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>object of the challenged regulations is to provide for the displacement of local rent controls. See text of regulations at note 1. Thus, the only question remaining is whether the Secretary had the authority to promulgate the regulation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Plaintiffs place much reliance on <em>Karg-man v. Sullivan, </em>552 F.2d 2 (1st Cir. 1977), <em>reh. denied, </em>558 F.2d 612 (1st Cir. 1977). That case, unlike this one, presented no actual conflict between the operation of HUD\u2019s subsidized insured housing programs and Boston\u2019s rent control for the regulations now challenged \u2014 exclusive regulation of rents by HUD \u2014 were not then in effect. In large part that case turned upon the burden of proof and evidence presented at a time when the Secretary\u2019s own policies were unclear and, indeed, had vacillated. This court was not persuaded on the record then before it that HUD rents were the minimum necessary to ensure project viability. <em>Kargman v. Sullivan, </em>552 F.2d 2, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1977). The court stated that the \u201cmere fact that Boston\u2019s rents were lower, does not, of itself, present an impermissible actual conflict with federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. Because it was not established that Boston\u2019s rent regulation caused mortgage defaults in HUD insured projects, the court concluded that the laws could co-exist. The Court specifically noted, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUI\">\u201c[T]his is not a case where a national administrator, surveying all of his problems of dealing with local rent control, had concluded that the federal program nationally is jeopardy because of varying approaches to setting rent ceilings, or administrative entanglements, or the risk that, local regulation would discourage participation in the program.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The very situation stated not to exist in the above quotation now exists. The Secretary has surveyed the situation nationally and has concluded that preemption of local rent control is necessary to protect HUD insured subsidized projects from default. 40 Fed.Reg. 8189 (1975). It can no longer be said that there is no actual conflict between the two schemes of regulation. The Secretary has deliberately framed a regulation creating such a conflict, and the only issue is her power to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The Secretary promulgated the regulations under the authority of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3535(d) (1976). That section gives the Secretary broad powers under the NHA to \u201cmake such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out [her] functions, powers, and duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, as stated earlier, Congress gave the Secretary broad administrative powers over each of the subsidized insured programs. <em>See </em>text accompanying notes 2 to 11, <em>supra. </em>By virtue of the rent subsidy, direct mortgage loans, mortgage insurance, and interest subsidy programs, the federal government has a very direct interest in and involvement with the financial viability of the housing projects and, therefore, in their rental income.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Federal regulation of rents accord the government a voice in securing the economic viability of federally subsidized insured housing. Thus, the Secretary\u2019s preemptive regulation, in light of Congress\u2019 delegation, is consistent with and advances the purposes of the Act, <em>see Kargman v. Sullivan, </em>552 F.2d at 14 (Campbell, J., concurring),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and is therefore valid.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Whirl</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>pool Corp. v. </em>Marshall,-U.S.-, 100 S.Ct. 883, 63 L.Ed.2d 154 (1980) (No. 78-1870) (regulation which furthers purpose of Act and rationally complements statutory scheme is valid).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In promulgating this regulation, there is no dispute that HUD followed the informal rule-making procedures required Toy federal law. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553. The Secretary proceeded by adopting an interim rule, based on her experience with insured mortgage claims, decline in housing stock available for low income families, and defaults on mortgage loans and insured mortgages. The rules under challenge were adopted after notice and comment procedure and rested on legislative type findings amply supporting the rule. 40 Fed.Reg. 8189, 49,-318; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">We turn next to plaintiffs\u2019 due process argument. In promulgating 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 403.1 \u2014 403.10 (1979), HUD examined the housing situation nationally and drafted a rule to deal with a series of problems. In other words, HUD engaged in legislative rule-making rather than in an adjudicatory function. Thus, HUD complied with the necessary due process requirements for this action when it proceeded in conformity with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1976) which requires public notice and hearing prior to the regulation\u2019s promulgation.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">The question of what procedural requirements HUD must meet when landlords seek to have their rent increased has been answered before. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 401 (1979) promulgated in response to the District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Marshall v. Lynn, </em>497 F.2d 643 (D.C.Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 970, 95 S.Ct. 235, 42 L.Ed.2d 186 (1974), provides for written notice to the tenants, an opportunity to comment and a written response from HUD explaining its actions. This provides sufficient protection of plaintiff\u2019s interests. This court previously determined that tenants in subsidized housing were not entitled to an administrative hearing or judicial review of agency decisions on rent increases. <em>Hahn v. Gottlieb, </em>430 F.2d 1243, 1249 (1970). Similarly, several other circuits found that tenants had no due process rights in the adjustment of rents in NHA housing. <em>Grace Towers Tenants\u2019 Association v. Grace Housing Development Fund, Inc., </em>538 F.2d 491 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>Harlib v. Lynn, </em>511 F.2d 51 (7th Cir. 1975); <em>Paulson v. Coachlight Apartments, </em>507 F.2d 401 (6th Cir. 1974); <em>Langevin v. Chengano Court, Inc., </em>447 F.2d 296 (2d Cir. 1971). Moreover, in those cases which did find that tenants must be accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ed some rights, the courts imposed only nominal notice and hearing requirements now satisfied by HUD\u2019s regulations. <em>Marshall v. Lynn, supra; Geneva Towers Tenants\u2019 Organization v. Federated Mortgage Investors, </em>504 F.2d 483 (9th Cir. 1974). Consequently, tenants here are assured of due process when their landlord petitions for rental increases. <em>Accord Gramercy Spire Tenants\u2019 Association v.

Under the regulations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>unsubsidized insured projects are subject to local rent control until the Secretary determines local control jeopardizes HUD\u2019s economic interest in the project and issues a certificate of preemption. The Secretary\u2019s authority for and the interest served by preemption are the same in both subsidized and unsubsidized projects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b155-10\">. In plaintiff\u2019s view it is not enough that the Secretary has been granted broad powers to administer the housing programs \u2014 including the authority to regulate rents \u2014 and that the regulation advances purposes of the housing programs. Plaintiffs argue that when an exercise of regulatory powers would preclude the exercise of traditional police powers, in order for the police powers to be superseded, the agency must demonstrate a clear delegation of power from Congress to preempt the particular aspect of police powers involved. In support of their argument that no such specific congressional intent to authorize the Secretary to preempt local rent control exists, plaintiffs emphasize that the various housing programs, as enacted, did not foreclose but rather invited and allowed local participation and regulation. It is true that Congress did not expressly declare that federal regulation of subsidized insured housing was intended to preempt local control of rents. <em>Kargman v. Sullivan, </em>552 F.2d 2 (1st Cir. 1977). But the fact that Congress itself did not foreclose local rent control does not indicate it intended to preclude the Secretary from so doing. We think that where, as here, Congress has set up a complex series of programs the success of which \u201crequires a flexible exercise of administrative discretion,\u201d <em>Hahn v. Gottlieb, </em>430 F.2d 1243, 1246 (1st Cir. 1970), has allowed for the operation of that flexibility by delegating broad administrative powers, and has expressly granted to the agency the power to deal with the subject embraced by the conflicting local law \u2014 here, rents \u2014 Congress has authorized the agency to decide whether to override those local laws which, in the agency\u2019s reasonably based view, hamper the operation of the federal program. No more explicit statement on the part of Congress, as plaintiffs would require, is necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b156-5\">KUNZIG, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A8A\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">I concur in the result and opinion of the court and indeed participated fully in the <em>per curiam. </em>However, due to the magnitude and importance of this case I wish to add my personal reasoning a bit more in depth as to why the approach taken by the court in analyzing the preemption issue is the correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">As the court states, the ultimate issue' regarding HUD\u2019s preemption of Boston\u2019s local rent control is whether the Secretary had the authority to promulgate the regulation. <em>See </em>text accompanying note 18 <em>supra. </em>Like the majority of the court in <em>Kargman v. Sullivan, </em>552 F.2d 2 (1st Cir. 1977), however, I am concerned with which preemption analysis we should use in light of the multiplicity of Supreme Court cases in this area of law. <em>Id. </em>at 10-14. Since the early case of <em>Gibbons v. Ogden, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824), there have been many cases analyzing the interplay of federal and state law in light of the Supremacy Clause, U.S.Const. art. IV, \u00a7 2. In <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 10 L.Ed.2d 248 (1963), the Supreme Court described three traditional grounds for preemption of state law under the Supremacy Clause: (1) there exists clear evidence that Congress intended to preempt the field, (2) the actual subject matter of the federal legislation demands exclusive federal regulation, or (3) there is an actual conflict between the two schemes of regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 141-42, 83 S.Ct. at 1216-17.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">This circuit applied the third test presented in <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers </em>in <em>Kargman v. Sullivan, </em>552 F.2d 2 (1st Cir. 1977). No specific federal statutes or regulations indicated the application of another approach. The court determined that no actual conflict existed between the operation of HUD\u2019s subsidized-insured housing programs and Boston\u2019s rent control because the court was unconvinced that HUD rents were the minimum necessary to ensure project viability. <em>Kargman v. Sullivan, </em>552 F.2d 2, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1977). It stated that the \u201cmere fact that Boston\u2019s rents were lower, does not, of itself, present an impermissible actual conflict with federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. Because there was no proof presented showing that Boston\u2019s rent regulation caused mortgage defaults in HUD insured projects, the court concluded that the laws could coexist. In large part, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>case turned upon the burden of proof and evidence presented. The court specifically left open the question of the effect of a regulation preempting local law. <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The question left open in <em>Kargman </em>is precisely the issue presented in this case. The Secretary has determined that preemption of local rent control is necessary to protect HUD insured-subsidized projects from default. 40 Fed.Reg. 8189 (1975). Moreover, this issue with which we are faced does not fit neatly into one of the three categories outlined in <em>Florida Lime, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Rather, the case involves preemptive effect of a federal regulation promulgated under federal law. Consequently, the case is most appropriately analyzed under the relatively modern line of cases dealing with these issues beginning with <em>Free v. Bland, </em>369 U.S. 663, 82 S.Ct. 1089, 8 L.Ed.2d 180 (1962).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\"><em>Free v. Bland </em>considered whether Treasury regulations creating a right of surviv-orship in United States Savings Bonds preempted any inconsistent Texas community property laws. Under the Treasury regulations, when the co-owner of a bond issued to \u201cMr. or Mrs.\u201d dies, the survivor becomes the absolute owner. Mr. Free claimed the full value of the bonds, but Mrs. Free\u2019s son and heir claimed one-half community property interest his mother owned by virtue of Texas community property law. The Court found the Treasury regulation preempted local law. In doing so, the Court utilized a two-step approach. First, it determined whether the regulation was a valid federal law. If so, then its second step was to determine whether it conflicted with state law. Assuming a valid federal regulation and a conflict, the federal law prevails. <em>Id. </em>at 666, 82 S.Ct. at 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">In this case, plaintiffs challenged the validity of the regulation by arguing that the Secretary was without authority to promulgate them and that they were unnecessary and unreasonable. They also argued that HUD must show an actual conflict as the court required in <em>Kargman v. Sullivan, </em>552 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>F.2d 2 (1st Cir. 1977), despite a concession that the regulation actually conflicts with Boston\u2019s rent control.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The Secretary promulgated her regulations under the authority of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3535(d) (1976). That section gives the Secretary broad powers under the NHA to \u201cmake such rules and regulation as may be necessary to carry out [her] functions, powers, and duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, as stated earlier, Congress gave the Secretary broad administrative powers over each of the subsidized-insured programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">As this Circuit has noted before, the success of these federal programs \u201crequires a flexible exercise of administrative discretion.\u201d <em>Hahn v. Gottlieb, </em>430 F.2d 1243, 1246 (1st Cir. 1970). While I do not find an express provision in HUD\u2019s enabling legislation providing that the Secretary may preempt local rent control law, it is implicit in the statutory scheme. As other courts reviewing this problem have noted, the NHA, in addition to providing general authority to implement the Act, also requires that rents, charges and methods of operation of subsidized-insured housing be subject to HUD regulation. Note, <em>HUD preemption of Local Rent Control Ordinances </em>\u2014 Tenants <em>Entitled to Due Process Rights, </em>30 Rutgers L.Rev. 1025, 1044 (1977) (hereinafter <em>\u201cPreemption of Local Rent Control </em>\u201d). Federal regulation of rents can implement the goals of national housing policy by insuring the continued economic viability of federally subsidized-insured housing. Thus, the Secretary\u2019s decision, in light of Congress\u2019 delegation, is consistent with the NHA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Kargman v. Sullivan, </em>552 F.2d 2, 14 (1st Cir. 1977) (Campbell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">Plaintiffs also argued that the regulations were unreasonable and unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">In administering its subsidized and insured projects across the country, HUD has experienced substantial financial difficulties in projects subject to local rent control. Some 55% of the projects in Boston have suffered financial difficulty and had their insured mortgages assigned to HUD for insurance benefits. In New Jersey, sixteen projects in Newark, Atlantic City or Pleas-antville required mortgage modification, foreclosure or were in default. <em>See also 515 Associates v. Newark, </em>424 F.Supp. 984 (D.N.J.1977). These experiences and others led the Secretary to conclude that local rent control was a substantial factor in causing mortgage default in subsidized-insured housing. 40 Fed.Reg. 8189 (1977); <em>Preemption of Local Rent Control, supra </em>at 1044. HUD also determined that local rent control deterred private industry in further developing subsidized-insured housing. <em>See 515 Associates v. Newark, </em>424 F.Supp. at 991. Finally, the Secretary also examined the prejudicial effects of the local rent control regulations upon its housing projects. Judge Connor analyzed this reasoning in <em>Gramercy Spire Tenant\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Harris, </em>446 F.Supp. 814 (S.D.N.Y.1977). In finding these regulations a valid exercise of the Secretary\u2019s powers, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Prior to the adoption of the rent control regulation in its final form, the evidence available to HUD suggested that local rent control ordinances threatened, on occasion, seriously to undermine [HUD\u2019s interest in mortgagor\u2019s continuing solvency]. HUD was informed that annual increase percentages under local rent control regulations often \u201cbore no relationship to the actual costs incurred by a mortgagor in operating and maintaining a residential rental property,\u201d and, further, that applications for hardship increases by mortgagors often involved them in cumbersome and time-consuming procedures, with the result that even if an increase was approved, \u201cit was often too late to prevent the project from going into default\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 822; 40 Fed.Reg. 49319 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">On the basis of the evidence which HUD encountered and considered, I cannot find that the regulations promulgated to solve the mortgage default problem were either unnecessary or unreasonable. <em>Accord, Gramercy Spire Tenant\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Harris, supra; Argo v. Hills, </em>425 F.Supp. 151 (E.D.N.Y.1977), <em>aff\u2019d </em>578 F.2d 1366 (2d Cir. 1978); <em>515 Associates v. Newark, </em>424 F.Supp. 984 (D.N.J.1977); <em>Levin-Sanger-Orange v. Rent Leveling Board, </em>142 N.J.Super. 429, 434, 361 A.2d 616, 619 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Finally, plaintiffs argued that HUD was required to show an actual conflict between its regulations and Boston\u2019s rent control laws. While the court reached that result in <em>Kargman v. Sullivan, </em>552 F.2d 2 (1st Cir. 1977), both the <em>per curiam </em>and I have noted that the court specifically left open the question we face here where the regulation specifically preempts local law. Moreover, plaintiffs admitted that HUD\u2019s regulations purport to occupy the entire field of rent regulation for subsidized-insured housing. Thus, as I analyze <em>Free v. Bland, </em>369 U.S. 663, 82 S.Ct. 1089, 8 L.Ed.2d 180 (1962), once we have found the regulations to be validly promulgated, they preempt local law since they have the full force and effect of federal law. Consequently, we reach the same destination as the <em>per curiam </em>by a somewhat different route.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">The question of whether an actual conflict exists between federal and state laws is generally limited to those situations where the federal law fails to state its preemptive effect, e. <em>g., New York State Department of Social Services v. Dublino, </em>413 U.S. 405, 93 S.Ct. 2507, 37 L.Ed.2d 688 (1973), or Congress specifically directs an agency to adhere to state law in some instances but potential conflicts arise, e. <em>g., California v. United States, </em>438 U.S. 645, 98 S.Ct. 2985, 57 L.Ed.2d 1018 (1978). Neither situation is present here. Rather, the HUD regulations are clear in their intent to preempt local rent control laws. As <em>Jones v. Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 530-31, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 1312-13, 51 L.Ed.2d 604 (1977), relied on by the district court and <em>per cu-riam, </em>makes clear, an express preemption provision obviates the need to examine whether an actual conflict exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">Consequently, after thoroughly considering the relevant Supreme Court doctrine, I come to the same issue that we all reached in the <em>per curiam : </em>did the Secretary have the power to promulgate the regulations? Since we find that she did, they validly preempt conflicting local laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">Accordingly, for all the above reasons, I would affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\">. <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, id., </em>dealt with whether a California statute gauging the ripeness of avocados was constitutional insofar as it excluded federally approved Florida avocados from California. The California statute determined avocado maturity on the basis of oil content. Federal regulations applicable to Florida avocados made no distinction on the basis of oil content. Moreover, Florida avocados often do not meet the California standards until after maturity. Nevertheless, the California statute, the Court held, was not preempted because the two statutes did not actually conflict and there was no indication of a federal intent to occupy the field. <em>Id. </em>at 141, 83 S.Ct. at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\"><em>See also Bibb v.

Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 624, 93 S.Ct. 1854, 36 L.Ed.2d 547 (1973) (area of exclusive federal control).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\">. Another rule frequently entering into preemption cases is that where the federal government enters into a field traditionally occupied by the states, greater deference is given to state law. <em>See Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>435 U.S. 151, 98 S.Ct. 988, 55 L.Ed.2d 179 (1978); <em>Service v. Dulles, </em>354 U.S. 363, 388, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1165, 1 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1957); <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 1152, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947). Since HUD is regulating a landlord-tenant relationship, traditionally a matter of state concern, at first blush it appears that great deference should be provided state law with an increased burden upon defendants to show a federal intent to preempt. This case does not, however, deal with a traditional landlord-tenant relationship. Rather, because of a shortage in low and middle income rental housing, Congress has stimulated the private sector to provide the housing with which we are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Seemingly, plaintiffs would agree that if HUD owned and operated the projects local governments would be precluded from regulation absent federal permission, U.S.Const. art. IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 2; <em>Gibson v. Chouteau, </em>80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 92, 99, 20 L.Ed. 534 (1872). Likewise, these particular landlord-tenant relationships, while not involving complete federal ownership, contain significant incidents of ownership and involvement. <em>See Hahn v. Gottlieb, </em>430 F.2d 1243, 1247 n.5 (1st Cir. 1970); <em>Gramercy Spires Tenant\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Harris, </em>446 F.Supp. 814 (S.D.N.Y.1977). In fact, by definition, these landlord-tenant relationships would not exist but for the federal legislation. Thus, it does not appear that state law deserves special deference because the federal law is not impinging upon an area of traditional state involvement. <em>Cf. Nat\u2019l League of Cities v. Usery, </em>426 U.S. 833, 96 S.Ct. 2465, 49 L.Ed.2d 245 (1976); <em>New York State Dep\u2019t of Social Services v.

This decision that HUD\u2019s regulations are within the strictures of the NHA is further buttressed by the same holding of several other courts. Three district court decisions involving federally insured housing in New York and New Jersey held that 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 403.1-403.9 (1979) were a proper exercise of power under the NHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The first case to address this question was <em>515 Associates v. City of Newark, </em>424 F.Supp. 984 (D.N.J.1977). The projects under consideration were unable to meet their mortgage payments and HUD was required to pay. HUD resold the buildings and plaintiffs, who were unable to adjust the rentals as contemplated in the bid prospectus due to local rent control, sought a certificate of preemption. The district court laid out its three-part inquiry as follows: \u201c(1) Are the rules within the delegated authority? (2) Are the rules reasonable? (3) Were the rules issued pursuant to proper procedures?\u201d <em>Id </em>at 991. It went on to conclude that \u201cthe unambiguous language of the statute and the expressed purposes of the Act compel the conclusion that the regulations here at issue are properly within the rule-making authority granted to the Secretary.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">Similar results were reached in <em>Gramercy Spires Tenant\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Harris, </em>446 F.Supp. 814 (S.D.N.Y.1977) and <em>Argo v.

Axelrod Management Co., </em>471 F.Supp. 308 (S.D.N.Y.1979) stated \u201c[HUD has] congressionally delegated authority to promulgate 24 C.F.R. pt. 403 and that 24 C.F.R. pt. 403 takes precedence over local rent control laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
