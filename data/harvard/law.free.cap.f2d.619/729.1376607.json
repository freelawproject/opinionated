Bonnie Peske and other similarly situated recipients of grants under North Dakota\u2019s AFDC program (Peske) appeal from a district court judgment dismissing their complaint against the executive director and members of the Social Service Board of North Dakota (the Board). The district court determined that under <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, </em>441 U.S. 600, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979), it lacked subject matter jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>to hear Peske\u2019s claims. For reasons set forth below, we conclude that this determination was erroneous because insufficiently supported by appropriate findings. Accordingly, we vacate the district court judgment and remand the case for a jurisdictional determination under the standards set forth in <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 537-38 and 542-43, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 1379 and 1381-82, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">At the time this action was instituted, the Board employed an alternate month budgeting procedure to compute the amount of a recipient\u2019s grant under North Dakota\u2019s AFDC program.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alternate month budgeting means that variable income received in a given month and subsequently reported to the Board reduces the amount of a recipient\u2019s grant for the second month following the month in which the income was received.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For example, if an AFDC recipient earned an extra $100 in May, the Board would reduce the recipient\u2019s grant by a given amount in July.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Peske sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the Board\u2019s alternative month budgeting procedure. In her complaint Peske claimed that alternate month budgeting denied her equal protection of the law in violation of the fourteenth amendment. Peske based this claim on the budgeting procedure\u2019s allegedly arbitrary distinction between \u201cthose households which receive and report non-exempt earned income\u201d and \u201call other AFDC households.\u201d Peske further claimed that alternate month budgeting violated her fourteenth amendment right to due process by \u201cconclusively pre-sum[ing]\u201d income received in one month \u201cto be available to meet the needs of the recipient\u2019s household two months later.\u201d In addition, Peske alleged that alternate month budgeting was inconsistent with relevant provisions of the Social Security Act, specifically 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(7) and (a)(10) (1976), and with applicable federal and state regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">Defendants moved to dismiss Peske\u2019s complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), asserting her constitutional claims to be insubstantial. If that were true, defendants reasoned, then the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the remainder of Peske\u2019s claims. Defendants noted that Peske brought this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976) with federal jurisdiction asserted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) and (4) (1976). In <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, supra, </em>the Court held that jurisdiction under section 1343 does not encompass a claim that a state welfare regulation is invalid because it conflicts with the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Citing <em>Chapman, </em>the district court granted defendants\u2019 motion and dismissed Peske\u2019s complaint without considering the substantiality of her constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Peske concedes that neither her Social Security Act nor her state law claims gave the district court jurisdiction over her action. She argues, however, that given the substantiality of her constitutional claims, the district court could hear her Social Security Act and state law claims as a matter of pendent jurisdiction. <em>E. g., Hagans v. Lavine, supra, </em>415 U.S. at 536, 94 S.Ct. at 1378. <em>See Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, supra, </em>441 U.S. at 618 n.36, 99 S.Ct. at 1916 n.36; <em>id. </em>at 675, 99 S.Ct. at 1946 (Stewart, J., dissenting); <em>Her-weg v. Ray, </em>619 F.2d 1265, at 1269 (8th Cir. 1980) <em>(en banc) </em>(equally divided court<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>); <em>Oldham v. Ehrlich, </em>617 F.2d 163, at 168-169 (8th Cir. Mar. 12,1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The determinative jurisdictional question is therefore whether Peske\u2019s complaint alleged a substantial constitutional claim. In this context the Court has defined a substantial constitutional claim as one not \u201cessentially fictitious,\u201d \u201cwholly insubstantial,\u201d \u201cobviously without merit,\u201d or inescapably rendered frivolous by prior decisions. <em>Ha-gans v. Lavine, supra, </em>415 U.S. at 537, 538, 94 S.Ct. at 1379 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">We doubt whether even under this unexacting test Peske\u2019s due process claim can be deemed substantial. <em>See Oldham v. Ehrlich, supra, </em>at 167 n.6. However, given the district court\u2019s failure to consider the sub-stantiality of either of Peske\u2019s constitutional claims and the possible mootness of this case,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we decline the parties\u2019 respective invitations either to affirm or reverse the district court judgment on the record before us.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The district court judgment is vacated and the case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\">. After appellants began this suit, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare promulgated regulations requiring states to use one of three prescribed budgeting methods in administering their AFDC programs. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 233.21-233.29 (1979) (effective May 4, 1979). North Dakota subsequently amended its budgeting regulations. <em>See </em>N.D.A.C. \u00a7 75-02-0 1-05(9)(b) (amended effective Dec. 1, 1979). On remand the district court should determine whether these new regulations have mooted Peske\u2019s claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\">. The then-applicable North Dakota regulation provided in part: \u201cFluctuating earned income shall be budgeted so as to be deducted from the aid to families with dependent children grant the second month following the month in which the income was earned.\u201d N.D.A.C. \u00a7 75-02-01-05(9)(b) (1979). Federal regulations classify this procedure as a form of \u201cretrospective budgeting.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.21(b) (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b790-12\">. Appellants are AFDC recipients whose grants were temporarily reduced under North Dakota\u2019s alternate month budgeting procedure. Alternate month budgeting may, however, also work to increase a recipient\u2019s grant. If income received in a given month is less than that received in the previous month, the recipient\u2019s grant in the second month following will be in a greater amount than the next previous month\u2019s grant. The combination of income and grant must meet the sum which North Dakota regulations stipulate as the minimum level of income necessary to satisfy basic requirements for a decent standard of living. N.D.A.C. \u00a7 75-02-01-05(2)(b) (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b790-13\">. A Social Security Act claim would itself vest jurisdiction in a federal court if the amount in controversy exceeded $10,000. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) (1976). In the present suit, however, Peske seeks no damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b791-21\">.
