After a public hearing, the School Board adopted the policy statement and rules recommended by the committee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-10\">The appellants brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the policy statement and the rules adopted by the School Board violate the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The district court reviewed the practices of the Sioux Falls School District and found that the 1977 Christmas program that was the subject of the initial complaints \u201cexceeded the boundaries of what is constitutionally permissible under the Establishment Clause.\u201d The court also found, however, that programs similar to the 1977 Christmas program would not be permitted under the new School Board guidelines and concluded that the new rules, if properly administered and narrowly construed, would not run afoul of the First Amendment. <em>Florey v. Sioux Falls Sch. Dist. 49-5, </em>464 F.Supp. 911 (D.S.D.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-16\">The appellants\u2019 claim is that the School Board policy and rules are unconstitutional both on their face and as applied. At the time of the district court proceeding, however, no holiday season had passed with the rules in effect. Consequently, little evidence was presented on the actual implementation of the rules, and the district court made no findings in that regard. The record does contain some evidence of the interpretation given the rules by school administrators with respect to the Christmas holiday. We may consider that evidence, as well as the district court\u2019s observations on the 1977 Christmas program, in discerning the meaning of the rules, but because of the absence of district court findings on their application, we limit our review to the constitutionality of the rules on their face.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-18\">The close relationship between religion and American history and culture has frequently been recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the First Amendment to the Constitution explicitly prescribes the relationship between religion and government: \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>ently straightforward prohibition can rarely be applied to a given situation with ease, however. As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201ctotal separation [between church and state] is not possible in an absolute sense.\u201d <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602, 614, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2112, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971). As a result, the Court has developed a three-part test for determining when certain governmental activity falls within the constitutional boundaries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-4\">First, the [activity] must have a secular * * * purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion, * * * finally, the [activity] must not foster \u201can excessive governmental entanglement with religion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 612-613, 91 S.Ct. at 2111 (quoting <em>Walz v. Tax Commission, </em>397 U.S. 664, 674, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 1414, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-6\">A. <em>Purpose.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-7\">The appellants\u2019 contention that the School Board\u2019s adoption of the policy and rules was motivated by religious considerations is unsupportable. The record shows that the citizens\u2019 committee was formed and the rules drawn up in response to complaints that Christmas observances in some of the schools in the district contained religious exercises. The motivation behind the rules, therefore, was simply to ensure that no religious exercise was a part of officially sanctioned school activities. This conclusion is supported by the opening words of the policy statement: \u201cIt is accepted that no religious belief or non-belief should be promoted by the school district or its employees, and none should be disparaged.\u201d The statement goes on to affirmatively declare the purpose behind the rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-8\">The Sioux Falls School District recognizes that one of its educational goals is to advance the students\u2019 knowledge and appreciation of the role that our religious heritage has played in the social, cultural and historical development of civilization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQI\">The express language of the rules also leads to the conclusion that they were not promulgated with the intent to serve a religious purpose. Rule 1 limits observation of holidays to those that have both a religious <em>and </em>a secular basis. Solely religious holidays may not be observed. Rule 3 provides that music, art, literature and drama having a religious theme or basis may be included in the school curriculum only if \u201cpresented in a prudent and objective manner and as a traditional part of the cultural and religious heritage of the particular holiday.\u201d Similarly, Rule 4 permits the use of religious symbols only as \u201ca teaching aid or resource\u201d and only if \u201csuch symbols are displayed as an example of the cultural and religious heritage of the holiday and are temporary in nature.\u201d We view the thrust of these rules to be the advancement of the students\u2019 knowledge of society\u2019s cultural and religious heritage, as well as the provision of an opportunity for students to perform a full range of music, poetry and drama that is likely to be of interest to the students and their audience.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-11\">This purpose is quite different from the express and implied intent of the states of New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland in the Supreme Court \u201cSchool Prayer Cases.\u201d First, we emphasize the different character of the activities involved in those cases. The challenged law in <em>Engel v. Vitale, </em>370 U.S. 421, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1962), provided for the recitation of a state-authored prayer at the start of each school day. The Supreme Court had no difficulty characterizing this practice as a religious activity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-12\">There can, of course, be no doubt that New York\u2019s program of daily classroom invocation of God\u2019s blessings as prescribed in the Regents\u2019 prayer is a religious activity. It is a solemn avowal of divine faith and supplication for the blessings of the Almighty. The nature of such a prayer has always been religious * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 424-425, 82 S.Ct. at 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-15\">Since prayer, by its very nature, is undeniably a religious exercise, the conclusion is inescapable that the advancement of reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>gious goals was the purpose sought by the school officials in <em>Engel. </em>Indeed, the state officials published the prayer in a document entitled \u201cStatement on Moral and Spiritual Training in the Schools.\u201d There can be little doubt that their intent was to promote \u201cspiritual\u201d ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">Similarly, in <em>Ablngton School Dist. v. Schempp, </em>374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963), the Supreme Court emphasized the \u201cpervading religious character of the ceremony\u201d involving daily Bible reading in the schools. <em>Id. </em>at 224, 83 S.Ct. at 1572. Again, when a state intentionally sets up a system that by its essential nature serves a religious function, one can only conclude that the advancement of religion is the desired goal. As explained more fully in the next section of this opinion, however, the programs permitted under the Sioux Falls rules are not unquestionably religious in nature. Thus, we are not required to infer that the Sioux Falls School Board intended to advance religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">Moreover, in the Supreme Court prayer cases, compulsory religious exercises were imposed on all schools by state law. The Sioux Falls rules, by contrast, do not require the individual schools to have holiday activities; they merely permit the inclusion of certain programs in the curriculum in the event that classroom teachers feel that such programs would enhance their overall instructional plan. The rules are an attempt to delineate the scope of permissible activity within the district, not to mandate a statewide program of religious inculcation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">The appellants argue that the \u201clegislative\u201d history of Rule 1 compels the conclusion that the rule was designed to advance religion. The basis for this argument is a proposed amendment to Rule 1 introduced before both the citizens\u2019 committee and the School Board. The proposed amendment would have added to Rule 1 the following words: \u201cSuch observances shall be limited to secular aspects of these holidays.\u201d The amendment was defeated by both the citizens\u2019 committee and the School Board. The School Board rejected the proposal, appellants assert in their brief, \u201cbecause it wanted to allow schools to observe the religious basis of holidays.\u201d This, they maintain, is an unconstitutional purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-9\">We do not agree that the rejection of the proposed amendment renders the School Board rules constitutionally infirm. First, the record is devoid of evidence indicating the reasons the proposal was rejected. A number of possibilities suggest themselves, including the ambiguity of the proposed addition. The appellants\u2019 assertion that the rejection was due to the School Board\u2019s desire \u201cto observe the religious basis of holidays\u201d is thus unsupported. Furthermore, even if the appellants\u2019 contention were correct, the Constitution does not necessarily forbid the use of materials that have a \u201creligious basis.\u201d Government involvement in an activity of unquestionably religious origin does not contravene the Establishment Clause if its \u201cpresent purpose and effect\u201d is secular. <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 445, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1115, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961). Thus, although the rules permit the schools to observe holidays that have both a secular and a religious basis, we need not conclude that the School Board acted with unconstitutional motives. To the contrary, we agree with the district court\u2019s finding that the School Board did not adopt the policy statement and rules for the purpose of advancing or inhibiting religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-10\">B. <em>Effect.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-11\">The appellants contend that, notwithstanding the actual intent of the School Board, the \u201cprincipal or primary effect\u201d of the rules is to either advance or inhibit religion. <em>See Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 612, 91 S.Ct. at 2111. We cannot agree. The First Amendment does not forbid all mention of religion in public schools; it is the <em>advancement </em>or <em>inhibition </em>of religion that is prohibited. <em>Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, </em>413 U.S. 756, 788, 93 S.Ct. 2955, 2973, 37 L.Ed.2d 948 (1973). Hence, the <em>study </em>of religion is not forbidden \u201cwhen presented objectively as part of a secular program of education.\u201d <em>Abington School Dist. v. Schempp, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>374 U.S. at 225, 83 S.Ct. at 1573. We view the term \u201cstudy\u201d to include more than mere classroom instruction; public performance may be a legitimate part of secular study. This does not mean, of course, that religious ceremonies can be performed in the public schools under the guise of \u201cstudy.\u201d It does mean, however, that when the primary purpose served by a given school activity is secular, that activity is not made unconstitutional by the inclusion of some religious content. As the district court noted in its discussion of Rule 3, \u201c[t]o allow students <em>only </em>to study and <em>not </em>to perform [religious art, literature and music when] such works * * * have developed an independent secular and artistic significance would give students a truncated view of our culture.\u201d 464 F.Supp. at 916 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">The appellants assert, however, that something more than secular study is authorized by the Sioux Falls rules. They point to Rule 1, which states that holidays that have a religious and secular basis may be \u201cobserved\u201d in the public schools. \u201cObservation,\u201d they maintain, necessarily connotes religious ceremony or exercise and the rule thus has the impermissible effect of advancing religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">A review of the policy statement and rules as a whole leads us to conclude that the appellants\u2019 emphasis of the word \u201cobserve\u201d is misplaced and their interpretation of it incorrect. First, as noted in section II.A. of this opinion, the rules must be read together with the policy statement of the School Board. That statement makes it clear that religion is to be neither promoted nor disparaged in the Sioux Falls schools. Consequently, any ambiguity in the meaning of the word \u201cobserved\u201d must be resolved in favor of promoting that policy. Moreover, the only evidence presented on the definition of the word \u201cobserved\u201d was the testimony of the School Superintendent, Dr. John Harris. Dr. Harris explained that \u201cobserved\u201d means \u201cthat programs with content relating to both the secular and religious basis of [the holiday] could be performed, could be presented in the school.\u201d (Transcript at 65.) As noted earlier, we view performance or presentation to be a legitimate and important part of \u201cstudy\u201d in the public schools. Thus, the use of the word \u201cobserve\u201d does not mean that the rules have the effect of advancing religion so long as the religious content of the programs is \u201cpresented objectively as part of a secular program of education.\u201d <em>Abington School Dist. v. Schempp, supra, </em>374 U.S. at 225, 83 S.Ct. at 1573.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-8\">To determine whether religion is advanced or inhibited by the rules, then, we must look to see if a genuine \u201csecular program of education\u201d is furthered by the rules. It is unquestioned that public school students may be taught about the customs and cultural heritage of the United States and other countries. This is the principal effect of the rules. They allow the presentation of material that, although of religious origin, has taken on an independent meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-9\">The district court expressly found that much of the art, literature and music associated with traditional holidays, particularly Christmas, has \u201cacquired a significance which is no longer confined to the religious sphere of life. It has become integrated into our national culture and heritage.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, the rules guarantee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>that all material used has secular or cultural significance: Only holidays with both religious and secular bases may be observed; music, art, literature and drama may be included in the curriculum only if presented in a prudent and objective manner and only as a part of the cultural and religious heritage of the holiday; and religious symbols may be used only as a teaching aid or resource and only if they are displayed as a part of the cultural and religious heritage of the holiday and are temporary in nature. Since all programs and materials authorized by the rules must deal with the secular or cultural basis or heritage of the holidays and since the materials must be presented in a prudent and objective manner and symbols used as a teaching aid, the advancement of a \u201csecular program of education,\u201d and not of religion, is the primary effect of the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\"> The appellants argue that, despite the secular benefits, inclusion of material with a religious theme, basis or heritage invalidates the rules. In support of this assertion, the appellants point out that several of appellants\u2019 witnesses, all of them ordained clergymen, testified that the singing of Christmas carols would have some religious effect on them. But the appellants misread the test laid down by the Supreme Court. As noted, <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra, </em>permits a given activity if \u201cits <em>principal </em>or <em>primary </em>effect [is] one that neither advances nor inhibits religion.\u201d 403 U.S. at 612, 91 S.Ct. at 2111 (emphasis added). It would be literally impossible to develop a public school curriculum that did not in some way affect the religious or nonreligious sensibilities of some of the students or their parents. School administrators should, of course, be sensitive to the religious beliefs or disbeliefs of their constituents and should attempt to avoid conflict,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but they need not and should not sacrifice the quality of the students\u2019 education. They need only ensure that the primary effect of the school\u2019s policy is secular. The district court\u2019s finding that they have done this by the challenged rules is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-10\">The distinction between an activity that primarily advances religion and one that falls within permissible constitutional limits may be illustrated by comparing the 1977 kindergarten Christmas program found by the district court to be an impermissible religious activity and the programs authorized by the new School Board guidelines. The 1977 program at one of the elementary schools contained a segment that, in the words of the district court, \u201cwas replete with religious content including a responsive discourse between the teacher and the class entitled, \u2018The Beginners Christmas Quiz.\u2019 \u201d The \u201cQuiz\u201d read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>Teacher: Of whom did heav\u2019nly angels sing,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-4\">And news about His birthday bring?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-5\">Class: Jesus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-6\">Teacher: Now, can you name the little town</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-7\">Where they the Baby Jesus found?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-8\">Class: Bethlehem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-9\">Teacher: Where had they made a little bed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-10\">For Christ, the blessed Saviour\u2019s head?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-11\">Class: In a manger in a cattle stall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-12\">Teacher: What is the day we celebrate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-13\">As birthday of this One so great?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-14\">Class: Christmas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1378-15\">This \u201cQuiz\u201d and other similar activities constituted, the district court found, \u201ca predominately religious activity\u201d which exceeded constitutional bounds. We agree with this characterization and with the district court\u2019s observation that similar programs would be prohibited by the new rules. The administration of religious training is properly in the domain of the family and church. The First Amendment prohibits public schools from serving that function.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-16\">C. <em>Entanglement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-17\">The appellants contend that the new guidelines in Sioux Falls unconstitutionally \u201cfoster \u2018an excessive government entanglement with religion.' \u201d <em>See Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 613, 91 S.Ct. at 2111. All the Supreme Court cases cited by the appellants in support of the \u201centanglement\u201d test deal with governmental aid to sectarian institutions, not with the permissible scope of activity in the public schools. In a \u201cparochaid\u201d case, the court is presented with a situation in which the state is involving itself with a concededly religious activity or institution. The real danger is the potential for state repression of such institutions. In the present case, by contrast, the school district is called upon to determine whether a given activity is religious. This type of decision inheres in every curriculum choice and would be faced by school administrators and teachers even if the rules did not exist. Indeed, the rules are guidelines designed to aid in the deci-sionmaking process. Rather than entangling the schools in religion, the rules provide the means to ensure that the district steers clear of religious exercises. We think the district court was correct in finding that the new rules do not unconstitutionally entangle the Sioux Falls school district in religion or religious institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-20\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-21\">The appellants also contend that implementation of the policy and rules of the Sioux Falls School Board should be enjoined because the rules violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. This contention does not withstand scrutiny.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-22\">The public schools are not required to delete from the curriculum all materials that may offend any religious sensibility. As Mr. Justice Jackson noted in <em>McCollum v. Board of Education, </em>333 U.S. 203, 235, 68 S.Ct. 461, 477, 92 L.Ed. 649 (1948),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-23\">Authorities list 256 separate and substantial religious bodies to exist in the continental United States. Each of them * * has as good a right as this plaintiff to demand that the courts compel the schools to sift out of their teaching everything inconsistent with its doctrines. If we are to eliminate everything that is objectionable to any of these warring sects or inconsistent with any of their doctrines, we will leave public education in shreds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1378-24\">These inevitable conflicts with the individual beliefs of some students or their, parents, in the absence of an Establishment Clause violation, do not necessarily require the prohibition of a school activity. On the other hand, forcing any person to participate in an activity that offends his religious or nonreligious beliefs will generally contra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>vene the Free Exercise Clause, even without an Establishment Clause violation. <em>See Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972). In this case, however, the Sioux Falls School Board recognized that problem and expressly provided that students may be excused from activities authorized by the rules if they so choose.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">We recognize that this opinion affirming the district court will not resolve for all times, places or circumstances the question of when Christmas carols, or other music or drama having religious themes, can be sung or performed by students in elementary and secondary public schools without offending the First Amendment. The constitutionality of any particular school activity conducted pursuant to the rules, in association with any particular holiday, cannot be determined unless and until there is a specific challenge, supported by evidence, to the school district\u2019s implementation of the rules. We simply hold, on the basis of the record before us, that the policy and rules adopted by the Sioux Falls Board of Education, when read in the light of the district court\u2019s holding that segments of the 1977 Christmas program at one of the elementary schools were impermissible, are not viola-tive of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-9\">I. POLICY</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-10\">\n<em>Recognition of Religious Beliefs and Customs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-11\">It is accepted that no religious belief or non-belief should be promoted by the school district or its employees, and none should be disparaged. Instead, the school district should encourage all students and staff members to appreciate and be tolerant of each other\u2019s religious views. The school district should utilize its opportunity to foster understanding and mutual respect among students and parents, whether it involves race, culture, economic background or religious beliefs. In that spirit of tolerance, students and staff members should be excused from participating in practices which are contrary to their religious beliefs unless there are clear issues of overriding concern that would prevent it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-15\">The Sioux Falls School District recognizes that one of its educational goals is to advance the students\u2019 knowledge and appreciation of the role that our religious heritage has played in the social, cultural and historical development of civilization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-16\">II. RULES</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-17\">Observance <em>of Religious Holidays</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-18\">The practice of the Sioux Falls School District shall be as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-19\">1. The several holidays throughout the year which have a religious and a secular basis may be observed in the public schools.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-20\">2. The historical and contemporary values and the origin of religious holidays may be explained in an unbiased and objective manner without sectarian indoctrination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-21\">3.

The singing of \u201cChristmas carols\u201d appears to be a primary focal point of appellants\u2019 objections to the rules. These carols had their origin in England, France, Germany and other European countries. The first carols written in the United States appeared in the Nineteenth Century, but European carols were sung far earlier. The earliest printed collection of carols was published in 1521. Many of the popular carols of today, including <em>Adeste Fideles, Hark the Herald Angels Sing </em>and <em>Joy to the World, </em>were written in the early part of the Eighteenth Century. The most popular of all, <em>Silent Night, Holy Night, </em>was probably composed in Austria in 1818 and first published in 1840. Carols were banned for a period in the New England Colonies by the Puritans, but they have been sung in homes, schools, churches and public and private gathering places during tjie Christmas season in every section of the United States since that time. Today, carols are sung with regularity on public and commercial television and are played on public address systems in offices, manufacturing plants and retail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>stores in every city and village. <em>See </em>T. Coffin, The Book of Christmas Folklore (1973); R. Myers, Celebrations, The Complete Book of American Holidays; 5 Encyclopedia Americana 693 (International ed. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-7\">Many carols have a religious theme; some do not. As in the centuries gone by, some persons object to the singing of carols with a religious basis in any place but the church or home because they feel that to do so debases religion; others have the same objection but because they feel it enhances religion. We take no part in this argument, it being entirely clear to us that carols have achieved a cultural significance that justifies their being sung in the public schools of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, if done in accordance with the policy and rules adopted by that school district.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1377-8\">. In keeping with the goal of avoiding conflict with students\u2019 religious beliefs, the Sioux Falls policy statement includes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1377-11\">The school district should utilize its opportunity to foster understanding and mutual respect among students and parents, whether it involves race, culture, economic background or religious beliefs. In that spirit of tolerance, students and staff members should be excused from participating in practices which are contrary to their religious beliefs unless there are clear issues of overriding concern that would prevent it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1377-12\">The school district may, of course, excuse students from participating in this or any other school activity. But excusing students from participation does not solve Establishment Clause problems, <em>Abington School Dist. v.

This is not a financial aid case; rather, this is a variation of the school prayer <em>(Engel v. Vitale, </em>370 U.S. 421, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1962)) and Bible reading <em>(School District </em>v. <em>Schempp, </em>374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963) <em>(Schempp)) </em>cases. Preparing and presenting Christmas assemblies is not a religious activity in the obvious sense that reciting a nondenominational prayer or reading from the Bible are religious activities. Prayer is \u201ca solemn avowal of divine faith and supplication for the blessings of the Almighty.\u201d <em>Engel v. Vitale, supra, </em>370 U.S. at 424, 82 S.Ct. at 1264. Similarly, reading from the Bible is a religious exercise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Schempp, supra, </em>374 U.S. at 224, 83 S.Ct. at 1572. When compared with school prayers or Bible reading, Christmas assemblies, and in particular the singing of Christmas carols, appear ambiguous in character. Nonetheless, I am of the opinion that the preparation and presentation of Christmas assemblies in the public schools violates the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">\u201cThe problem, like many problems in constitutional law, is one of degree.\u201d <em>Zorach v. Clauson, </em>343 U.S. 306, 314, 72 S.Ct. 679, 684, 96 L.Ed. 954 (1952). I quite agree with the majority that singing Christmas carols in the public schools is not necessarily a violation of the Establishment Clause.

As noted by the majority, the Christmas carol is a music form which is undoubtedly worthy of study. At 1316-1317 n.5. Nothing in my analysis should be taken to mean that the study of Christmas carols and other Christmas traditions, \u201cwhen presented objectively as part of a secular program of education, may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Schempp, supra, </em>374 U.S. at 225, 83 S.Ct. at 1573. \u201cMusic without sacred music, architecture minus the cathedral, or painting without the scriptural themes would be eccentric and incomplete, even from a secular point of view.\u201d <em>Illinois ex rel.

Similarly, western European history would be incomplete without the Crusades, the Inquisition or the Reformation, as would early American history (and the history of the Establishment Clause itself, <em>see Nyquist, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 770 n. 28, 93 S.Ct. at 2964) without the Puritans, the Quakers or the Transcendentalists. To return to the metaphor of music, nothing in my analysis would limit a music curriculum to fugues and minuets, <em>see Lemon v.

The difficulty of defining the boundary with precision inheres in a paradox central to our scheme of liberty.

At 1313. At the center of the controversy in the present case is the Christmas assembly. At oral argument counsel for the school district and for appellants supplied a few additional details about the Christmas assemblies. The other holiday observances were not discussed. The contents of the Christmas holiday observances varies from teacher to teacher; the complexity of the material depends upon the grade level; the lower grades tend to have class parties while the upper grades tend to have school assemblies; the assemblies are typically concerts which feature traditional Christmas music and songs, including Christmas carols such as \u201cSilent Night\u201d and \u201cO Come All Ye Faithful\u201d; the assemblies are usually held during the evening at the particular school; assembly attendance is not compulsory and students could excuse themselves; assembly activity is not graded but assembly preparation is part of the general classroom work and may involve as much as two months of the school year (this time is, of course, not devoted entirely to assembly preparation). This kind of Christmas assembly is a traditional feature in many public schools and in many communities across the country. However, widespread observance or \u201cmere longevity of custom does not in itself insulate a practice from constitutional scrutiny.\u201d <em>Fox v. City of Los Angeles, </em>22 Cal. App.3d 792, 587 P.2d 663, 671, 150 Cal.Rptr. 867, 875 (1978) (banc) (Bird, C. J., concurring) (cross displayed in city hall windows at Easter enjoined as violation of Establishment Clause in state constitution), <em>citing </em>70 Cal.App.3d 885, 139 Cal.Rptr. 180,184 (App. 1977). \u201c[Historical acceptance without more [does] not alone [suffice], as \u2018no one acquires a vested or protected right in violation of the Constitution by long use.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nyquist, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 792, 93 S.Ct. at 2975, <em>citing Walz v. Tax Commissioner, supra, </em>397 U.S. at 678, 90 S.Ct. at 1416.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-9\">II. <em>The Secular Legislative Purpose Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1383-10\">First, I am not totally persuaded that the policy and rules reflect a clearly secular legislative purpose. It cannot be overlooked that complaints about the religious content of several Christmas assemblies prompted the formation of the citizens\u2019 advisory committee and the adoption of the policy and rules by the school board. Against this background I am inclined to view the school board\u2019s rejection of the proposed \u201csecular aspects only\u201d amendment as indicative of a purpose to permit more than the study (including performance when appropriate) of religion, subjects with religious content or significance and religious traditions. <em>Cf. Meltzer v. Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number><em>Education, </em>577 F.2d 311, 317 (5th Cir. 1978) (banc) (Brown, C. J., dissenting in part) (majority upheld guidelines for distribution of religious literature in public schools against Establishment Clause attack), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1089, 99 S.Ct. 872, 59 L.Ed.2d 56 (1979). In addition, the rules refer exclusively to \u201creligious holidays.\u201d No doubt this singular orientation reflects the non-existence of agnostic or atheistic occasions. The rules do not address the observance of <em>non-religious </em>holidays, such as Veterans Day, Arbor Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, the birthdays of various presidents or civic leaders (i. e. the controversy over whether Martin Luther King\u2019s birthday should be a holiday). To the extent the policy and rules focus only on religious holidays, I would find the policy and rules unconstitutionally operate as a preference of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">Like the majority, I too accept \u201cthe thrust of these rules to be the advancement of the students\u2019 knowledge of society\u2019s cultural and religious heritage.\u201d At 1314. The opening words of the policy statement takes the commendable position that \u201cno religious belief or non-belief should be promoted by the school district or its employees, and none should be disparaged.\u201d At 1319 (Appendix). I do not deny that knowledge of society\u2019s cultural and religious heritage and the encouragement of tolerance (religious and other kinds) and mutual understanding are admirable secular goals. However, I find several problems in the relationship between the rules and these secular goals. First, I do not understand how the <em>observance </em>of religious holidays promotes these secular goals. Moreover, I do not understand how the observance of particular religious holidays <em>(i. e. </em>Christian and Jewish holidays; <em>but see </em>note 4 <em>infra), </em>but not others (/. e., Ramadan, North American Indian holidays, Hindu holidays) encourages student knowledge and appreciation of religious and cultural diversity. For example, the observance of the holidays of religions less familiar to most American public school children than either Christian or Jewish holidays would seem more likely to increase student knowledge and promote religious tolerance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\">Second, even assuming the observance of religious holidays does advance these secular goals, those secular goals can be achieved in public education without the \u201cobservance\u201d of religious holidays. As Mr. Justice Brennan observed in <em>Schempp,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV4\"><em>Torcaso </em>and the <em>Sunday Law Cases </em>forbid the use of religious means to achieve secular ends where nonreligious means will suffice. . . . While I do not question the judgment of experienced educators that the challenged practices [Bible reading] may well achieve valuable secular ends [fostering harmony and tolerance among the pupils, enhancing the authority of the teacher, and inspiring better discipline], it seems to me that the State acts unconstitutionally if it either sets about to attain even indirectly religious ends by religious means, or if it uses religious means to serve secular ends where secular means would suffice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-7\">374 U.S. at 281, 83 S.Ct. at 1603. Here the school district seeks to accomplish secular goals by religious means, the observance of religious holidays. Surely the school district can advance student knowledge and tolerance of religious diversity as effectively by <em>non </em>religious means, that is, through the study of comparative religions or as part of the history or social studies curriculum. In any case, the observance of religious holidays as a means of accomplishing the secular goals of knowledge and tolerance clearly discriminates against non-belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-8\">Third, even if the secular goals of student knowledge and religious tolerance are promoted by religious means and nonreligious means are inadequate, why should the rules limit such observance only to those holidays which have \u201ca religious and a secular basis\u201d? Why require these holidays to have a secular basis at all? Ostensibly it is the religious basis of these particular holidays (and the different religions thus represented) which is critical to the promotion of student knowledge and tolerance of religious diversity. In this context, a particular holiday\u2019s <em>secular </em>basis is irrelevant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>Nonetheless, the inclusion of a secular basis requirement does balance and diffuse the religious basis requirement and thereby appears, at first glance, to shield the rules from constitutional attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">Finally, the rules state that several holidays have \u201ca religious and a secular basis\u201d but fail to explain what is meant by those terms. The rules identify such holidays as Christmas, Easter, Passover, Chanukah, Valentine\u2019s Day, St. Patrick\u2019s Day, Thanksgiving, and Halloween. On the one hand, I find it very difficult to articulate exactly what is meant by \u201csecular basis\u201d and to discern the secular basis of some of the holidays (i. e. Easter). Secular basis presumably refers to something other than religiously neutral symbols (i. e. snowmen and jingle bells instead of Nativity scenes and the Star of Bethlehem), association with majoritarian (Christian) cultural traditions, commercialization, or observance contemporaneous with Christian religious holidays.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1385-6\">On the other hand, I find it equally difficult to ascertain what is meant by \u201creligious basis,\u201d particularly as applied to holidays like Valentine\u2019s Day. Valentine\u2019s Day does have a certain degree of secular (and commercial) significance as an occasion for the exchange of expressions of love and affection. However, the religious origin of Valentine\u2019s Day can only be characterized as remote (it is the name day of a Roman Christian martyr of the second century AD) and its contemporary religious significance minimal. The same observation is more or less true of St. Patrick\u2019s Day and Halloween, particularly insofar as those holidays are \u201ccelebrated\u201d today. Furthermore, the \u201creligious basis\u201d of the holidays listed in the rules varies rather markedly, for example, from Valentine\u2019s Day to Easter. In fact, Thanksgiving arguably seems to me the one holiday listed in the rules which has both a discernible secular and religious basis; Thanksgiving commemorates an event of some significance (perhaps apocryphal) in early American colonial history and is a national holiday set aside for giving thanks to God. Thanksgiving is a federal legal public holiday. <em>See 5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-9\">Christmas is especially difficult. Despite its many and diverse secular manifestations, Christmas remains an event of immense and undiminished significance to Christians: the celebration of the birth of Christ. <em>Cf. McGowan v. Maryland, supra, </em>366 U.S. at 431-53, 81 S.Ct. at 1108-1119 (Sunday closing laws upheld as establishing uniform day-of-rest and recreation with only remote or incidental religious benefit). Unlike Thanksgiving, Christmas has no <em>inherent </em>secular basis as the anniversary of an American historical event. Christmas has nonetheless acquired an undeniable secular importance and general acceptance as a holiday season over the years. As noted in <em>Allen v. Morton, </em>161 U.S.App.D.C. 239, 495 F.2d 65 (1973), which involved an Establishment Clause challenge to the annual \u201cChristmas Pageant of Peace\u201d celebrated on federal parkland adjacent to the White House that included the display of a life-size Nativity scene or \u201ccreche,\u201d Christmas holiday observances are often associated with the laudable secular theme of expressing a national desire for \u201cPeace on Earth, Goodwill Toward Men.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69. Christmas is also a federal legal public holiday, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(a), and is observed directly and indirectly in many government activities: for example, the President lights a national Christmas tree, the post office issues commemorative stamps for the Christmas season which feature artwork with Christian themes, local governments display Christmas trees and Christmas decorations on public buildings, city streets and city squares.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-10\">Nonetheless, what is constitutionally unobjectionable for adults or in a non-public school context, <em>but see Fox v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>587 P.2d at 666, 150 Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>Rptr. at 870, may be prohibited for public school children. <em>See, e. g., Tilton v. Richardson, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 685, 91 S.Ct. at 2099 (Burger, C. J.) (distinction between elementary and secondary education and university education); <em>Schempp, supra, </em>374 U.S. at 294-300, 83 S.Ct. at 1612 (Brennan, J., concurring) (\u201cOf special significance to this distinction is the fact that we are here usually dealing with adults, not with impressionable children as in the public schools.\u201d). To the extent the school district seeks to justify the <em>observance </em>of the Christmas holiday as an occasion to advance the students\u2019 knowledge of cultural and religious knowledge, diversity, and tolerance or to promote peace among mankind,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> these objectives could be accomplished by the <em>observance </em>of a more neutral \u201choliday,\u201d for example United Nations Day. \u201cSuch substitutes would, I think, be unsatisfactory or inadequate only to the extent that the present activities do in fact serve religious goals.\u201d <em>Schempp, supra, </em>374 U.S. at 281, 83 S.Ct. at 1602-1603 (Brennan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">Even assuming the school board acted with a secular legislative purpose, \u201cthe propriety of a legislature\u2019s purposes may not immunize from further scrutiny a law which either has a primary effect that advances religion, or which fosters excessive entanglements between Church and State.\u201d <em>Nyquist, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 774, 93 S.Ct. at 2966.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-5\">III. <em>The Primary Effect Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"AP_T\">Second, do the rules, particularly to the extent they permit the preparation and presentation of Christmas assemblies, have a principal or primary effect which either advances or inhibits religion? Unlike the majority, I think they do. Christmas assemblies have a substantial impact, both in favor of one religion and against other religions and nonbelief, on the school district employees, the students, the parents and relatives of the students and the community-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-9\">When a [school district] so openly promotes the religious meaning of one religion\u2019s holidays, the benefit reaped by that religion and the disadvantage suffered by other religions is obvious. Those persons who do not share those holidays are relegated to the status of outsiders by their own government; those persons who do observe those holidays can take pleasure in seeing . . . their belief given official sanction and special status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1386-10\"><em>Fox v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>587 P.2d at 670, 150 Cal.Rptr. at 874 (Bird, C. J., concurring). By sponsoring Christmas assemblies which feature programs of traditional Christmas music, including Christmas carols, only during the Christmas season, the school district has in effect endorsed the beliefs of one religion. The school district has placed \u201cthe power, prestige and financial support of government\u201d behind the Christmas holiday. <em>See Engel v. Vitale, supra, </em>370 U.S. at 430-31, 82 S.Ct. at 1267. The school district devotes considerable faculty time to the preparation and presentation of these assemblies; students expend considerable classroom time to the same end.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-11\">\u201cThe unconstitutionality of this practice crystallizes when we consider <em>what </em>is being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>displayed <em>where </em>and <em>when.\" Fox v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>587 P.2d at 670, 150 Cal.Rptr. at 874 (Bird, C. J., concurring) (emphasis in original). Viewed in context, I do not think Christmas assemblies can accurately be described as merely arts festivals or choral concerts. These assemblies contain material that is unmistakably Christmas-oriented and are held only during the Christmas season, not in October or April. The programs of Christmas assemblies may include songs, poems or dramatic presentations, all of which may have artistic merit, but the subject and particularly the timing of these assemblies are no less revealing than the term \u201cChristmas assembly.\u201d In contrast, Christmas carols presented <em>as a music form </em>could be performed at any time during the school year, not just at Christmas. Even though generally performed during the evening (when the school buildings are not being used educationally), assembly preparations are conducted in public school buildings, during the school day, by public school teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">It is not enough that the challenged action has a principal or primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion. <em>Compare Lemon, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 612, 91 S.Ct. at 2111, <em>with Nyquist, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 783-84 &amp; n.39, 93 S.Ct. at 2971. The majority identifies the principal effect of the rules to be education about the customs and cultural heritage of the United States and other countries. Even accepting this characterization (I would emphasize instead the musical or dramatic impact of the Christmas assemblies) of the principal secular effect, this principal secular effect is not separable from the religious effect. Moreover, the religious effect is not \u201cremote, indirect or incidental\u201d to the secular effect. <em>See generally </em>L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 840 (1978). In <em>Nyquist, </em>the Supreme Court cautioned against using the principal or primary effect test to make \u201cmetaphysical\u201d distinctions between primary and secondary effects. 413 U.S. at 783-84 n.39, 93 S.Ct. at 2970-2971. The Supreme Court stated that \u201c[o]ur cases simply do not support the notion that a law found to have a \u2018primary\u2019 effect to promote some legitimate end under the State\u2019s police power is immune from further examination to ascertain whether it also has the direct and immediate effect of advancing religion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the primary effect test forbids any government action that has a substantial religious impact. <em>See Meltzer v. Board of Education, supra, </em>577 F.2d at 318 (Brown, C. J., dissenting in part) (outlines a non-discriminatory impact principle), <em>citing Gillette v. United States, </em>401 U.S. 437, 450, 91 S.Ct. 828, 836, 28 L.Ed.2d 168 (1971); <em>Allen v. Morton, supra, </em>495 F.2d at 87 (Leventhal, J., concurring); <em>Fox v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>587 P.2d at 673 &amp; n.11, 150 Cal.Rptr. at 877 (Bird, C. J., concurring). As discussed above, I would find that Christmas assemblies do have a substantial religious (or non-secular) effect, an effect which cannot be \u201coffset\u201d by a primary secular effect under the formulation of the primary effect test set forth in <em>Nyquist. </em>I do not dispute that Christmas assemblies have secular effects (cultural education, promotion of religious diversity, musical and dramatic value); however, \u201c[sjuch secular objectives, no matter how desirable and irrespective of whether judges might possess sufficiently sensitive calipers to ascertain whether the secular effects outweigh the sectarian benefits, cannot serve today any more than they could 200 years ago to justify such a direct and substantial advancement of religion.\u201d 413 U.S. at 785 n.39, 93 S.Ct. at 2971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-7\">IV. <em>The Excessive Entanglement Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1387-8\">Third, I think the rules necessarily foster an excessive entanglement of the school district with religion. As noted by the majority, the rules call upon the school district to determine whether a given activity is religious. At 1318.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-9\">The [school board] may also find itself effectively defining religion or censoring the content of religious materials. . . . [T]he secular public school system could become the focal point for the competition of all religious beliefs [and nonbe-lief]. The courts and other state officials would be under a continuing duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>make certain that one faith was not in effect being endorsed and promoted by [the observance of religious holidays]. Indeed, it is ironic that the more fairly and objectively the guidelines are enforced, the more the school board will become immersed in serious religious judgments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\"><em>Meltzer </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>577 F.2d at 319 (Brown, C. J., dissenting. in part). \u201cA comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance will inevitably be required to ensure that [the rules] are obeyed and the First Amendment otherwise respected.\u201d <em>Lemon, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 619, 91 S.Ct. at 2114. Of course, it is precisely this type of \u201cexcessive and enduring entanglement between state and church,\u201d <em>id., </em>which is proscribed by the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-5\">[T]he Establishment Clause embodied the Framers\u2019 conclusion that government and religion have discrete interests which are mutually best served when each avoids too close a proximity to the other. It is not only the nonbeliever who fears the injection of sectarian doctrines and controversies into the civil polity, but in as high degree it is the devout believer who fears the secularization of a creed which becomes too deeply involved with and dependent upon the government. It has rightly been said of the history of the Establishment Clause that \u201cour tradition of civil liberty rests not only on the secularism of a Thomas Jefferson but also on the fervent sectarianism ... of a Roger Williams.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-6\"><em>Schempp, supra, </em>374 U.S. at 259-60, 83 S.Ct. at 1591 (Brennan, J., concurring) (footnotes omitted), <em>citing </em>P. Freund, The Supreme Court of the United States 84 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-7\">In addition to administrative entanglement, the rules also enmesh the school district in another type of entanglement first articulated in <em>Lemon, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 623, 91 S.Ct. at 2116, that is, \u201cthe potential for political divisiveness related to religious belief and practice.\u201d <em>See also Meek v. Pit-tenger, supra, </em>421 U.S. at 372, 95 S.Ct. at 1766; <em>Nyquist, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 797-98, 93 S.Ct. at 2978; <em>see generally </em>L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 866 (1978). As in the case of financial aid to parochial schools, proponents in favor of religious holiday observances, opponents against religious holiday observances and advocates for specific religious (or non-religious) holidays will engage in considerable political activity either to elect school board members whose views are compatible with their own views or to influence the school board.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-9\">It would be unrealistic to ignore the fact that many people confronted with issues of this kind will find their votes aligned with their faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-10\">Ordinarily political debate and division, however vigorous or even partisan, are normal and healthy manifestations of our democratic system of government, but political division along religious lines was one of the principal evils against which the First Amendment was intended to protect. The potential divisiveness of such conflict is a threat to the normal political process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-11\"><em>Lemon, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 622, 91 S.Ct. at 2116 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-12\">V. <em>The Free Exercise Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"agg-dedup-0\">Appellants also argue that the rules on the observance of religious holidays violate the Free Exercise Clause. In view of my Establishment Clause analysis, I do not reach this issue. However, I do not agree with the majority that the availability of excusal from participation in activities authorized under the rules refutes the Free Exercise challenge. At 1318-1319.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-13\">[T]he excusal procedure itself necessarily operates in such a way as to infringe the rights of free exercise of those children who wish to be excused. [The Supreme Court] held in <em>Barnette </em>and <em>Torcaso, </em>respectively, that a State may require neither public school students nor candidates for an office of public trust to profess beliefs offensive to religious principles. By the same token the State could not constitutionally require a student to profess publicly his disbelief as the prerequisite to the exercise of his constitutional right of abstention. . . . [B]y requir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>ing what is tantamount in the eyes of teachers and schoolmates to a profession of disbelief, or at least of nonconformity, the procedure may well deter those children who do not wish to participate for any reason based upon the dictates of conscience from exercising an indisputably constitutional right to be excused. Thus the exeusal provision in its operation subjects them to a cruel dilemma. In consequence, even devout children may well avoid claiming their right and simply continue to participate in exercises distasteful to them because of an understandable reluctance to be stigmatized as atheists or nonconformists simply on the basis of their request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\"><em>Schempp, supra, </em>374 U.S. at 288-90, 83 S.Ct. at 1606-1607 (Brennan, J., concurring) (citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">VI. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1389-7\">Of course, \u201cevery vestige, however slight, of cooperation or accommodation between religion and government\u201d is <em>not </em>unconstitutional.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 294, 83 S.Ct. at 1609; <em>cf. Sherbert v. Verner, </em>374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963) (free exercise clause required accommodation of state unemployment compensation benefits program for member of Seventh Day Adventist Church); <em>Zorach v. Clauson, supra, </em>343 U.S. at 312, 72 S.Ct. at 683 (released time for religious instruction off school premises). There is nothing unconstitutional about the use of religious subjects or materials in public schools <em>as long as it is presented as part of a secular program of education. </em>However, to the extent the policy and rules adopted by the Sioux Falls School District authorizes the observance of religious holidays, particularly Christmas assemblies, in a manner other than as part of a secular program of education, I would hold the policy and rules violate the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-10\">The above analysis may be regarded by some as hypersensitive or even antireli-gious. It is not. Judicial scrutiny of the relationship between religion and government must be particularly scrupulous in the context of the public school.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-11\">The secular public school did not imply indifference to the basic role of religion in the life of the people, nor rejection of religious education as a means of fostering it. The claims of religion were not minimized by refusing to make the public schools agencies for their assertion. The nonsectarian or secular public school was the means of reconciling freedom in general with religious freedom. The sharp confinement of the public schools to secular education was a recognition of the need of a democratic society to educate its children, insofar as the State undertook to do so, in an atmosphere free from pressures in a realm in which pressures are most resisted and where conflicts are most easily and most bitterly engendered. Designed to serve as perhaps the most powerful agency for promoting cohesion among a heterogeneous democratic people, the public school must keep scrupulously free from entanglement in the strife of sects. The preservation of the community from divisive conflicts, of Government from irreconcilable pressures by religious groups, of religion from censorship and coercion however subtly exercised, requires strict confinement of the State to instruction other than religious, leaving to the individual\u2019s church and home, indoctrination in the faith of his choice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number><em>McCollum, supra, </em>333 U.S. at 216-17, 68 S.Ct. at 468 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A72\">It is implicit in the history and character of American public education that the public schools serve a uniquely <em>public </em>function: the training of American citizens in an atmosphere free of parochial, divisive, or separatist influences of any sort \u2014 an atmosphere in which children may assimilate a heritage common to all American groups and religions.

Clauson, </em>343 U.S. 306, 313, 72 S.Ct. 679, 684, 96 L.Ed. 954, deep feelings are aroused when aspects of that relationship are claimed to violate the injunction of the First Amendment that government may make \u201cno law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .\u201d Americans regard the public schools as a most vital civic institution for the preservation of a democratic system of government.
