Because of the allegation that appellant had been previously convicted of violating section 1325, the indictment charged him with a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the prior conviction upon which the felony indictment was predicated was infirm because the magistrate had violated Rule 11(f), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in accepting appellant\u2019s guilty plea. The trial judge denied appellant\u2019s motion, and the case was tried upon stipulated facts. Defendant was found guilty and sentenced to two years in custody, which sentence was suspended on the condition that appellant serve 180 days in a jail-type or treatment institution, and that appellant be on probation for a period of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">The issues on this appeal are whether the prior conviction is in fact infirm for the failure to comply with Rule 11(f), and, if so, whether that conviction can be collaterally attacked in this proceeding, wherein the indictment for a felony violation of section 1325 is predicated upon the prior conviction. Although the appeal is ostensibly one from the order denying the motion to dismiss the indictment, appellant concedes that even if the prior conviction were expunged, he would stand guilty, on the stipulated facts, of the lesser included misdemeanor offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-14\">We must affirm. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Timmreck, </em>441 U.S. 780, 99 S.Ct. 2085, 60 L.Ed.2d 634 (1979), effectively forecloses a defendant\u2019s right to attack collaterally a conviction in which a Rule 11 violation occurred. While <em>Timmreck </em>involved an attack under 28 U.S.C. section 2255, the Court\u2019s reasoning is equally applicable here: \u201ccollateral relief is not available when all that is shown is a failure to comply with the formal requirements of the Rule.\u201d (441 U.S. at 785, 99 S.Ct. at 2088, citing <em>Hill v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 429, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962).) The result is that a conviction is not made invalid by a Rule 11 violation unless that violation is asserted on direct appeal. In this case, as in <em>Timmreck, </em>that was not done. Accordingly, we must affirm the conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-10\">. \u00a7 1325.
