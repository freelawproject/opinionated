The district court entered its order on July 27, 1978 after adopting the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation to deny relief on petitioner\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-20\">The district court\u2019s decision was made upon a review of the record and without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing. The record included the habeas corpus petition and the magistrate\u2019s report. The magistrate\u2019s report was likewise made without an evi-dentiary hearing. Clark has timely appealed to this Court from the district court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to this appeal, Clark proceeded pro se on his federal habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-21\">This Court will make no attempt to rule on the merits of Clark\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. This Court will, however, vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for an evidentiary hearing because we cannot conclusively determine the accuracy of petitioner\u2019s allegations of failure of his trial counsel to confer with him or to prepare and investigate adequately possible defenses prior to trial. <em>Gaines v. Hopper, </em>575 F.2d 1147, 1149 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Venable v. Neil, </em>463 F.2d 1167, 1168 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>see also note, </em>93 Harv. L.Rev. 752 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-22\">The record establishes that petitioner Clark has exhausted his state remedies on the issues of his counsel\u2019s failure to confer with him and his counsel\u2019s failure to prepare adequately prior to . trial. Both of Clark\u2019s pro se state habeas corpus petitions were denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In both of these instances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the denial was without benefit of an evi-dentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The history of this case bears recitation. A Louisiana grand jury indicted Clark for second degree murder. At trial, which was to a jury, the defendant Clark took the stand and testified that he shot the victim in a bar during a dispute that arose during a card game. According to Clark, the dispute arose not with the victim, Maurice Fletcher, but with another participant in the card game. Clark told the jury that before the first dispute was resolved Maurice Fletcher intervened. Clark had never met Fletcher before that evening. Clark related to the jury that Fletcher, \u201creached and grabbed me and pulled me off the floor, right up in his face, and told me he was going to kill me.\u201d Clark continued, \u201cI finally pulled away from him and he shoved me and I went back and I seen him go for his pocket and I knew that the man was-going to kill me. I don\u2019t even remember getting my gun out of my pocket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The witnesses at trial who were present during the card game also testified that the victim grabbed Clark first. One state witness testified that when Fletcher picked Clark up off the floor, he brought him close to him and said something, but that he did not hear what Fletcher said to Clark. Another witness corroborated Clark\u2019s statement that Fletcher told Clark that he was going to kill him. This corroboration testimony was by a surprise witness subpoenaed by the trial attorney for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">At the close of all testimony, the state trial judge charged the jury on the relevant law, including the possibility of imposing a verdict on manslaughter. Under Louisiana law applicable at the time of Clark\u2019s jury trial, proof that the defendant\u2019s actions were the result of either sudden passion or heat of blood, under provocation sufficient to deprive an average person of his self control, would support only a conviction for manslaughter. In contrast, second degree murder required proof of a specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm. La.Rev. Stat. 14:30.1 to .31.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">The jury returned its verdict of guilty on the charge of murder in the second degree. On January 16, 1975, the trial judge sentenced Clark to imprisonment for life, without benefit of probation or parole for twenty years. A jury conviction on manslaughter would have limited Clark\u2019s punishment to a term less than life and could not have resulted in such a serious loss of the possibility of probation or parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Petitioner Clark is entitled by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to trial free from \u201cfundamental unfairness,\u201d including any unfairness that would stem from blatantly incompetent counsel. <em>Fitzgerald v. Estelle, </em>505 F.2d 1334, 1336 (5th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>422 U.S. 1011, 95 S.Ct. 2663, 45 L.Ed.2d 675 (1975). Clark is also entitled by the right to counsel provision of the sixth amendment to reasonably effective assistance of counsel. <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>588 F.2d 1010, 1015-16 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Gray, </em>565 F.2d 881 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 955, 98 S.Ct. 1587, 55 L.Ed.2d 807 (1978). The sixth amendment right to reasonably effective counsel does not mean \u201cerrorless counsel\u201d or counsel judged ineffective by hindsight.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">A full and fair hearing on the state habeas corpus petition can often resolve serious allegations of ineffectiveness of counsel. <em>E. g., Akridge v. Hopper, </em>545 F.2d 457, 458 (5th Cir. 1977). Records of state habeas corpus hearings may negate allegations that counsel failed to make an informed evaluation of possible defenses or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>failed to conduct meaningful discussions of the case with his client. <em>Dixon v. Balkcom, </em>614 F.2d 1067 (5th Cir. 1980). The district court should hold a full hearing on any issues not resolved because of an insufficient record. Ultimately, the final determination of whether or not counsel rendered reasonably effective assistance of counsel requires an inquiry into counsel\u2019s actual performance. That review must be based upon an adequate record, and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">[a] review of Fifth Circuit law indicates that this Court\u2019s methodology involves-an inquiry into the actual performance of counsel in conducting the defense and a determination whether reasonably effective assistance was rendered based on the totality of the circumstances and the entire record. This Circuit does not blindly accept speculative and inconcrete claims of \u201cwhat might have been if.\u201d If an appellant can point to specific examples of ineffectiveness, we have not hesitated to grant a new trial or hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><em>United States v. Gray, supra, </em>565 F.2d at 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In this case there has never been an evidentiary hearing before any court at any time. That deficiency requires this Court to search a wholly inadequate record. Such search reveals that the only indication of trial counsel\u2019s pretrial preparation and consultation with his client was in his calling one surprise witness during trial who corroborated Clark\u2019s defense of self-defense. That witness was the only witness not already subpoenaed by the state, and he was subpoenaed on December 6, 1974 by trial counsel. Trial was set for December 9, 1974, and the subpoena was requested after the state trial judge denied trial counsel\u2019s motion to strike his name as petitioner\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In disposing of petitioner\u2019s allegations of ineffective pretrial investigation and inadequate consultation, the magistrate focused primarily upon that portion of the record indicating trial counsel\u2019s production of favorable testimony from the one surprise witness. This one aspect of trial counsel\u2019s representation is not dispositive of the serious allegations concerning pretrial preparation raised in the petition in this case. <em>See Gaines v. Hopper, supra, </em>575 F.2d at 1148-49; <em>Friedman v. United States, supra, </em>588 F.2d at 1016-17; <em>Bell v. Georgia, </em>554 F.2d 1360, 1361 (5th Cir. 1977). Other portions of the limited record support negative inferences. They indicate that Clark\u2019s trial counsel filed no discovery motions; filed no pretrial motions on defensive issues; subpoenaed only one witness for trial and the subpoena for that witness was belated; and failed to obtain a transcript of the testimony before the grand jury. This Court is not, therefore, faced with no more than an unsupported claim that counsel spent only a short time with his client in preparation for trial. <em>Howard v. Beto, </em>466 F.2d 1356 (5th Cir. 1972). Nor does this case involve no more than conclusory assertions which might well justify dismissing a petition pri- or to an evidentiary hearing. <em>Friedman v. United States, supra, </em>588 F.2d at 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Based, therefore, on the inadequate record before this Court, it cannot be concluded that Clark\u2019s claims of ineffective pretrial investigation and inadequate consultation are without substance. The order denying habeas corpus relief is vacated and this cause is remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on the issues of inadequate pretrial consultation and preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-16\">. The state trial judge appointed two attorneys to represent petitioner on the charge of second degree murder. One week before jury trial both attorneys moved to strike their names as counsel. The state court excused only one of the two attorneys. Petitioner\u2019s allegations of ineffectiveness concern only the representation provided by the other appointed attorney whose motion was denied by the state court. That attorney represented petitioner prior to and during his state jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-24\">. The District Court issued a certificate of probable cause for this appeal pursuant to Rule 22(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b492-25\">. Prior to denial of state collateral relief, the Supreme Court of Louisiana affirmed Clark\u2019s conviction and sentence on an out-of-time appeal. <em>State of Louisiana v. Clark, </em>332 So.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>236 (La.1976). On that appeal, Clark was represented by a third state appointed attorney since he had asserted that his trial counsel had not complied with his request to file a timely appeal. The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed Clark\u2019s conviction after noting that trial counsel had not properly preserved the alleged errors for review since he had failed to make timely objections or request other corrective measures such as a judicial declaration of mistrial or admonition of the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
