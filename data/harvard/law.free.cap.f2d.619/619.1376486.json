At the time the deficiency notices were mailed to Appellants, the period for assessment of an income tax deficiency for 1963 against the Moores, and for 1963 and 1964 against the Blue Ridge Transportation Company had expired unless fraudulent returns were filed. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(c)(1). Similarly, the period for assessment of a deficiency for 1964 against the Moore\u2019s had expired unless a fraudulent return was filed or unless gross income was understated by 25 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-21\">Appellants appeal from an Order of the United States Tax Court, assessing deficiencies and penalties for Appellants\u2019 filing of fraudulent income tax returns, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-22\">Both parties agree that the Commissioner has the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that Appellants intentionally designed to evade a tax believed to be owing. Fraud with intent to evade a tax may be shown by circumstantial evidence, including, <em>inter alia, </em>evidence of false bookkeeping entries and conduct calculated to conceal sources of income and to avoid the making of normal business records. <em>Spies v. United States, </em>317 U.S. 492, 494, 63 S.Ct. 364, 365, 87 L.Ed. 418 (1943). Based upon our review of the record and the Tax Court\u2019s findings of fact, we believe that the Tax Court\u2019s holding that the Appellants filed fraudulent income tax returns was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-23\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Tax Court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
