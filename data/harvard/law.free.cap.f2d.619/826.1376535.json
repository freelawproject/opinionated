We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-20\">The patternmakers involved in this litigation work at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Until 1976, the patternmakers were compensated under various \u201cspecial\u201d wage schedules for federally employed blue-collar workers. The essential difference between Federal Wage Schedule \u201cspecial rates,\u201d such as those paid the patternmakers, and FWS \u201cregular rates\u201d is that the former may be set within a wide range giving agencies flexibility to adjust to market conditions in attracting qualified personnel, and the latter must fall within statutorily-defined percentages. The Office of Personnel Management, formerly the Civil Service Commission,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in cooperation with the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>(FPRAC),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> administers the program of special wage schedules. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5343(c)(3)(B) and (e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">On December 11,1975, the Department of Defense requested authority to cancel the special rates of the Puget Sound shipyard patternmakers. The FPRAC approved the cancellation request, and, in April 1976, the CSC converted the patternmakers\u2019 compensation to the regular wage schedule. The position of patternmaker was rated WS-14 on a 15 level schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The Department of Defense requested cancellation of the special rates because they had become obsolete and use of regular FWS rates would result in a wage increase for the patternmakers. The pattern-makers now claim that any increase in wages resulting from the conversion to regular rates is only temporary and that, in the long run, they would be better compensated under the special wage rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">The patternmakers contend that the CSC\u2019s procedure in converting them from special to general wage schedules is contrary to both the express language and underlying legislative intent of the relevant statutes, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5343-5349. Specifically, they contend that; (1) the lead agency (the Department of Defense) is required to conduct a wage survey before switching its prevailing rate employees (the patternmak-ers) from a special to a general wage schedule; (2) the patternmakers are entitled to an administrative appeal from the lead agency\u2019s decision to convert their wage schedules; and (3) the patternmakers are entitled to compensation under the special wage schedule that cannot be altered or amended without due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">The patternmakers cite three provisions as supporting their claim that the Department of Defense was required to conduct a wage survey prior to converting from special to regular wage schedules. They rely first on 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5343(b) which provides, in relevant part, that the Civil Service Commission \u201cshall schedule full-scale wage surveys every 2 years and shall schedule interim surveys to be conducted between each 2 consecutive full-scale wage surveys.\u201d The purpose of these surveys is to collect data on which wage schedules and rates, including special surveys and rates, may be based.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">The patternmakers also cite a regulation implementing \u00a7 5343 which states: \u201cWhen there is more than one type of wage schedule in the wage area, the agency shall make a separate determination for each wage schedule.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 532.505(b) (1979). Finally, the patternmakers rely on statutory language requiring that, as prevailing rate employees, they be included as participants in the wage survey process. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5343(c)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Implicit in this requirement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>the patternmakers assert, is a condition that special rate employees be consulted before any conversion to regular rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">We begin by looking to the plain meaning of the provisions on which the patternmakers rely. <em>See Greyhound Corp. v. Mount Hood Stages, Inc., </em>437 U.S. 322, 330, 98 S.Ct. 2370, 2375, 57 L.Ed.2d 239 (1977). The language of these provisions indicates that the Civil Service Commission, with the participation of special and general wage employees, is to conduct surveys of wage rates in the appropriate wage areas at least once every two years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, nothing in the statutory language compels the Civil Service Commission to conduct surveys before it converts special wage schedules to general wage schedules.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor does the legislative history cited by the patternmakers support reading such a requirement into the statutes. We conclude that Congress did not intend the statutory survey requirements to apply to the conversion of wage schedules.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The patternmakers next contend that they are entitled to an administrative appeal of the Civil Service Commission\u2019s decision to convert the special wage schedule to the general wage schedule. They base this contention on 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5346(c) which allows employees to appeal the CSC\u2019s assignment of positions to occupations and grades.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5343, the Civil Service Commission may establish a job grading system and assign wage grades to blue-collar jobs in that system.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In assigning a wage grade to a particular blue-collar position, the lead agency must consider the level of skill required by the job, the degree of responsibility the work entails, the job\u2019s physical demands, and relevant working conditions, as well as the compensation paid for comparable work by other agencies and private employers. <em>See </em>Federal Personnel Manual, Chapter 532, subchapter 6-5a(l)(b), at 532-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">Once a blue-collar job is assigned to a particular wage grade under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5346(c), aggrieved employees may petition the Commission for a review of their job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>classifications. The Commission is required to investigate and decide such complaints.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The right of appeal conferred by \u00a7 5346(c) is triggered when prevailing rate employees are dissatisfied with the wage level assigned to their blue-collar positions. <em>Cf. Ward v. Campbell, </em>610 F.2d 231 (5th Cir. 1980), (review of CSC determination that lead agency had assigned proper wage grade to electrical lineman position). Here, however, the patternmakers do not contend that their work has been assigned the wrong wage grade. They claim, instead, that they are entitled to appeal the cancellation of the special schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Nothing in the language of \u00a7 5346 supports the patternmakers\u2019 claim. The statute describes review of agency action \u201cplacing [a] position in an occupation and grade for pay purposes,\u201d not of decisions to convert compensation schedules. Furthermore, the patternmakers cite no legislative commentary implicitly recognizing the right of appeal they seek. Section 5346(c) does not entitle employees to appeal conversion from special to general rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The patternmakers claim that an entitlement to compensation under the special schedules is a constitutionally protected property interest which cannot be altered without affording a right of prior hearing or subsequent review.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">In evaluating this sort of due proces claim, we have traditionally followed the two step inquiry defined in <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). First, is the interest asserted of the sort that is protected by the Fifth Amendment? And second, if the interest is protected, what sort of process is constitutionally due? <em>See, e. g., Moore v. Johnson, </em>582 F.2d 1228 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Hai-mowitz v. University of Nevada, </em>579 F.2d 526, 527 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">The patternmakers have no property interest in the continuation of special rate compensation. The nature of the interest in the rate schedule is determined by the statutes conferring the benefit and by the regulations and provisions under which it is administered. <em>See Perry v. Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 599-603, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2698-2700, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). Here, nothing in the statutes creates an entitlement in the patternmakers to have wages remain at a fixed level. Wages can go down as well as up as conditions change. And nothing in the Defense Department\u2019s administration of the special rates would have justified a reasonable expectation by the patternmakers that special rates could not be revoked following CSC\u2019s consultation with FRPAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">Because the CSC\u2019s actions in converting the patternmakers\u2019 compensation from special to general schedules did not deprive the patternmakers of a property interest, there was no denial of due process. <em>See Arnett v. Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134, 153, 154, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 1643, 1644, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-21\">.
