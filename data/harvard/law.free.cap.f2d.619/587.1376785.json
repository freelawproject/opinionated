Anderson. The Commissioner claimed certain stock of the Anderson Music Company should be included in the gross estate of the decedent at its value at the time of Anderson\u2019s death; appellants assert the stock was more properly valued at $650 per share, the sum established in a purchase agreement dated January 29, 1965, between the trustee of a revocable trust, which the decedent established on December 1, 1964, and the two sons of the decedent and an employee of Anderson Music Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">After a rehearing, the Tax Court, in an opinion by Judge Theodore Tannenwald, Jr., dated July 26, 1977, P-H Memo TC, 177-237, held the evidence established that the revocation of the <em>inter vivos </em>trust terminated the February 1, 1965 buy/sell, agreement. Therefore, the agreement was not in effect at the decedent\u2019s death and the stock was properly valued at its fair market value on the date of the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Upon a careful review, the court is not persuaded that any Michigan law which the appellants cite compels a different result. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth by the Tax Court in its second opinion, filed July 26, 1977,</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">IT IS ORDERED that the decision of the Tax Court be and it is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
