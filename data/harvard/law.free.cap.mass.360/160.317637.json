The plaintiffs own land in the \u201cWest Wareham annexation\u201d of the Wareham Fire District (the district). See St. 1907, c. 178 (fn. 2, <em>infra). </em>West Wareham was added to the district by vote of the district at its 1966 annual meeting. At the annual district meeting held on March 11, 1968, the district accepted G. L. c. 40, \u00a7\u00a7 42G-42I.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>In 1967, the district engaged engineers to prepare plans for supplying water to the West Wareham. annexation and later made appropriations, to be paid for by borrowings, for acquiring land for, and constructing, a standpipe and for laying mains. The water commissioners <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were \u201cauthorized to take all action necessary to carry out these projects.\u201d The work began in July, 1967, and was completed about February 1, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">On July 2, 1968, the water commissioners adopted an order, relating to the completed extension of the system to West Wareham, in part as follows: \u201cThat the [district\u2019s] water system ... be extended . . . over certain streets and ways which are located within the . . . [d]istrict . . . that by reason thereof the area . . . along and about said streets and ways will receive a benefit or advantage other than the general advantage to the community known as the . . . [district, and that the betterments are to be assessed in the amounts respectively estimated below. . . . The estimated cost of the improvement is $299,251.53. On the attached sheets the persons liable to assessment . . . the locations of the parcels to be assessed . . . and the estimated amounts of the assessments are listed.\u201d Notice of the order was recorded in the Plymouth County registry of deeds on July 25, 1968, and amended hsts were recorded on October 11, 1968. About September 20, 1968, the assessors of Wareham notified each landowner in the West <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Wareham annexation of the amounts of the betterment assessments and of their right to request apportionment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> About October 15, 1968, the tax collector mailed a bill to each such landowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The plaintiffs, by their bill filed December 27, 1968, sought declaratory relief concerning the validity of the assessments, and whether valid liens thereby were imposed on their properties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the bill was brought, St. 1969, c. 407, was enacted by the Legislature <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and approved on June 10, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">On July 28, 1969, the trial judge ruled that the betterment assessments and liens would become valid when St. 1969, c. 407, became effective.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> From a final decree to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>this effect, the plaintiffs appeal. There was no request for a report of material facts. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">1. The work, the cost of which is the subject of the betterment assessments, was completed about February 1, 1968. The provisions of G. L. c. 40, \u00a7\u00a7 42G-42I, were not accepted (see <em>Brucato </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>338 Mass. 612, 614-615) by the district until March 11, 1968. There is no allegation, finding, or evidence that the district thereafter \u201cprovide[d] by\u201d (see \u00a7 42G, <em>supra, </em>fn. 1, at point [A]) any \u201cby-law or vote for the levy of special assessments to meet . . . the cost <em>thereafter </em>incurred of laying pipes in public and private ways\u201d (emphasis supplied) as authorized by \u00a7 42G, or that any vote to \u201cprovide\u201d (see \u00a7 42G, fn. 1, <em>supra, </em>at point [B]) for use of the procedures set forth in \u00a7 42H was adopted after the district accepted that section on March 11, 1968.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No order for imposing betterment assessments for the project appears to have been promulgated either by the district or by the water commissioners until the latter, on July 2, 1968, adopted the order, already quoted, and recorded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">This order related to a project already completed, so the order was not made at the time when the commissioners \u201c determine[d] to lay water pipes,\u201d as required by the first sentence of \u00a7 421. Because \u00a7 42G (and probably also \u00a7 42H, and [by reference to \u00a7 42G] \u00a7 421) related only to \u201ccost thereafter incurred,\u201d the situation was not, on July 2, 1968, one where \u201cassessments may be made under said sections for the construction of such improvement\u201d (see \u00a7 421, fn. 1, <em>supra, </em>at point [C]). Also the recording (on July 23, 1968) of the order of July 2, 1968, may not satisfy the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>quirement of \u00a7 421 that it be recorded \u201cforthwith.\u201d There may also have been failure to comply with the procedural requirements of G. L. c. 80, \u00a7 1 (as amended through St. 1933, c. 254, \u00a7 62) and \u00a7 2 (as amended through St. 1962, c. 234). See <em>Union St. Ry. </em>v. <em>Mayor of New Bedford, </em>253 Mass. 304, 312-313. These procedural requirements, so far as they related to apportionment, division, reassessment, abatement, collection, and interest, were incorporated by reference by c. 40, \u00a7 421 (see fn. 1, <em>supra, </em>at point [D]). These delays and failures doubtless led the commissioners (see fn. 5) to seek the 1969 legislation (c. 407).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">2. Before the 1969 statute became effective, the district had not effectively acted under c. 40, \u00a7\u00a7 42G-42I, at least in the respects noted above. It thus is necessary to consider whether St. 1969, c. 407, cured these defects. We assume, without deciding, that c. 407, \u00a7 2 (fn. 5, <em>supra), </em>adequately and specifically validated any lateness in the recording of orders, plans, estimates, and assessments, so far as required under c. 80, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, and c. 40, \u00a7 421. Section 1 of the 1969 statute, however, does not use apt language to cure such defects, arising under c. 40, \u00a7\u00a7 42G and 42H (neither of which is mentioned in c. 407, \u00a7 1), as fa) failure of the district to adopt a vote or by-law providing for levying betterment assessments, (b) failure to \u201cprovide\u201d for the methods of assessment discussed in \u00a7 42H, and (c) the circumstance that at least \u00a7\u00a7 42G and 42H in terms apply only to projects <em>thereafter </em>undertaken, and then only if so provided in a district vote (or votes) in addition to and after the vote accepting the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">A validating, curative statute, which \u201cmay affect personal or property rights [here liability of particular land to betterment assessments and liens] . . . should be precise and clear.\u201d See <em>Loriol </em>v. <em>Keene, </em>343 Mass, 358, 362; <em>Opinion of the Justices, post, </em>894, 898. The meager language of \u00a7 1 does not seem to us broad enough to cover the deficiencies in the district's purported actions and its applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>tian of c. 40, \u00a7\u00a7 42G and 42H, to a project already completed when the district accepted these sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Because, in any event, c. 407, \u00a7 1, does not cure the defects in the district\u2019s action under c. 40, \u00a7\u00a7 42G and 42H, we need not decide (and intend no suggestion) whether that chapter, applicable only to a fire district wholly within the town of Wareham, was \u201can act in relation to . . . towns\u201d adopted without compliance with pertinent (but somewhat ambiguous) provisions (especially \u00a7 8) of the so called Home Rule Amendment, art. 89 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth, or whether any such compliance was required. See <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>356 Mass. 775, 788-791; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>357 Mass. 831, 834-835. See also <em>Marshal House, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rent Review S Grievance Bd. of Brookline, </em>357 Mass. 709, 719-720; 1967 Senate Doc. No. 1547, pp. 24-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">3. The district contends that the assessments may be sustained under G. L. c. 80, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, and that these sections in effect provide an alternative to the provisions of c. 40, \u00a7\u00a7 42G-42I. Chapter 40, \u00a7 421 (see fn. 1, at point [D]) does incorporate by reference the procedural methods of dealing with betterments contained in c. 80. In this, \u00a7 421 is similar to a number of other provisions of the General Laws. See c. 80A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 15 (alternative method of eminent domain); c. 82, \u00a7 12 (highways, benefits may be assessed); c. 83, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 26, 28 (sewers, drains, and sidewalks); c. 85, \u00a7 6 (snow removal); c. 111, \u00a7 136 (drainage of wet lands); c. 161, \u00a7\u00a7 78-80 (street railway changes). In these instances, the authority for assessing betterments appears to arise elsewhere than in c. 80, \u00a7 1, so that c. 80 provides only the procedure for betterment assessments and not the. basic authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Chapter 80 arises from a codification of betterment statutes (see Preliminary Report of the Commissioners to Consolidate and Arrange the General Laws, p. 220 et seq.) made in 1918 during the compilation of the General Laws. The same report recommended revision of the eminent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>domain statutes (see pp. 3-53). Chapter 80, \u00a7 1, now reads, in relevant portions, substantially as it did when recommended in 1918: \u201cWhenever a limited and determinable area receives benefit . . . other than the general advantage to the community, from a public improvement <em>made by or in accordance with the formal vote or order of a board of officers </em>of the . . . district, <em>and such order states that betterments are to be assessed for the improvement, </em>such board shall within six months after the completion of the improvement determine the value of such benefit ... to the land within such area and assess upon each parcel thereof a proportionate share of the cost of such improvement, and shall include in such cost <em>all damages awarded therefor under </em>. . . [c. 79]; but no such assessment shall exceed the amount of such adjudged benefit . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). The provisions which now constitute G. L. c. 80 obviously are closely related to the suggested revision (in the same report, p. 3 et seq.) of the eminent domain laws. Section 1 of the latter suggested revision is in essentially the form of what is now G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These statutes, on their face and in the light of their simultaneous recommendation, strongly suggest that \u201cthe formal vote or order\u201d mentioned in c. 80, \u00a7 1, has reference principally to an eminent domain taking order under c. 79, \u00a7 1 (fn. 8), which must make specific provision whether betterments are to be assessed if the taking is one for which such an assessment is permissible, although other types of votes and orders, initiating or laying out a public improvement, may also be covered. See <em>Folan </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>259 Mass. 347, 348-350.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Even if, standing alone, the language of c. 80, \u00a7 1, may seem to have broader application, we think that it does not provide an alternative basic authorization for the assessment of betterments, apart from an order or vote for an eminent domain taking or one initiating a public improvement, especially where another statute expressly authorizes the particular betterment assessment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This interpretation of c. 80, \u00a7 1, is essentially that given \"in Nichols, Taxation in-Massachusetts (3d ed.) 765-769; see also p. 828. <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In any event, even if no eminent domain taking is necessary to permit action under c. 80, \u00a7 1, that section provides no authority for the water commissioners\u2019 inclusion of betterment assessments in their order of July 2, 1968. The improvement here in issue was not made \u201cin accordance with\u201d that order of July 2, 1968, but pursuant to earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>votes of the district itself. We conclude that c. 80, \u00a7 1, provides no basis for the assessments here in issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">4. We have, of course, no occasion to consider what, if any, more adequate, curative legislation could now be devised to sustain these assessments, or to what extent and in what manner such curative legislation must protect persons who may have changed their position with respect to land affected by the order of July 2, 1968, after that date. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, post, </em>894, 897-900.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">5. The final decree is reversed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. If no further relevant legislation is approved prior to April 15, 1972, a new final decree is to be entered declaring the rights of the parties in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\"> The capital letters in brackets in the following quotations and in fn. 2, are for convenient reference to the language immediately following such letters respectively.

The italicized language of c. 178, \u00a7 10 (see fn. 2, <em>supra, </em>at point [E]) does not; by itself, clearly give to the commissioners the power (without a district vote) to levy betterments, nor is that power expressly mentioned in \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7 of the 1907 statute. On this record we need not decide how these sections relate to district betterment assessments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
