She seeks recovery on counts for (1) negligence, (2) trespass to the person, and (3) assault and battery. The court directed verdicts on counts 1 and 2. With respect to count 3 the court submitted the following special question to the jury. \u201cHas the plaintiff satisfied the jury by a fair preponderance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>credible evidence that the defendant persisted in the administration of anesthesia after the plaintiff informed the defendant that she did not want him to continue to do so?\u201d The jury answered \u201cno.\u201d The judge then directed a verdict for the defendant on the remaining count. The plaintiff excepted to the direction of the verdicts and to the denial of her motion for a new trial. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The relevant evidence is as follows. On March 30, 1966, the plaintiff, an outpatient at the Dental Clinic of the Massachusetts General Hospital, was \u201cput to sleep\u201d prior to oral surgery by an intravenous injection of Brevitol, an anesthetic. The defendant was a qualified anesthesiologist at the hospital. Dr. Kittredge Anderson, a neurologist called by the plaintiff, testified that he saw the plaintiff on two occasions, namely on May 23, 1968, and on June 6, 1968, but that he had never treated the plaintiff. He stated that there was an irritation of the \u201cmedian nerve\u201d and that the irritation was causally related to the intravenous injection of Brevitol on March 30, 1966. On cross-examinatian, Dr. Anderson stated that he could not be sure that the nerve injury was caused by the needle, or that the needle touched or entered the nerve, and that there could have been infiltration of Brevitol and no damage. He testified that there are many ways a nerve can be affected, such as by a blow or by trauma; that the median nerve could have been damaged after March 30, 1966; and that the plaintiff gave him a history of alcohol addiction which could be quite significant in a situation of this type. He further testified that there are objective tests to determine w'hether the hand was \u201cclawed\u201d by virtue of a defect in the nerve, but he had not performed them. He admitted that he had seen the Massachusetts General Hospital record, and an '\u2018[Vjlectromyogram report\u201d which showed no damage to the median nerve; that there was no mention of a \u201cclaw hand\u201d in the hospital record of April 12, 1966; that his own examination revealed no injury to the radial nerve; and that although the plaintiff said her forearm was \u201cflexed \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>up after the injection, there was no mention of this in the hospital record.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The plaintiff testified that during the intravenous injection her hand began to hurt and that her fingers began to \u201ccrawl up\u201d; that when the injection was completed her fingers were \u201call crawled up\u201d; that finally \u201cmy hand went completely closed and my arm came up.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant was called as a witness by the plaintiff. His testimony was devoid of any evidence indicating negligence on his part or that he did not conform with established medical practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The instant case is not one of those \u201cexceptional cases . . . \u2018where the negligence and harmful results are sufficiently obvious as to lie within common knowledge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haggerty </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>344 Mass. 136, 139. A review of the entire record fails to reveal any evidence that the defendant departed from accepted medical practice, nor was the expert testimony sufficient to establish a causal relationship between the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cclawed hand\u201d and any act of the defendant. <em>King\u2019s Case, </em>352 Mass. 488. <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Dr. Anderson did testify that the nerve irritation was caused by the injection but in no way did his testimony indicate negligence on the part of the defendant or that the defendant departed from accepted medical practice. On the record before us Dr. Anderson\u2019s opinion as to the causal relationship between the injection and the nerve irritation must be disregarded because \u201cit amounts to no more than mere speculation or a guess from subordinate facts that do not give adequate support to the conclusion reached.\u201d <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, supra, </em>at 751. A verdict for the defendant was properly directed on the count for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">We find no error in the court\u2019s order for directed verdicts on counts 2 and 3. The plaintiff admits that she consented to the insertion of the needle in the first place. After hearing all the evidence the jury was given the question previously recited. The burden is on the plaintiff to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>lack of consent and this she failed to do. <em>Belger </em>v. <em>Arnot, </em>344 Mass. 679, 684. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>143 Mass. 577, 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The finding of the jury was not \"so greatly against the weight of the evidence that it could be said that the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial was an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law or a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Pearlin </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>356 Mass. 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-9\"> There is nothing in the hospital record which corroborates the plaintiff\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
