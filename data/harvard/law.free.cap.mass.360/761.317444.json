Charles Baker, when called as a witness, refused to answer certain questions, asserting his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. On November 29, 1971, the court made the following findings, rulings, and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">FINDINGS OF FACT.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">The court makes the following findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">1. The witness I. Charles Baker was interrogated by the State Police on August 5, 1971. He was interrogated on August 25, 1971, under oath, by Chief Justice McLaughlin of the Superior Court pursuant to a letter from the Chief Justice to Baker, dated August 20, 1971, a copy of which is attached hereto (exhibit A). Baker\u2019s counsel was with him and consulted with him freely at each interrogation. He made an answer to each question. At no time during either interrogation did Baker claim any privilege or suggest that his answers might incriminate him. The questions and answers on each occasion were recorded stenographically and have been transcribed. Only the questions (with the exception of a few questions deleted by agreement of counsel) are before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">2. The present proceeding on the two informations is in practical effect a continuation of the inquiry into the same charges and judicial conduct, as the inquiry initiated prior to August 25, 1971, by Chief Justice McLaughlin of which the interrogation of Baker on that day was a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>3. The statute of limitations has run on every substantive criminal offence committed before January 1, 1965, which is suggested in any way by the evidence. There is no suggestion in the evidence or otherwise that Baker has committed any substantive offence (e.g. murder, treason, robbery while armed or by putting in fear) for which the statute of limitations (State or Federal) exceeds six years. See G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 63, as amended through St. 1955, c. 781, \u00a7 1; c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 17 (as amended through St. 1952, c. 406, \u00a7 1), 18, 19, and 21. See also 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 3281-3291 (1964); Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 6531.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">4. Indictments are pending in the Superior Court for Middlesex County charging Baker with larceny and conspiracy to commit larceny on a number of occasions, all allegedly taking place after January 1, 1968. No pending indictment against Baker charges any criminal act prior to January 1, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">5. A stipulation filed on November 24, 1971, by the District Attorney for the Northern District, and joined in by or in behalf of the Attorney General, is attached (exhibit B). It was supplemented by agreement in open court on that day (Tr. 1197-1198) that \u201clarceny\u201d should be included in' the stipulation. We interpret this as inserting the words \u201cor larceny\u201d after the word \u201cconspiracy\u201d in both the first and second sentences of the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">6. With respect to conspiracies prior to January 1, 1965, and continuing thereafter, the stipulation of the District Attorney, joined in by or on behalf of the Attorney General, is applicable in accordance with its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">RULINGS OF LAW.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">A. The passage of the time within which a criminal prosecution may be brought, under the applicable statute of limitations, precludes Baker from asserting the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to possibly criminal acts committed prior to November 29, 1965. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Backus, </em>78 F. 2d 571, 577 (7th Cir.). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goodman, </em>289 F. 2d 256, 262-263 (4th Cir.). McCormick, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>Evidence, \u00a7 135. Wigmore, Evidence (McNaughton rev.) \u00a7 2279 (c). See <em>Hale </em>v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43, 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">B. The burden of showing \u201cthat-the statutory period of limitation has expired\u201d rests upon the party objecting to the invocation of the privilege. See the <em>Goodman </em>case, <em>supra, </em>pp. 262-263. Special counsel have sustained that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">C. To the extent of any stipulation of immunity made by or in behalf of the Attorney General, or by a District Attorney with the approval of the Attorney General, and relied upon by Baker by giving testimony, applicable Massachusetts law requires this court to ensure that the public faith pledged to Baker is duly and fully kept and that the stipulation of immunity is enforced in good faith and fairly so as to constitute an effective grant of immunity in accordance with the terms of the stipulation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>356 Mass. 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">D. From a careful consideration of all the circumstances of this inquiry, we are of opinion that it is clear that for Baker to answer questions put to him in direct or cross-examination with respect to events prior to January 1, 1965, will involve him in no risk of self-incrimination. See <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>378 U. S. 1, 7-14; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>348 Mass. 60, 62-63 (somewhat restricting <em>Sandrelli </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>342 Mass. 129, 132-141); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>354 Mass. 81, 83-84. Cf. <em>Gambale </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>355 Mass. 394, 396-398.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">E. Baker\u2019s answers to Chief Justice McLaughlin on August 25, 1971, and to the State Police on August 5, 1971, do not constitute a general waiver for all purposes of Baker\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. Special counsel have argued that, to the extent of the subject matter of the answers in fact given, such answers constitute a limited waiver of the privilege by Baker. We discuss this contention below in paragraph H.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">F. The circumstance that such answers were in fact made, by Baker on August 5 and August 25, 1971, in the presence of Baker\u2019s counsel, is evidence that Baker and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>counsel then regarded such questions and answers as having no substantial tendency to incriminate Baker or to provide any link in a chain of facts likely to incriminate Baker, and that they had no such tendency.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">G. Relevant answers already given by Baker on August 5 and 25, 1971, could be introduced against him as admissions in any criminal proceeding in which he may be a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">H. Because of the rulings above in paragraphs A through D, inclusive, it is unnecessary to decide whether and to what extent the answers given by Baker, in the presence of his counsel, without claiming any constitutional privilege, in previous interrogations constitute a waiver of such privilege. Were it necessary for this court now to rule on this issue, we would be disinclined to follow somewhat \u201cmechanical\u201d decisions elsewhere that waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination must occur in precisely the same proceeding in which the privilege is claimed. See e.g. <em>Re Neff, </em>206 F. 2d 149, 151-153 (3d Cir.); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miranti, </em>253 F. 2d 135, 139-140 (2d Cir.). See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>28 Ill. 2d 585, 589-591; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCola, </em>33 N. J. 335, 345-349; <em>Snyder Appeal, </em>398 Pa. 237, 244-246; Wigmore, Evidence (McNaughton rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 2275-2276, esp. at pp. 470-472. Instead, we would be inclined to adopt as (1) in the public interest, (2) advancing the fair administration of justice, and (3) less likely unfairly to obstruct justice and \u201csound law enforcement,\u201d a somewhat limited form of the rule laid down in <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>416 F. 2d 791, 800-803 (D.C. Cir.) to the extent stated below. See McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7 130. See also Rule 37 (b) of the Uniform Rules of Evidence, 9A U. L. A. 621, which provides that the privilege is not available to a witness \u201cif the judge finds that he . . . while the holder of the privilege has ...(b) without coercion and with knowledge of his privilege, made disclosure of any part of the matter or consented to such a disclosure made by any one.\u201d See also American Law Institute\u2019s Model Code of Evidence, Rule 231, p. 169 (see Rule 204, p. 135) and comments at pp. 343-345. We would be inclined to adopt the principle of the <em>Ellis </em>case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>at least to this extent, viz.: Where a witness assisted and advised by counsel has testified in proceedings or investigations obviously directed to the subject matter of an inquiry or an issue later before a court, and where the prior testimony has been recorded by a competent stenographer or has been written out in the presence of the witness, the witness\u2019s privilege is to be deemed waived (a) at least to the extent of the subject matter of the questions which he has answered, (b) where the proceeding in which the privilege is invoked is a probable, logical, or natural continuation or outgrowth of the proceeding or inquiry in which prior testimony has been given by .the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">ORDER.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Baker's general claim of privilege is denied with respect to any examination or cross-examination concerning events prior to January 1, 1965, subject to Baker\u2019s establishing by counsel that there is, as to any particular question, a significant risk of incrimination not hitherto brought to the court\u2019s attention. Baker may consult with, and be advised by, his counsel during his examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Exhibit A</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">August 20, 1971</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Mr. Charles Baker 307 Cambridge Street Boston, Massachusetts</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Dear Mr. Baker:</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">In connection with the accusations which have been made by Michael Raymond involving the integrity of two justices of the Superior Court of this Commonwealth and in which your name has been prominently mentioned, I am desirous of personally interviewing you.
