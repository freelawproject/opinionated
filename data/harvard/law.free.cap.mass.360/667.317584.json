L. c. 175, \u00a7 32, as amended through St. 1941, c. 342, \u00a7 1; see fn. 3, infra) or, in the alternative, to acknowledge by a published ruling that Rockland is authorized (without such an amendment) to transact certain lines of insurance business. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C, as amended through St. 1971, c. 520, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>The pleadings and a stipulation establish the following facts. Rockland is a mutual insurance company incorporated in Massachusetts. It is presently licensed to transact business under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 47, clauses First, Second (b), and Eighth, and also under \u00a7\u00a7 54E and 54F. Rockland has formally applied to the commissioner to amend its certificate to include the coverages mentioned in c. 175, \u00a7 54C, as amended (see fn. 2, <em>infra). </em>The commissioner denied Rockland\u2019s application and refused to amend its previously held certificate. Rockland presently satisfies the financial requirements to transact business under \u00a754C.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Rockland asserts (and we assume) that in recent years a major part of its business has been automobile property damage insurance (see c. 175, \u00a7 47, Second [b]) and that the enactment of the so-called \u201cno fault property damage law\u201d (St. 1971, c. 978, as affected by St. 1971, c. 1079) will result in the \u201cvirtual extinction\u201d of this part of Rockland\u2019s business \u201cbecause it includes the property damage coverage within \u00a3or as closely related toj the compulsory bodily injury coverages issued by insurance companies\u201d and referred to in c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 54C, 113A, and 113B. Rockland in its brief concedes that its \u201cpresent, certificate . . . does not <em>expressly </em>include within its wording the authority to issue compulsory (bodily injury) motor vehicle liability insurance under\u201d \u00a7 54C.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">A Superior. Court judge ruled on December 14, 1971, that \u00a7 54C merely authorizes an insurance company (to the extent provided in \u00a7 54C) to conduct specified lines of insurance business without having to amend its articles of organization or purpose clause so as to include such lines, if they had not previously been so included. He referred (a) to c. 175, \u00a7 47, as setting forth the \u201ctypes of insurance business for which a company may be incorporated,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>(b) to \u00a7 54, which provides that no domestic mutual company \u201cshall transact any other kind of business than . . . is specified in its . . . agreement of association,\u201d with specified statutory exceptions, which the judge regarded as comparable to \u00a7 54C.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He ruled that c. 175, \u00a7 32,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as amended, requires a company to obtain from the commissioner \u201can amended certificate . . . [under \u00a7 32] each time . . . [its] business is expanded to include another type of coverage.\u201d He entered an order that the petition be dismissed. Rockland appealed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">1. The principal issue is the proper interpretation of c. 175, \u00a7 32 (fn. 3) and \u00a7 54C (fn. 2) as applied to Rockland. We proceed on the premise that Rockland is a mutual company which (a) is authorized to write property damage insurance by its existing certificate but not authorized (by any amendment to its certificate) to write compulsory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>bodily injury policies; (b) meets the policyholders' surplus requirements of $600,000 contained in \u00a7 54C; and (c) is considered by the commissioner, in his discretion, to be one which should not be permitted (in \u201cthe public interest\u201d) to write bodily injury insurance under \u00a7 54C.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Chapter 175, \u00a7 54, requires that a domestic mutual company shall be confined to the lines of business specified in its agreement of association, but that in addition it may also carry on certain further lines in circumstances described in later subdivisions of \u00a7 54. Section 51 contains somewhat similar provisions with respect to the lines of business of stock companies. Sections 54A to 54F (which relate at least to all domestic companies \u00a1[whether stock or mutual] meeting the requirements of these sections, respectively) immediately follow \u00a7 54. We are of opinion that they are intended to describe additional lines of insurance which the specified stock (see \u00a7 51) and mutual (\u00a7 54) companies may write without amendment of their corporate purposes and articles of association. At least as to \u00a7\u00a7 54B, 54C, and 54D, authority for these additional powers was introduced in the Commonwealth by St. 1945, c. 384, \u00a7 2. This statute was a consequence of the then commissioner's recommendation that there be an expansion of the lines of insurance that certain companies were empowered to write by adopting a program of multiple line underwriting to the extent described in the recommendations. See 1945 House Doc. No. 94, pp. 3-7; 1945 House Bill No. 96. The placement of the new sections in c. 175 immediately after \u00a7\u00a751 and 54, is strong indication that they were describing merely additional lines authorized for certain domestic stock and mutual companies, notwithstanding more limited purposes stated in their articles of association.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">2. A further question relates to \u00a7 32 (see fn. 3, <em>supra). </em>Rockland contends that \u00a7 32 has application only to the initial organization of domestic companies. There is much language in the section that points to this conclusion. The first sentence of \u00a7 32 and the proviso in the second sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>tenee of the section, however, if read by themselves, could reasonably be viewed as requiring a domestic company, undertaking to write new lines of insurance, to secure an amendment of its certificate to include the new lines. The intervening portions of \u00a7 32 make such a reading difficult. For example, there is little or no basis for applying to a company already in operation (when it seeks an amendment of its certificate) the provision calling for the commissioner to determine \u201cthat the company is without liabilities except\u201d for organization expenses and (for some companies) its liabilities to stockholders for amounts paid in for shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Section 32 has not been amended since 1941, four years prior to the enactment of \u00a7 54C, and the introduction of multiple line underwriting in 1945. The legislative history of St. 1945, c. 384, \u00a7 2, gives slight indication of any legislative intention to affect \u00a7 32 or to apply it so as to require amendment of an outstanding certificate under that section when a company holding such a certificate proposes to write policies in a new line of business permitted under the 1945 \u201cmultiple line\u201d legislation. The commissioner\u2019s recommendation for the 1945 legislation (1945 House Doc. No. 94, p. 3) starts out (emphasis supplied), \u201cWe believe that the privilege of multiple line underwriting, so called, should be afforded companies now in existence <em>as they may see fit </em>to take advantage of the privilege.\u201d There is no mention of the necessity of having a company\u2019s outstanding certificate amended... The recommendations quote (pp. 4-6) the report of an insurance industry committee appointed to report to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners suggesting many of the provisions of \u00a7 54C (see p. 5) with respect to automobile insurance for reasons set out in the report (p. 6). These recommendations also do not suggest that any amendment of a company\u2019s certificate under \u00a7 32 was to be required as a prerequisite of taking advantage of \u00a7 54C.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Section 32 has been considered by this court, but only with respect to an initial certificate, in <em>Elmer </em>v. <em>Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>sioner of Ins. </em>304 Mass. 194, 197-198. There ten petitioners sought to organize a mutual insurance corporation to issue accident, liability, collision, and health insurance policies. Our opinion stated (p. 198) that, under the proviso in the second sentence of \u00a7 32, as it then read (as appearing in St. 1938, c. 357, \u00a7 2) applying only to life companies, the commissioner did have, with respect to life companies only, \u201cdiscretion [to3 refuse a certificate to a life company, if . . . of the opinion that the granting of it \u2018would ... be prejudicial to the public interest.\u2019 \u201d No such discretion was found then (1939) to exist under \u00a7 32 or otherwise with respect to companies other than life companies. This court ordered a writ of mandamus to issue to compel the commissioner to approve the incorporation papers in that case. Shortly thereafter, by St. 1941, c. 342, \u00a7 1, the proviso in the second sentence of \u00a7 32 was broadened to apply the discretion to \u201cany\u201d company. Thus the proviso is now of general application. The 1941 amendment, however, made no reference to any process of amending outstanding certificates. There is no suggestion in the <em>Elmer </em>case (although no decision on the point was necessary) that this court in 1939 thought \u00a7 32 had application except upon the issue of an original certificate under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Section 32 plainly does not very clearly (a) define the commissioner\u2019s powers with respect to the issuance and amendment of certificates to carry on particular new lines of business, (b) state that it applies at all to amendment of certificates, or (c) explain the relation, if any, of \u00a7 32 to \u00a7\u00a751 and 54-54F, and to the general provisions of c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 6. If the commissioner is to continue to assert power to require amendments of certificates issued under \u00a7 32, there is obvious need for substantial legislative clarification of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The commissioner, as we have recognized, has been given very broad supervisory powers over insurance companies. See especially c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 6; <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>First Natl. </em>Bank, 352 Mass. 74, 79-80; <em>Multi-Line Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>Rating Bureau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>357 Mass. 19, 21-22. We should be slow to interpret the commissioner\u2019s authority under \u00a7 32 more narrowly than the commissioner contends is necessary to protect the public interest, even if there is ambiguity concerning the scope of his authority. To do so might force him to have resort to his more drastic powers under c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 4 (as amended through St. 1941, c. 324) and 6 (as amended through St. 1949, c. 242, \u00a7 l).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The commissioner, in effect, asserts (a) that he has power to prevent a company in advance from writing new lines of insurance, if he for sufficient cause deems such expansion prejudicial to the public interest, and (b) that he is not confined to talcing action (e.g. under \u00a7 6) after the company has failed to handle the new lines soundly, efficiently, or fairly. Efficient, prompt, and reasonable settlement of bodily injury claims is very important, of course, under the new \u201cno fault\u201d concept. See <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary) ante </em>1, 5 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Because the statutorjr provisions (\u00a7\u00a732 and 54C) did not seem clear, we requested (see fn. 4, <em>supra) </em>that certain additional information be submitted to us. This was done promptly and carefully in a stipulation approved by the trial judge. The additional information includes (a) a copy of Rockland's outstanding \u00a7 32 certificate, dated June 25, 1971, which in terms recognizes the possibility that the certificate may be \u201camended or revoked\u201d; (b) copies of the correspondence between Rockland and the commissioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>office with respect to the amendment of its certificate, an amendment which was affirmatively sought by Rockland by a request which may involve an implicit recognition of the commissioner\u2019s practice of requiring such an amendment when a company seeks to write new lines under \u00a7 54C; (c) a statement that there \u201care no regulations or procedural memoranda issued by the Commissioner with respect to proceedings under\u201d c. 175, \u00a7 32, \u201cnor are there any forms prescribed under that section\u201d; and (d) two further stipulation's set out in the margin concerning the commissioner\u2019s administrative practice, or contentions as to his powers, to require (under \u00a7 32) application by domestic insurers for amendment of their certificates when they wish authority to write lines of insurance under \u00a7 54C which by their \u00a7 32 certificate they have not previously been authorized to write.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">It is plain that, under an ambiguous statutory situation, the commissioner for about a quarter of a century has been asserting the powers he now claims with respect to Rockland, despite the absence of any clear legislative grant to him of such powers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> His practice seems to have been consistent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>although it has not been embodied by him in rules or regulations (see G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 37, as amended through St. 1970, c. 712, \u00a7 1), if it be assumed (a matter which we need not decide) that he has power to issue general rules and regulations. Nevertheless, in a confused statutory situation, a consistent, long continued, administrative practice of the public officer charged with regulating a large industry is not lightly to be disregarded and is entitled to weight in statutory interpretation. See <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc. </em>347 Mass. 337, 343-344.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The uncertainty concerning the extent of the commissioner\u2019s statutory powers, and his assertion of discretionary powers (see e.g. <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine </em>355 Mass. 358, 360) to protect the public interest, lead us to deny, as matter of discretion (see <em>Hallenborg </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Billerica, ante, </em>513, 519-520) a peremptory writ of mandamus requiring the commissioner at once to grant an amendment of Rockland\u2019s certificate. We regard the present record as inadequate, particularly concerning the nature of the administrative practices under \u00a7\u00a732 and 54C. We are not impressed with the assertion that Rockland is faced with an emergency which must be dealt with before January 1, 1972, on a hastily prepared and unsatisfactory record. Accordingly we remit Rockland to renewing its application before the commissioner, and requesting a hearing (which should be held without delay and stenographically reported) for the presentation of evidence concerning the fitness of Rockland to have authority to issue personal injury liability policies under \u00a7 54C.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the commissioner, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>full hearing (and the development of a complete and informative record), still refuses an amendment of Rock-land\u2019s certificate, then Rockland may have resort to any remedies available to it under Gr. L. c. 30A, or by certiorari (Gr. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, as amended through St. 1963, c. 661, \u00a7 1). In view of the obvious iinportance of this decision to Rock-land, we think that the commissioner should make careful findings of fact and state in detail the reasons for his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The present petition need, not be dismissed. If there is delay in holding a hearing, the petition may be amended to seek an order to hold one.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">There is no occasion to consider the alternative relief which Rockland seeks under c. 175 \u00a7 113C. If Rockland is entitled to such relief, it will be only in the event of a decision on a full record either that no amendment is necessary or that the commissioner has no discretion to deny amendment of Rockland\u2019s certificate, issues winch we think should be determined only after the further hearings suggested above. Before we are faced with such a determination the ambiguous statutory situation may have been clarified helpfully and appropriately by the 1972 Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The order for judgment is reversed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\"> Related sections include \u00a7 48 (concerning the lines of business which a stock company may conduct with specified other lines of insurance business), as amended through St. 1970, c. 876, \u00a7 10, and \u00a7 48A (as appearing in St. 1946, c. 471, \u00a7 4), a similar provision concerning mutual companies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b683-6\"> Section 54C, as amended by St. 1961, c. 168, \u00a7 5, reads: \u201cAny company authorized to transact the kinds of business specified in the first or second clause, or in subdivision fb) of the sixth clause, of section forty-seven may insure against any loss of oi damage to, or loss of use of, motor vehicles . . . their fittings or contents, or against legal liability for loss or damage on account of injury to or death of any person or on account of any damage to property of another, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of said vehicles . . . provided it maintains a surplus to policyholders including any guaranty capital, of not less than six hundred thousand dollars.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b683-7\"> Section 32, as amended through St. 1941, c. 342, \u00a7 1, reads: \u201cNo domestic company shall make or issue <em>any contracts or policies of insurance . </em>. . until it has obtained from the commissioner a certificate, in such form as he may prescribe, stating that the company has complied with the conditions set forth in this section and all other provisions of law, and authorizing it to make or issue <em>such </em>policies or contracts.

[exceptions not relevant] provided, that if the commissioner is of the opinion that the granting of such a certificate to <em>any </em>company would, in any case, be prejudicial to the public interest, he may <em>in his discretion </em>refuse to issue it\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\"> Because of the imminence of the effective date of St. 1971, c. 978, \u00a7 2 (January 1, 1972), the case has been submitted to us on the original papers. We ordered (December 21, 1971) certain further information to be transmitted to us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b687-5\"> Under \u00a7 6, the commissioner may take the action there specified where he is satisfied as to \u201cany domestic company\u201d that it is in \u201can unsound financial condition, or that its business policies or methods are unsound or improper, or that its condition or management is such as to render its further transaction of business hazardous to the public or to its policyholders or creditors.\u201d The present and former commissioners may have been en.couraged to think that they had power to compel insurance companies to seek certificate amendments to enter new lines of business (even under \u00a7 54C) by the provisions of c. 175, \u00a7 54 (a <em>Y) </em>and (g), and other similar provisions. These may suggest at least some residual control by the commissioner of any expansion of a company\u2019s activities. Rockland argues that the requirement of the commissioner\u2019s approval in \u00a7 54 (a <em>Y) </em>and (g) impliedly negates any power in him to withhold approval under \u00a7 54C. The statutory coordination of the various sections and clauses is so confused that we cannot accept this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b688-6\"> The description of the commissioner\u2019s practice is as follows: \u201c(d) Other domestic insurance companies [than Rockland] have sought authority to write some or all . . . lines . . . authorized under\u201d \u00a7 540. \u201cAuthority has been granted to those companies desiring to write lines\u201d under \u00a7 54C \u201cother than the so-called bodily injury liability coverage. Those companies seeking authority to write the latter coverage under\u201d \u00a7 540 \u201chave been advised . . . to apply for such authority pursuant to\u201d c. 175, \u00a7 47, cl. Sixth (b). \u201cIn those instances where authority has been granted the [commissioner has amended the certificate to reflect\u201d such grant, \u201c(e) The [commissioner contends that since 1945 his office has consistently required amendments to original certificates issued under\u201d \u00a7 32 whenever a company desires \u201cto include a new line of insurance coverage not previously included in its certificate.\u201d Rockland contends (1) that it is improper and unnecessary for the commissioner to require such an amendment where the company\u2019s request is to transact a line of business authorized by \u00a7 54C and (2) that such an amendment is not a condition precedent to authority to transact such new line of business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\"> In this matter the present commissioner appears to have relied only on the advice of his departmental counsel. The correspondence presented to us shows that, on November 10, 1971, the commissioner refused Rockland\u2019s entirely reasonable request that he seek an opinion of the Attorney General concerning the propriety of his position, as would have been wise for him to do in such a doubtful matter. In such situations, it will frequently avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>litigation and possible unfairness to citizens if departmental heads seek the more objective advice of the chief non judicial law officer of the Commonwealth rather than relying upon their subordinates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b689-9\"> There is indication in the insurance statutes that the Legislature intended to surround compulsory insurance with special safeguards and prerequisites to authority to write such policies, which' Rockland has not shown that it has satisfied. See e.g. G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113A, as amended through St. 1969, c. 147. It is a form of insurance, which, because compulsory, affects a very large part of the public. There thus is special occasion for the commissioner to exercise with diligence whatever powers he possesses to supervise that line of coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
