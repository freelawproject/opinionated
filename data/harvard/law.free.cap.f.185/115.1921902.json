The bill charges infringement, and prays for an accounting and injunction. The action was brought August 29. 3908. On October 24, 1908. the defendant answered. No issue was raised that the patent was a joint invention. Thereupon prima facie proofs were taken on the part of the complainant, and in due course considerable testimony was taken on behalf of defendant. At this stage of the proceedings, and more than two years after suit was brought, the defendant makes this motion, based upon the following petition, to dismiss with <em>costs:</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-14\">\u201cAnd now comes the defendant herein and shows unto the court:</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-15\">\u201c(1) That subsequent to the bringing of this suit the defendant employed as its attorney or agent Palmer A.

H. Hinkle, V. P. Lake Superior Iron and Chemical Co., Detroit. Mich.\u2014 Dear Sir: As I could get no settlement for my patent from the Phelps Hackley Co. or the Wisconsin Chemical Co., or recognition of my patents for producing alcohol, I brought suit against them, and I have been informed that their attorneys contemplate visiting Ashland and possibly other plants of your company. They intimate that they expect to get from parties there information that will tend to depreciate my patents. As you are the largest users of my patents and have a large amount of money invested in them, it is manifestly to your interest that they prove valid; and therefore I take it that you will see that none of your employes will fail to uphold the patents at the expense of their personal vanity, as your financial interests are now much different from what they were in, these patents before you were given rights under them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-15\">\u201cYours truly, ' [Signed] H. O. Chute.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-16\">It is the claim of the defendant that the writing of this letter rendered complainant liable to prosecution under section 5399, Rev. St. (U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3656), which reads as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-17\">\u201cSec. 5399. Every person who corruptly, or by threats or force, endeavors to influence, intimidate, or impede any witness, or officer in any court of the United States, in the discharge of his duty, or corruptly, or by threats or force, obstructs or impedes, or endeavors to obstruct or impede, the due ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ministration of justice therein, shall be punished by a fine of not more.than, five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment not more than three months, or both.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-4\">Hinkle, to whom the letter was written, was vice president of the Lake Superior Iron &amp; Chemical Company, which corporation was a licensee of the complainant, and was extensively engaged in the business of producing wood alcohol by complainant\u2019s patented process. As is usual where ex parte affidavits are relied upon, we get but a lean outline of the facts of the case. It does not appear that Hinkle ever answered the letter of December 11,' 1908, or that he ever made any effort in any way to comply with the request contained in said letter, or that he ever disclosed its contents to any one until September 2, .1910, when he gave the letter to defendant\u2019s counsel, to he used in an application for security for costs, it appears that certain employe's of the Lake Superior Iron &amp; Chemical Company were about that time, and for the first time, openly claiming that they liad collaborated with the complainant in perfecting his process, and that his invention was the joint product of their inventive genius. This seems like a stale claim, as the patent was then more than four years old, and nothing had been heard of any such defense until this suit was brought. Complainant swears that there was no foundation for such a claim; that these men were hostile io him. and were simply boasting of their own genius and achievement Defendant\u2019s counsel notified complainant that he was going to Ashland to obtain certain information from these disgruntled employes, with a view of defeating the patent. Thereupon complainant wrote this letter to Hinkle, who, as licensee, was jointly interested with fhe complainant in maintaining the monopoly. It further appears from the affidavit that the defendant has taken the testimony of these same witnesses under an amended answer, in the patent suit, without any suggestion of coercion or reluctance on their part to give testimony. Therefore the transgression upon which this special proceeding is based would seem to be the writing of this personal letter of December 11, 3908. which seems to have borne no fruitage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-5\">As far as Ilinkle was concerned, it appears that he had enlisted under defendant\u2019s flag three days before complainant wrote the letter of December 11th. This is plainly shown by Hinkle\u2019s letter to defendant\u2019s counsel under date of December 8th, in which .occurs the following assurance: \u201cThis corpora lion, being, as you doubtless know, a stockholder in Wisconsin Chemical Company, we are naturally interested in this action, and will be glad to do all we can.\u201d His hostile attitude is furl her shown by his letter of December 18, 1908, to defendant\u2019s counsel, advising him that \u201cevery caution be used to prevent his [complainant\u2019s] obtaining information as to your proceedings in this case.\u201d Hinkle had balanced in his mind the conflicting interests of his corporation, and had decided to throw Ms influence in favor of defendant, and to ignore any obligation resting upon it to support the patent under which it held a license. This active hostility of Hinkle may well account for the fact that these employes of the Lake Superior Iron &amp; Chemical Company, who had remained quiescent for four years, suddenly broke out in a chorus of opposition to the patent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-6\">Mr. Jones, in his rebuttal affidavit, says that then and there, December 22, 3908, at Ashland, deponent first became aware of any available evidence of joint inventorship in the matter of the alleged process in suit, and such claim of joint inventorship was never mentioned by deponent or any one else to his knowledge prior to that time, or as an available defense in this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-7\">No one can read the affidavits and letters without arriving at the conclusion that there was among these several corporations, and the several attorneys engaged in this litigation, what a distinguished politician once christened as an \u201cinextricable intertwinement.\u201d Enough appears in the record to render ihe vague general statements in sections (i and <em>7 </em>of the petition as unworthy of attention by reason of an. entire absence of facts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b129-8\">Winkler, Flanders, Bottum &amp; Fawsett, for the complainant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AnD\">Luther V.

No cause of action will be proceeded with which has become infected with fraud or other iniquity, it matters not when or how the facts are brought to the attention of the court. The distinction is, however, fundamental that the transgression which falls within this maxim must have infected the cause of action, so that to entertain it would be violative of conscience. It does not reach a case where the cause of action is meritorious, and where, subsequent to suit brought, the complainant has been guilty of reprehensible conduct, but which does not go to the cause of action. Woodward v. Woodward, 41 N. J. Eq. 224, 4 Atl. 424; Liverpool, etc., Co. v. Clunie (C. C.) 88 Fed. 160, 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">It is contended by defendant that this letter is an effort to impede and corrupt the due course of justice. \u00b0If this be true, a plain, adequate remedy would be found under section 5399, Rev. St. Under such indictment the court would have the necessary machinery to determine the gravity of the offense, and to make the punishment fit the crime. A court of equity has no such facilities. It seems doubtful whether the court will intervene summarily in such a case, under the aforesaid maxim, to punish mere. personal transgression, where the cause of action has not been contaminated, nor the records of the court despoiled. Primeau v. Granfield (C. C.) 180 Fed. 847. Complainant appears to have come to the court with, a clean, wholesome cause of action, based upon a United States patent, whereby the government has conferred upon him, as a meritorious inventor, a lawful monopoly by way of approval and reward for the exercise of his inventive genius. For two years the cause of action proceeds in the usual way, when for the first time it is suggested that complainant had just then written a letter to a friend, who is not a party to the cause, which is supposed to be in violation of section 5399. Under these circumstances, does the power reside in the court to deny complainant the right to litigate with infringers who are wrongdoers? No case has been cited, and I can find none, where this equitable doctrine has been carried to this extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">There is, however, another ground upon which I prefer to rest my decision. It will be conceded on every hand that, if the offending letter will bear pn innocent construction, such interpretation must be placed upon it. To presume an iniquitous purpose, and thus give a guilty flavor to the document, would be to reverse the maxims of the law. The presumption, of innocence is the strongest presumption known to the law, and complainant is entitled to its protection. This letter, read in the light of the facts disclosed by the affidavit, is susceptible of an innocent meaning. Hinkle\u2019s corporation was a licensee of the complainant, employing his patented process in the manufacture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>of wood alcohol. Certain of the employ\u00e9s of said corporation at Ashland became hostile to the complainant for some undisclosed reason. They were openly claiming that they were collaborators with complainant in perfecting his process, and that it was in fact a joint invention. Complainant swears positively that there was no ground in fact for such a claim, that his process was completed before he went to the Ashland plant, and that these employ\u00e9s were merely boasting of their own skill and assuming airs by reason of their supposed inventive faculties. There is nothing in the record to dispute this positive statement of complainant, and the court must proceed upon the theory that it is true. It is evident that complainant refers in his letter to these very men as failing to uphold the patent \u201cat the <em>expense </em>of their personal vanity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Defendant\u2019s counsel, for some unexplained reason (presumably to bring pressure to bear on complainant), notified complainant that defendant was about to take the testimony of these disgruntled employ\u00e9s at Ashland. Whereupon complainant wrote this letter to Hinkle, vice president of the corporation. Defendant\u2019s counsel jumps at the conclusion that thereby complainant endeavored io thwart the course of justice by inducing Hinkle to organize perjury and fortify his patent by false testimony. The defendant is not justified in this conclusion. The law has been well settled, in this circuit and elsewhere, that a certain degree of loyalty is due from the licensee to his licensor. In Ind. Mfg. Co. v. Case Co., 154 Fed. 365, 370, 83 C. C. A. 343, 348, the court say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">\u201cAnd throughout the valid relationship of licensor and licensee, appellant lias the right, not only to royalties, but also to appellee\u2019s silence respecting the validity and prima facie scope of the patents. Siemens Elec. Co. v. Duncan Elec. Co., 142 Fed. 157 [73 C. C. A. 375].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The same doctrine is held in Comptograph Co. v. Burroughs (C. C.) 175 Fed. <em>792, </em>and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Complainant was justified in appealing to Hinkle for a reasonable support of the patent in which they were jointly interested. There were other ways whereby these employ\u00e9s might fail to uphold the patent, besides going upon the witness stand. The boastful claim involves the validity of the patent, and would furnish aid and comfort to every infringer, and damage the value ox the patent. If such claim was without foundation, it amounted to a slander of the patent. If the claim of joint invention was false or fanciful, it was clearly the duty of Hinkle to silence these employ\u00e9s,- and a request to that effect by complainant involved no iniquity. Trom the standpoint of the complainant, the truth would furnish him support, and what he wanted was silence, _and not perjury. He might, without any criminal intention, remind Hinkle of his financial interest in sustaining the patent, and he might ask him to use his influence in every lawful way to see to it that the patent be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">When asked, upon the argument, why he did not bring this matter to the attention of the grand jury, if he thought the case would fall i under section 5399, defendant\u2019s counsel replied that a criminal prosecution would do the defendant no good. This tends to strengthen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the suspicion that this special proceeding was invoked to win a lawsuit, rather than to vindicate the majesty of the law or the purity of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">For the reasons above given, the motion to dismiss will be denied, and an order to that effect may be prepared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
