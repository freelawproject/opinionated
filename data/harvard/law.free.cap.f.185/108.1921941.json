Here the insured warranted that his boat should \u201cat all times have a competent watchman on board,\u201d and the evidence is undisputed that, while the boat was lying at wharf, the sole watchman aboard went ashore to secure a change of clothing, and while absent the boat caught fire and was consumed. The very fact that his presence at the time was so essentially necessary to put out the fire and prevent the loss clearly demonstrates the insurance company\u2019s right to stand upon the express warranty made in the contract that he would be-there for that purpose. His absence was certainly not immaterial to the risk, and it is a very reasonable presumption that the loss could have been avoided if he had been there performing his duty. It seems clear that the breach.of this warranty by the agent of insured without his knowledge must be held, nevertheless, a violation by the insured with whom alone the company contracted.
