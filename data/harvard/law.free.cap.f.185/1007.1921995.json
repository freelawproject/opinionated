This cause comes here upon appeal to review a decree awarding the libelant, as master of the German steamship Erika, $45,000 as salvage and $3,333.21 for expenses, with Interest and costs. Burlingham, Montgomery <em>&amp; </em>Beecher (Charles C. Burlingham, of counsel), for appellant. Wheeler, Cortis &amp; Haight (C. S. Haight, of counsel), for appellee.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVOO\">Before LACOMBE, COXE, and WARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1019-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"AxFV\">In our opinion, interest should not he added to the amount awarded by the court\u2019s decision, intermediate the filing of the opinion and the entry of the decree, unless the delay in entering decree is attributable in some way to claimant, which does not appear to be the case here. Judge Hand\u2019s opinion (180 Fed. 892) sets forth the facts with great fullness, and as appellant concedes with accuracy. Since we are satisfied with his reasoning imd concur in his conclusion, further discussion seems unnecessary. With the modification above suggested, the decree is affirmed, without costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
