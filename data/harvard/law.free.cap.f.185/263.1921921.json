On petition of Fred<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>erick G. Austin, trustee in bankruptcy, in proceedings in the Eastern district of Michigan to compel the New York Stock Exchange to pay over to him as trustee the proceeds of the sale of the Stock Exchange seat of Cameron Currie. An order was entered denying the motion, and the trustee appealed, and also filed a-petition to review.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AhOk\">Affirmed, on the opinion of the trial judge, which is as follows:</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-4\">The proposition that a bankrupt\u2019s seat in the New York Stock Exchange is property or assets passing to his trustee may be admitted. I think it must he admitted, but am unable to perceive how it advances the petitioner\u2019s case. A seat in this Stock Exchange is property of such a nature that it can never become available to the assignee, legal representative, receiver or trustee of a Stock Exchange member, until the claims of other members of this unincorporated association have been settled by the sole tribunal entitled to pass upon the same according to the laws of the exchange, which are no more than the contractual engagements entered into by every person joining the organization, and therefore binding upon all those successors in interest who claim by, through, or under a Stock Exchange member.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\">It is true that persons having claims against a member or ex-member of <em>the exchange </em>who might submit the, same to the Stock Exchange committee on admissions (pursuant to the constitution and by-laws) may be precluded from so doing by their own acts or omissions, and may be enjoined from so doing by the action of a court of competent jurisdiction having power over the person of the claimant. This was done in O\u2019Dell v. Boydon, 150 Fed, 731, 80 C. C. A. 397, and it may be that Mr. Freer bas in effect done the same thing by taking the course he has with respect to proceedings in the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">But this reasoning cannot apply to the claim of Hayden, Stone &amp; Co. It does not appear that the bankruptcy court in Michigan has any jurisdiction over this firm, and there is nothing in the papers submitted to show that any effort has been made by that court to enjoin Hayden, Stone <em>&amp; Go. </em>from prosecuting any and all remedies which they may have anywhere in the world against Cameron Currie. The circuit court for the county of Wayne in the state of Michigan has not enjoined Hayden, Stone &amp; Co., and quite plainly could not, if it wished to, from pursuing any remedy which the firm may have against said Currie before the admissions committee of the Stock Exchange.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-7\">The facts, therefore, seem to me quite plain, as follows: When Currie failed, he was indebted to Hayden, Stone <em>&amp; </em>Co. in an easily ascertainable <em>amount of money. </em>For the repayment of that money the creditors had two securities: (a) The collateral furnished by Currie; ' (b) Currie\u2019s Stock Exchange seat. How much of the Currie collateral would be available to Hayden, Stone &amp; Co. was and still is doubtful, owing to the appearance of humerous parties claiming portions of the collateral by right superior to both pledg- or and pledgee. Therefore Hayden, Stone &amp; Co. did what they had a right to do; i. e., propound their demand to as much of the collateral as they coulcl get in the circuit court for Wayne county and contemporaneously assert their right to the whole or any part of the proceeds of Currie\u2019s Stock Exchange seat before the committee on admissions of the Stock Exchange. It was the usual case of a person having more than one security proceeding upon all his demands at once. ''</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-10\">If' it were possible to say that either fund would be sufficient to satisfy the demands of Hayden, Stone &amp; Co., it might well be that that firm could by proper proceedings in a proper court be enjoined from harassing other creditors by -tying up more property than was required for their purposes. But that cannot be done. There is nothing to <em>show </em>how large a portion of the fund realized in Michigan will be required to satisfy the demands of the real owners of the collateral put up by Currie with Hayden, Stone &amp; Co. So that the only question remaining is whether the admissions committee of the New York Stock Exchange has now pending before it a claim by Hayden, Stone &amp; Co. undetermined, as to which the claimant is guilty of no laches, and from the prosecution of which it has not been enjoined. It is to me too plain for argument that such a claim is now pending before the admissions commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>tee; and that that tribunal cannot be deprived of its jurisdiction, in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, is a point as to which 1 do nor. think it necessary to cite authorities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-4\">Owing, therefore, to the existence of the claim of Hayden, Stone &amp; Co., the application is denied.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-5\">Frederick Geller (Henry M.
