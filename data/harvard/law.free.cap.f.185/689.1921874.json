To the objection that the case was not before us on the merits, because the record shows no exception to the judgment, nor any formal bill of exceptions, we deem it proper to give some consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-23\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The judgment below appears to have been on all the merits the case had and was final. The Suing out of a writ of error is a sufficient exception to a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-24\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The writ of error brings before the appellate court the record of the case for review, the pleadings, the judgment, bills of exception, as also any agreed statement of facts.

See Raimond v. Terrebonne Parish, 132 U. S. 192, 10 Sup. Ct. 57, 33 L. Ed. 309; Glenn v. Fant, 134 U. S. 398, 10 Sup. Ct. 583, 33 L. Ed. 969; Lloyd v. McWilliams, 137 U. S. 576, 11 Sup.

Ed. 258), the Supreme Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">\u201cAs we understand the principles on .which judgments here are reviewed by -writ of error, that error must appear by some ruling on the pleadings, or on a state of facts presented to this court. Those facts apart from the <em>pleadings </em>can only be shown here by a special verdict, an <em>agreed statement duly signed and submitted to the court below, </em>or by bill of exceptions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">It thus distinctly recognized that an agreed statement of facts is a part of the record for the purpose of reviewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">In the present case the record shows an agreed statement of facts duly submitted to the court below before judgment, by the note of evidence jointly offered by both parties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">\u201cOn trial of plea of prescription and estoppel plaintiff offers:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">\u201c(1) Policy of insurance of London &amp; Lancashire Insurance Company of Liverpool, No. 3660890, sued on in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-11\">\u201c(2) Interrogatories on facts and articles and defendant\u2019s answers thereto in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-12\">\u201c(2a) Lease of the premises assured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-13\">\u201c(3) Records in this court No. 12,990 and 12,991, styled \u2018Mrs. Anna Dreyfous, Widow of Fellman, v.

May 3E 3 907, the day of hearing case, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-20\">\u201cThe following additional statement of fact is agreed to between the plaintiff and the defendant, to make part of the statement of facts to be used by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>the court in considering and deciding this cause on the plea of prescription, filed by the defendant, and heretofore, <em>by agreement, </em>submitted <em>to </em>the court, and now under advisement by the court, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">\u201cThat ou the 14th day of August, 1901, Messrs. Ross <em>&amp; </em>Cooke, representatives of the Royal Insurance Company, the London <em>&amp; </em>Lancashire Fire Insurance Company, and the Lancashire Fire Insurance Company, made to the counsel of the plaintiff a tender of what they claimed as due under the policies held by the plaintiff in all three of said companies, covering the loss on the building and tha loss on the rent, the amount of the tender for the rent being the sum of two thousand three hundred and eleven 12/1oto dollars ($2,311.12); said companies claiming that the amount tendered was the amount due, as per the report of the appraisers and umpire heretofore offered in evidence in this cause, and that the counsel of the defendant declined to receive the amount thereof tendered, but agreed with the parties making the tender, although made by draft, that it should be considered as if made in lawful money of the United States, with all due form of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">\u201c[Signed] Farrar, Jonas <em>&amp; </em>Kruttschnitt, \u201cAttorneys-for Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">\u201cHall &amp; Monroe, \u201cAttorneys for Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">\u201cClegg &amp; Quintero, \u201cAttorneys for Defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-10\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> This last agreed statement of facts is not subject to the criticism in Raimond v. Terrebonne Parish and Glenn v. Fant, supra. All the facts agreed to are ultimate facts, not- in any way involved, restricted, or limited by agreement or conclusions of law. By itself this agreed additional statement of facts in this case would be sufficient under the issue made by the pleadings and submitted to the court, because the ultimate facts therein stated and agreed to are conclusive of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">In Maloney v. Adsit, 175 U. S. 281, 20 Sup. Ct. 115, 44 L. Ed. 163, the question was whether the parties could by agreement settle a good bill of exceptions. Here the question is whether the parties can make an agreed statement of facts a part of the record before the judge \u2014 a jury being waived \u2014 passes <em>upon and </em>decides the issue involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">The bill of exceptions involves judicial action. The agreed statement is a judicial admission, of the same conciusiveness as if incorporated in both petition and answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b703-14\">SHELBY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Afn\">(dissenting). I think the rehearing should be granted. The judgment of the Circuit Court does not refer to the \u201cadditional statement of fact,\u201d nor does the record show when it was written, or that it was fded in the lower court, either before or after the judgment was entered. The judgment refers to a note of evidence, which includes many documents and an \u201cagreement for submission to arbitration\u201d; but there is no reference to the \u201cadditional statement of fact\u201d as having been submitted to the court, either before or after judgment. If we assume that the paper was on file in the court below, it is no part of the record, unless in some way identified bv or called to the attention of the lower court. England v. Gebhardt, 112 U. S. 502, 5 Sup. Ct. 287, 28 L. Ed. 811. The judgment shows that it was entered \u201cafter hearing evidence\u201d; but it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>appear what evidence was heard. The \u201cadditional statement of fact\u201d does not show the ultimate facts proved by the documents that were before the court, as shown by the judgment, nor does it show what was proved by the evidence referred to by the trial judge. On its face it purports to be a mere addition to facts, not all the ultimate facts. It seems to me, therefore, that if it were shown to have been before the trial court before judgment, or approved by that court after judgment, it would not have been sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The majority of this court must have gone beyond this \u201cadditional statement\u201d to have reached its conclusion, for a judgment on the merits has been' entered. If the case had been tried alone on the \u201cadditional statement,\u201d and the trial court had found against the plea of prescription, the defendant company would have been permitted to plead again to the merits. Lang v. Kimball, 15 La. 200; Bijou Company v. Lehmann, 118 La. 956, 43 South. 632. But this court, reversing the judgment which sustained the plea of prescription, rendered judgment final against the defendant company without giving it an opportunity to plead over, contrary to State ex rel. Negrotto v. Judges, 45 La. Ann. 1437, 14 South. 419. The entry of final judgment shows, however, that the majority examined the case on its merits beyond the facts set out in the \u201cadditional statement of fact,\u201d and holds that, not only the defense of prescription is not good, but that the facts are such that no good defense could be made; and this is done without a finding of facts, a bill of exceptions, or an agreement showing the ultimate facts deduced from the documents and other evidence submitted to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The award does not authorize the refusal to let the defendant plead over, for the award relates only to values.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
