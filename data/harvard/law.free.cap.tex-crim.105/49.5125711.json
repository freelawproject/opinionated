H. Cantrel did then and there fraudulently take from the said house and from the possession of the said Forney Prigon one automobile casing and two inner tubes for said casing of the value of $20.00, same being the corporeal personal property of the said Forney Prigon without the consent of the said Forney Prigon and with the intent to deprive the said Forney Prigon of the value thereof,\u201d etc. The undisputed testimony in this case shows that the property alleged to have been stolen was the property of F. L. Bridges, and that the house burglarized was a barn on the premises occupied and under the control of Dan <em>Smith; </em>that the said Bridges was a single man and was living on said premises with said Dan Smith, and had the right and the privilege of storing said casing and inner tubes in said barn alleged to have been burglarized. There is no evidence in the record showing that Forney Prigon had any interest whatever in the premises, or in the house thereon which was burglarized, or in the alleged stolen property. The court in his charge to the jury followed the indictment and charged the jury, in effect, that if they believed from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant did break and enter a house owned and occupied by Forney Prigon without his consent, to find him guilty, etc. The appellant\u2019s attorney requested the court, in a special charge, to instruct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty, and in his motion for a new trial sought to have the verdict set aside upon the ground that there was a variance between the allegations in the indictment and the proof, which special charge was refused and said motion overruled. Under the record as presented to us, it is clearly shown that there was a fatal variance between the allegations and the proof, and that the court, erred in refusing to instruct a verdict of not guilty, or, failing in this, in not granting the motion for a- new trial. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b69-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>There are other questions raised, but in view of the disposition we are forced to make of this case, we deem it unnecessary to discuss same.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\">Fo,r the errqrs above mentioned we are of the opinion that the judgment of the trial court should be reversed and remanded, and it is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
