It was essential in this case to introduce in evidence the check described in the indictment, there being no proof that the check was lost. Muniz v. State, 59 Tex. Crim. Rep. 365. McBride v.

This the proof in the instant case wholly fails to do and because of such failure, the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The judgment of the district court is, therefore, reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
