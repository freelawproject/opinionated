Complaint is made by bill of exception No. 1 at the refusal of the court to grant a severance and place one Moore, a co-defendant, upon trial first. The court qualifies the bill by stating that said Moore was a fugitive from justice and had never been arrested. Under such circumstances the court properly refused the request for severance. Art. 651, C. C. P., 1925, Rev., Anderson v. State, 8 Tex. Crim App. 542; Crane v. State, 91 Tex. Crim. Rep. 304, 240 S. W. 920; Moore v. State, 96 Tex. Crim. Rep. 262, 257 S. W. 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">There are numerous other bills of exception in the record. As presented none of them are believed to show error.
