The court submitted the case on the issues of murder and manslaughter; no charge on self-defense or other justification was given or asked, and the failure to so submit any such issue was not excepted to by appellant, and no complaint is made with reference thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-18\">There are no bills of exceptions in the record and no special charges offered and refused. There are various exceptions to the court\u2019s charge. The appellant\u2019s own testimony, however, shows beyond dispute that he was guilty of manslaughter, and in view of the fact that he was given the minimum punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>ment for this offense, we \u00e1re not called upon to review the alleged errors in the court\u2019s charge in submitting this issue to the jury as an incorrect charge on this subject could not have possibly injured him in this case.

These are the only two questions raised in the motion for rehearing. Same will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
