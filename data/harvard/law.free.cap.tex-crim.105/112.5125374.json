The state\u2019s evidence was to the effect that the sheriff, while searching the premises of the appellant, found some jars of whiskey and also some so-called \u201cchoc beer.\u201d Aside from the possession, the record is bare of evidence of a sale or an intent to sell the whiskey.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">In instructing the jury, the court, in the second paragraph of its charge, used the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-13\">\u201cOur statutes provide that it shall be unlawful for any person in this state to possess intoxicating liquor except for medicinal, mechanical, scientific or saeramental'purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">In the seventh paragraph of the court\u2019s charge the jury were instructed to convict the appellant if they believed. that he had intoxicating liquor in his possession. Appropriate objection was urged to this charge. The statute defining the offense upon which the prosecution is based declares that <em>\u201cit shall be unlawful for any person to possess, for the purpose of sale, intoxicating liquor.\u201d </em>See Art. 666, P. C., 1925. The court should have instructed the jury in appropriate language that as a predicate for conviction they must believe, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the intoxicating liquor found upon the appellant\u2019s premises was possessed by him <em>for the purpose of sale. </em>This is the command of the statute. See Petit v. State, 90 Tex. Crim. Rep. 366, and numerous other cases collated in Vernon\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., 1925, Vol. 1, p. 435, note 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">There are other questions raised which are deemed unnecessary to discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>The State\u2019s Attorney concedes that the fault in the charge mentioned requires a reversal of the judgment, and we concur in this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
