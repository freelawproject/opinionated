No reason appears why it was not filed within the time required by the statute. It cannot be considered. Art. 760, C. C. P., 1925. Bailey v. State, 282 S. W. 804; Johnson v. State, 283 S. W. 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>There appears to be no merit in the criticism of the indictment. It is in the usual form charging burglary and is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">No bills of exception are found in the record save those complaining of the court\u2019s charge. We observe no vice in the charge unless it be that it omitted some defensive issue which of course cannot be appraised without having the facts available. But we find where the court gave three special charges at appellant\u2019s instance, all of which did prevent defensive issues, and may have been given in response to the objection urged.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
