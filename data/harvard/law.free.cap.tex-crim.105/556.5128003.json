State, 103 Tex. Crim. Rep. 512; Underhill\u2019s Criminal Evidence, 3rd Ed. Sec. 82; Johnson v. State, 92 Tex. Crim. Rep. 582, 241 S. W. 484; Rose v. State, 92 Tex. Crim. Rep. 560, 244 S. W. 1009; Williamson v. State, 74 Tex. Crim. Rep. 289, 167 S. W. 360; Blue v. State, 106 S. W. 1157. Many other, authorities sustaining this rule will be found listed under Sec. 184, p. 117, Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Appellant in his brief recognizes the rule above stated but makes the further proposition that this rule has never been extended to warrant testimony of acts of the accused on cross-examination in such close juxtaposition to the offense being tried as to be virtually a part of such \u25a0 offense. We think a careful analysis of the record in this case, including the court\u2019s qualifications of the bills, is entirely sufficient to show that the questions asked and the answers made by the witnesses do not trench upon the rule last stated. In fact, the court in his qualification of one of the bills specifically states that the matter inquired about took place at another time and place from that at which the offense was alleged to have been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b576-13\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b576-14\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A8I\">While driving an automobile upon the public highway, the appellant\u2019s car came into a collision with a truck, resulting the death of two persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The state introduced testimony to the effect that immediately after the collision, the appellant appeared to be intoxicated. This he controverted by the testimony of witnesses and also by the introduction of testimony tending to show that the collision resulted from a defect in his eyesight.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">A witness testified that about half an hour before the collision took place, the appellant was seen by the witness upon the public road conducting himself in such a manner as to lead the witness to conclude that the appellant was intoxicated. The witness describing the conduct said that the appellant was driving his car upon the wrong side of the road; that he had Kis arm around the neck of a woman who was riding with him; that the witness warned the appellant that his conduct was such as to endanger the lives of others upon the road and that the appellant took offense and threatened to whip the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">The motion for rehearing is based upon the alleged error of the court in receiving the testimony of appellant\u2019s character witness upon cross-examination. The witness said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">\u201cI heard something about him having two women up there, and he was drunk and fighting and made an assault on both of them and they calling for Mr. Starnes to come there and get after him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The offense charged being that the appellant, while drunk, was upon a certain day, driving an automobile, it was competent to introduce testimony of witnesses who had observed the conduct of the appellant, and original testimony of any fact which would tend to establish proof by direct or by circumstantial evidence that the appellant was intoxicated while driving his automobile upon the public road. The evidence of which complaint is made, however, does not come from those who saw the appellant but comes from one who claims to have heard others state that the appellant was drunk upon the occasion in question and that he assaulted the women who were with him. The effect of this testimony was to prove by hearsay that the appellant was intoxicated and that he acted the part. This evidence was received by the learned trial judge upon the theory that it was within the rule permitting one who has testified to the good reputation of the accused to be questioned touching his information of the past conduct of the accused incompatible with the good character relating to the .trait under inquiry for which the witness vouched. See Forrester v. State, 28 Tex. Crim. Rep. 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The rule stated is subject to an exception, namely, that the inquiry touching the past conduct of the accused of which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>witness has heard must be confined to happenings antecedent to the commission of the offense for which he is on trial. See Underhill on Crim. Ev., 3rd Ed., Sec. 142, and cases cited in the text under notes 90 and 92; also Caruth v. State, 77 Tex. Crim. Rep. 150; Hopperwood v. State, 44 S. W. 841; Fossett v. State, 55 S. W. 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\">In the present case, there is no direct testimony that the appellant had made an assault upon any woman. The witness who was cross-examined did not claim to have seen the appellant drunk on the occasion in question nor to have seen him make any assault. The witness purported merely to relate things that he had heard concerning the conduct of the appellant upon the day upon which the offense was charged to have taken place. The receipt of his testimony is not only improper for the reasons above stated, but for the additional reason that its effect is by hearsay to establish the very condition upon which the prosecution is based, namely, that the appellant, while driving an automobile upon the public road, was drunk. See Goss v. State, 284 S. W. 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">For the reasons stated, we have, on reconsideration, concluded that we were in error in affirming the judgment. The motion for rehearing is therefore granted, the affirmance is. set aside, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and \u2022 the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
