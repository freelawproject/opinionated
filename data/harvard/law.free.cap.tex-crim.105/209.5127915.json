We have repeatedly held that a statement of facts and bills of exceptions filed more than 90 days after the notice of appeal is given cannot be considered by this court. In this ruling we are following the plain terms of the statutes. Sec. 5, Art. 760, 1925 Revision C. C.

The 1925 Code of Criminal Procedure became the law of 'this state on the first of September, 1925. We are not at liberty to go contrary to the positive commands of the statute because the revision was not in the hands of the appellant\u2019s attorney. However much we might regret the situation, our duty in the premises is plain. The statement of facts is filed too late, and the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
