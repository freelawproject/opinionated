Art. 1508a, Vernon\u2019s Ann. Criminal Statutes of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">A simple reading of the statute referred to seems to make it clear that the notice in writing can only be legally made by the Live Stock Sanitary Commission or by its chairman, and a notice given by an acting inspector is without authority of law and a failure to comply with the notice so given will not constitute an infraction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">For the reason that the information upon which this conviction is based is void, the judgment is reversed arid the cause dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
