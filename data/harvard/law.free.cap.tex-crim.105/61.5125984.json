The motion for new trial was overruled October 13, 1925. The statement, of facts was filed January 14, 1926. This was ninety-three days after the notice of appeal and more than the time fixed .by the Revised Statutes.of 1925. We are thus deprived of the right to consider the statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">The record contains but one bill of exceptions. Same was taken to the refusal of a special charge, the applicability of which would necessarily depend upon the testimony in the cas\u00e9. ' Being deprived of the right to look to the testimony, we are unable to determine whether the refusal of the special charge referred to was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">The indictment being regular, and the charge of the court appearing to be' satisfactory to appellant and to present the law applicable to the offense, and nothing being before us to support any. contention that appellant has not had a fair trial, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-14\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b80-15\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b80-16\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AFj\">The members of this court hav\u00e9 expressed their regret more than once at the change in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>1925 Code of Criminal Procedure of the time within which statements of facts must be filed in order to entitle them to consideration by this court. We do not make the law. We only interpret it in doubtful cases and declare it in others. Said statute plainly fixes the time within which the statement of facts must be filed in a criminal case. Said period is ninety days from the date of the giving of notice of appeal. The statement of facts in this case not being filed within the time fixed by statute, cannot be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
