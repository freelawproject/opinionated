The first one complains of the court\u2019s action in permitting the state to prove that the appellant was drunk at the time he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">This testimony should not have been admitted but in view of the fact that the appellant is given the lowest penalty, under a statement of facts that fully justified the conviction, we think it is not of sufficient importance to require a reversal of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">Bill of exception number two complains of the action of the court in overruling the motion for new trial which was based on the ground of newly discovered evidence. The showing contained in the record with reference to newly discovered evidence fails to disclose that any diligence was used to procure the testimony and none of the requisites of the statute are complied with in presenting this motion to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">With the record in this condition, no error is shown in this bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b650-14\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b650-15\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AMc\">In his motion for rehearing appellant insists that we were in error in our former opinion in stating that no diligence was shown to discover the testimony of one Caudle, the alleged newly discovered witness. Appellant\u2019s insistence caused us to make a further examination of the record which has only confirmed us in the views already expressed. O. M. Fuquay was a witness for the state. Jim Williams was a' witness for appellant. The testimony developed that the discovery of the whiskey which appellant was charged with transporting resulted from a collision between appellant\u2019s car and that of one Grissom. Both Fuquay and Williams testified to being present and what they observed at the scene of the collision immediately after it occurred. Appellant\u2019s own witness Williams testified that he, Fuquay and <em>Caudle </em>were standing there talking at the time. By one of appellant\u2019s own witnesses the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>presence of Caudle was made known during the trial, yet there seems to have been no effort to get Caudle as a witness before the trial closed. The most ordinary diligence in the form of an inquiry from either Fuquay' or Williams before the trial would have discovered what other parties were present and in a position to throw light upon the transaction, and this inquiry would doubtless have resulted in the discovery of the witness Caudle.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
