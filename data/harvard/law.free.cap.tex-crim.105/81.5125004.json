C. Taylor or order $42.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-15\">Forty-Two............................................................50/xx Dollars</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-16\">To THE TEXAS NATIONAL BANK</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-21\">LIBERTY CAFE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-22\">Beaumont, Texas. By Geo. Angelo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-23\">Endorsed on back of instrument in writing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa2\">\u201cH. C. Taylor\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-24\">By his first complaint appellant alleges that the court, erred in refusing to instruct a verdict of not guilty. The court ruled correctly in this matter. As above stated, the evidence not only shows the guilt of appellant but it shows it without dispute in our judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-25\">By various complaints appellant contends that there is a variance between the allegations in the indictment and the proof offered on the trial. The record discloses that the check offered in evidence was identical with the one described in the indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ment save that it shows that it had been endorsed by H. C. Taylor and had written across it the word forgery. The party to whom the check was given testified that before he took the check he saw the appellant endorse the back of it with the name of H. C. Taylor, and afterward the bank to whom it was presented for payment wrote across the face of it the word forgery. These facts were insufficient to show a variance. Mr. Branch correctly states the rule on page 860 of his P. C., as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">\u201cWhen a variance is claimed it should be remembered that the state is not required to allege or prove that the instrument in writing alleged to be forged was burdened or ornamented with stamps, monograms, memorandums, indorsements, or writings, which are not a part of the alleged forgery relied on or which were placed on such instrument subsequent to the alleged forgery. Proof that the instrument alleged to be forged had on it those things or added matters which were unnecessary to set out in the indictment will not cause a variance between the allegations and the proof. Labbaite v. State, 6 Tex. Crim. App. 262. Hennesy v. State, 23 Tex. Crim. App. 354, 5 S. W. 215. Burks v. State, 24 Tex. Crim. App. 326, 6 S. W. 300. De Alberts v. State, 34 Tex. Crim. Rep. 510, 31 S. W. 391. King v. State, 38 S. W. 191. Leslie v. State, 47 S. W. 368. Davis v. State, 156 S. W. 1171.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Appellant also contends that as the check was not purported to be signed by the person who was authorized to draw funds belonging to the Liberty Cafe, that it was a nullity and that forgery could not be predicated upon it. Art. 939, Branch\u2019s P. C., provides that the term \u201canother\u201d as used in the forgery statutes applies to any other person except the person engaged in the forgery. The check purported to be signed by the Liberty Cafe, and the fact that the name signed to it was fictitious, in no way enured to the benefit of the appellant. On the contrary, under the terms of the statute itself, this was sufficient on which to predicate an action for forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Objection is made to the court\u2019s action in permitting the County Attorney to reproduce the testimony of a witness who had moved out of the state. The court\u2019s action in this matter was in conformity with the precedents. Besides, the bill itself states no facts which would show that said testimony was not admissible. It has been repeatedly held that a mere statement of the ground of objection in a bill of exception is not a certificate of the judge that the facts which formed the basis of the objections are true. Smith v. State, 4 Tex. Crim. App. 630. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Robbins v. State, 272 S. W. 176. See Sec. 209, Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C. for full collation of authorities on this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\">There being no error shown in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b102-7\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A_M\">The case was one of circumstantial evidence, but no exception to the failure of the court to submit that theory, appears in the record. In order to avail one of the failure to charge on circumstantial evidenqe, there must be either an exception to the charge of the court or a special charge presenting such theory. Charles v. State, 85 Tex. Crim. Rep. 534; Givens v. State, 98 Tex. Crim. Rep. 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The alleged forged instrument was in the form of an ordinary check calling for the payment of money. The Liberty Cafe in Beaumont, Texas, had a check book specially prepared for their use, in which forms appeared the name of the drawer thereof as the \u201cLiberty Cafe, by________________,\u201d it being requisite to complete the check and make it call for the payment of money, that the blank be filled out by some person. In the alleged forged check as set out in the indictment the blank appeared to have been filled out by George Angelo. It was not alleged in the indictment that George Angelo was a fictitious person. Proof of the fact that there was no person of that name constituted no variance. Davis v. State, 34 Tex. Crim. Rep. 117; Johnson v. State, 35 Tex. Crim. Rep. 272; Davis v. State, 37 Tex. Crim. Rep. 218; Spicer v. State, 52 Tex. Crim. Rep. 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">\u2019 There would seem no possibility of sound contention that the alleged forged instrument copied in the indictment would not, if true, have created a pecuniary obligation. It is not alleged in the indictment that the check would have been the obligation of the Liberty Cafe, and it was not necessary for the proof supporting the state\u2019s contention to show that the check was made by authority to sign the name of the Liberty Cafe to such instrument. The instrument set out created no legal obligation against the Liberty Cafe, because not signed by anyone connected with said cafe or authorized to fill out the blank upon said check. If George Angelo had authority to fill out such blank, the instrument set out would have created an obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>against said cafe. The manifest purpose of the execution of the check as set out in the indictment, was to create the impression that George Angelo had the right to bind the Liberty Cafe in the execution of such check.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The check was passed by appellant who endorsed thereon the name of the payee appearing on the face of the check. The endorsement was no part of the instrument. Every element of the offense of forgery seems to appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">We have examined the able motion for rehearing, filed by appellant\u2019s counsel, with care, but are unable to agree with any of the contentions, and the motion will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
