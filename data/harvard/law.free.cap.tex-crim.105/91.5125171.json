The record further discloses that when this .case was called for trial, the appellant announced ready, and after the state had introduced the prosecuting witness, Mings, and he had testified \u2022 in behalf of the state to the effect that he purchased from the appellant on the 15th day of April, 1925, a quart of corn whiskey, paying him $2.50 for same, then the appellant sought to withdraw his announcement of ready for trial and have his case postponed or continued for the want of the testimony of one Berry Winn, by whom, it is alleged in said application, he expected to prove that a negro brought the whiskey in question to the back end of the drug store where the prosecuting witness said he received same. The application shows upon its face that said witness had never been subpoenaed up to the time when the appellant sought to withdraw his announcement and continue the case, but the appellant seeks to overcome his lack of diligence in this respect by alleging that there were three other cases pending against him for alleged sales of intoxicating liquor in the back end of said drug store to the prosecuting witness, Mings, and one W. B. Winn, and that he did not know, until after he heard the prosecuting witness\u2019 testimony what particular set of facts the state would rely upon for a conviction. Aside from the fact that said application does not show any diligence to obtain the testimony of the absent witness, there is nothing in the application showing that the appellant used any diligence to ascertain what state of facts or transaction the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>was relying upon for a conviction, from the date on which the indictment was returned to-the time of the trial. There is no error shown in the refusal of the court to grant, the application for a postponement or continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Bill of exception No. 7 complains of the action of the court in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence, and raises the same question as bill No. 1 relative to the desired testimony of the witness, Berry Winn, and what we have stated with reference to said bill No. 1 applies fully to bill No. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">In bills of exception Nos. 2 and 3 the appellant complains of certain paragraphs of the court\u2019s charge to the jury, which objections were raised for the first time in the motion for a new trial. These objections came entirely too late, and in order to be considered by this court they should have been presented to the trial court before his charge was read to the jury. Art. 666, 1925 C. C. P., states: \u201cAll objections to the charge and to the refusal or modification of special charges, shall be made at the time of the trial.\u201d This has been the law since the Acts of the Legislature of 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">In bill of exception No. 4 complaint is made to the action of the court in permitting the District Attorney, on cross-examination', to ask the appellant if he were not indicted with one Hale in another and separate case, and in permitting the District Attorney to have the Sheriff testify, over appellant\u2019s objection, that he had delivered Charley Flowers to the penitentiary agent, and that he was sent to the' penitentiary for making whiskey. This bill, as presented, shows no error. If the appellant had been charged with a felony in another indictment, it was proper for the state to ask him about it on cross-examination for the purpose of affecting his credibility as a witness before the jury; and the objection raised to the Sheriff\u2019s testimony that Charley Flowers, the man from whom the appellant stated he obtained the whiskey in question for the prosecuting witness, Mings, was in the penitentiary, because said testimony was not the best evidence obtainable, is not tenable. We know of no evidence that would be better than the testimony of the Sheriff himself to the effect that he delivered said witness to the penitentiary authorities and that he was in the penitentiary at the time of the trial, if the Sheriff knew it was a fact, as the bill indicates.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Bill No. 5 complains of the failure of the court to charge the jury on circumstantial evidence. This record does not disclose any error in this respect. The witness, Mings, testified posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>tively to having purchased the whiskey in question from the appellant, paying him \u00a72.50 therefor. These facts do not call for a charge on circumstantial evidence. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Bill No. 6 complains of the remarks used in the closing argument of the District Attorney to the jury. This bill, as presented, shows no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Bills Nos. 8 and 9 complain of the action of the court in sustaining the state\u2019s objection to appellant\u2019s question propounded to the prosecuting witness, Mings, as to his being before the grand jury, but the bills, as presented, fail to show what the answers of said witness would have been, and therefore this court is unable to determine whether or not said proposed testimony was admissible. See Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., p. 136, paragraph 4, citing Massey v. State, 1 Tex. Crim. App. 569; Luttrell v. State, 14 Tex. Crim. App. 152; Porter v. State, 60 Tex. Crim. Rep. 588, 132 S. W. 939; Fletcher v. State, 153 S. W. 1135, and many other authorities there collated. Also see Punchard v. State, 240 S. W. 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">After a careful examination of the entire record, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed, and it is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The foregoing opinion by. the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judge's of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b113-10\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b113-11\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A_Y\">Appellant devotes the principal part of his motion for rehearing and argument thereon to the contention that the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit appellant to withdraw his announcement and continue the case to secure the\" testimony of Berry Winn should not have been\" sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">Mings, the alleged purchaser,\" testified that he asked appellant if he had any whiskey, to which appellant replied that he did not have it there, but would have to go after it; that this conversation occurred in the rear of Winn\u2019s drug store; that in a few minutes he again saw appellant in the front of the drug store and appellant said it was back there in a carton on the shelf, that he paid appellant \u00a72.50 and secured the whiskey. Mings says no one was present but he and appellant at the time of the first conversation, and makes no mention of anyone being present at the time of the last conversation when he learned from appellant where the whiskey was and paid him for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Appellant testified that Mings asked appellant if he knew where Mings could get some whiskey and told Mings he did not have any, but would try to find some; that this took place in the back end of Winn\u2019s drug store; that appellant left and found a negro by the name of Flowers who said he had some whiskey arid appellant told him Mings wanted it and told him to take it to the drug store; that appellant went on toward the postoffice and came in the front door of the drug store when Mings asked him if he found anything and he told him yes, that it was back on the shelf-. Appellant claims to have seen Flowers put the whiskey on the shelf. He says Mings gave him the \u00a72.50 which appellant handed to Flowers, and that Winn was present and witnessed the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Under this state of the record we cannot agree with appellant\u2019s claim that he was not lacking in diligence in procuring process for Winn previous to the trial. According to his own evidence Winn was present during part of the transactions with Mings. It occurs to us that the slightest diligence would have prompted an effort to secure Winn\u2019s presence to support appellant\u2019s theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We have examined into the other questions urged by appellant in his motion for rehearing and think they were properly disposed of in our original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
