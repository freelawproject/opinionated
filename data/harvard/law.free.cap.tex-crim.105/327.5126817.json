Owen Carpenter, by shooting him with a pistol, about the 13th day of May, 1925. It was the contention of the state that the homicide was committed with malice and without provocation upon the part of the deceased, and upon a pretended and fancied grievance that the deceased had informed appellant\u2019s wife of his, appellant\u2019s, conduct and escapades with other women. It was the contention of the appellant that the deceased was guilty of improper conduct toward his wife; that the deceased, while visiting appellant\u2019s home professionally in his absence, attempted to kiss and fondle his wife, over her protests, and that on one occasion deceased threw her across the bed and sought to have intercourse with her by force, which she prevented by fighting him off. When his wife informed him of deceased\u2019s conduct, appellant\u2019s mind, according to his contention, was greatly agitated, enraged and incapable of cool reflection, and he took deceased in his automobile to his home and had deceased face his wife for the purpose of apologizing to her for said conduct. Upon reaching appellant\u2019s home, and his wife appearing in the presence of deceased, the latter denied any such conduct and insisted that appellant\u2019s wife state to him, appellant, that no such conduct occurred. Appellant\u2019s wife, according to his contention, there reaffirmed that what she had told him, appellant, was true, whereupon deceased again denied same, and was making a move in the direction of appellant, in a threatening manner, when the latter, in a passion of rage and resentment and under the belief that the deceased was then preparing to attack him or do him some serious injury, shot and killed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The record contains 28 bills of exception. In bill No. 1 complaint is made to the action of the court in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s application for a continuance in order that he might obtain the testimony of the witnesses, Simmons, Thomas, Mat-son and Combs. It appears from the record that Combs drove the deceased and the appellant, at the latter\u2019s request, in an automobile to appellant\u2019s home just before the homicide, and was indicted for the same offense for which the appellant was convicted, and was a fugitive from justice at the time of the trial. It further appears that the witness, Matson, appeared upon the trial before it was concluded, but was not used as a witness in the case. This leaves the question of the continuance to be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>sidered only in connection with the alleged testimony of the witnesses, Simmons and Thomas. The application for a continuance shows that both'of these witnesses resided in the town where the homicide was committed and in the county of the trial; that the indictment was returned into court on September 21, 1925; that the case was set down for trial on said date for September 30, 1925; that on September 22, 1925, subpoenas were issued for said witnesses, which subpoenas were returned into court by the sheriff on the 28th of September, showing that Simmons had \u201crun away\u201d and that Thomas was \u201cnot known.\u201d It is alleged in said application that the appellant expected to prove by said witnesses that he, appellant, had informed them between Sunday night, the day upon which he claimed his wife informed him fully concerning the deceased\u2019s conduct, and Wednesday following, the day of the homicide, of said insulting conduct and acts of the deceased toward his wife, and that at said time, he, appellant, was greatly agitated, excited and nervous, and that the witness, Simmons, advised him not to kill deceased, but to make him apologize to his wife for said conduct. The record further discloses that the court charged the jury six days after the motion for continuance was overruled, and that four days later the motion for a new* trial was overruled. The attorneys representing the state contested the application for continuance, and contend before this court that the trial court was not in error in overruling same because the appellant did not use proper diligence, in seeking to have said witnesses subpoenaed or located after the process was returned into court showing that they had not been served, during the trial or up to the time of overruling the motion for a new trial, nor did appellant attempt to show, during said time, any probability <em>of </em>ever obtaining said testimony or locating said witnesses. In support of this contention the state cites the case of Marta v. State, 193 S. W. 326, which seems to bear out the state\u2019s contention. In this court it is presumed that the ruling of the trial court in such matters is correct, unless the contrary is made to appear, and in this instance, from the record as presented, we are unable to conclude that the action of the court on this application was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\">In bill of exceptions No. 2 complaint is made to the refusal of the court to permit the witness, Price, to testify that on Sunday night, prior to the homicide on Wednesday, the appellant told the witness that he intended to see the deceased and make deceased apologize to him and to his wife for said conduct. The state objected to this testimony upon the ground that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>self serving, and we are of the opinion that the bill, as presented, shows no error in the ruling of the court thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Bill No. 3 complains of the action of the court, after the witness, Price, had testified to a conversation with the appellant on Sunday night, as above mentioned, and to the appellant\u2019s stating at said time, referring to the deceased, \u201cThe damned rascal is now sitting across the street in his car, he and Frank Fall\u00eds,\u201d in permitting the state to ask the witness, on cross examination, and have him testify that he did not see anything that would have kept appellant from making an attack on the deceased at that time. Appellant contends that said testimony involved a conclusion of the witness. We think this objection went more to the weight than to the admissibility of this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Complaint is made in bill No. 4 to the action of the court in permitting the state, on cross examination of appellant\u2019s wife, to interrogate her and have her testify to conversations between her and Mrs. Fort about two weeks prior to the homicide relative to some letters which she had obtained from her husband\u2019s pocket and which involved some' other women, and to question her concerning a conversation which she had with the deceased about her husband\u2019s relations with other women, and concerning the deceased\u2019s treatment of her, and to an alleged conversation to the effect that her husband had told her that the deceased was telling her things about his, appellant\u2019s, conduct with other women in order to \u201cget in with her,\u201d or for the purpose of insulting her, and to the state asking her if she did not state to Mrs. Fort that the deceased had always acted as a gentleman toward her and had never insulted her, and also if she didn\u2019t tell Mrs. Fort that her husband was going to kill deceased. This testimony was objected to by the appellant upon the ground that it was making his wife a witness against him on matters not brought out in chief. We are of the opinion that there was no error in the admission of this testimony, or laying the predicate for impeachment purposes of the appellant\u2019s wife. The appellant had introduced his wife as a witness in his behalf and she had testified to the undue familiarity of the deceased with her and his attempt to have intercourse with her, and to the deceased having told her about appellant\u2019s conduct with other women, and we think this testimony was clearly admissible upon the part of the state to show by this witness, on cross examination, if it could, that what she had testified to in chief as to the conduct of the deceased and what she had told her husband was not true, and we think said testimony was legitimate for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>purpose and was germane to the testimony given by her in chief, and she, having voluntarily.taken the stand as a witness in behalf of her husband, was subject to impeachment the same as any other witness. Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., Secs. 152 and 153, citing Exon v. State, 33 Tex. Crim. Rep. 468, 26 S. W. 1088; Brown v. State, 61 Tex. Crim. Rep. 334, 136 S. W. 265; Taylor v. State, 167 S. W. 59, and many other authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\">By bills of exception Nos. 8 and 9 the appellant complains of the action of the court in permitting the state to prove by the witness, Mrs. Fort, that appellant\u2019s wife, a few days before the homicide, told her that she had letters which she had obtained from the pocket of her husband, without her husband\u2019s knowledge, and that said letters pertained to his association with other women, and that she knew that the deceased knew something about appellant\u2019s conduct with women and was going to make him tell her about it, and to the said witness, Mrs. Fort, testifying that in one conversation with appellant\u2019s wife she stated to the witness that her husband had told her that the deceased was just trying to \u201cget on the good side of her\u201d so he could mistreat her, and that she, appellant\u2019s wife, informed the witness that the deceased had always been a perfect gentleman toward her and had never insulted her, and told her that the appellant was going to kill the deceased on account of deceased having told her of appellant\u2019s conduct with other women, mentioning a certain woman in that connection, to all of which testimony appellant\u2019s counsel objected upon the ground that it was hearsay, and that same was beyond the scope of the proper cross examination on the testimony of defendant\u2019s wife in chief, and was making his wife a witness against him, and was not a proper basis for impeachment. We are of the opinion that this testimony was proper for impeachment purposes. Bell v. State, 85 Tex. Crim. Rep. 475; 213 S. W. 648; Eason v. State, 89 Tex. Crim. Rep. 638, 232 S. W. 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">In bill of exceptions No. 5 complaint is made to the refusal of the court to permit the appellant to testify to what he had heard and what the deceased had told him relative to deceased\u2019s improper relations with women. This testimony was excluded, upon objection by the state, because same involved specific acts of alleged lewdness upon the part of deceased. We think there was no error in excluding said testimony of specific acts. Sea Spannell v. State, 83 Tex. Crim. Rep. 418, 203 S. W. 357; Bozeman v. State, 215 S. W. 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Bill No. 7 complains of the action of the court in permitting the state to prove by the appellant, on cross examination, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>he and one Schow were out at the park with some girls, and as to appellant\u2019s meeting a certain widow at a dance and taking her back to her home at McGregor, and also to the court\u2019s action in permitting the state, as shown in bill of exceptions No. 11, as rebuttal evidence to show by the witness, Nelson, that he saw appellant one night with a woman who was not his wife in his lap, while she was in an intoxicated condition, it being urged by the appellant that said testimony was prejudicial and was an attempt to prove other and different offenses, and that the court committed reversible error in allowing the state to introduce same to the jury. We think this testimony was admissible, and especially in rebuttal of the contention of the appellant as to his enraged condition of mind by reason of deceased having informed his wife as to his conduct with other women, and to his having been surprised at his wife asking him questions concerning his conduct in connection therewith. If what his wife had been informed about his conduct with other women was true, and the appellant contended that his mind became so enraged over the deceased having informed his wife of such conduct, then it was clearly admissible for the state to show, if it could, the truthfulness of said conduct. Redmond v. State, 108 S. W. 365; Teague v. State, 148 S. W. 1063; Parker v. State, 216 S. W. 178; Broussard v. State, 271 S. W. 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Bill No. 13 complains of the remarks of one of the attorneys representing the state to the effect that Jack Combs was implicated and indicted for the same offense as appellant. It appears that this statement was made while arguing a question of testimony before the court in the presence of the jury, and upon objection being raised thereto by the appellant, the court promptly instructed the jury to disregard said remarks. This bill as presented, we think, shows no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">.Bill No. 12 complains of the action of the court in permitting the state\u2019s witnesses to show that after the homicide they found the pistol of deceased in his office. This testimony was offered by the state evidently in rebuttal of the appellant\u2019s testimony to the effect that at the time he shot the deceased he thought the deceased was armed and was preparing to draw a pistol. We think this evidence was admissible for the purpose indicated, as shown by this bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Bills 14 to 28, inclusive, complain of the refusal of the court to give appellant\u2019s special charges. We have carefully examined these charges and have reached the conclusion that there is no error shown in the ruling of the court, in view of the fact that the court\u2019s general charge and special charge No. 16, given at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the request of the appellant, properly cover, we think, all phases of the law raised by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\">After a careful examination of this voluminous record and the exhaustive brief filed by the appellant, we have reached the conclusion that there is no reversible error shown in the trial of this case, and that the judgment of the trial court should be aifirmed, and it is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The foregoing opinion by the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b354-7\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AmJ\">From appellant\u2019s own testimony we find, that he was informed of insulting conduct of deceased toward appellant\u2019s wife on Saturday night before the killing on Wednesday, but that she did not then give him full details. He admits that after getting this information he and deceased were at a party together till a late hour Saturday night, and that he was armed but demanded no explanation of deceased and made no attack on him. From appellant we learn that on Sunday night following said Saturday, he obtained from his wife full details of the alleged insulting conduct, and that thereafter on the same night he saw deceased sitting in a car talking with one Fall\u00eds, and also that a little later on said night he saw deceased get out of his car and sit down to talk with some other persons. On neither occasion did appellant say or do anything to deceased. From appellant\u2019s testimony also we are informed that on the day of. the killing he saw deceased on the street, and put his pistol inside his overalls, walked out and met deceased. He testified that, just before meeting deceased he pulled his pistol far enough out to let deceased see he was prepared, and then had a conversation with deceased, which ended in his demanding that deceased go with him to the wife of appellant and apologize for the way he had treated her, to which he says deceased agreed, and appellant called his partner Combs who drove them to\" appellant\u2019s home. Appellant testified further that on the way to his home he told deceased he thought deceased was too good a friend of his to do that to him; that deceased replied, \u201cSmitty, I haven\u2019t done anything, I haven\u2019t done what you think I have done, Smitty,\u201d to which appellant says he replied, \u201cI know what you have done.\u201d Appellant also testified that when they walked into his wife\u2019s presence deceased said, \u201cMrs. Smith, I didn\u2019t do that. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>I didn\u2019t do that,\u201d and sat down, whereupon appellant said to his wife, \u201cNorma, are the things you have told me about this matter true?\u201d but that she began crying and made no reply. He says deceased kept begging her, saying he had not done that, and said again, \u201cMrs. Smith, I didn\u2019t do that, you know I didn\u2019t do that, tell him I didn\u2019t do that.\u201d He further stated that his wife then said, \u201cI haven\u2019t lied\u201d and that deceased started up from his chair and appellant fired rapidly, killing deceased almost instantly.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\">Our statute provides that when one seeks to reduce a homicide to manslaughter because of insulting words or conduct of the party slain, it must appear that the killifig occurred immediately following the insulting words or conduct or at the first meeting of the parties after the slayer is informed of same. We have said in our decisions that the \u201cfirst meeting\u201d means the first time the parties are in proximity under such circumstances as would enable the slayer to act in the premises. Pitts v. State, 29 Tex. Crim. App. 377. This case has frequently been cited by us with approval. From the opinion in said case we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">\u201cThe law never intended to furnish a party with the opportunity and means of taking unlawfully the life of a human being. It is only in consideration of ungovernable passion that murder is reduced to manslaughter. Recognizing this infirmity in man, the law presumes such passion will assert itself on the first opportunity ; and if the party happens to be or is intentionally armed after hearing of such insults, and he meets the wrongdoer, and being carried away by his passion slays him, the law mitigates the crime and punishment in consideration of the fact that his mind was incapable of cool reflection, and the offense becomes manslaughter instead of murder. It Was never intended, and we trust never may be permitted, that an opportunity once being afforded for passion to assert itself, the injured party may afterward, coolly, calmly, and deliberately, select time, place, circumstances, weapons, and his own convenient opportunity, and then in revenge kill his victim without holding him guilty of murder.\u201d This applies with peculiar force in the case before us, and to appellant\u2019s insistence in his motion for rehearing that he should have been allowed to tell of particular instances of lewd conduct on the part of deceased of which he had heard prior.to the homicide, said conduct being with other women. The testimony before us is plain and undisputed that appellant did not kill deceased on his first meeting after being told by his wife of the insulting conduct, and viewed in an effort to determine whether there be any fresh insult after such meeting and at the time of the killing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u2014we fail to find same. On the way to the house of appellant deceased had repeated the statement that he had not done the things. Appellant did not then manifest any uncontrollable passion. After reaching said home deceased again stated that he had not done said things and called on appellant\u2019s wife to support this by telling appellant that he had not so done. Her reply was to say to appellant, \u201cI have not lied,\u201d whereupon appellant shot and killed deceased. We are at some loss to perceive how the conduct or statements of deceased immediately preceding the killing could be deemed fresh insulting words or conduct, and must look to the preceding facts to determine whether appellant was in fact caused to do this killing as a result of passion which he could not control. Under facts such as are before us we have no doubt of the propriety of the rejection of the testimony referred to and deem it not necessary to discuss the authorities cited, or the general proposition as to whether there might arise cases in which testimony of the previous lewdness of the deceased would be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJhq\">Complaint is made of our disposition of appellant\u2019s fourth bill of exceptions. The wife of appellant was a witness testifying to the fact of the insulting conduct by deceased and its detailed communication to appellant; also that deceased repeatedly hinted at and told her of acts and conduct of appellant, indicating that he was untrue to his marital vows; also that deceased was their family physician at the time of and after the alleged misconduct on his part, and that most, if not all, of such conduct occurred and was repeated when he was on professional calls at her home, that by reason of information received from deceased she suspected her husband and charged him with misconduct with other women on numerous occasions. Manifestly it was 'competent for the state to ask her on cross examination with reference to statements made by her to others which, if true, supported the proposition that deceased\u2019s conduct with her had always been that of a gentleman; and if she had not derived her information and belief as to the misconduct of appellant with other women, from other sources than deceased, and, upon her denial of such facts, to ask her if she had not so stated. So also she might be asked questions bearing on her continued use of deceased\u2019s professional services after his first misconduct with her. We are not attempting to set out in detail the matters in the wife\u2019s testimony to which much of the cross-examination was pertinent. It may be that the questions to said wife as to whether she had not stated prior to the homicide that appellant was going to kill deceased, were improper, but she denied such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>statements, and the objections of the appellant are all grouped in said bill and are made as much and for the same grounds to all of the matters therein complained of. A bill of exceptions is too general when it includes a number of matters, some of which are clearly admissible and no direct or special challenge appears to be made as- to a particular matter which might be otherwise objectionable. Payton v. State, 35 Tex. Crim. App. 510; Gaines v. State, 37 S. W. 333; Tubb v. State, 55 Tex. Crim. Rep. 623; Cabral v. State, 57 Tex. Crim. Rep. 304; Solosky v. State, 90 Tex. Crim. Rep. 537. What we have just said also applies to appellant\u2019s bills of exception Nos. 8 and 9. In one of these he presents more than a page of the record setting out the testimony of Mrs. Fort, co-mingling that which was admissible with other parts that might be questionable, and if the bill speaks the facts, making the same objection to the whole of said testimony for the general reason stated, not one of which specifically refers to or points out the matter so strenuously here urged by appellant as erroneous. The precedents are too numerous and the rule is too sound and well settled in regard to the impropriety of such bills of exception. Appellant cites the Drake case, 29 Tex. Crim. App. 265; Skaggs v. State, 21 S. W. 257, and Hobbs v. State, 53 Tex. Crim. Rep. 71, but in neither of these is there a failure to call the attention of the court below to the error complained of, such as appears in the bill of exceptions before us, nor are any of the grounds of objection stated in bills of exception Nos. 8 and 9 based on what appears to be the only meritorious reason assigned for asserting that the objection is valid. We further observe that it is not the intent of our statute or decisions to hold that cross-examination of the wife of the accused must relate to words or expressions used by her while giving her testimony in chief, but on the contrary the state may apply the usual method of cross-examining her as to all matters germane and pertinent to her testimony as given on direct examination. This doctrine is not new. Mr. Branch in his valuable Annotated P. C., Sec. 152, cites Creamer v. State, 34 Texas, 173; Hampton v. State, 45 Texas, 154, and many other authorities in support of same.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The state\u2019s theory apparently was that appellant was incensed at deceased because of statements made by the latter to appellant\u2019s wife indicating and disclosing appellant\u2019s conduct with other women. Appellant\u2019s wife testified that deceased had made many such statements to her and\" that because of them she became suspicious of appellant, tried to find out from him what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>his relations were with other women and charged him with same. She said that among other things deceased told her that he saw appellant and Spruce Schow with two girls and he supposed they were going to the park. It is a very significant fact that in her testimony as to what occurred at her house when appellant brought deceased there just before the shooting, Mrs. Smith testified that deceased said: \u201cI didn\u2019t do that Mrs. Smith, you know I -didn\u2019t do that,\u201d and that she replied, \u201cYou did tell me those things.\u201d Appellant also testified that his wife on various occasions prior to the homicide had accused him of being out with other women at lewd parties, and he said he was surprised because he did not know where she got the information. He also admitted that on several occasions shortly before the killing, he had, asked her if deceased was not the one who had been telling her these things. Appellant made a confession shortly after the killing wherein appears the statement: \u201cI told him that if he was man enough, to go before my wife and tell her the things he had said against me were false.\u201d Explaining what he meant by \u201ctell her that the things he had said against me were false,\u201d appellant said he wanted him to tell her that the things he had said were false. These facts seem to us plainly to make material the proposition that the state might prove that appellant had in fact been out with other women at parties, and renders ineffective appellant\u2019s objection as set out in bill of exceptions No. 7, wherein he complains that the state made him admit that he and Spruce Schow went down to the park with two women, and that he took one of them home; the state also asked appellant, and he admitted it, that he had borrowed a car and driven alone with a married woman, whom he had never seen before, from a dance at Clifton down to McGregor, and that he after-wards met said woman at Waco. In our opinion facts showing appellant to have done the things, report of which to his wife the state claimed to be the basis for his enmity toward deceased, would be admissible as supporting the state\u2019s theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We have given careful study to the various authorities and contentions of appellant, but believing them not well supported, the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
