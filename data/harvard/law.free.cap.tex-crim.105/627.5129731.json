Stinson, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, and <em>Robert M.

It was the contention of the appellant that he was not with the parties named above at the time and place alleged in the indictment and knew nothing of said transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-19\">The record contains three bills of exception. Bill No. 1 merely sets out the appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial. There is no error shown in this bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The second bill complains of the refusal of the court to instruct a verdict of not guilty, and is based upon the alleged insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict and judgment. We find no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">In the third bill of exception (numbered \u201c5\u201d) complaint is urged to the refusal of the court to grant a new trial because of the alleged illegality of the verdict of the jury, the contention being based upon the fact that the punishment assessed was for five years and a day in the penitentiary, and \u201cnot for any term of years not less than five, as provided by statute.\u201d If we grasp the contention made in this bill by counsel for appellant, the complaint is to the effect that by reason of the action of the jury in adding a day to the five years, the verdict is thereby rendered void, because the statute prescribing this penalty contemplates that the punishment shall be in years and not in days. Counsel representing appellant have cited us to no authority in support of this contention, and we are frank to confess that we know of none upholding this proposition. After a careful examination of the record, we have reached the conclusion that there is no merit in this contention, and that the jury, in their discretion, would have the authority to assess the punishment within the maximum and minimum terms of said statute, including fractional parts of a year as well as embracing full and complete years.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Having examined this record carefully, and finding no reversible error therein, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed, and it is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b646-9\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AUk\">Appellant insists that the evidence is not sufficient to show him guilty of the offense charged. We have examined the entire testimony and are unable to agree. The very positive testimony of various witnesses connects appellant with other parties supposed to have acted with him in the commission of the offense. The circumstances very strongly point toward appellant and said other parties as those who committed the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
