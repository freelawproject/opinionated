Chancery\u2014decree granting relief upon cross-bill\u2014equivalent to a dismissal of the original bill. The owner of land sold the same, taking notes for the unpaid price, secured by deed of trust on the premises. The purchaser laid out the land in lots and blocks, and his grantee sold two lots to B. Default having been made in paying the purchase money, the trust deed was foreclosed, and the trustee conveyed the premises to the creditor, who was the original vendor. The latter filed his bill to set aside the deed to B. of the lots, as a cloud on the title. B.\u2019s grantor was made a party, and a cross-bill was filed to set aside the trustee\u2019s deed. On the hearing, no decree was made as to the bill to set aside the deed to B., but the trustee\u2019s sale was set aside on certain conditions as to-payment of the sum due on the mortgage: Meld, that while there was no final decree for the dismissal of the original bill against B., the practical effect of the decree as rendered was to dismiss such bill in case the redemption was made.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b464-11\" pgmap=\"464\">2.

So upon cross-bill to set aside a trustee\u2019s sale and allow a redemption, a decree giving affirmative relief to the defendant, on the default of the complainants to pay the redemption money, by requiring one of them to convey his title, is unauthorized.

D. 1875, one William H. Colehour sold, and by warranty deed, in the form prescribed by the statute of this State, conveyed, unto cross-complainant, for the consideration of $......., lots 1 and 2, in block 47, in Ironworkers\u2019 addition to South Chicago, mentioned in said original bill. And about the same time, said Colehour, by similar warranty deeds, for the consideration therein expressed, sold and conveyed unto cross-complainant divers other lots in said subdivision; that at and before the selling of said lots to cross-complainant, and to induce cross-complainant so to purchase, said Colehour and the Calumet and Chicago Canal and Dock Company represented unto cross-c\u00f3mplainant that the title to said lots was free and clear in said Colehour, except a mortgage, amounting to $50 per lot, on each lot in said subdivision, with interest thereon from a date not earlier than March 12, 1874, held by said Calumet and Chicago Canal and Dock Company, and that upon payment of the amount so secured on each lot, not exceeding $50 on any lot, the said lots should be severally released from all incumbrances in favor of said company, and . be absolutely free and clear; and cross-complainant, relying on such representations of said Colehour and said company, purchased said lots, and paid said Colehour a large sum of money therefor, and in consideration of the money so paid, received the deeds aforesaid; and cross-complainant charges the fact to be, that there was not then, and is not now, but $50 of principal secured to said company on either of said lots so conveyed to cross-complainant, with interest thereon from the date of cross-complainant\u2019s said purchase; and cross-complainant has often offered to pay to said company or to said Colehour the sum of $50 per lot for each of said lots 1 and 2, as well as for each of the other lots so purchased by cross-complainant, with all interest due on such lots, respectively, and has demanded from said company and from said Colehour a release of said lots 1 and 2 from all the incumbrances in favor of said company, upon such payment of $50 per lot for each of -said lots, with the interest thereon, which sums of money cross-complainant repeatedly tendered to said company for such release of said lots, and like tender and offers cross-complainant has often made for each of said other lots so purchased by cross-complainant as aforesaid, and said company has in some instances accepted the amount so offered, and released the lots for which the same was offered; and cross-complainant is informed and believes, and charges the truth to\u2019be, that said Colehour has paid to said company the amount due on said lots; and cross-complainant charges that said Colehour was and is, as between cross-complainant and him, said Colehour, bound to pay said sum so secured on each of said lots, and to procure a release thereof from all claims of said company; and cross-complainant hath often requested him so to do, but said Colehour pretends that said company will not accept such payment and make such releases, and he well hoped that said company and said Colehour would have complied with his requests in the premises, as in justice and equity they ought to have done.\u201d There is then a charge of confederacy between the canal and dock company and Colehour.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\" pgmap=\"471(21) 472(92)\">The prayer is, that the canal and dock company and William H. Colehour be required to answer, but without oath; that they be summoned, and that the cross-complainant\u2019s title to the lots be quieted and set at rest; that it may be determined that the claim of the canal and dock company is only a mortgage or security for the payment of $50 per lot of principal; that the amount secured by each lot be ascertained, and Colehour required to pay the same, and that upon such payment the canal and dock company be required to release and convey to cross-complainant title in the lots, and for general relief.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-5\" pgmap=\"472\">William H.

It denies that respondent, in order to induce said Bremer to purchase, represented to said Bremer that the title to said lots was free and clear in said Colehour, except a mortgage held by this respondent, and amounting to $50 per lot, and that upon payment of a sum not exceeding $50 per lot the said lots should be severally released from all incumbrances in favor of this respondent. What representations the said Colehour may have made to said Bremer, and how much said Bremer may have relied on such representations in purchasing said lots, or how much money said Bremer may have paid said Colehour, this respondent has no means of knowing, and can not, therefore, either admit or deny the allegations of said cross-bill in relation thereto, and leaves said Bremer to make such proof thereof as he is advised may be material, but respondent avers that the same, if proven, are not material to the respondent; and respondent denies the allegation of said cross-bill, that there was not then, and is not now, but $50 secured on each of said lots named in its original bill herein, with interest thereon from the date of said Bremer\u2019s purchase.

The bill of the Calumet and Chicago Canal and Dock Company seeks a decree setting aside the deed of William H. Colehour conveying to Jacob Bremer lots 1 and 2, in block 47, in Ironworkers\u2019 addition, being a subdivision of the west half of the north-west quarter of section 17, town 37 north, range 15, east of the third principal meridian, in Cook county, and it is neither framed upon the hypothesis that Bremer\u2019s title is that of a mortgagee, nor does it seek the foreclosure of any mortgage. Had no cross-bill been filed, manifestly the decree must have been either that the relief prayed be granted, or that the bill be dismissed. There was no affirmative relief granted in conformity with the prayer of the hill, and while there was no final decree that the bill be dismissed, the practical effect of .the decree was equivalent to that.</p> <p id=\"b491-9\" pgmap=\"491(37) 492(229)\">The cross-bills are, in effect, bills to redeem. They ask that the title under the trustee\u2019s sale be-held to be that of mortgagee, only, and that they be let in to redeem. It is true, the court, in its final decree, did not find the right to redeem precisely as they alleged it to be; but, under the prayer for general relief, it was clearly competent to grant these parties the right to redeem that was granted by the decree. The decree distinctly recites : \u201cAnd the court further finds, from the evidence, that in consequence of irregularities and defects in the notice and proceedings by the said George W. Smith, trustee as aforesaid, in making the sale under said .deed of trust from the said Charles G. Harris to said Smith, as trustee, by virtue of the power of sale therein contained, that the said Jacob Bremer, Charles W. Colehour, William H. Colehour and Edward Boby, or any or either of them, is entitled to have said sale of said property described in said deed of trust set aside, upon such terms and within such time as may be prescribed by the court, upon paying to the Calumet and Chicago Canal and Dock Company the amount now due upon said promissory notes, including the interest thereon, as specified in said deed of trust, and upon paying to the said Calumet and Chicago Canal and Dock Company the amount paid by the said dock company for taxes upon said land, and interest thereon, as provided in the said deed of trust.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b492-4\" pgmap=\"492(149) 493(75)\">We are not inclined to interfere with the findings of fact in the decree. The court finds, \u201cfrom the evidence, that the said Jacob Bremer, Charles W. Colehour, William H. Colehour and Edward Boby, and all parties claiming any interest in said premises, or any part thereof, from, through, by or under the said Jacob Bremer, Charles W. Colehour, William H. Colehour and Edward Boby, or either of them, are, by lapse of time, and by their admissions, declarations and conduct, equitably and forever barred and estopped from asserting or claiming that the said promissory notes of the said Charles G. Harris, mentioned in said original bill, are not the notes intended to be described in and secured by said deed of trust by said Charles G. Harris to said George W. Smith, described in said bill, and in evidence as aforesaid, and from asserting or claiming that said deed of trust by said Charles G. Harris to said George W. Smith, was not made, executed and delivered to secure said three promissory notes in said original bill.\u201d It is true, there is upon this point an irreconcilable conflict in the evidence ; but we are unable, after having carefully considered all the evidence bearing upon the point, to say that we are clearly satisfied that the court below erred in its finding.</p> <p id=\"b493-5\" pgmap=\"493\">There is also a conflict in the evidence upon the point, whether an officer of the dock company, having authority to conclude it by his declarations and actions, represented and agreed that each lot might be redeemed by the payment of $50, and thereby induced Bremer and others to purchase; but we, in this respect, as in the other, can not say that we are clearly satisfied that the court below erred in its finding. The decree, however, directing Bremer to convey, and on his default the master in chancery to do so, and in assuming to give affirmative relief to the Calumet and Chicago Canal and Dock Company in any other respect, is unauthorized. The decree, after directing the payment of the amount required to be paid to redeem, should then have concluded, that in default of the complainants so doing the cross-bills be dismissed.' 2 Daniell\u2019s Ch. Pr. (Perkins\u2019 ed.) 1016, 17; Seton\u2019s Decrees in Equity, 106, *145; Walker v. Harris, 7 Paige Ch. 167; 2 Barbour\u2019s Ch. Pr. (2d ed.) 200; 2 Jones on Mortgages, (2d ed.) 1106.</p> <p id=\"b493-6\" pgmap=\"493\">An objection is urged, that the decree should have provided for the statutory period of redemption. This is not tenable. The time rests in the sound discretion of the court, in view of all the circumstances. In such eases, the complainant should be prepared to pay at once, and his bill, when properly framed, in fact offers to make payment. The usual time allowed is six months, but that is not obligatory in all cases. 2 Jones on Mortgages, (2d ed.) sec. 1107. We can not say that the court here abused its discretion in that respect.</p> <p id=\"b493-7\" pgmap=\"493(24) 494(42)\">The decree is in all respects affirmed, except in so far as it assumes to give affirmative relief, but in that respect it is reversed, and the cause remanded to the court helow, with directions to that court to modify and amend the decree to conform to the views herein expressed. Each party will be taxed with the costs made by that party in this court.</p> <p id=\"b494-5\" pgmap=\"494\">Decree reversed in fart and in fart affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
