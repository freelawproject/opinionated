Same\u2014colored children in the public schools. By the statutes of the State, the duty of providing schools for the education of all children between the ages of six and twenty-one years in their district, is imposed on all boards of education; and the statute also provides, that in the performance of this duty they shall not exclude from such schools, directly or indirectly, any such children on account of color.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b613-10\" pgmap=\"613\">3.

Under such instruction the jury could find for the relator only on proof that his children were excluded from all the public schools of the district.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b613-11\" pgmap=\"613\">4.

By the answer of respondents, and the replication thereto, an issue of fact was raised, for the trial of which the case was certified to the circuit court of Madison county. A trial by jury in that court resulted in a general verdict in favor of respondents; but there were also several special findings returned, and these, with the general verdict, and a bill of exceptions containing all the evidence offered in the circuit court, have been certified back for our final determination of the cause. \u25a0</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-5\" pgmap=\"615\">It is averred in the petition, that the board of education of Upper Alton school district is a corporation existing under and by virtue of an act of the legislature of this State, approved February 15, 1865, and an amendatory act, approved March 29,1869; that prior to 1886 said school board provided four school houses in said district, in three of which white children alone were admitted and taught, and in the other of which children of African descent, or colored children, only, were admitted and taught; that in 1885 and 1886 said board of education caused.to be erected in said Upper Alton a public school building, commonly called a.high school building, with ample room for the accommodation and instruction of all the children of said district, white and colored; that thereupon the three schools previously used for the white children were closed and discontinued, and that there is now no other common or free school in said district provided for white children than the high school building aforesaid, and all of said white children, whether in the primary, intermediate or high school grades, who desire so to do, are admitted by said board to said high school building, and all the grades of a common school education, primary, intermediate and high school, are taught therein to said white children according to their advancement in education; that on the Tth of October, 1886, said board passed a resolution, as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-6\" pgmap=\"615(63) 616(375) 617(61)\">\u201cResolved, first, that if, after submitting to the customary examination for admission of white pupils to the high school, any colored children shall be found to have attained the requisite standing, such colored children shall be admitted to the high school; second, that all the grades taught in the white schools below the high school, shall be taught in the colored school.\u201d \u2014But said board has ever refused, and still refuses, to admit any of the colored children of said district into said high school building, as pupils, unless sufficiently advanced to enter the high school grades; that relator is a colored man; that he now resides and has long resided in said Upper Alton, and is a taxpayer therein; that he has several children, two of whom are named, respectively, Tony Peair and Cora Peair, aged six and nine years, who now reside and ever have resided with relator; that neither of them is qualified to enter the high school grades taught in said high school building; that upon the opening of said building for the reception of pupils, all white children who presented themselves for admission to any of the grades to be taught therein, whether primary, intermediate or high school grades, were received into said building, and have been since taught therein; that upon the opening of said building for the reception of pupils, and again on October 27, 1886, and again on December 21,1886, application was made at said building, to the principal in charge thereof, on behalf of said two children, for permission to attend school in said building, but such permission was refused by said principal, under orders from said board of education, for the reason that said children are colored, and for no other reason; that said board, as at present organized, is composed of Edward C. Lemen, Michael Low, Eranklin Moore, Robert R. McReynolds and George Johnson, and that relator has applied to each member thereof to grant said relator\u2019s said two children permission to attend school in said high school buildipg, but without success, but each of said members has refused such permission; that relator has requested the president of .said board to call a meeting of said board for the purpose of granting said children admission to the schools taught in said high school building, but he refused to do so, upon the ground that the members of said board would not allow colored children to attend any school in said building below the high school grade, and that he and other members of said board advised relator to institute suit to test the question as to whether the colored children of said district have the right to attend school in said building below the high school grade; that he has used every means within his power, except legal proceedings, to obtain admission for his said children to said schools in said building, but without avail, etc., wherefore he prays a writ of mandamus, etc.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-5\" pgmap=\"617(301) 618(380) 619(136)\">Respondents, by their joint answer, admit the existence of said board of education of Upper Alton school district, as alleged in the petition, and that prior to 1886 schools were located and conducted in said district as averred by the relator; also, the erection of said high school building, and that upon the completion thereof the three schools previously used by white children were closed and discontinued, while that used by colored children was continued; they aver that the separate school for colored children, prior to 1886, was erected, organized and maintained at the instance and because of the preference of relator and other colored citizens of said district that their children should be educated in a school separate from the white children; they deny that there is no other common or free school for white children in said school district except the high school building, and aver that there are, and have been during the school years of 1886 and 1887, two common or free school houses kept open and maintained therein; they deny that the high school building contains ample room for the accommodation of the school children, white and colored, in said district; they aver \u201cthat Professor George W.

The eighteenth special finding is directly and positively so, and the eleventh and nineteenth, to the effect that they were so excluded by the principal of said school, are so in effect. The resolution of respondents, August 20, 1886, set out in the answer, vested full power in said principal to assign all pupils in said district; therefore, what was done in that respect by the principal, was indirectly done by respondents. We think these special findings are supported by the evidence, and while they are not treated as special verdicts under the recent amendment to our Practice act, they are in this proceeding proper to be considered as findings of fact on the issues submitted to the jury. Even if the general verdict could be said to be a finding in respondents\u2019 favor on this branch of the ease, it is so manifestly the result of misdirection by the court as to be entitled to no consideration.</p> <p id=\"b623-6\" pgmap=\"623\">\u2022 By one instruction, the jury are told that \u201cunless you believe, from the evidence, that -the board of education of Upper Alton excluded the children named in the petition from the public schools of Upper Alton, by a resolution of said board of education, on account of color, passed and entered of record, then you should find for the defendant.\u201d By the statute, it is made unlawful to exclude a child from any of the public schools of Upper Alton district on account of color. By the instruction, the jury could only find for relator on proof that his children were excluded from all the public schools of said district. By the statute, it is made unlawful to exclude a child from a public school on account of color, either directly or indirectly; but here the jury are told they must find for respondents unless they believe relator\u2019s children were excluded by a resolution entered of record.</p> <p id=\"b624-4\" pgmap=\"624\">By another of the series of instructions asked by and given on behalf of respondents, the jury was told: \u201cIf you believe, from the evidence, that the board of education, (defendants,) in the exercise of a reasonable discretion, furnished to all the children of Upper Alton school district, of school age, facilities for a common school education, as in their judgment would best promote the education of the children and answer the purpose of the law, the jury will find for the defendants. \u201d Here, again, the requirements of the statute are wholly ignored, and the issue presented by the pleadings entirely lost sight of. Under these instructions the jury could do no less than return a general verdict for defendants; but that verdict is no indication as to what view of the evidence they would have taken on the question now under consideration if they had been properly instructed, while the special verdicts do clearly show .that the jury found, from the evidence, that relator\u2019s children had been excluded from said'school by respondents on account of color.</p> <p id=\"b624-5\" pgmap=\"624\">A careful reading of all the evidence before us forces the conviction that it was the purpose of respondents to require the children of relator, and all other colored children of the district, to attend what had been known as the colored school building, and to exclude all colored children of the district, below the high school grade, from the high school building. Especially are we convinced that these children were practically excluded from the said high school building by-the principal because they were colored children, and that respondents, though informed of that fact, took no steps to have them admitted.</p> <p id=\"b624-6\" pgmap=\"624(62) 625(32)\">But respondents maintain, that even though this principal question is resolved in relator\u2019s favor, still he can not have a peremptory writ of mandamus, because he has failed to show an express demand by him upon respondents that his children should be so admitted, and their refusal, before filing his petition. The jury has found, as is shown by the foregoing statement of facts, that no such demand was made; therefore, if the position of respondents is legally correct, the general verdict must be sustained, and the prayer of the petition denied.</p> <p id=\"ARz\" pgmap=\"625\">The argument in support of the proposition that a formal demand and refusal must be shown, is based upon the assumption that the duty here sought to be enforced is of a private nature, affecting only the right of relator, the law being, that in such case a demand is necessary to lay the foundation for relief by mandamus. If, on the contrary, the duty,' the performance of which is sought to be enforced, is a public duty, resting upon respondents by virtue of their office, it is equally well settled that no such demand and refusal are necessary. (High on Ex. Legal Bern. sec. 41, and authorities cited.) The duty here sought to be enforced is not of a private nature, nor is the right demanded by relator merely an individual right, within the meaning of the rule announced. By the statutes of this State, the duty of providing schools for the education of all children between the ages of six and twenty-one in their district, is imposed upon respondents. The legislature has also, by express enactment, provided, that in the performance of that duty they shall not exclude from such schools, directly or indirectly, any such child on account of its color. The duty thus imposed upon respondents is incumbent upon them by virtue of their office. In such case it has been well said, \u201cthe law itself stands in the place of a demand, and the neglect or omission to perform the duty stands in the place of a refusal, or, in other words, the duty makes the demand, and the omission is the refusal.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b625-4\" pgmap=\"625(81) 626(67)\">Again, the right claimed by the relator is not merely a personal right. True, he may, and doubtless does in this particular case, have the peculiar interest of a parent in having his children admitted to a school in which he thinks they have a right to be taught; but after all, it is the public,\u2014the community at large,\u2014that is most deeply interested in the enforcement of this and all other laws enacted for the wise and humane purpose of educating the children of the State. While it was natural and appropriate that the father should become the relator, we entertain no doubt that any citizen of the school district might, with equal right of law, have done so, and maintained the petition. In County of Pike v. The People, 11 Ill. 208, it is said: \u201cWhere the object is the enforcement of a</p> <p id=\"b626-5\" pgmap=\"626\">public right, the people are regarded as the real party, and the relator need not show that he has any legal interest in the result. It is enough that he is interested, as a citizen, in having the law executed and the right in question enforced.\u201d See, also, City of Ottawa v. The People ex rel. 48 Ill. 240; Hall et al. v. The People ex rel. 57 id. 312; Village of Glencoe v.
