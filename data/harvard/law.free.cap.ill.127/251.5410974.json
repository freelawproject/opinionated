The trial was before the court, without a jury. The bill of exceptions contains the evidence, but it fails to show that any exception was taken to the finding and decision of the court, or that a motion was made for a new trial, overruled, and the decision of the court excepted to, and hence no error can be assigned.

Church, 58 id. 291.</p> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b252-4\" pgmap=\"252\">Mr. Justice Scholfield</author> <p id=\"Abz\" pgmap=\"252\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b252-5\" pgmap=\"252\">This was ejectment, tried, by agreement of parties, by the court, without the int\u00e9rvention of a jury.</p> <p id=\"b252-6\" pgmap=\"252\">The bill of exceptions fails to show any exception taken to the judgment rendered, or any motion for a new trial. Nor are there recited in the bill of exceptions any propositions of law submitted under the 42d section of the.Practice act, and the rulings of the court thereon; and there is-no question of law discussed in argument, arising on rulings of the court in admitting or excluding evidence. There is, therefore, no question presented by the record upon which we can pass. It is immaterial that the recitals in the orders entered by the clerk may show exception to the judgment, and the submission and rulings thereon of propositions of law under the 42d section of the Practice act. These are matters that can only become a part of the record by being incorporated in the bill of exceptions, and the clerk\u2019s recitals, in that respect, are, therefore, extra-official, and of no legal effect.
