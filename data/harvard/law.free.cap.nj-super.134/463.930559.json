J. S. A. </em>2A:139-3, an offense not within the municipal court\u2019s jurisdiction. Despite defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary, the municipal court\u2019s records indicate that the complaint was amended <em>(B. </em>7:10-2) and he was convicted of being a disorderly person under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:170-38, an offense within the municipal court\u2019s jurisdiction. The latter statute proscribes the unlawful taking or using of any means of conveyance, or being an accessory thereto. This was not a case of the municipal court judge attempting to downgrade the original offense without the prosecutor\u2019s permission. See <em>State v. States, </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>285 (1965). Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>appealed to the County Court and sought a <em>de novo </em>hearing on the record below, as provided for under <em>B. </em>3:23-8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">We note at the outset that the transcript of the municipal court hearing leaves much to be desired. Other than the notation on the complaint and the municipal court judge\u2019s finding of guilt, the record fails to reveal when or under what circumstances the original complaint was amended. However, a strong presumption arises from the notations on the original record that the amendment was made prior to the hearing and conviction. In addition, much of the transcript contains gaps concerning questions and answers \u2014 we have many notations in the transcript such as \u201cinaudible,\u201d \u201cobliterated,\u201d \u201cmachine turned off temporarily,\u201d \u201cobliterated by Mr. Saportin speaking\u201d and \u201cobliterated by counsel speaking.\u201d In short, it would be pure speculation to review this inadequate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">When the appeal came before the County Court judge he recognized the deficiencies in the record above outlined and stated, \u201c1 am still in a quandary exactly what the defendant was charged with. Therefore, 1 am going to reverse and remand this matter for a new trial * * By so doing, he erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The County Court\u2019s jurisdiction and power to hear appeals from the municipal court is circumscribed by <em>B. </em>3 :23-8. Section (e) of the rule permits the County Court judge to convict or acquit the defendant \u2014 no power is given, nor can it be implied that he has the inherent power, to reverse and remand for a new trial. Under the circumstances existing here, he should have utilized sections (a) and (c) of the rule and afforded defendant a plenary trial <em>de </em>novo, permitting both sides to produce their witnesses, and then determine the guilt or innocence of defendant. See <em>State v. Higgins, </em>132 <em>N. J. Super. </em>67 (App. Div. 1975). So too, if he deemed it essential, he could have amended the complaint to charge a violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:170-38. <em>B. </em>3:23-8(c); <em>State v. Joas, </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>179, 188-189 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>The judgment below is reversed and the matter remanded to the Hudson County Court for a plenary hearing on the amended complaint charging a violation of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A: 170-38.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
