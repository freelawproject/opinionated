A. <em>D.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AvCI\">The ultimate issue in these <em>consolidated </em>appeals is whether attorneys\u2019 fees are deductible from the lien asserted by a disability insurance carrier against a covered employee\u2019s recovery in a third-party action. As will be seen below, our resolution of that issue turns on the resolution of a conflict between New York and New Jersey law.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">The trial judge, whose thoughtful opinion is reported at 125 <em>N. J. Super. </em>320 (Law Div. 1973), succinctly set forth the relevant facts and legal contentions of the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>In each instance a New Jersey resident, employed in New York, was injured in an automobile accident in New Jersey. Disability benefits were paid to the employees by their respective New York employers\u2019 insurance carriers. Actions were commenced in New Jersey by the employees against third parties for injuries received in the accidents and resulted in the recovery of amounts in excess of the disability benefits received by the employees from the carriers, plus attorneys\u2019 fees and costs (computed on the whole sum recovered). The carriers in these actions assert subrogation rights under New York law to the full extent of the benefits paid, without allowance for costs or attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by the employees in effecting a recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">On their part the employees assert that (1) the enforcement of the New York statutory subrogation claims should be denied in their entirety because the claims conflict with the statutory law and public policy of New Jersey, or (2) at the very least and for similar reasons, the amounts claimed by the carriers are subject to an offset for the <em>pro rata </em>share of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in effecting the recovery against which the right of subrogation is being claimed, [at 323-324]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The trial judge held that New York law governed the existence <em>vel non </em>of the subrogation rights, but that the insurers\u2019 liens were nevertheless subject, under New Jersey law, to payment of a pro rata share of the attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred by the employees in the third-party actions. The insurers appeal, urging a reversal of the trial judge\u2019s holding solely with regard to attorneys\u2019 fees. Plaintiffs, apparently abandoning their contention below that no subrogation rights are cognizable, argued for an affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">According to the New York disability statute, as interpreted by the courts of that state, the insurer is entitled to recover its full lien without deduction for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, provided that the employee\u2019s total third-party recovery, less attorneys\u2019 fees, exceeds the amount of disability benefits paid. <em>McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. </em>67, <em>N. Y. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Law, </em>\u00a7 227 (1965); <em>Cianciosi v. Merchant\u2019s Mut. Ins. Co., </em>61 <em>Misc. </em>2d 867, 307 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 136 (Sup. Ct. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">In contrast, as noted by the trial judge, New Jersey\u2019s temporary disability statute contains no specific provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>granting subrogation rights to an insurance carrier in the present context. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43:21-25 <em>at seq. </em>Consequently, the issue of an attorney\u2019s lien superimposed on the insurer\u2019s lien has not arisen in any disability insurance cases in New Jersey. In closely analogous situations, however, our law subjects the subrogation rights of carriers to payment of some share of the attorneys\u2019 fees. Under the New Jersey Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, for example, the carrier\u2019s statutory right of subrogation is subject to payment of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in accordance with certain statutory maxima. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:15-40(b) and (e) \u2022, <em>Caputo v. Best Foods, </em>17 <em>N. J. </em>259, 267 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">And, in the absence of a statute, this court has held that where an insurer\u2019s subrogation rights arise by contract, but the contract is silent as to attorneys\u2019 fees, equitable principles dictate that the insurer pay a proportional share of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred by the insured in a successful third party action. <em>Klacik v. Kovacs, </em>111 <em>N. J. Super. </em>307 (App. Div. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The conflict of laws between the two states is therefore clear: New Jersey favors contribution to the costs of suit by the insurer where such insurer has benefited from a third-party recovery; New York law precludes such deductions for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs from the liens of disability insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">This same conflict has arisen between the workmen\u2019s compensation laws of. the two states. In <em>Privetera v. Hill-crest Homes, Inc., </em>29 <em>N. J. Super. </em>591 (Law Div. 1954), plaintiff had been injured while at work in New York. He received a workmen\u2019s compensation award from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board of New York. It was paid by the compensation carrier in New York. A third-party action was instituted against an alleged tortfeasor in New Jersey and was settled for $3,000. The compensation carrier claimed its entire lien, while plaintiff contended the lien was subject to deduction for expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees as provided in the New Jersey Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:15-40. The court rejected plaintiff\u2019s argument, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">Plaintiff proceeded under the provisions of article 2, section 29 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of New York, which authorized him to bring the third-party action, and he is, accordingly, bound by all of the provisions of that law \u2014 he cannot take advantage of the portion he likes and disregard those portions of which he disapproves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">My conclusion, therefore, is that the New York statute is controlling in the present case, and the New Amsterdam Casualty Company is entitled to receive the draft of $1,123.40 without deduction. The petition to impress an attorney\u2019s lien upon the fund must, necessarily, be dismissed, [at 593]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Thus, even where there was a New Jersey statute providing for payment of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, New York law to the contrary prevailed. As we have noted above, there is no such comparable New Jersey statute applicable to disability benefits as distinguished from workmen\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\"><em>Privetera </em>was cited with approval in <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Borsari Tank Corp., </em>248 <em>F. </em>2d 277 (2 Cir. 1957). In that case Liberty Mutual had paid compensation under Missouri law to the widows of three employees of a Missouri employer who had been killed while working on a New Jersey construction job. Third-party actions, brought in New Jersey by their estates, were settled for a total sum of $82,500. The issue arose as to whether, at the time of the settlement, Liberty was entitled to reimbursement of its full lien, or whether such recovery was subject to a reduction in the amount of a pro rata share of the attorneys\u2019 fees in the third party New Jersey actions. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">Although Liberty Mutual and Borsari filed their statutory notice in the third party actions instituted in the New Jersey State Court, pursuant to New Jersey law, their right to recover on their lien, <em>the amount of their recovery and the conditions attached thereto, are governed 6y the law of the State whose Compensation Act was invoked </em>by the claimants in obtaining their compensation awards. In this case it would be the law of Missouri, [at 282; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>Wilson v. Faull, </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>105 (1958), involved the issue as to whether New Jersey or Pennsylvania law was applicable to the right of an injured employee of a subcontractor to maintain a common law action against a general contractor, the law of the two states differing in that regard. The court applied Pennsylvania law and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\">However, where the injured employee seeks to maintain a common law tort action against his employer in one of two or more states having a legitimate interest in the work-injury, <em>the forum has almost invariably applied the law of the state in which the employer has provided compensation insurance and whose lato granted such employer immunity from common law negligence actions by the employee, and dismissed the suit </em>(citations omitted), * ^ * This choice of law has been made by the state of the forum, whether it was the state of the injury (citations omitted), *\u25a0 * * or the state of the contract (citations omitted), * * * or the state of employment relation (citations omitted) * * *. [at 117-118; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\"><em>* * </em>* Fundamental compensation policy dictates that where an employer is required to provide compensation benefits by the law of the state having a legitimate interest in a work-injury, under which the injured employee could claim a compensation remedy against the employer, <em>the state of the forum should recognize the correlative immunity conferred upon suoh an employer by the law of the foreign state, </em>[at 120; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">All of the reasoning of <em>Privetera, Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Borsari Tank Corp., </em>and <em>Wilson v. Faull, </em>which we consider sound, applies here. Indisputably, the disability policies under which the companies paid the benefits were issued in New York to New York employers. It is that state\u2019s law which creates the carriers\u2019 right of subrogation, regulates the insurance premiums payable and specifies the amount of recovery of the lien. While we recognize the trend away from former \u201cmechanical\u201d formulae in deciding choice-of-law questions (compare <em>Kievit v. Loyal Protect. Life Ins. Co., </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>475, 492 (1961), with <em>Buzzone v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>447, 452 (1957)), we conclude that, whether we apply a traditional or a more modern choice-of-law test, New York law should govern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the deductibility of attorneys\u2019 fees from the carriers\u2019 liens under the circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">As we have noted above, the trial judge held that New York\u2019s disability benefits law must govern the existence of the right of subrogation. In so holding the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">The place of employment here was New York and the benefits were paid to the injured employees by reason of their New York employment and pursuant to the statutory scheme of that state. While choice of law in this situation is not controlled by the application of mechanistic formulae as such, it is evident that fundamental fairness as well as the need for certainty of result commits our courts to look to the laws of the state pursuant to which the benefits were paid to determine questions affecting the essential rights of the employers, co-employees, as well as insurance carriers. See <em>Stacy v. Greenberg, </em>9 <em>N. J. </em>390; <em>Privetera v. Hillcrest Homes, Inc., supra; </em>but see, <em>Wilson v. Faull, </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>105 (1958). [at 325 of 125 <em>N. J. Super.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The court went on to say, however, that \u201cit does not automatically follow that the choice-of-law on the first issue compels us to choose New York law in determining the status of the asserted attorneys\u2019 liens.\u201d Though we agree with this general proposition, we fail to see why the \u201ccontacts\u201d recited by the court in accepting application of New York law as to the \u201cexistence\u201d of the right of subrogation do not equally postulate that state\u2019s law as governing the extent of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Nor do we agree, as the trial judge said, that an attorney\u2019s lien has such \u201cpriority\u201d under New Jersey law as to warrant engravement of a limitation on the subrogation right created under New York auspices. Not every legal principle established in a state rises to the dignity of \u201cpublic policy.\u201d A mere difference between our law and that of another jurisdiction does not compel the conclusion that the foreign law is offensive to our public policy. <em>Caribe Hilton Hotel v. Toland, </em>63 <em>N. J. </em>301, 308 (1973); <em>Zotta v. Otis Elevator Co., </em>64 <em>N. J. Super. </em>344, 349 (App. Div. 1960). Eather, \u201cpublic policy\u201d in conflicts of law doctrine has been said to be \u201csome fundamental principle of justice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>some prevalent conception of good morals, some deep-rooted tradition of the common weal.\u201d <em>Loucks v. Standard Oil Co., 224 N. Y. </em>99, 111, 120 <em>N. E. </em>198, 202 (Ct. App. 1918); see <em>Buzzone v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Ind. Co., supra, 23 N. J. </em>at 458-459. We accept the proposition that it is the law of New Jersey that an attorney shall be paid for the services he renders. We do not conceive that such principle is such a deep-rooted fundamental principle of justice as to be considered \u201cpublic policy\u201d in the sense that that concept is relevant here. Moreover, the New Jersey policy of compensating attorneys has not been violated here. The attorneys in the instant cases are not, by our decision, denied compensation for services rendered. Our decision concerns only the degree to which the cost of such services should be shared between the carriers and the employee-plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The case of <em>Klacik v. Kovacs, supra, </em>111 <em>N. J. Super. </em>307, does not in our view support the application of New Jersey law here. Again, as the trial judge concedes, the subrogation right there arose \u201cas a matter of private insurance contract and not by virtue of the law of a sister state.\u201d 125 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 327. We consider the distinction to be crucial. The court in that case was not confronted with any choice-of-law issues, but only with a question of local law. In the instant case, however, the issue is not what the local law should be, but rather whether that law, or a conflicting foreign law, should apply. We have concluded that New York law should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Nor do we agree, as plaintiffs argue, that New Jersey\u2019s interest in settlement of litigation warrants rejection of New York\u2019s law that the insurers\u2019 liens are not subject to deductions for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. We are not persuaded that imposition of such fees and costs will, in the words of the trial court, \u201cremove an .impediment to the settlement of disputes in our courts.\u201d <em>125.N. J. Super, </em>at 328. We do agree that the cooperation of the subrogee-insurer is frequently a substantial factor in effecting settlements. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>that \u201ccooperation\u201d is exemplified by the willingness of the insurer to reduce the amount of its lien. Therefore it may be argued that reduction of the lien by the amount of the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs will give the insurer less leeway to reduce its lien. In that instance the insurer would have less monies available for reduction of its lien and less motivation for cooperation in settlement negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">While the trial court would consider that the <em>renvoi </em>doctrine, rejected by this court in <em>In re Damato, </em>86 <em>N. J. Super. </em>107, 115-116 (App. Div. 1965), has been reborn by reason of the revision of the <em>Restatement, Conflict of Laws </em>2d, \u00a7 8 (1971), we disagree. We recognize the revision made in the <em>Restatement </em>of 1971, but we do not consider that it dilutes the soundness of the reasoning of <em>In re Damato </em>in rejecting the doctrine because of its inherent capacity for confusion and unending \u201ccircular process.\u201d We consider <em>In re Damato </em>still to be the law of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"> Lastly, respondents argue that under the Full Faith and Credit Clause the giving of effect to one part of a foreign statute (in this case the \u201cexistence\u201d of the statutory lien) does not preclude rejection of other parts (here non deductibility for fees and costs). We accept that proposition. But it does not follow that such other parts should not be accepted where, as here, the interests of the foreign state predominate. Here we hold that New York\u2019s interests are such that choice-of-law principles dictate recognition of all aspects of the insurers\u2019 liens \u25a0 \u2014 \u2022 the nature, extent of recovery and the condition thereof, and, more particularly, their recovery without deduction for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">For the foregoing reasons the judgments below, insofar as they ordered that the companies\u2019 liens were subject to deductions for attorneys\u2019 fees for services rendered in the New Jersey third-party actions, are reversed. The cases are remanded to the trial court for proceedings in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
