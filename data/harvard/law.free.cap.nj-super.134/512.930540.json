J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AFM\">The parties were married on September 10, 1955. On October 19, 1972 plaintiff wife filed a complaint for divorce seeking, among other things, equitable distribution of all real and personal property. Although the matter was originally contested, defendant withdrew his opposition thereto and plaintiff submitted uncontested proof of her divorce action. Additionally, the parties agreed upon an equitable distribution of their property, with the exception of plaintiff\u2019s interest, if any, in a pension plan held by defendant as a fireman in the Town of Bloomfield. That issue, by the terms of the judgment of divorce dated July 27, 1973, was \u201creserved for further hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">On April 4, 1973 a hearing was held at which the parties stipulated that defendant (presently 45 years of age) was employed as a fireman in Bloomfield from 1962 to the date of the hearing. Both he and his employer contributed to a pension plan. Thereafter, with the consent of the parties, defendant obtained and filed a letter from the Department of Treasury, Division of Pensions, which indicated that as of October 1972 (when the complaint herein was filed) defendant\u2019s pension contribution was $5917.26 and that \u201cThese <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>monies are returnable to the member should he resign or be dismissed prior to qualifying for a benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The trial court determined that plaintiff was not entitled to participate in the funds contributed by defendant because there had been \u201cno vesting\u201d thereof in him since he had not either resigned or been dismissed. An appropriate judgment was entered and plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">On this appeal, plaintiff, pursuant to <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A :34 \u2014 23, seeks an equitable distribution of the sum of $5917.26 contributed by defendant to the pension plan. She asserts that this sum was \u201clegally and beneficially acquired by them or either of them during the marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">At the outset we specifically note that plaintiff seeks an equitable distribution of defendant\u2019s <em>contribution </em>to the pension plan. She does not seek a distribution of the ultimate sum to be paid to defendant upon retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\"><em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43 :16A-1 <em>et seq. </em>(Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System) governs all of the rights and obligations of municipal firemen with respect to contributions, retirement and pensions. The following statutory definitions and distinctions are material to the issue herein involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">\u201cAggregate contributions\u201d shall mean the sum of all the amounts, deducted from the compensation of a member or contributed by him or on his behalf, standing to the credit of his individual account in the annuity savings fund. [A. <em>J. S. A. </em>48:16A-1(10)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">\u201cAnnuity\u201d shall mean payments for life derived from the aggregate contributions of a member. [(11)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-10\">\u201cPension\u201d shall mean payments for life derived from contributions by the employer. [(12)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">\u201cRetirement allowance\u201d shall mean the pension plus the annuity. [(13)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">In the event any member fireman resigns or is dismissed from his position before retirement he shall be entitled to the repayment of his \u201caggregate contribution.\u201d If he dies before withdrawing the same, then it shall be paid to his designated beneficiary. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43 :16A-2 and 16A-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">Additionally, a member may retire in accordance with any of the following plans: \u201cservice\u201d \u2014 voluntary at age 55 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>and mandatory at age 65 years (IV. <em>J. S. A. </em>43:16A \u2014 5); \u201cordinary disability\u201d \u2014 under 55 years with 5 years of creditable service <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>43: 16A-6); \u201caccidental disability\u201d (IV. <em>J. S. A. </em>43:16A-7); \u201cspecial\u201d \u2014 after 25 years of creditable service but before attaining the age of 55 years (IV. <em>J. 8. A. </em>43:16A-11.1), and \u201cdeferred\u201d \u2014 after 15 years of creditable service but before reaching the age of 55 years (IV. <em>J. 8. A. </em>43 :16A-11.2). In each of the above instances the member, upon retirement, receives a service \u201cretirement allowance\u201d which includes \u201can annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of his <em>aggregate </em>contributions\u201d (emphasis supplied) plus his pension which varies in amount in each of the above situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Further, upon the death of a member who has retired under any of the above plans, provision is made for the payment of a specified sum to the deceased member\u2019s beneficiary which is based in part upon the contributions made by him. Likewise, if a member dies during active service, there is paid to his beneficiary or to his widow, children or parent, as the case may be, a sum which again is made up in part by all or a portion of his contributions. IV. <em>J. 8. A. </em>43 :16A-9 and 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Under the above cited statute defendant (or his beneficiary) has the absolute right to the repayment of his contributions either directly or as part of his retirement benefits (or as a death benefit). Thus, since defendant has a present fixed right to the future enjoyment of the contributions paid by him, even though the date of that enjoyment be uncertain, his interest therein is vested. <em>Cf. Montclair Nat\u2019l Bank v. Seton Hall College of Med., </em>96 N. <em>J. Super. </em>428, 435 (App. Div.), certif. den. 50 N. <em>J. </em>301 (1967). As to the distinction between an employee\u2019s interest in his retirement allowance and in the contributions made by him, see <em>Phillipson v. Bd. of Admin., </em>3 Cal. 3d 32, 89 Cal. Rptr. 61, 473 <em>P. </em>2d 765, 770, n. 8 (Sup. Ct. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">We are mindful of our Supreme Court\u2019s suggestion that the concept of \u201cvesting\u201d should probably find no significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>place in the developing law of equitable distribution and that the customary uses of that concept are not relevant to the question of effecting such distribution. <em>Stern v. Stern, </em>66 <em>N. J. </em>340, 348 (1975). As the court said therein, \u201cOur statute requires, in order that property be available for distribution incident to a divorce, that it shall have been <em>acquired </em>during marriage. There is no reference to vesting.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"> In approaching the problem in this manner, we first note that <em>Painter v. Painter, 65 N. J. </em>196, 215-217 (1974) mandates that the word \u201cacquired,\u201d as used in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:34-23, must be construed in a \u201ccomprehensive sense.\u201d So viewed, we conclude that the $5917.26 contributed by defendant from his earnings during the marriage to plaintiff (up until the date of the filing of the complaint herein) is property \u201cacquired\u201d during the marriage and subject to equitable distribution under the statute. <em>Cf. DiTolvo v. DiTolvo, </em>131 <em>N. J. Super. </em>72 (App. Div. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><em>Tucker v. Tucker, </em>121 <em>N. J. Super. </em>539 (Ch. Div. 1972), relied upon by the trial judge, is factually inapposite. There the husband made no contributions to the private employer\u2019s incentive compensation and pension plan and consequently had no right of withdrawal before retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In determining that the $5917.26 contributed by defendant is subject to equitable distribution, we are not directing an actual apportionment of that specific fund. Rather the amount thereof must be examined and valued as one element to be included in determining the entire assets to be allocated between the parties. In so including it the trial judge will fix such percentage or portion thereof which, under the existing circumstances, is equitable and just. <em>Cf. Stern v. Stern, supra, </em>66 <em>N. J. </em>at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Accordingly, that portion of the judgment entered by the trial judge which determined that plaintiff is not entitled to participate in the sum of $5917.26 contributed by defendant to the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>reversed and the matter is remanded for a hearing in accordance herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Reversed and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
