James J. Thompson (Thompson)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought this action against, among others, Michael S. Ioane, Sr., Shelly J. Ioane, and their adult children Briana C. Ioane, Ashley M. Ioane, and Michael S. Ioane, Jr. (collectively, the Ioanes).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Briana filed a cross-complaint against Thompson, asserting a number of claims, including one for quiet title to the Blue Gum property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-10\">The trial court sustained Thompson\u2019s demurrer to Briana\u2019s cross-complaint and, later, granted summary judgment in Thompson\u2019s favor and against the Ioanes on causes of action for quiet title and declaratory relief. On Thompson\u2019s motion, the trial court found Michael and Shelly to be vexatious litigants and imposed a prefiling order against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-11\">Michael, Shelly, and Briana (collectively, appellants) appealed and are proceeding in propria persona. In appeal <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Ioane </em>(H042104), Briana appeals the order sustaining Thompson\u2019s demurrer to her cross-complaint. All three appellants appeal the grant of summary judgment in appeal <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Ioane </em>(H043112). Michael and Shelly appeal the prefifing order in appeal <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Ioane </em>(H043350).</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-12\">We reverse and remand with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>I. Background<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">A. <em>Factual </em>Background<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">The Blue Gum property was sold at a foreclosure sale in August 1998.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, Bank United filed an unlawful detainer action against Michael in <em>Bank United </em>v. <em>Ioane </em>(Super. Ct. Santa Cruz County, 1999, No. MS981411). In June 1999, the court entered judgment ordering that Bank United take possession of the Blue Gum property from Michael and that a writ of possession be issued.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>Shelly filed for bankruptcy. She and Michael filed an adversary proceeding against Bank United and others in her bankruptcy case. In their first amended complaint, they alleged that they were the owners of the Blue Gum property, that the foreclosure sale was invalid, and that the writ of possession issued in the state unlawful detainer action was invalid. They sought possession of the Blue Gum property, among other relief. On July 10, 2000, the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of Bank United.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">In approximately the same timeframe, Michael and Shelly filed a separate civil suit against Bank United and others in federal district court (case No. 99-21119 SW). They alleged they had \u201ca paramount interest\u201d in the Blue Gum property, that Bank United lacked any claim to the Blue Gum property, and that the writ of possession issued in the state unlawful detainer action was invalid. As in the adversary proceeding, they sought possession of the Blue Gum property. In an order filed on August 25, 2000, the federal court dismissed the action with prejudice, \u2018\u201ceasily concluding] that the present litigation is just one more in a string of frivolous lawsuits filed by the Plaintiffs . . . .\u201d The court dismissed the majority of the causes of action pursuant to the <em>Rooker-F eldman </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> reasoning that those claims effectively sought federal court review of the state court\u2019s ruling in the unlawful detainer action. On September 26, 2000, the court imposed the sanction of prefiling review on Michael and Shelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">The Blue Gum property was deeded to Thompson and his wife in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">The Ioanes filed a quiet title action against, among others, the Thompsons in <em>Olson v. Aulman </em>(Super. Ct. Santa Cruz County, 2002, No. CV138163). On July 24, 2002, the superior court granted a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Thompson and his wife. The court later entered judgment in favor of the Thompsons. That judgment called for the Thompsons to recover their costs, but did not purport to quiet title in the Thompsons\u2019 favor. This court affirmed that judgment on December 19, 2003. <em>(Olson v. Murray </em>(Dec. 19, 2003, H024770) [nonpub. opn.] <em>(Olson).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">The Ioanes have recorded a number of documents regarding the Blue Gum property with the Santa Cruz County Recorder since the issuance of this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Olson </em>in 2003. For example, a grant deed was recorded on February 15, 2005, purporting to transfer title to the Blue Gum property from Michael to Lesieli Tavake on behalf of his then-minor children Ashley, Briana, and Michael, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\">Thompson filed a verified first amended complaint on June 13, 2014, against the Ioanes and others.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He sought a judgment quieting title in his favor, cancellation of various written instruments, and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">On January 15, 2015, the court sustained a demurrer filed by Shelly, Michael, and Michael, Jr., to the cancellation of instruments cause of action with leave to amend, which Thompson did not. Instead, he dismissed the cancellation of instruments cause of action against Ashley and Briana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">Briana filed a cross-complaint asserting claims for quiet title, conversion, malicious prosecution, cancellation of written instruments, and declaratory relief on November 5, 2014. She sought cancellation of nine instruments, including the 2001 grant deed to the Thompsons. Thompson demurred, arguing that the quiet title, conversion, cancellation of written instruments, and declaratory relief claims were barred by res judicata (claim preclusion). He further argued that the conversion, malicious prosecution, and declaratory relief claims failed to state sufficient facts to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">On February 26, 2015, the court sustained Thompson\u2019s demurrer to each of Briana\u2019s causes of action without leave to amend. It ruled that the quiet title claim was barred by claim preclusion, the conversion claim failed to state sufficient facts to state a cause of action and was barred by claim preclusion, the malicious prosecution claim failed to state sufficient facts to state a cause of action, the cancellation of written instruments claim was barred by claim preclusion, and the declaratory relief claim failed to state sufficient facts to state a cause of action and was barred by claim preclusion. Brianna filed a notice of appeal on March 17, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">On March 18, 2015, Thompson filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that claim preclusion or issue preclusion barred appellants\u2019 defenses. The trial court granted that motion in an order filed on October 21, 2015. Michael, Shelly, and Briana filed notices of appeal on December 21, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">In January 2016, pursuant to a motion made by Thompson, the trial court entered a vexatious litigant prefiling order against Michael and Shelly. They appealed from that order on March 14, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">The court entered judgment on March 25, 2016. It quieted title to the Blue Gum property in Thompson as of May 30, 2001. The judgment enjoined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>appellants \u201cto make no further claim to said Blue Gum Property adverse to plaintiff, by legal action or otherwise, on the basis of any fact or facts that were proved, or which might have been proved, in the action.\u201d The court also ordered cancellation of 16 recorded documents. Finally, the court declared that Thompson \u201cis the sole owner of the fee simple title of the Blue Gum Property; and that [appellants] have no legal or equitable right, title, estate, lien, or interest in the Blue Gum Property adverse to plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">II. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">A. <em>Appealability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">As a threshold matter, we note that each of appellants\u2019 three appeals was filed prematurely from a nonappealable order before judgment had been entered. While Thompson does not raise an appealability challenge, \u201c[t]he existence of an appealable judgment is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal. A reviewing court must raise the issue on its own initiative whenever a doubt exists as to whether the trial court has entered a final judgment or other order or judgment made appealable by Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Jennings v. Marralle </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 121, 126-127 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 275, 876 P.2d 1074].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">Briana appealed from the order sustaining Thompson\u2019s demurrer to her cross-complaint. But \u201c[a]n order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend is not appealable, and an appeal is proper only after entry of a dismissal on such an order.\u201d <em>(Sisemore </em>v. <em>Master Financial, Inc. </em>(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1386, 1396 [60 Cal.Rptr.3d 719].) Appellants all appealed from the order granting summary judgment to Thompson, which also was not appealable. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (m)(1)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; see <em>Saben, Earlix &amp; Associates v. Fillet </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1024, 1030 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 610].) And Michael and Shelly appealed from the prefiling order, which was nonappealable. <em>(In re Bittaker </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1008 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 679].) Appellants should have sought review of each nonappealable order on a single appeal from the final judgment entered against them in March 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">The California Rules of Court allow us to \u201ctreat a notice of appeal filed after the superior court has announced its intended ruling, but before it has rendered judgment, as filed immediately after entry of judgment.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.104(d)(2).) \u201c[S]ince an appealable judgment was later entered, the notice[s] of appeal [are] merely premature. [Citation.] [Therefore], \u2018we will liberally construe the appeal [s] to have been taken from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>judgment of dismissal.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Doan v.

Regents of University of California </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 120, 125 [271 Cal.Rptr. 146, 793 P.2d 479].) Because a demurrer tests only the legal sufficiency of the pleading, the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true. <em>(Berg &amp; Berg Enterprises, LLC v. Boyle </em>(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1034 [100 Cal.Rptr.3d 875] <em>(Berg &amp; Berg Enterprises).) </em>We do not review the validity of the trial court\u2019s reasoning, and therefore will affirm its ruling if it was correct on any theory. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Nor are we \u2018\u201climited to plaintiff\u2019s] theory of recovery in testing the sufficiency of [its] complaint against a demurrer, but instead must determine if the <em>factual </em>allegations of the complaint are adequate to state a cause of action under any legal theory.\u201d <em>(Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 94, 103 [101 Cal.Rptr. 745, 496 P.2d 817].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">\u2018\u201cWhere a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, [we] must determine whether there is a reasonable probability that the complaint could have been amended to cure the defect; if so, [we] will conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the plaintiff leave to amend. [Citation.] The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that it could have amended the complaint to cure the defect.\u201d <em>(Berg &amp; Berg Enterprises, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.4th at p. 1035.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\">b. <em>Claim </em>Preclusion<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1113-10\"><em>\u201cClaim preclusion </em>\u2018prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same parties or parties in privity with them.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>[Citation.] Claim preclusion arises if a second suit involves (1) the same cause of action (2) between the same parties (3) after a final judgment on the merits in the first suit. [Citations.] If claim preclusion is established, it operates to bar relitigation of the claim altogether.\u201d <em>(DKN Holdings, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 824.)

Puritan Leasing Co. </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 481, 485 [143 Cal.Rptr. 772].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">2. <em>Conversion and Malicious Prosecution Causes of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">On appeal, Briana argues the court erred in sustaining the demurrer on claim preclusion grounds. As noted above, the court sustained the demurrer as to certain claims on the ground that the cross-complaint failed to state sufficient facts to state a cause of action. Briana does not address that ground. Only the quiet title and cancellation of written instrument claims were disposed of solely on claim preclusion grounds. (Thompson demurred to the claim for declaratory relief on the ground that it was wholly derivative of the other causes of action, and thus failed if they failed.) Therefore, we affirm the order sustaining the demurrer as to the conversion and malicious prosecution causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">3. <em>Quiet Title Cause of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">Briana acknowledges that she and the other Ioanes filed an action to quiet title to the Blue Gum property against the Thompsons in case No. CV138163 more than a decade ago. At Thompson\u2019s request, the trial court took judicial notice of court records related to that quiet title action, including (1) the trial court order granting the Thompsons\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, (2) the trial court judgment in favor of the Thompsons, and (3) the <em>Olson </em>decision issued by this court affirming the trial court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-10\">In view of the foregoing, Thompson contends that claim preclusion bars Briana\u2019s cross-claim seeking to quiet title to the Blue Gum property. She disagrees, attacking the validity of the 1998 foreclosure sale, the supposed basis for the judgment on the pleadings in the Thompsons\u2019 favor in case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>No. CV138163,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and this court\u2019s decision affirming that judgment, which she says got the facts wrong. Briana did not raise any of these arguments below in opposition to Thompson\u2019s demurrer; as such, she forfeited them. <em>(Perez </em>v. <em>Grejales </em>(2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 580, 591-592 [86 Cal.Rptr.3d 784] <em>(Perez) </em>[\u201carguments raised for the first time on appeal are generally deemed forfeited\u201d].) Moreover, as discussed below, they fail on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\">All of the elements of claim preclusion were met, such that the trial court did not err in sustaining Thompson\u2019s demurrer to Briana\u2019s cross-claim to quiet title to the Blue Gum property. First, case No. CV138163 and Briana\u2019s cross-complaint involved identical causes of action\u2014to quiet title to the Blue Gum property. Second, the actions involved the same parties\u2014 Briana and Thompson. Third, there was a final judgment on the merits in case No. CV138163. Briana\u2019s arguments regarding the validity of the 1998 foreclosure sale and the merits of the Thompsons\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings in case No. CV138163 could have been raised in the prior action. Briana notes that she \u201cdid not argue a lack of privity between Bank United and the Thompsons\u201d on appeal from the judgment in case No. CV138163. But, for purposes of claim preclusion, that matters not. <em>(Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 897 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 51 P.3d 297] [claim preclusion requires that \u201call claims based on the same cause of action must be decided in a single suit; if not brought initially, they may not be raised at a later date\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">Briana\u2019s challenge to this court\u2019s decision affirming the judgment in Thompson\u2019s favor in case No. CV138163 is unavailing. For purposes of claim preclusion, \u201can erroneous judgment is as conclusive as a correct one.\u201d <em>(McKinney </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 787, 795 [168 Cal.Rptr. 89].) Therefore, even if this court got the facts wrong, as Briana claims, the doctrine of claim preclusion applies. <em>(Hawkins </em>v. <em>SunTrust Bank </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1387, 1393 [206 Cal.Rptr.3d 681] [claim preclusion bars \u201c \u2018 \u201crelitigation of a factual dispute even in those instances where the factual dispute was erroneously decided ....\u201d\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">To the extent Briana contends the final judgment in case No. CV138163 is void, that contention fails. \u201c \u2018A judgment is void if the court rendering it lacked subject matter jurisdiction or jurisdiction over the parties. Subject matter jurisdiction \u201crelates to the inherent authority of the court involved to deal with the case or matter before it.\u201d [Citation.] Lack of jurisdiction in this \u201cfundamental or strict sense means an entire absence of power to hear or determine the case, an absence of authority over the subject matter or the parties.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pajaro Valley Water Management </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number><em>Agency </em>v. <em>McGrath </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1100 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 741].) Briana does not suggest, let alone demonstrate, that the court rendering the earlier judgment acted without jurisdiction in the fundamental sense. Accordingly, the rule that \u201ca <em>void </em>judgment will not operate as a bar to relitigation of the issues purportedly adjudicated\u201d has no application. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">Briana\u2019s quiet title action fails for the independent reason that judicially noticeable facts show that her interest in the Blue Gum property depends on a void judgment, such that she cannot state a claim for quiet title. To prevail on a quiet title claim, a plaintiff must establish title to the property in dispute. (\u00a7 761.020; <em>Hoeller </em>v. <em>Lloyd </em>(1959) 173 Cal.App.2d 777, 778 [343 P.2d 929] <em>{Hoeller).) </em>Briana\u2019s cross-complaint traces her title to a January 2003 judgment in <em>Yates </em>v. <em>First Trust National </em>(Super. Ct. Santa Cruz County, 2003, No. CV139431) quieting title to the Blue Gum property in Michael. In ruling on Thompson\u2019s demurrer, the trial court took judicial notice of a March 2004 order in that case setting aside the January 2003 judgment as \u2018\u201cvoid ab[ ]initio as to title to\u201d the Blue Gum property. Thus, judicially noticeable facts demonstrate that Briana cannot establish title to the Blue Gum property, as she must to state a claim for quiet title.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">On appeal, Briana argues the March 2004 order is void because the judge who entered it acted in excess of his jurisdiction; she also questions the reasoning set forth in the order. She did not raise those arguments below, and thus they are forfeited. <em>(Perez, supra, </em>169 Cal.App.4th at pp. 591-592.) They also fail on the merits. Where a court \u201cacts in excess of its jurisdiction, its act or judgment is merely voidable. [Citations.] That is, its act or judgment is valid until it is set aside, and a party may be precluded from setting it aside by \u2018principles of estoppel, disfavor of collateral attack or res judicata.\u2019 [Citation.] Errors which are merely in excess of jurisdiction should be challenged directly, for example by motion to vacate the judgment, or on appeal, and are generally not subject to collateral attack once the judgment is final unless \u2018unusual circumstances were present which prevented an earlier and more appropriate attack.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>American Contractors Indemnity Co. </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 653, 661 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 76, 93 P.3d 1020].) Briana does not assert any such unusual circumstances. Accordingly, the March 2004 order is not void or subject to attack here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">4. <em>Cancellation of Written Instrumen ts Cause of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">\u201cUnder Civil Code section 3412, \u2018[a] written instrument, in respect to which there is a reasonable apprehension that if left outstanding it may cause serious injury to a person against whom it is void or voidable, may, upon his application, be so adjudged, and ordered to be delivered up or canceled.\u2019 To prevail on a claim to cancel an instrument, a plaintiff must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>prove (1) the instrument is void or voidable due to, for example, fraud, and (2) there is a reasonable apprehension of serious injury including pecuniary loss or the prejudicial alteration of one\u2019s position. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(U.S. Bank National Assn. v.

Thompson contends two undisputed facts establish his title: (1) Bank United obtained title by foreclosure and trustee\u2019s sale and (2) he and his wife purchased the property from Bank United. While Michael and Shelly did not properly dispute those facts, Briana did.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In any event, summary judgment is improper \u2018\u201c[w]here the evidence submitted by [the] moving [party] does not support judgment in his favor . . . .\u201d <em>(Y.K.A. Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Redevelopment Agency of City of San Jose </em>(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 339, 354 [94 Cal.Rptr.3d 424].) As such, courts have held that the opposing party\u2019s failure to file a proper separate statement as required by section 437c, subdivision (b), is grounds for summary judgment only where the moving party has met its initial burden of proof. <em>(Thatcher </em>v. <em>Lucky Stores, Inc. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1086 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 575]; <em>Kojababian v.

In view of the foregoing, we have no difficulty concluding that, regardless of any deficiencies in appellants\u2019 separate statements, summary judgment in Thompson\u2019s favor was proper only if he submitted evidence supporting judgment in his favor. He did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\">The only \u201cevidence\u201d Thompson produced in support of his claim that he purchased the Blue Gum property from Bank United was this court\u2019s decision in <em>Olson, </em>of which the court below took judicial notice. In the background section of that opinion, this court stated that the Thompsons \u201cpurchased the Blue Gum property from Bank United . . . .\u201d The trial court was not entitled to judicially notice the <em>truth </em>of that factual statement. (See <em>Sosinsky v. Grant </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1566 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 552] [\u201cjudicial notice of the truth of \u2018facts\u2019 stated in an appellate opinion\u2019s statement of facts is not appropriate\u201d].) We note that \u201c[w]hether a factual finding is true is a different question than whether the truth of that factual finding may or may not be subsequently litigated a second time. The doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel will, when they apply, serve to bar relitigation of a factual dispute even in those instances where the factual dispute was erroneously decided in favor of a party who did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>testify truthfully.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1569.) But Thompson does not argue that preclusion principles bar the relitigation of the issue of what entity sold him the Blue Gum property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">Thompson\u2019s own filings in this court and the court below reveal a triable issue of fact as to his chain of title. In the operative complaint, Thompson alleged that the basis of his title to the Blue Gum property is a grant deed from grantor First Trust National Association. His separate statement asserted he purchased the property from Bank United. On appeal, Thompson claims he purchased the property from Bank United and \u2018\u201c[a] deed conveying title . . . was delivered by First Trust National Association . . . .\u201d He also contends that First Trust National Association \u201cmerged or changed its name to Bank United,\u201d but he does not support that contention with citation to the record. Nor does he point us to any record evidence explaining the relationship between Bank United and First Trust National Association. Accordingly, there is a triable issue of fact as to whether Thompson purchased the Blue Gum property from Bank United or First Trust National Association. That fact is material to Thompson\u2019s ability to properly trace his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">Thompson does not appear to take the position that the prior quiet title action (case No. CV138163) established his title and is preclusive on that issue.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That is, he does not attempt to use issue preclusion offensively. <em>(Abelson </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 776, 787 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 13] [\u201cthe offensive use of collateral estoppel . . . occurs when a plaintiff seeks to prevent a defendant from relitigating an issue determined adversely to defendant in another action against plaintiff or another party\u201d].) Such an argument would fail. Issue preclusion \u201cprevents relitigation of previously decided issues\u201d\u2014those that were \u201cactually litigated and necessarily decided in the first suit.\u201d <em>(DKN Holdings, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at pp. 824-825.) Thompson has not shown that his title to the Blue Gum property was litigated and decided in case No. CV138163. The record establishes that, in that case, the Thompsons were granted judgment on the pleadings on the Ioanes\u2019 quiet title action and judgment was entered in their favor. That judgment called for the Ioanes to \u201crecover nothing against\u201d the Thompsons and for the Thompsons to recover their costs; it did not purport to quiet title in the Thompsons. Thus, the record demonstrates only that the Ioanes failed to establish title to the Blue Gum property, not that Thompson did so. Thompson contends he was \u201centitled to an affirmative decree quieting title in his name\u201d merely because he prevailed against the Ioanes\u2019 quiet title claim. But that cannot be right, as both Thompson and another defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>Washington Mutual (Bank United\u2019s successor), prevailed against the Ioanes\u2019 quiet title claim. It cannot be that they both were entitled to quiet title decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude Thompson failed to establish his own title to the Blue Gum property. Therefore, he did not meet his prima facie burden on the motion for summary judgment on the quiet title claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">3. <em>Thompson Did Not Establish His Right to Summary Judgment on His Declaratory Judgmen t Cause of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">Thompson sought a declaration that he was the sole owner of the Blue Gum property and that appellants have no interest in it.

[Citation.] Nonetheless, a court may determine whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose.

[\u00b6] [h]as previously been declared to be a vexatious litigant by any state or federal court of record in any action or proceeding based upon the same or substantially similar facts, transaction, or occurrence.\u201d Section 391, subdivision (b)(4) does not indicate <em>what </em>must be \u201cthe same or substantially similar\u201d to the basis for the prior suit, and thus requires judicial construction. Courts\u2014including the court below\u2014have construed section 391, subdivision (b)(4) to apply where the prior proceeding was based the same or substantially similar facts, transaction, or occurrence as <em>the current action. (Devereaux v. Latham &amp; Watkins </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>1571, 1581 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 849], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Moran v.

At issue is whether the person to be declared vexatious must be the plaintiff in the current action, as Michael and Shelly contend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-4\">Section 391 defines \u201cvexatious litigant\u201d as \u201ca person,\u201d not a plaintiff, whose litigation history contains particular behaviors (e.g., repeated attempts to relitigate (subd. (b)(2))). Thus, by its plain language, section 391, subdivision (b)(4) allows any party to an action to be declared a vexatious litigant. Under such a reading, anyone previously declared to be a vexatious litigant in another jurisdiction could be declared a vexatious litigant in California courts merely by being sued here. Such a result would be absurd and inconsistent with the statutory purpose of \u201ccurbing] misuse of the court system by those persistent and obsessive litigants who, repeatedly litigating the same issues through groundless actions, waste the time and resources of the court system and other litigants.\u201d <em>(Shalant </em>v. <em>Girardi </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 1164, 1169 [126 Cal.Rptr.3d 98, 253 P.3d 266].) The passive act of being sued constitutes neither a misuse of the court system, nor a waste of the time and resources of the court system and other litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">The foregoing is not to say that a defendant never can be declared a vexatious litigant. Section 391, subdivision (b)(3) applies to any litigant\u2014 plaintiff or defendant\u2014who, \u201cacting in propria persona, repeatedly files unmeritorious motions, pleadings, or other papers, conducts unnecessary discovery, or engages in other tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d (See <em>John, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at p. 99 [appellate courts have the authority to declare a defendant appellant or writ petitioner to be a vexatious litigant in the first instance during the course of an appeal from litigation the defendant or writ petitioner did not file under \u00a7 391, subd. (b)(3)].) Applying section 391, subdivision (b)(3) to both plaintiffs and defendants advances the purpose of the statute\u2014curbing abuse of the judicial system. Likewise, applying section 391, subdivision (b)(2) to any litigant, whether plaintiff or defendant, who repeatedly litigates prior determinations is consistent with the statutory purpose. But, the same cannot be said of an equally broad construction of section 391, subdivision (b)(4), which could ensnare litigants who have ceased their vexatious ways.
