Wilson, Sr., federal prisoner # 08746-035, was convicted by jury verdict for two counts of racketeering, one count of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE), one count of distribution of cocaine, and two counts of distribution of cocaine base. Wilson filed a \u00a7 2241 petition in district court alleging that: (1) the evidence regarding the actual substance involved in his offenses was insufficient in light of <em>DePierre v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2225, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011); and (2) the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the jury to find upon which specific violations his CCE conviction was based was erroneous in light of <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 824, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999). The district court dismissed that petition because it did not qualify for the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 savings clause and was an unauthorized \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Wilson argues on appeal that his claims meet the savings clause provision of \u00a7 2255 because the Supreme Court cases upon which he is relying are retroactively applicable on collateral review and serve to void his convictions. In an appeal from the denial of habeas corpus relief, the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error and issues of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). In <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 900-04 (5th Cir.2001), we held that in order to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the \u00a7 2255 savings clause, the petitioner must set forth a claim (1) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (2) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\"><em>DePierre </em>did not decriminalize Wilson\u2019s criminal conduct and has not been held to be retroactively applicable. Although <em>Richardson </em>is retroactively applicable, Wilson\u2019s challenge to his CCE conviction under <em>Richardson </em>does not meet the savings clause test because application of <em>Richardson </em>does not render the crime of conviction a nonexistent offense. <em>See Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830. Wilson has not demonstrated that the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
