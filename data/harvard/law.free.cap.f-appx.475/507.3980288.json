After the defendants asserted nonexhaustion, the district court dismissed White\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). White now moves for leave to proceed IFP on appeal following the district court\u2019s order denying IFP and certifying that his appeal is not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-21\">White argues that the district court erred by failing to grant him a continuance to meet the exhaustion requirement or to construe his IFP motion as a motion to reopen. Those claims lack legal support. He also contends that the district court should have granted his IFP motion because he is indigent, he was granted IFP status to proceed in district court, and justice should not be denied due to his poverty. Because White has not shown that the district court erred in holding that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to his claim, those arguments fail to show that the district court erred by certifying that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-22\">White also argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint with prejudice. This issue \u201cinvolves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because White\u2019s appeal is not entirely frivolous, White is entitled to proceed IFP on appeal, and his motion for IFP is granted. We may, however, address the merits of White\u2019s claim at the same time we resolve the IFP issue if it is expedient. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>A dismissal without prejudice would have been appropriate in this case. <em>See Wright v. Hollingsworth, 260 F.3d 357, 359 </em>(5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed as modified to reflect a dismissal without prejudice of White\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">IFP GRANTED; AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b539-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
