The district court\u2019s ruling is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-22\">Cardenas argues that the district court adopted the Government\u2019s response, which erroneously construed his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as one based on Amendment 750, instead of Amendment 484. He further contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion without reviewing his timely filed objections to the Government\u2019s response. He contends that his case should be remanded for an eviden-tiary hearing so that he may \u201chave the drugs reweighed for sentencing purpose[s] absent all waste and packaging material in accordance with amendment 484 and the 1993 Guideline Manual 1B1.10 (policy statement).\u201d The Government has moved for summary affirmance, arguing that Cardenas is not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-23\">Contrary to Cardenas\u2019s assertion, the district court did not adopt the Government\u2019s response, but rather denied Cardenas\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without reasons. Further, there is no evidence that the district court failed to consider any objections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>filed by Cardenas. Nevertheless, even assuming Cardenas\u2019s assertion is true, any error was harmless since Cardenas is not entitled to relief. Cardenas is not eligible for a sentence reduction because he was sentenced to a statutory mandatory life sentence due to his prior convictions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, emt. n. 1A; <em>see also United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 581 (5th Cir.2010). Further, Cardenas\u2019s guidelines range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, but rather from his career offender status. Thus, he is not entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 3582. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Sewell, </em>77 F.3d 480, 1996 WL 46546, at *1 (5th Cir. Jan. 17, 1996)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Moreover, Amendment 484 became effective on November 1, 1993, prior to Cardenas\u2019s sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, amend. 484, p. 322 (1993). As such, Cardenas\u2019s argument is not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) since he could have raised his argument at sentencing or on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cardenas\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary. Cardenas\u2019s motion to remand is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
