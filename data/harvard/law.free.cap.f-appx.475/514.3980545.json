In this interlocutory appeal, Terry challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a preliminary injunction. Additionally, the instant appeal challenges the district court\u2019s denial of Terry\u2019s motion to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-20\">Interlocutory orders denying preliminary injunctions are immediately appeal-able as an exception to the final judgment rule. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1); <em>Lakedreams v. Taylor, </em>932 F.2d 1103, 1107 (5th Cir.1991). However, we lack jurisdiction to decide moot questions or issues that cannot affect the rights of the parties to the appeal. <em>McRae v. Hogan, </em>576 F.2d 615, 617 (5th Cir.1978). While this appeal was pending, the district court entered a final judgment dismissing Terry\u2019s suit, which included a request for permanent injunc-tive relief. The entry of a final judgment regarding permanent injunctive relief moots any order regarding temporary in-junctive relief. <em>See Louisiana World Exposition, Inc. v. Logue, </em>746 F.2d 1033, 1038 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-21\">With regard to the order denying Terry\u2019s discovery motion, Terry points to no authority vesting us with jurisdiction to grant him relief in this appeal. The district court\u2019s denial was entered before final judgment was entered, and we are without jurisdiction to review such an order in an interlocutory appeal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1292(a)(1); <em>Texaco Inc. v. Louisiana Land &amp; Exploration Co., </em>995 F.2d 43, 44 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-22\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b546-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
