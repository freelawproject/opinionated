Ibarra argues that his sentence, which is in the middle of his advisory guidelines range of 41 to 51 months of imprisonment, is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary as measured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>the factors identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Ibarra does not contend that the district court committed any procedural error in imposing his sentence. Thus, our review is confined to whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We have consistently rejected Ibarra\u2019s \u201cdouble counting\u201d argument and his argument that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 results in an excessive sentence because it is not empirically based. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.2009). We also have rejected the \u201cinternational trespass\u201d argument that Ibarra asserts. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">As to Ibarra\u2019s argument that the Sentencing Guidelines failed to account for the circumstances of his offense or his history, at sentencing, the district court considered the advisory guidelines range, Ibarra\u2019s objection to the presentence report, Ibarra\u2019s arguments in support of a variance from the advisory guidelines range, Ibarra\u2019s statement in allocution, the Government\u2019s request for a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range, and the factors identified in \u00a7 3553, determining that a 46-month sentence was appropriate. The record reflects that the district court made an individualized determination at sentencing based on the facts presented and in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">\u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Ibarra argues, for the purpose of preservation of the issue for possible further review by the Supreme Court, that a sentence imposed under \u00a7 2L1.2 should not be accorded that presumption \u201cbecause, without empirical basis, the guideline double-counts criminal history.\u201d As he concedes, however, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). Ibarra has not shown that the district court failed to give proper weight to his arguments or to any particular \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). He has thus failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that is accorded his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See id.; United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b981-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
