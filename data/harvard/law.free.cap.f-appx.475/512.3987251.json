Given the drug quantity involved in his offense, Brown\u2019s base offense level would have been 34; however, the district court determined that Brown was a career offender, which resulted in an offense level of 37 and placement in criminal history category VI. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Brown received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and, as a result of his substantial assistance, the district court downwardly departed by four levels on the Government\u2019s motion, resulting in a total offense level of 30. The district court imposed a 168-month term of imprisonment, which was at the bottom of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Brown now seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court also denied Brown\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP, certifying that his appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">When a district court certifies that an appeal is not taken in good faith, a prisoner may either pay the filing fee or challenge the district court\u2019s certification decision by moving for IFP in this court. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into the prisoner\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted). Probable success on the merits is not required. <em>Id. </em>If the merits of the appeal are \u201cinextricably intertwined with the certification decision,\u201d such as when the district court certifies that an appeal is not taken in good faith because the underlying claims are frivolous and have no possibility of success, we may determine both issues. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">Brown argues that he is entitled to a reduction in his sentence pursuant to Amendment 750, a retroactive amendment that altered the Drug Quantity Table of \u00a7 2D1.1 based on the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA). However, as discussed above, Brown\u2019s guideline range was calculated based on his career offender status rather than on the drug quantity involved in his offense. In view of the foregoing, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Brown\u2019s motion for a reduction in his sentence, as Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">Because he has failed to demonstrate that his appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 3582 motion involves legal points arguable on the merits, Brown\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Further, because it is apparent that an appeal would lack mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>it, the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
