Shkambi is charged with conspiring to distribute or to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine, heroin, marijuana, or ecstacy, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. He contends that he is not a flight risk or a danger to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">Shkambi is proceeding pro se, although the record shows that he is represented by counsel. We do not permit hybrid representation. Uni<em>ted States v. Ogbonna, </em>184 F.3d 447, 449 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.1999); 5th Cir. R. 28.6. Further, the record evidence support\u2019s the district court\u2019s determination that no conditions exist that would reasonably assure Shkambi\u2019s appearance and the safety of the community were he to be released pending trial. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Shkambi release pending trial. <em>United States v. Rueben, </em>974 F.2d 580, 586 (5th Cir.1992); <em>United States v.
