By moving to proceed IFP, Laws is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5). This court\u2019s inquiry into the litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">Laws contends that the district court abused its discretion in declining to reduce his sentence based on retroactive Amendment 750.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> The district court correctly concluded that Laws was not entitled to relief based on Amendment 750 because, even without consideration of the crack cocaine in his case, he was responsible for 750.7 grams of powder cocaine, which drug quantity alone results in the same base offense level and guidelines range he faced at sentencing. Because Amendment 750 did not result in a lower sentencing guidelines range in Laws\u2019 case, the district court did not err in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">Nevertheless, Laws argues that, in the interests of fairness, the district court should have additionally considered a sentencing reduction based on the fact that 93% of the powder cocaine for which he was held accountable resulted from an improper conversion of cash seized at the time of his arrest to drugs for sentencing purposes. Laws may not raise this claim now. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009) (stating that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not a proper vehicle for asserting challenges to the original sentencing); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">Laws has not demonstrated any arguably nonfrivolous claim for appeal. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, his request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-15\">Additionally, Laws\u2019 attempt to challenge the cash-to-drugs conversion through a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is a continuation of his repetitious filings seeking to raise the claim despite its having been raised and rejected on direct appeal and in his \u00a7 2255 motion. Laws is therefore cautioned that any future frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings may result in the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
