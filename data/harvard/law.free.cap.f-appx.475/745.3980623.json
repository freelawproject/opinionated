Two months after Tifton closed, on January 13, 2011, the plaintiffs filed suit against Tifton in Georgia state court. On March 28, 2011, the FDIC filed a motion to substitute itself as a party for Tifton in the state court action. The FDIC attached to its motion copies of the documents appointing it as Tifton\u2019s receiver. Before the state court could rule on the motion, the FDIC filed a notice of removal in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-24\">The plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the ease to state court, arguing that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case because the state court had not entered an order substituting the FDIC as a party. The district court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion. It determined that since the FDIC had not been substituted in the manner required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(c), it was not a party for the purposes of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1819(b)(2)(B), the FDIC removal provision. The FDIC appeals the district court\u2019s remand order.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">We recently addressed the issues raised in this appeal in <em>FDIC v. North Savannah Properties, LLC, </em>686 F.3d 1254 (11th Cir.2012). We held that the FDIC becomes a party for the purposes of removal under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1819(b)(2)(B) once it is appointed receiver and files a notice of substitution; the state court does have to enter an order of substitution for subject-matter jurisdiction to exist. In light of our decision in <em>North Savannah Properties, </em>we vacate the district court\u2019s remand order. And because we conclude that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case, we also vacate the district court\u2019s order vacating its prior order of substitution of the FDIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
