That sentence was below the advisory guidelines sentencing range of 77 to 96 months. It was not, however, as far below that range as Mondragon suggested it should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">Because Mondragon does not contend that the district court committed any procedural error, we need only review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). We review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Ordinarily, an appellate court reviewing for reasonableness \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). This is true whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. In the present case, however, it might be argued that Mondragon is relegated to review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir. 2007). Nevertheless, we pretermit consideration of that issue, as Mondragon cannot prevail even under the less deferential standard of review for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. </em>Rodriguez, 523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The district court considered the idea of a sentence lower than the one it finally selected. Although it agreed that a sentence below the guidelines range was appropriate because of Mondragon\u2019s cultural assimilation within the United States, the district court did not believe that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as a whole counseled in favor of a sentence that would in effect negate the 16-level adjustment resulting from the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), as Mondragon requested. Although cultural assimilation may be considered as a ground for imposing a more lenient sentence, cultural assimilation is not to be given dispositive weight. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Thus, Mon-dragon\u2019s implicit argument that the cultural assimilation factor suffices to tip the balancing of the sentencing factors in favor of a lower sentence is contrary to our precedent. <em>See id. </em>We discern no basis for disturbing the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion in evaluating the totality of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456; <em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b557-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
