Martinez, federal prisoner # 51047-189, has applied for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in this appeal from the denial of his motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for a reduction of his sentence in light of Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Martinez pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine base (crack) with intent to distribute and was held accountable for 5.8 grams of crack. The district court denied the reduction in his sentence because Martinez is a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, such that Amendment 750 did not have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>effect of lowering his guidelines range of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Martinez argues that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion was an abuse of discretion because, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u00a7 4B1.1 is not mandatory. This argument is foreclosed. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009). Although application of Amendment 750 would reduce Martinez\u2019s base offense level, it does not ultimately alter the sentencing guidelines range. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(3). Accordingly, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in Martinez\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 IB 1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Because Martinez was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 750, he cannot show that he will present a nonfrivolous issue with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2691; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Martinez\u2019s request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b561-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
