Avery argues that the district court erred by sentencing him to the mandatory minimum in effect at the time of his crime under the AntiDrug Abuse Act, instead of the mandatory minimum provided in the Fair Sentencing Act, which took effect before Avery\u2019s sentencing hearing. The government confesses error. At sentencing, the district court stated that a 120-month sentence was \u201crather harsh,\u201d but the district court ruled that its \u201chands [were] tied\u201d and it had \u201cno alternative\u201d but to sentence Avery to the mandatory term of imprisonment. After Avery appealed, the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2331, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), that \u201cCongress intended the ... more lenient penalties [under the Fair Sentencing Act] to apply to those offenders whose crimes preceded August 3, 2010, but who are sentenced after that date.\u201d Dorsey instructs that the Fair Sentencing Act ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>plies to Avery. We vacate Avery\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
