On remand, the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed with the finding of the immigration judge that the Department of Homeland Security presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that Ugaz had a well-founded fear of persecution if forced to return to Peru. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)\u00ae. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">Ugaz applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture on account of persecution based on her criticism of a Peruvian terrorist organization, Shining Path. The immigration judge denied relief based on its finding that Ugaz\u2019s testimony failed to establish past persecution or that she was unable to relocate within Peru. The Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed Ugaz\u2019s appeal. The Board found Ugaz\u2019s testimony credible, but the Board found that Ugaz had failed to prove past persecution or that she had a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">This Court granted Ugaz\u2019s petition for review of the denial of asylum and vacated the order that denied Ugaz\u2019s application. <em>Ugaz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>275 Fed.Appx. 848 (11th Cir.2008). We held that the evidence compelled a finding that Ugaz had been persecuted on account of her political opinion and \u201centitle[d] her to a rebuttable presumption that she [had] a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 853. We declined to consider whether Ugaz could relocate within Peru because the Board \u201cmade no ... findings\u201d on that issue, <em>id. </em>at 853 n. 3, and we remanded for further proceedings in which the Department could present evidence to \u201crebut[ ] [the] presumption\u201d about Ugaz\u2019s fear of future persecution, <em>id. </em>at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">On remand, the immigration judge and the Board again denied Ugaz asylum relief. During an evidentiary hearing, Ugaz and the Department agreed that the immigration judge could reach a decision by \u201cinterpret[ing] ... the current <em>Country Reports.\u201d </em>The immigration judge found that the 2009 Country Report and other documents submitted by the parties \u201cprove[d] by a preponderance of the evidence that the Shining Path of the present is not the same organization as it was in the past and ... has [no] interest in con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>timing to persecute\u201d Ugaz. The immigration judge also found that there was \u201cno indication that [Ugaz] could not avoid future persecution by relocating\u201d in Peru. The Board dismissed Ugaz\u2019s appeal. The Board agreed with the findings of the immigration judge that conditions had changed in Peru since Ugaz had first applied for asylum and that Ugaz had \u201cfailed to show that she was unable to relocate with Peru to avoid the threat of future persecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Ugaz challenges the decision of the Board on two grounds. First, Ugaz argues that the Board erred as a matter of law in its determination that she could relocate within Peru. Second, Ugaz argues that the Department failed to establish that there has been a fundamental change in conditions in Peru to rebut the presumption that Ugaz has a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Ugaz\u2019s arguments require that we apply two standards in reviewing her petition. First, we review <em>de novo </em>any legal decision of the Board. <em>Lopez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1341, 1344 (11th Cir.2007). Second, we review all factual findings of the Board under the \u201chighly deferential substantial-evidence test\u201d which requires that we \u201c \u2018affirm the ... decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1199 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting Al <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001)). We will not disturb a finding of the Board unless the \u201c \u2018record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">On return from remand, we review only whether the Department rebutted the presumption that Ugaz has a well-founded fear of future persecution in Peru. A presumption about future persecution may be rebutted if the Board makes one of two findings: (1) \u201c[t]here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution\u201d; or (2) \u201c[t]he applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of [her] country of nationality.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(A) &amp; (B). The Department bears the burden of rebutting the presumption by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(ii); <em>see, e.g., Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1352 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">The Board erroneously placed the burden of proof on Ugaz to prove that she was unable to relocate within Peru. In its decision, the Board overlooked the \u201cdistinction between establishing future persecution as a separate claim and rebutting the presumption of future persecution.\u201d <em>Imelda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 724, 728 n. 3 (11th Cir.2010). An applicant who seeks asylum on account of future persecution generally retains the burden to prove the ability to relocate, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3)\u00ae, but an applicant who proves past persecution and is entitled to a presumption of future persecution shifts the burden to the Department to prove the ability to relocate, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(h), (b)(3)(h). Because both Ugaz and the Department introduced evidence regarding conditions in Peru and the Board did not consider whether the Department satisfied its burden of proof, we will not review whether Ugaz can avoid persecution by relocating within Peru.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">Notwithstanding the error by the Board about the burden of proving ability to relocate, substantial evidence supports the finding of the Board that conditions in Peru have changed so that Ugaz no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>longer has a well-founded fear of future persecution. In 2002 and 2003, Shining Path targeted Ugaz because she criticized their political activities, but the evidence submitted by Ugaz and the Department suggests that Shining Path has all but abandoned its ideology for drug trafficking activities. <em>See Imelda, </em>611 F.3d at 729-30. All but one document introduced by the Department and Ugaz reports that Shining Path has restructured, downsized, and shifted most of its military activities from government animus to supporting the narcotics trade. The 2009 Country Report states that \u201c[t]here were no reports of politically motivated disappearances\u201d in Peru and that most activities of Shining Path were \u201clinked to narcotics trafficking\u201d in the \u201cValle de Apurimac y Ene region\u201d and \u201cremote coca-growing areas.\u201d A March 2010 article in Jane\u2019s World Insurgency and Terrorism reports that a \u201csharp rise in [Shining Path] activity against security forces in 2005 sparked concerns about a widespread resurgence,\u201d but \u201c[b]y 2008, the group\u2019s strength\u201d was reduced \u201cto number in the mid-hundreds\u201d and its members were \u201cprincipally located in the Andea highland regions.\u201d The article acknowledges that Shining Path still \u201costensibly maintain[s] [its] ideological motivation\u201d against the \u201cPeruvian state\u201d and \u201cretains a limited urban guerrilla capacity and presence,\u201d but the article reports that Shining Path is \u201cnow focused on providing protection to drug-trafficking operations\u201d and \u201cmost of the attacks against police are operations financed by narco-traffickers and cocaleros (coca growers).\u201d One article introduced by the Department reports that a leader of Shining Path had \u201cannounced the suspension of military actions\u201d and \u201casked the Peruvian government to enter into dialogue,\u201d and that the founder of Shining Path had \u201cdistanced himself\u2019 because its members had degenerated into \u201cmercenaries with no ideology.\u201d Although the documents contain evidence about some political activities by Shining Path, that evidence does not compel a conclusion that the organization continues to target or retain an interest in persecuting Ugaz. <em>See Mehmeti, </em>572 F.3d at 1199. The evidence about \u201cchanged country conditions in [Peru] negated the presumption that [Ugaz] had a well-founded fear of persecution\u201d and rendered her \u201cineligible for asylum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">We DENY Ugaz\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
