Manns argued that he was denied counsel at a critical stage of his prosecution. The district court determined that Manns could not proceed under \u00a7 2241 because he was not challenging the execution of his sentence and because he had not met his burden of proving that his \u00a7 2241 petition came within the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-23\">Manns\u2019s argument that <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938), guarantees him the right to bring a denial of counsel claim under \u00a7 2241 is without merit. In 1948, Congress enacted \u00a7 2255 and made it the main provision governing collateral attacks on convictions for federal prisoners. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 &amp; n. 18 (5th Cir.2001). Although a federal prisoner may still proceed under \u00a7 2241 if he meets the requirements of the savings clause in \u00a7 2255, <em>id. </em>at 901, Manns has not even attempted to make such a showing. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1031-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
