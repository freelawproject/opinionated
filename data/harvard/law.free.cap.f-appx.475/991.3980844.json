California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Castillo-Saucedo has filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Castillo-Saucedo\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Castillo-Saucedo\u2019s response claims he deserves a sentence credit. District courts are not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585 to compute service credit. Prisoners may seek administrative review of the computation of their credit; they may pursue judicial review of their sentence computation only after exhausting their administrative remedies. <em>United States v. Dowling, </em>962 F.2d 390, 393 (5th Cir.1992). There is no allegation here that he exhausted his administrative remedies regarding this claim. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2. Castillo-Saucedo\u2019s motion to appoint new appellate counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1023-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
