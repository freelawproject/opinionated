As Alegr\u00eda concedes, because he did not raise this argument in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To show plain error, Alegr\u00eda must show legal error that is clear or obvious and affects his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but will only do so if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">Alegr\u00eda has not shown that the district court plainly erred in finding that there was a sufficient factual basis to support his guilty plea. The record as a whole indicates that Alegr\u00eda admitted he possessed the firearm and that the district court did not pressure him to plead guilty. When asked by the district court, Alegr\u00eda stated several times that he had had enough time to review the plea agreement with his counsel, that he read and voluntarily signed the plea agreement, and that the contents of the agreement, including the factual basis, were true. Although at one point he remained silent when asked if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>possessed the firearm, Alegr\u00eda subsequently admitted that he was an illegal alien and that he possessed the firearm. He also reiterated several times that he wished to plead guilty and that he was pleading guilty voluntarily and not because the district court insisted that he do so. The district court explained the term \u201cpossession,\u201d and its explanation was consistent with this court\u2019s precedent concerning constructive possession. <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>431 F.3d 832, 837 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Onick, </em>889 F.2d 1425, 1430 (5th Cir.1989). Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in finding that there was a sufficient factual basis for Alegria\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b543-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
