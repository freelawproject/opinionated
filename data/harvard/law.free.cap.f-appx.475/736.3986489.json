After review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b769-17\">Petitioners\u2019 original asylum application sought relief based on their violation of China\u2019s one-child policy. Specifically, Petitioners alleged a well-founded fear that one of them would be forcibly sterilized if they returned to China because they already had two U.S.-born children.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-18\">On December 7, 2009, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied all requested relief. The IJ concluded that Petitioners had not shown that their fear of forced sterilization was objectively reasonable. In particular, the IJ found that most of Lin\u2019s evidence concerning China\u2019s family planning policy was general in nature and that her particularized evidence did not show that Chinese nationals who had U.S.-born children and then returned to Petitioners\u2019 hometowns were sterilized against their will.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-19\">On November 3, 2010, the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s findings and dismissed Petitioners\u2019 appeal. This Court denied the petition for review. <em>Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>438 Fed.Appx. 771 (11th Cir.2011) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>On January 31, 2010, while Petitioners\u2019 <em>first </em>appeal to this Court was still pending, Petitioners filed a timely motion to reopen with the BIA. Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen (1) submitted additional evidence in support of their original coercive family planning claim; and (2) alleged a new religious persecution claim based on Lin\u2019s recent conversion to Christianity and membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. On September 14, 2011, the BIA denied Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen, concluding that some of Petitioners\u2019 evidence predated their removal hearing and the remaining evidence did not show that Petitioners were statutorily eligible for relief as to either claim. Petitioners filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">An alien\u2019s motion to reopen must \u201cstate the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 240B(c)(7)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). The motion to reopen \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The BIA has the discretion to deny a motion to reopen because: (1) the alien failed to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; (2) the alien failed to establish a prima facie case of eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal; or (3) the BIA determined that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion. <em>Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d <em>1371, </em>1374-75 (11th Cir.2007). Because motions to reopen are disfavored, an alien seeking to reopen removal proceedings bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d to show that the new evidence would likely change the outcome of the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen. With respect to Petitioners\u2019 coercive family planning claim, much of their evidence pre-dated the December 2009 removal hearing, and Petitioners have not explained why they could not have presented this material at the removal hearing. Petitioners\u2019 evidence that did post-date their removal hearing (recent news articles about forced sterilizations in China) did not pertain to individuals who, like Lin and Gao, were parents of U.S.born children or who resided in Lin\u2019s or Gao\u2019s home county or village. As the BIA noted, Petitioners essentially sought to \u201craise[ ] the same unsuccessful family planning petition\u201d they previously presented to the IJ and then to the BIA. The BIA, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in concluding that this new evidence would not have changed the result of Petitioners\u2019 case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in determining that Lin\u2019s new evidence failed to establish a prima fa-cie case of religious persecution. According to the State Department\u2019s 2007 International Religious Freedom Report, Christianity is one of the five authorized religions in China, and the Chinese government\u2019s interference with Christian worship targets members of unauthorized \u201chouse churches.\u201d Similarly, Lin\u2019s other evidence related to the targeting of Christians who attend these unsanctioned \u201chouse churches.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Lin\u2019s affidavit stated that she intends to practice Christianity in China, it did not state that she plans to attend one of the dnsanctioned house churches or that her religious beliefs would prevent her from attending a government-sanctioned Christian church.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Additionally, Lin\u2019s evidence does not establish that government interference with Christian house churches in Fujian Province, where Lin would live, currently is so widespread as to create a well-founded fear of persecution. The evidence indicates that the Chinese government\u2019s treatment of house church members varies widely from region to region. Although the 2007 Religious Freedom Report mentions that government officials closed some house churches in Fujian Province in 2007, most of the reports in the record identify other regions of China as being more dangerous for house church worshipers, and many of the articles Lin submitted detailed events that occurred three to five years before Petitioners filed their motion to reopen. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen as to Lin\u2019s religious persecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-7\">. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">. Petitioners cite several decisions that are materially distinguishable. <em>See Zhang, </em>572 F.3d 1316; <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252 (11th Cir.2009); <em>Li v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.2007). These cases involved <em>untimely </em>motions to reopen, such that the petitioners were required to present evidence of changed country conditions to lift the time bar. This Court concluded that the petitioners had presented such evidence, but did not reach the merits of the motions to reopen. In contrast, Petitioners here filed a timely motion to reopen, which the BIA denied on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b771-6\">. Among other things, Lin submitted a January 15, 2011 letter from Lin\u2019s aunt in China. Lin's aunt stated that she was baptized as a Christian thirty years ago and attended small church meetings in the homes of fellow believers. At some point, the police discovered the \"illegal gathering\u201d and took the congregants to the police station, where they beat and interrogated Lin\u2019s aunt and released her only after she signed a letter agreeing to never again attend an underground church activity. We note, as the BIA did, that it is not clear from the letter when these events occurred and whether this evidence was available and could have been presented at Petitioners\u2019 removal hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
