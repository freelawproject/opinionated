He argues that the IJ and BIA violated regulations and precedent in their discretionary denial of relief by failing to consider favorable factors and by creating, mischaracterizing, and giving undue weight to unfavorable factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-21\">We lack jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that Mata was not entitled to cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). Despite this jurisdictional limitation, we may review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Although Mata phrases his arguments as questions of law, the essence of his arguments is that the IJ and BIA improperly considered and weighed favorable and unfavorable factors in making the discretionary decision to deny cancellation of removal. Accordingly, his assertions do not raise constitutional issues or questions of law, and we lack jurisdiction to review his petition. <em>See Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 800-01 (5th Cir.2006). Because we lack jurisdiction to review the final order of removal, the petition for review is dismissed. <em>See Rueda, </em>380 F.3d at 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-22\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b975-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
