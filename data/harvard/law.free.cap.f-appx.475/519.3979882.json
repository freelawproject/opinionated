Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 295-96 (5th Cir.2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-24\">Cofer\u2019s argument that the district court erred as a matter of law by failing to make findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009). Moreover, the district court gave reasons for denying Cofer\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion: the district court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the circumstances of the case and Cofer\u2019s conduct, and Cofer\u2019s post-conviction conduct but concluded for the reasons set forth in the Government\u2019s opposition that a sentence reduction was not warranted. To the extent that Cofer is also arguing that a sentence reduction was warranted, he has shown no abuse of discretion because the record reflects the district court\u2019s consideration of Cofer\u2019s motion and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-25\">In his reply brief, Cofer argues for the first time that the district court\u2019s order is devoid of the analysis for determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>whether to grant a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) set forth in <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); the Fair Sentencing Act; and the Sentencing Guidelines. For the first time, Cofer may also be arguing that the district court incorrectly calculated the revised guidelines range. We do not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 360 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b551-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
