The district court dismissed the petition as time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). We affirm the dismissal, but on different grounds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-22\">Andrews challenges a 1994 Georgia drug conviction that was used to enhance his current federal sentence. A petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 is available only to a petitioner \u201cin custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). Andrews fully served the sentence for his 1994 drug conviction. He is a federal prisoner serving a sentence that was issued by a federal court, and a \u00a7 2254 petition is not available to him. <em>See Means v. Alabama, </em>209 F.3d 1241, 1242 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (a prisoner who challenges an expired state sentence that was used to enhance his current federal sentence must bring suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 rather than \u00a7 2254).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-23\">Even construing his <em>pro se </em>petition as a one filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, relief is still unavailable. The Supreme Court has instructed that habeas relief is generally not available to a petitioner who challenges a past conviction and fully expired sentence that was used to enhance a subsequent federal sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-24\">If ... a prior conviction used to enhance a federal sentence is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own right because the defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they were available (or because the defendant did so unsuccessfully), then that defendant is without recourse. The presumption of validity that attached to the prior conviction at the time of sentencing is conclusive, and the defendant may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>collaterally attack his prior conviction through a motion under \u00a7 2255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><em>Daniels v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 374, 382, 121 S.Ct. 1578, 1583, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001). The majority in <em>Daniels </em>recognized an exception for challenges concerning the failure to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 382, 121 S.Ct. at 1583 (citing <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963)). But the exception does not apply here because Andrews was represented by counsel during the 1994 proceedings. Andrews cannot challenge his prior conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254 or 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-25\">.
