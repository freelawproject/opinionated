He argues that his sentence, which was enhanced pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 based on Valdez\u2019s status as a career offender, violates the Eighth Amendment because it was cruel and unusual punishment, disproportionate to his offense, and essentially amounted to a life sentence based on his age. Valdez has not shown that his sentence is grossly disproportion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>ate to the crime. He committed the in.stant offense after two prior felony convictions; was sentenced as a recidivist; was held responsible in the instant case for heroin, cocaine, and cocaine base equivalent to 8,517.57 kilograms of marijuana; and has failed to set forth any cogent argument regarding the disproportionality of his sentence. <em>See Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 284-85, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
