The district court concluded that he was a career offender under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov.2005) and for that reason had a guidelines range of 188 to 255 months in prison. The court varied downward and sentenced Gil to 108 months in prison. The Sentencing Commission later issued Amendment 750 to the guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels for crack-cocaine offenses. Gil then filed a motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which allows a district court to reduce a sentence that was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d The district court denied that motion, and Gil appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-21\">The district court did not err because the district court based Gil\u2019s prison sentence on his career offender guidelines range. A district court cannot reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on amendments to the base offense levels for crack-cocaine offenses if the district court based the defendant\u2019s sentence on his career offender guidelines range. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-30 (11th Cir.2008). Our holding in <em>Moore </em>controls our decision here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-17\">. Gil argues that the reasoning in the plurality opinion in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), undermines our holding in <em>Moore. </em>It does not, and even if it did, we are not bound by plurality opinions of the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez-Lauzan, </em>437 F.3d 1128, 1139 n. 8 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Horton v. Zant, </em>941 F.2d 1449, 1464 n. 32 (11th Cir.1991). We are bound by our holding in <em>Moore.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
