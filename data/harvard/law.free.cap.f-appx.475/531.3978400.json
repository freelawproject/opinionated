She has appealed her sentence and contends that the district court erred in determining the drug quantity attributable to her as relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The district court adopted the probation officer\u2019s finding that Cadena aided and abetted the distribution of 9,200 pounds (4,173.12 kilograms) of marijuana by her codefendant, James Cornelius, Jr. Because that finding was unrebutted, the district court was entitled to adopt it without further inquiry or explanation. <em>See United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.1995). Cadena has not shown that the district court\u2019s drug-quantity finding was clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 878 (5th Cir.1998). Moreover, because Cadena was subject to a mandatory minimum 120-month term of imprisonment, a reduction of her offense level would not have affected the length of her sentence. Accordingly, any error in determining the drug quantity at sentencing was harmless. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752-53 (5th Cir.2009). The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
