The district court found that Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines \u2014 which lowered offense levels in USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 applicable to crack cocaine offenses \u2014 had been made retroactive by the Sentencing Commission, and that the reduction in Mr. Green\u2019s sentence was consistent with the policy statement set forth in USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 and the applicable factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>D.E. 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-17\">Though the district court granted his motion for reduction of sentence, Mr. Green now appeals. He argues that the district court, before reducing his sentence pursuant to Amendment 750, should have lowered the amount of crack cocaine for which he was held responsible when he was originally sentenced. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-19\">Mr. Green is essentially asking that we require the district court to revisit the factual determination it made as to drug quantity at the initial sentencing hearing. But \u00a7 3582(c) is limited in scope, and \u201cdoes not authorize a sentencing or resen-tencing hearing.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Moreover, USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) provides that the district court shall substitute only the retroactive amendment \u201cfor the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced, and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d Thus, we have held that <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis in original). In short, Mr. Green\u2019s motion under \u00a7 3582(c) did not authorize the district court to change its initial relevant conduct determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-22\">To the extent that Mr. Green is arguing that we recognized a constitutional error in his original sentence on direct appeal, and that this error allowed the district court to revisit the issue of relevant conduct under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we disagree. On direct appeal, we vacated the life imprisonment sentence imposed on Clarence Clark, Mr. Green\u2019s co-defendant, holding that the sentence violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>See United States v. Green, </em>Slip. Op. at 4-5, 253 F.3d 708 (11th Cir.2001) (Table). With respect to Mr. Green, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>however, we said that he did not have a viable <em>Apprendi </em>claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">We note that, unlike defendant Clark, defendant Green was not in a position to raise an issue under <em>Apprendi </em>[,] since his 360-month sentence is within the statutory maximum for an enhanced penalty under the catch-all provision of [21] \u00dc.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). <em>See United States v. Rogers, </em>228 F.3d 1318, 1327 (11th Cir.2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 4 n. 4. Because we never ruled that Mr. Green\u2019s sentence was unconstitutional, there is no basis for allowing the district court to revisit its initial sentencing determination with respect to drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The district court\u2019s order reducing Mr. Green\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
