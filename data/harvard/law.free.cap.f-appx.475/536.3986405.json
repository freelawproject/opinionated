The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, while the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o).\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Kates was convicted by a jury of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base and was sentenced to 360 months in prison. The district court found that the retroactive guidelines amendment would not reduce Kates\u2019s total offense level because he was sentenced as a career offender. Kates has identified no error in this finding. His principal argument is that the district court should have gone below the advisory range to correct the unwarranted sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses. In the context of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a sentencing court lacks discretion to reduce a sentence further than the reduction allowed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. Kates\u2019s argument is unavailing, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
