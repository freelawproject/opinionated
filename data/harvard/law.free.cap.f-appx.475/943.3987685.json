The district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) and (b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and dismissed Le Clair\u2019s complaint with prejudice, concluding that the TBCJ was a state agency immune to suit under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">Le Clair contends that because the TBCJ\u2019s conduct violated the Fourteenth Amendment, the TBCJ is not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, and he argues that the TBCJ is a \u201cperson\u201d susceptible to suit under \u00a7 1983 and is liable for its policies or customs. We review the judgment of dismissal de novo. <em>Ballew v. Continental Airlines, Inc., </em>668 F.3d 777, 781 (5th Cir.2012); <em>Turner v. Pleasant, </em>663 F.3d 770, 775 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">The Supreme Court has recognized \u201conly two circumstances in which an individual may sue a State. First, Congress may authorize such a suit in the exercise of its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.... Second, a State may waive its sovereign immunity by consenting to suit.\u201d <em>College Sav. Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., </em>527 U.S. 666, 670, 119 S.Ct. 2219, 144 L.Ed.2d 605 (1999). Neither exception applies here. Further, \u201can entity with Eleventh Amendment immunity is not a \u2018person\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Howlett v. Rose, </em>496 U.S. 356, 365, 110 S.Ct. 2430, 110 L.Ed.2d 332 (1990). Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing Le Clair\u2019s suit. The judgment of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-15\">Le Clair has moved for the appointment of counsel on appeal. Because his case does not present exceptional circumstances, the motion is denied. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock Cnty., Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-16\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b976-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
