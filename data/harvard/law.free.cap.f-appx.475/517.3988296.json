By moving to proceed IFP, Kupstis is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Section 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) requires a district court to dismiss an IFP complaint at any time if the court determines that such complaint \u201cis frivolous or malicious.\u201d \u201cA complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-19\">As an initial matter, Kupstis does not address the dismissal of his claims against the 259th District Court, the Texas Eleventh Court of Appeals, and Hendrick\u2019s Medical Services. Accordingly, he has abandoned such claims on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-20\">Kupstis avers that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs regarding his groin pain, sore throat, and hepatitis C. Prison officials violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment when they demonstrate deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs, constituting an \u201cunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Kupstis\u2019s allegations amount to no more than a disagreement with his medical care and claims of negligence and medical malpractice, which do not establish deliberate indifference. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-21\">Kupstis contends that he was deprived of due process when the defendants confiscated and destroyed his legal materials and personal property. Kupstis\u2019s claims rest on the purported random and unauthorized acts of prison officials, and his claims for \u00a7 1983 damages are barred by the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine. <em>See </em>Hud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>son v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986); <em>Holloway v. Walker, </em>784 F.2d 1287, 1293 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Kupstis has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on then- merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). His IFP motion is therefore denied, and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24. Kupstis\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Kupstis is warned that if he accumulates a third strike, then he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b549-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
