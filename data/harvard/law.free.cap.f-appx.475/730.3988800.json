Fowler challenges the four-level enhancement of his sentence based on the finding of the district court that he was a leader of the conspiracy. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) (Nov.2010). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant receives a four-point increase in his offense level for being \u201can organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Relevant factors that a district court can use in determining whether to enhance for a leadership role include the defendant\u2019s \u201cexercise of decision making authority\u201d; his \u201cnature of participation in the commission of the offense\u201d; his \u201cclaimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime\u201d; and the extent to which he \u201cparticipat[es] in planning or organizing the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 4. Because the enhancement is intended to address \u201cconcerns about relative responsibility,\u201d <em>id. </em>cmt. background, \u201c[t]here can, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader or organizer of a criminal association or conspiracy,\u201d <em>id. </em>cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Fowler was a leader of the conspiracy. Fowler admitted at his change of plea hearing that he and his brother \u201cobtained] multi-kilograms amounts of cocaine from a source of supply in the Atlanta, Georgia[,] area\u201d that was \u201cdistributed by members\u201d of the conspiracy. Fowler argued at his sentencing hearing that his brother, Andre, controlled the conspiracy, but the government introduced a recording of a telephone conversation between the Fowler brothers that established that they shared control of the conspiracy. During the conversation, Fowler stated how \u201cif <em>we </em>both make us about a hundred [from selling cocaine] <em>... we </em>still got the money to run the company\u201d; Fowler instructed his brother to \u201cmake sure ... when <em>we </em>do get [a call about the cocaine], ... just make sure ... everybody, they gotta come with that gwap (money), and ... work it like that\u201d; and Fowler gloated that \u201ceverybody ... [would] watch you and watch me and ... watch and learn.\u201d In the conversation, Fowler\u2019s brother also referred to the conspiracy as \u201cour company,\u201d and Fowler\u2019s brother remarked how <em>\u201cwe </em>gone have [the cocaine] before everybody else\u201d and <em>\u201cwe </em>got some work to do.\u201d The government also introduced testimony from Lisa Gi-gante, an agent of the Drug Enforcement Agency, that she had determined that Fowler and his brother were \u201cthe leaders of the organization\u201d based on her investigation of the conspiracy and her interviews of confidential informants \u201cclosely associated\u201d with the conspiracy. Fowler did not challenge Gigante\u2019s testimony. The record supports the finding by the district court that Fowler was a leader of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">We AFFIRM Fowler\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
