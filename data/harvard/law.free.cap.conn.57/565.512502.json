Clark, the appellant, an aggregate of several weeks, leaving the last time January 31st, 1887, paying Charles for board the agreed sum of three dollars per week. He owned a farm near by, on which he kept oxen and other cattle. At one time Sheldon remained in the family of Charles a week as a guest, no charge being made, and Charles had the use of his oxen, which would have been a fair equivalent, and for which no charge was made by Sheldon. It was not, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>ever, said by either that one of these items should offset the other. Charles was a second cousin of Sheldon, and was quite poor. Sheldon had some landed property and live stock, but little money and small income. Except as above appears, accounts were kept by Sheldon and Charles,, in which Charles was credited with the board, and charged with the use of the oxen, which he sometimes used. On June 15th, 1887, Sheldon and Charles looked over their accounts, and Sheldon made in his memorandum book the following entry:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-5\">\u201c June 15th, 1887, looked over with Charles, balance due me,........$2.51</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-6\">Looked over team work,.....6.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-7\">$8.51 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-8\">This sum was not disputed by Charles, but was after-wards paid by him, a portion in October, 1887, and the balance, after Sheldon\u2019s decease, to his executors. No later action calling for debit or credit appears to have taken place after June 15th, 1887. During the times Sheldon boarded in Charles\u2019s family Charles\u2019s wife was kind, and on several occasions did him favors, such as mending or washing articles of clothing. On one occasion he had a hemorrhage, and she cared for him; the hemorrhage also caused some injury to the bed and carpet. Occasionally also Charles would take care of the cattle for him, or do some small chores about his place. No charge was made for any of these things, but Sheldon appreciated them, and on several occasions said to Charles and his wife that they should have their pay for what favors they were doing him. And in consequence of such statements they believed that the small services which they continued to perform would be suitably recognized and remunerated by Sheldon. I do not find that they ever thought of them as debts or legal obligations, or considered whether they would or would not be such, but there was a complete confidence on this point, that Sheldon would, in the exercise of his own judgment, do what was a full equivalent in return, and on this they solely relied, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>there was a full intention on his part to do so. On the 29th day of August, 1887, Sheldon, being ill of the disease of which he died on the 19th day of October, 1887, came to the house of Charles and said to Mr. and Mrs. Clark that he wished them to draw a note for seven hundred dollars, which he desired them to have for what they had done for him. Mrs. Clark said\u2014\u201c Why, Sheldon, that is too <em>much; </em>that is more than we deserve.\u201d He said\u2014\u201c I want you to have that if I die, but if I get well I want the note back, and I will then pay you what is right.\u201d The following note was accordingly drawn:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-5\">\u201c Beacon Falls, Conn., Aug. 29th, 1887.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-6\">\u201c On demand, for value received (to my full satisfaction), I promise to pay to Charles B.

On the 6th day of October, 1887, Sheldon made his will, which was duly probated, and-under which his estate is being settled. By this will he gave to Charles B. Clark one sixth of the residue of his estate, after having devised his real estate to other relatives.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-9\">Upon these facts the case was reserved for the advice of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-10\"><em>V.

It must be conceded that whatever consideration there was, if any, accrued during the intervals that Sheldon Clark boarded with Charles, and consisted of the favors which were done for him, as set forth in the finding. If there was no indebtedness or legal obligation on the part of Sheldon in favor of Charles, capable of being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>enforced as such, and which, the note was intended to pay, clearly there was no consideration for the note. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>7 Conn., 57; <em>Colburn </em>v. <em>Tolles, </em>14 id., 341. It will be observed in this connection that the parties were relatives; that they charged against each other upon book, in the time of it, every thing that was then regarded as the proper subject of a charge. And these accounts were finally adjusted on June 15th, 1887, and there was a balance due Sheldon. The services were voluntarily rendered, without request, and rendered as \u201cfavors\u201d and accepted by Sheldon as \u201c favors,\u201d and they relied solely upon him \u201c in the exercise of his own judgment\u201d to do as much for them in return as a favor. \u201c They never thought of them as debts or legal obligations.\u201d How then could they have maintained an action against him for those services ? <em>Candor\u2019s Appeal, </em>5 Watts &amp; Serg., 513: <em>Hartman\u2019s Appeal, </em>3 Grant\u2019s Cases, 271; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>29 Wis., 278. \u201c It must appear by proof of such circumstances connected with their dealing with each other, as fairly warrant the inference that it was the understanding and expectation of the parties on both sides that such services were to be paid for as a debt.\u201d 3 Wait\u2019s Actions &amp; Defences, 584. A legal obligation for doing the humane acts which might be fairly expected from a boarding master or mistress without extra compensation, is clearly not created by the facts in this case. <em>Frear </em>v. <em>Hardenbergh, </em>5 Johns., 272; <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>20 id., 28; <em>Recknagle </em>v. <em>Schmaltz, </em>72 Iowa, 63; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>supra. It seems from the finding that no contract was made as to compensation for the \u201cfavors,\u201d and no charge was made by the appellant or his wife. Such a contract is necessary to create a legal obligation to make such compensation. Addison on Contracts, 23; <em>Fitch </em>v. <em>Peckham, </em>16 Verm., 150; <em>Andrus </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>17 id., 560; <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>76 N.

Eq., 585; <em>Bonney </em>v. <em>Haydock, </em>40 id., 513 ; <em>Hamor </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>8 Ohio St., 239. Moral obligations which may furnish a good consideration \u201c include only those cases in which there has been a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>right which has become devoid of a legal remedy.\u201d <em>Cook </em>v.

The note was clearty a testamentary gift. It was not to be of any force until the maker died. The only consideration was gratitude. This method of attempting to dispense with the formalities and legal requisites of a will, is not to be encouraged by our courts. <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Sellick, </em>10 Conn., 480; <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Silloway, </em>111 Mass., 24; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Durfee, </em>126 id., 338; <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>14 Pick., 198; <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>23 id., 98; <em>Fink </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>18 Johns., 145; <em>Holley </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>16 Verm., 206; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Kittridge, </em>21 id., 238; <em>Hamor </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>8 Ohio St., 239.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b580-6\">Andrews, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ame\">This is an appeal from the doings of the commissioners on the estate of Sheldon Clark, late of Beacon Falls, deceased, in disallowing a note payable to Charles B. Clark for the sum of seven hundred dollars. The Superior Court made a finding of facts and reserved the question for the advice of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The note in controversy was made on the 29th day of August, 1887. On the 6th day of October following Sheldon Clark made his will and on the 19th day of the same month he died. The execution and delivery of the note was proved, or was admitted, and as it is expressed to be for value received it would <em>prim\u00e9 facie </em>be a valid claim against the estate of its maker and should be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The finding is not very explicit and perhaps not entirety free from doubt, but, taken in connection with the will and with the note itself, it appears that Sheldon Clark, who was unmarried and sick with the consumption, of which disease he died, lived in the family of Charles B. Clark a good part of the time from about January 1st, 1886, to the last of January, 1887\u2014boarded there, and in a sort made it his home there\u2014not continuously but at intervals. There was a price for board which was paid. Charles and his wife, however, rendered services to Sheldon outside the regular contract for board\u2014washed and mended his clothes, attended upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>him when he was sick, cleaned his clothes and the bedding after a hemorrhage, took care of his cattle when he was not able to do so himself and did the chores upon his place etc., etc.\u2014matters not very great in themselves and which seem never to have been the subject of any formal bargain between them. Sheldon appreciated their kindness and favors and on several occasions said to Charles and to the wife of Charles that they should have their pay. In consequence of these statements by Sheldon and in reliance upon them Charles and his wife continued to render these services. Sheldon knew that Charles and his wife expected to be paid, and he fully intended to pay them. No price was ever fixed; it was left for Sheldon to pay such sum as in his judgment should be a full equivalent. Sheldon made the note to pay for these services; there was no other consideration. He made it of his own accord, and there was no suggestion of any fraud, solicitation or undue influence. On the day the note was made Sheldon came to the house of Charles and said to Mr. and Mrs. Clark that he wished them to draw a note for seven hundred dollars, which he desired them to have for what they had done for him. Mrs. Clark said\u2014\u201cWhy Sheldon that is too much; that is more than we deserve.\u201d Sheldon said\u2014\u201c I want you to have that if I die, but if I get well I want the note back and I will then pay you what is right.\u201d The note was then drawn, was examined and approved by Sheldon and was duly signed by him and delivered to Charles, in whose hands it has ever since remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The appellees urge two reasons why the note ought not to be allowed against the estate of Sheldon Clark:\u2014that it was, and was intended to be, a testamentary gift; and that it was without consideration. The view we have taken of the case makes any reference to the first reason unnecessary; for if the note was made and delivered upon a sufficient consideration it is valid and binding, and should be paid irrespective of that objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">We think the note was made on sufficient consideration. Prof. John William Smith in his lectures on the law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>contracts, in answer to the question, \u201cWhat does the law recognize as a consideration capable of supporting a simple contract?\u201d gives this short practical rule. \u201cAny benefit accruing to him who makes the promise, or any loss, trouble or disadvantage undergone by, or charge imposed upon, him to whom the promise is made, is a sufficient consideration in the eye of the law to sustain the promise.\u201d And he adds\u2014\u201cAccordingly in the absence of fraud mere inadequacy of consideration is no ground for avoiding a contract.\u201d Smith on Contracts, pages 141, 148. Judge Storrs, in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Sigourney, </em>17 Conn., 517, says :\u2014\u201c Any act done by the promisee at the request of the promisor by which the former sustains any loss, trouble or inconvenience, constitutes a sufficient consideration for a promise, although the latter obtains' no advantage therefrom ; and in respect to the extent of such loss, trouble or inconvenience it is immaterial that if is of the most trifling description, provided it be not utterly worthless in fact and in law.\u201d See also <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Barnum, </em>8 Conn., 469. \u201c A valuable consideration in the sense of the law may consist either in some right, interest or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.\u201d <em>Currier </em>v. <em>Misa, </em>L. R., 10 Exch., 162. \u201c If the parties, being in a situation and having the power so to do, have exercised their own independent judgment as to the value of the subject matter, courts of equity should not and will not interfere with such valuation.\u201d Pomeroy\u2019s Equity, \u00a7 926. \u201c In the absence of fraud inadequacy of consideration is not sufficient to avoid a contract even in equity.\u201d <em>Bedel </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>11 N. Hamp. 19., Chancellor Kent, in <em>Osgood </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>2 Johns. Ch., 1, says: \u201c There is no case where mere inadequacy of price, independent of other considerations, has been held sufficient to set aside a sale made between parties standing on equal ground and dealing with each other without imposition or oppression.\u201d \u201cInadequacy of consideration is not then of itself a distinct principle of relief in equity. The common law knows no such principle. The consideration, be it more or less, sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>ports the contract.\u201d 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., \u00a7 245. See also <em>Warner </em>v. Daniels, 1 Wood. &amp; Minot, 110; <em>Train </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>5 Pick., 380; <em>Boothe v. Fitzpatrick, </em>36 Verm., 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The case of <em>Worth </em>v. <em>Case, </em>42 N. York, 362, is a case very similar in many respects to the one now in hand. It was brought against-the defendant as the executor of Theron B. Worth, on a note for $10,000. The plaintiff and Theron were sister and brother. The plaintiff resided in Corning, not keeping house but living in a furnished room. Theron lived in Southold. He visited the plaintiff at her residence several times. At a visit in January, 1864, he was very ill there. She gave up her room and bed to him, and he spent his entire time in them. She nursed him, bathed him, and rubbed his limbs every morning during his sickness. She also brought his meals to him from the hotel and rendered other attention to him while he was sick. He paid the bill at the hotel but paid her nothing for her service. Several times during his stay he spoke to her about paying her, and said he would pay her well. On the day he left her house, January 30, 1864, he handed her a sealed envelope indorsed: \u201cMary C. Worth. This is not to be unsealed while I live and to be returned to me at any time I may wish it. T. B. Worth.\u201d The plaintiff was not informed and did not know what the envelope contained, until she opened it after her brother\u2019s death in 1867, and found in it the note on which the suit was brought. Theron left a will by which he gave to the plaintiff the sum of $1,000. The plaintiff had a verdict for the amount of the note; in sustaining which the Court of Appeals said:\u2014\u201c The note was given for services rendered and if the note speaks truly he then considered those attentions worth $10,000. He chose for these services to execute the note. We have no pecuniary standard by which we can weigh or measure- their value to him. He estimated them then and continued to do so at $10,000. And those who stand in his shoes have no right to repudiate the contract which he made.\u201d <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Carruth, </em>108 Mass., 242, is another case of like kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The case of <em>Wolford </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>85 Ind., 294, was brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>on a promissory note executed in consideration of a father\u2019s naming a child after the promisor, and in pursuance of the promisor\u2019s agreement that if the child were so named he would provide for its education and support. It was held that this was a valid consideration. In delivering the opinion the court said:\u2014\u201c When, a party contracts for the performance of an act which will afford him pleasure, gratify his ambition, please his fancy, or express his appreciation of a service another has done him, his estimate of value should be left undisturbed unless there is evidence of fraud. There is in such a case absolutely no rule by which the courts can be guided, if once they depart from the value fixed by the promisor. If they attempt to fix some standard it must necessarily be an arbitrary one and ascertained only by mere conjecture. If, in the class of cases mentioned, there is any legal consideration for a promise, it must be sufficient for the one made; for, if this is not so, then the result is that the court substitutes its own judgment for that of the promisor and in doing this mates a new contract. When the purpose of the party is to secure a pecuniary or property benefit there is much more ground for judicial interference than in a case like this, where the controlling purpose is not gain but the gratification of a desire or fancy. Even in the former class of cases, courts never do interfere upon the sole ground of inadequacy of consideration, and certainly should not in the class to which the one at bar belongs. No person in the world, other than the promisor, can estimate the value of an act which arouses his gratitude, gratifies his ambition, or pleases his fancy. If there be any consideration at all it must be allotted the value the parties have placed upon it, or a conjectural estimate made arbitrarily and without the semblance of a guide must be substituted by the courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\"><em>Earl </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>64 N. York, 596, was a case brought on a note for $10,000 executed by the defendant\u2019s testator. The plaintiff had been in the service of the deceased for some six or seven years as his housekeeper and he was indebted to her for her services. The note was made only about two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>hours before his death. No contract had been made as to the rate of compensation for the services but the deceased had said he would pay her well, and the evidence tended to show that the amount of compensation was to be left to him. The court said:\u2014\u201cMere inadequacy of consideration, except as a circumstance bearing upon the question of fraud, is not a defence to a note. It is not necessary that the consideration of a note shall be equal in pecuniary value to the obligation incurred.\u201d See also <em>Cowee </em>v. Cornell, 75 N. York, 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The services rendered by Charles Clark and his wife to Sheldon Clark and for which this note is the promise to pay, if they should be drawn out on a book in the form of an account, with times and dates, and the thing done, and prices, might not amount to seven hundred dollars. But to Sheldon Clark, alone in the world, unmarried, without family or near kindred to make a home for him, sick of a wasting disease, who can measure their value so well as he ? He put his own estimate upon them, deliberately and without \u201cspeck of imposition.\u201d If he chose to pay for the services rendered a much larger sum than they were apparently worth, he had the right to do so. The note was not a gratuity or a testamentary gift. There is no standard whereby courts can limit the measure of value in such a case; and the note is not wanting even partially in consideration because the value of the consideration is less than the obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The Superior Court is advised to render judgment for the appellant to recover of the estate of Sheldon Clark the amount of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
