Beers, deceased.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-9\">1. We will consider first the provisions of the ninth paragraph of the will. William A. Beers, at the time of his death, had not received his one quarter share of so much of the residue as is represented by the \u201c corner lot,\u201d valued at $2,500, $666.66 in mortgage notes, and $164.50 in cash. The lot had not been sold because a \u201csufficient' and proper \u201d price could not be obtained for it, although the executor had \u201c endeavored so to do,\u201d while that the executor was not in a-position to properly divide and pay over the mortgage notes and money appears from the fact that his last administration account had not been rendered when William A. Beers died. No suggestion of undue delay in realizing upon or paying over this property appears anywhere in the record. It was still properly in the executor\u2019s hands unconverted and undelivered. William A. Beers had, therefore, not \u201creceived his share\u201d of the residue before his death. By the terms of the ninth paragraph the executor was directed, in respect to the residue, \u201c to convert the whole thereof into money, and to divide the same into four equal parts and to pay one \u201d to William A. Beers. If, disregarding these instructions, he had converted it little by little into money and paid several one quarter parts to William A. Beers, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>rights of this defendant to the remaining unpaid one quarter part ought not to be impaired simply because the whole share was not wholly unreceived. It cannot therefore be said that the contingency has not arisen in which the issue of William A. Beers is to receive one quarter of the property above referred to. It was certainly never \u201creceived\u201d by William A. Beers, within any meaning of the Avoid known to the dictionary. That the ordinary meaning of the words used contravenes no rule of law is plain from Lord Eldon\u2019s judgment in <em>Gaskell </em>v. Harman, 11 Ves., 497, in which he says:\u2014\u201c I admit the soundness of the proposition that if a testator thinks proper, whether prudently or not, to say distinctly, shoAving a manifest intention, that his legatees, pecuniary or residuary, shall not have the legacies or the residue unless they live to receive them in hard money, there is no rule against such intention if clearly expressed.\u201d See also 2 Wms. Exrs., 7th ed., 1329. That this intention is clearly expressed in the paragraph in question is our confident claim, and we make this claim relying upon the established practice of this court to permit testators to make their own wills, and when made to enforce rather than distort them. In 3 Jarman on Wills, 5 Am. ed., 672, will be found an extensive discussion of the question under consideration, founded upon the English decisions. To those there cited we would add <em>Elwin </em>v. <em>Elwin, </em>8 Ves., 547, which strongly supports our claim, and a suggestion regarding <em>Minors </em>v. Battison, (Law Reps., 1 App. Cas. H. of L., 428,) which is there cited, and which is principally relied on by our opponents here, that in the opinion of Lord Chelmsford (p. 487,) not contradicted by the other lords, the property by other provisions of the will was vested in the legatees from the death of the testator, which certainly should distinguish that case from ours. See also, an extensive discussion of the subject in 2 Wms. Exrs., 1494, note s. We find no discussion of the question by our own court, and none of consequence in the reports of other states except in the case of <em>Manice </em>v. <em>Manice, </em>43 N. York, 303. That the decisions and discussions above alluded to entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>sustain our position, would be perhaps too much to claim. We do insist, however, that the plain meaning of the language used, as Henry J\u201e Beers must have intended it to be understood, is as we claim; and that there is nothing in the above mentioned authorities which need prevent this court from allowing the testator to make his own will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-5\">2. We shall next consider the provisions of the seventh paragraph of the will. We claim that the reversion in one quarter of the property 'held in trust for the widow\u2019s use, did not so vest in this defendant\u2019s father as to pass by his will. This depends upon the meaning of the expression, \u201c in ease of the death of any of my said children,\u201d which begins the second clause of the seventh paragraph. Unless this refers only to a death in the testator\u2019s lifetime, it cannot well be claimed that William A. Beers had any interest in the fund which he could dispose of. That it does not refer to a death in the testator\u2019s lifetime alone, but .does refer to a death at any time before the \u201cpart \u201d of the person so dying is \u201c paid,\u201d must be clear. The only possible question about it, in our judgment, is, as to whether the death must occur before the \u201c part \u201d becomes payable, that is at the widow\u2019s death, or before it is actually \u201c paid.\u201d In either event this defendant has a vested interest in it, and his mother, Julia A. Beers, has no interest in it whatever. The \u201cpart\u201d is to be \u201cpaid\u201d to persons who are designated by terms sufficiently explicit to at least absolutely exclude the legatees or grantees of a child dying in the widow\u2019s lifetime. \u201c But although in the case of an immediate gift it is generally true that a bequest over in the event of the death of the preceding legatee, refers to that event occurring in the lifetime of the testator, yet this construction is only made <em>ex necessitate rei, </em>from the absence of any other period to which the words can be referred, as a testator is not supposed to contemplate the event of himself surviving the objects of his bounty; and, consequently, where there is another point of time to which such dying may be referred (as obviously is the case where the bequest is to take effect in possession at a period subsequent to the testator\u2019s decease), the words-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>in question are considered as extending to the event of the legatee dying in the interval between the testator\u2019s decease and the period of vesting in possession.\u201d 3 Jarman on Wills, 611. See also the cases there cited, and the pages following. \u201c The rule which reads a gift to survivors simply as applying to persons living at the death of the testator, is confined to those cases in which there is no other period to which survivorship can be referred; and where such gift is preceded by a life or other prior interest, it takes effect in favor of those who survive the period of distribution, and of those only.\u201d Id., 588. These well established rules enable us to readily distinguish the case at bar from those of which <em>Phelps </em>v. Phelps, 55 Conn., 359, is the latest type.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-5\">G. Stoddard, for Julia A. Beers, widow of William A.

Beers or his heirs, or to Julia A. Beers or her heirs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The questions are reserved for the advice of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">The cited clauses make it quite certain that it was the intention of the testator to give his entire estate to his children absolutely; the whole of it in right, at his death; the possession and enjoyment of a part then, of the remainder at the death of his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">At the execution of the will it was of course unknown whether any one of his children would survive him; unknown in case the death of any one preceded his own, whether that one would or would not leave a child or children surviving.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">Therefore, that he might die testate as to all of his estate, and might avoid the necessity for another will, he so framed this as to meet the possibilities in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">In the absence of a clear manifestation of intent on the part of a testator to postpone to an uncertain and possibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>distant time after Ms death the vesting of the title to his estate in his children, the nearest objects of his love and bounty, the law prefers, and presumes he intended, that it should vest at the moment when the will should become operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Of course the testator was well aware of the possibility of long delay in the satisfactory conversion of the entire assets of an estate into money, in adjusting claims against it, and in reaching the point of final distribution. But unless he so says explicitly, it cannot be presumed to be his will that either unavoidable or permitted delays should put it in the power of an executor to carry to a grandson an estate which he intended for his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">' There is every presumption in favor of a father\u2019s desire, circumstances permitting, that his children should take his estate in the form in which he leaves it invested. But, as there may be difficulties attending satisfactory division in specie among numerous heirs, testators often provide for melting the estate into money for absolute equality in division. That is the extent of the testator\u2019s wish. His provision for division in that manner furnishes no foundation for the belief that he thereby intended to postpone beyond his death the vesting in his children of the right to his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">In the seventh clause the testator says that, \u201cin case of the death of any of my said children, I order and direct that the part of him or her so dying be paid to his or her lawful issue. Here the death of the devisee, an absolutely certain event, not being by the testator associated with any circumstance or other event, the law refers it to the time of his own death. It is a well established rule that where there is a devise to <em>A, </em>and in case of his death, to <em>B, </em>if <em>A </em>survives the testator he takes absolutely. <em>Lowfield </em>v. <em>Stoneham, </em>2 Stra., 1261; <em>Hinckley </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>4 Ves., 160. And this is the language of the testator in the seventh paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The presumptions from the frame of this will that the testator preferred children to grandchildren, the vesting of his estate in his children at his death rather than upon an event of uncertain time thereafter, and the express provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>sion for such vesting contained in the seventh clause\u2014are together too weighty to permit any inference-' to the contrary to be drawn from the words \u201cshall have received\u201d in the ninth clause. In the light of all else in the will these are to be interpreted as meaning \u201cshall have become entitled to receive by surviving me.\u201d In common understanding also, the devisee of an estate in fee simple absolute \u201c receives\u201d it at the moment of the testator\u2019s death, although the enjoyment is postponed until the demands of creditors shall be satisfied. He can convey and give title; he can devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The Superior Court is advised that the devises by the seventh and ninth clauses vested in right in the children of the testator at his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
