Larkin, dated the 8th day of May, 1884. The defendant claimed title by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-17\">The court found that Cephalia acquired the title to the premises in 1861, and conveyed the same to the plaintiffs in 1884, but also found that the defendant and his grantor \u201chad openly and notoriously claimed, used and occupied the land adversely as their own,\u201d from April 25th, 1863, to the time of the trial, which was in 1887. But the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>also found that Cephalia was married to Thomas Larkin in 1860, and that he lived until 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">If the marriage of Cephalia was a valid one, her right of entry was not barred at the time of the commencement of the suit, it being within five years after the death of her husband. The defendant claimed that Thomas had a wife living at the time of his ostensible marriage to Cephalia, to whom he was married in 1843, and the only question made upon the trial of the case, so far as the record discloses, was whether such was the fact. To prove the former marriage the defendant offered in evidence the deposition of one Peter O\u2018Neill Larkin, who he claimed was a son of Thomas b}\u2019 the marriage of 1843. A part of this deposition is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201c Sometime in the year 1867 my mother wrote to Father Michael Lennon, parish priest of Geggan, who lived at Crossneghn, and who performed the marriage ceremony on the occasion of my father and mother, for a certificate of the marriage, and he returned to her the following certificate, and which is in his handwriting\u2014which is as follows: \u2018 I hereby certify that Patrick Larkin and Mary O\u2019Neill were lawfully married according to the rights of the Roman Catholic Church, on the 10th of August, 1843. Witnesses present on the occasion, Henry McArdle and Ann O\u2019Neill. Dated at Crossneghn, 16th Oct., 1867. Michael Lehhoh, P. P., Guggan, County Armagh, Ireland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">\u2018\u201cP. S. The above named emigrated to America some years ago. M. L.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">\u201c My mother received this, and stated to me that it was correct. I had oftentimes previously heard her state when and where she was married, which also corresponded with this certificate. I am thoroughly conversant with the handwriting of Father Lennon, and know said certificate to be in his handwriting. My mother has often stated to me that it was Father Lennon who married her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Cross-examined: \u201c I do not remember the date that my mother wrote to Father Lennon for the certificate, except as my memory is refreshed by the date on the certificate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>At the time mother wrote for the certificate, we lived either in New York or Boston, I can\u2019t tell which; we lived in both places during that year. I think my mother wrote for the certificate because she anticipated trouble with my father. I have seen Father Lennon write. I saw him write every year from 1850 to 1860, from the time I was six years of age. I was\u2019 in Ireland when I saw him write. I don\u2019t know that I saw the letter my mother wrote to Father Lennon, but quite likely I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">At the bottom of the deposition was an agreement signed by the defendant\u2019s attorney, in these words:\u2014\u201c It is agreed that the above may be used in evidence in the above entitled cause, subject to the objections noted.\u201d No objection was noted in the deposition to the evidence quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The court upon the objection of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel rejected this part of the deposition as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The defendants assign the following reasons of appeal among others:\u2014\u201c 1st. That the court erred in rejecting the deposition of Peter O\u2019Neill Larkin upon the question of marriage. 2d. That the court erred in excluding said deposition, the plaintiff having stipulated that it might be used on the trial of said cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">It is not necessary to decide the question whether the part of the deposition quoted, standing by itself, is legal evidence. It is not such unless it appears from the certificate itself that the priest who signed it performed the marriage ceremony. The certificate does not so state in terms, and it is doubtful if that is its import.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">But however this may be, the court should have disregarded the plaintiff\u2019s objection to the testimony and received it as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">The attorney had implied authority to make the stipulation, and the defendant had a right to rely upon it in preparing his case for trial. It is quite probable that by reason of it the defendant omitted to procure other testimony which he would have had upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">There is error and a new trial should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
