Both defendants were also convicted by their respective juries of conspiracy to murder two of the victims. Firearm and gang enhancements, as well as special circumstances allegations of murder while engaged in robbery (in Mejorado\u2019s case), multiple murders and murder of a witness, were found true. The juries could not agree on the death penalty in either case, and defendants were sentenced to consecutive terms of life imprisonment without parole, as well as additional terms of imprisonment for the enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">On appeal, Arceo asserts that the admission of testimony from witnesses who recounted inculpatory statements by Mejorado and another codefendant, who was tried separately, violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront adverse witnesses. In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude there was no Sixth Amendment violation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">1. <em>Overview of the Murders and the Participants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Defendants Arceo and Mejorado were members of a gang, the Krazy Ass Mexicans, as was Francisco Ramirez. Sergio Mejorado, defendant Mejorado\u2019s half brother, was a member of a different gang. These four gang members were participants in some or all of the three murders in this case. (Sergio Mejorado was not a defendant in this case, and Ramirez, who was a defendant, is not a party to these appeals.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Mejorado and Ramirez, who were good friends, lived in a converted garage adjacent to a house (the Lopez house) owned by Mej orado\u2019s grandmother, Maria Lopez. Maria Lopez lived there with her sons Adan and Ramon Lopez, and Ramon\u2019s son David Lopez. Another grandson, Tommy Lopez, also a gang member, lived elsewhere with his then girlfriend, Jessika Merrill. Defendant Arceo and codefendant\u2019s half brother, Sergio, also lived elsewhere. Arceo had two children with Maribel Mejorado, defendant Mej orado\u2019s cousin. Except for Tommy, none of the other Lopezes were gang members. (To avoid confusion, we refer to all of the Lopezes as well as to Sergio Mejorado by their first names.) Jennifer Sanchez and America (or Erica) San Miguel, two young women described as \u201cdruggies,\u201d spent a lot of time at the garage of the Lopez house with Mejorado and Ramirez.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The first murder victim was Raymundo Flores. Flores drove a green Impala with special chrome rims and electronic equipment, and there was evidence suggesting he had recently come into possession of $18,000 and that this was known to Ramirez and Mejorado. In the early morning hours of April 12, 2005, Flores was shot in the back of the head with a .380-caliber round from a semiautomatic handgun. He was found in an alley near the Lopez house and later died. That same morning, Mejorado knocked on the door of the Lopez house and, in an excited state, told his cousin, David, who had been sleeping in the living room, that \u201cthey [(he and Ramirez)] had murdered some guy\u201d in the alley. David went back to sleep. A few hours later, when he got up to go to work, David saw a green car with expensive rims in the driveway, covered with blankets.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The next day, Ramirez and Mejorado took the rims off the car, replaced the tires with spare tires, and took televisions and other electronic equipment from the car and put them in the house. Sanchez, one of the \u201cdruggies,\u201d was present, as were Tommy and his girlfriend Merrill.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Ramirez drove away in the stripped car with Sanchez, taking the car a couple of streets away from the Lopez house. Mejorado followed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Tommy and Merrill. When Tommy and Merrill drove up, the others \u201chad gas on the car,\u201d and Mejorado then set it on fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The next two victims were Sanchez and San Miguel, the two young women who were frequently at the garage of the Lopez house with Mejorado and Ramirez. Twelve days after the Flores murder, the two young women were in the garage with Mejorado, Arceo, Ramirez, Sergio, David, and Robert Borjas (a codefendant who was tried jointly with Mejorado and Ramirez but was not convicted). In the course of the evening, after a conclave in the bathroom among Arceo, Sergio, Ramirez and Borjas, Borjas said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to tie these bitches up,\u201d which David understood to mean that Sanchez and San Miguel knew too much and had to be \u201cgotten rid of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">David left the garage after some comments by Sergio that David understood as an indirect threat to David, and went to the Lopez house to go to bed. Thereafter, Sergio and Arceo killed Sanchez and San Miguel. In the morning, Mejorado woke up David and asked to borrow his car. David gave Mejorado the keys and went back to sleep. When he woke up again and went outside, Mejorado, Arceo, Sergio and Borjas were there. Borjas told David not to go into the garage because \u201cthey had just killed Jennifer and Erica.\u201d Arceo told David that Sergio had grabbed San Miguel, shoved her into the bathroom, and shot her a couple of times, and that he (Arceo) then took the gun from Sergio, grabbed Sanchez by her hair, and \u201cput a bullet in the back of her head.\u201d Sergio bragged about the shooting as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Mejorado and Ramirez loaded the bodies (which had been dragged from the garage to the living room of the Lopez house) into the trunk of David\u2019s car; Sergio and Arceo were gone by this time. Ramirez left in the car with the bodies, which were found the next day in Tulare County, burned and unrecognizable. Adan, David, Tommy and Merrill cleaned up the house, and Adan painted the garage. Ramirez brought David\u2019s car back, and David, Tommy and Merrill cleaned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">2. <em>The Aftermath of the Murders</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">After the murders of San Miguel and Sanchez, Mejorado and Ramirez did not return to the Lopez house again, and Adan moved into the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">The three killings may have remained unsolved were it not for Merrill, Tommy\u2019s girlfriend (who died before the trial). Several days after the murders of Sanchez and San Miguel, Merrill made a then anonymous call to the Tulare County police, reporting the three murders. This resulted in a warrant to search the Lopez house, multiple interviews of David and Adan as well as interviews of Merrill, a search of a house in Delano belonging to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Mejorado\u2019s mother, and a search of David\u2019s car. The bodies of San Miguel and Sanchez were eventually identified through fingerprints on one of the bodies and teeth from the other body.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Arceo was arrested on May 31, 2005, after a routine traffic stop, at which he gave a different name. Mejorado was arrested in August 2006 in Delano; he also used a different name and was later discovered to have outstanding warrants for the three murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">3. <em>The Charges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">An information was filed in November 2005 charging Arceo and Sergio with the murders of San Miguel and Sanchez. In April 2007, a first amended information charged Ramirez, Mejorado, and Borjas, as well as Arceo and Sergio, with the San Miguel and Sanchez murders (counts 1 and 2 respectively); charged Mejorado and Ramirez with Flores\u2019s murder (count 3); and contained various firearm, gang and special circumstances allegations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The third amended information added charges that the five defendants conspired to commit the murders of San Miguel and Sanchez (counts 5 and 6 respectively). In the final, fifth amended information, Arceo and Mejorado were charged as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Arceo was charged with the San Miguel and Sanchez murders and with conspiracy to commit those murders. (\u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 182, subd. (a)(1).) The information alleged firearm use by a principal as to the two murders (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (d) &amp; (e)(1), (c) &amp; (e)(1), (b) &amp; (e)), and included three personal-firearm-use allegations in connection with San Miguel\u2019s murder <em>(id., </em>subds. (b), (c) &amp; (d)), allegations that the murders were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)), and allegations of special circumstances: that San Miguel and Sanchez were killed because they were witnesses to a crime (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(10)), and multiple murders <em>(id., </em>subd. (a)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Mejorado was charged with all three murders and with conspiracy to murder San Miguel and Sanchez. In addition, there were the same allegations of firearm use by a principal in connection with the three murders, allegations that all the offenses were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, and allegations of special circumstances: witness killing, multiple murders, and that Flores was murdered during the commission of a robbery (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>4. <em>The Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The case was tried before two juries, one for Arceo and the other for Mejorado, Ramirez and Borjas. The trial extended over several months and more than 60 witnesses testified in the guilt phase. In the end, the only testimony at issue in these appeals (with minor exceptions), and the testimony critical to the murder convictions, is the testimony of David, Adan, and (in Arceo\u2019s case) Merrill.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">At the risk of some repetition, we summarize the testimony from these witnesses that supports the convictions. Other evidence will be discussed as necessary in connection with our analyses of the specific issues raised by Arceo and Mejorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">a. <em>Jessika Merrill</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Jessika Merrill testified at Arceo\u2019s preliminary hearing, and her testimony was read to Arceo\u2019s jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Merrill was Tommy\u2019s girlfriend. She saw and participated in stripping the green Impala of its rims, tires and electronic devices, together with Tommy, Ramirez, Mejorado, David and Adan. The group, with Merrill and Tommy driving separately, then drove the car a couple of streets away from the Lopez house. When Merrill and Tommy drove up, the others \u201chad gas on the car.\u201d Mejorado set it on fire, and \u201c[i]t blew up.\u201d Mejorado got burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">A few days later, Merrill saw Sanchez, whom she described as \u201ca druggy that hung around at\u201d the Lopez house, bum \u201cthe clothes [Ramirez] was wearing I guess the night of that murder.\u201d This occurred while the group (Ramirez, Mejorado, Tommy, David and Adan) were having a cookout. Merrill saw \u201cred . . . liquidy substance or dried red stains\u201d on the clothing and on the shoes. Merrill, on several occasions after Flores\u2019s murder, heard various members of the group (Ramirez, Mejorado, Adan, David and Borjas) talk about an intention \u201c[t]o dome her [(Sanchez)] because she knew too much.\u201d (\u201c[D]ome the bitch\u201d means \u201cblow her head off.\u201d) \u201cI heard them saying\u2014they said it right there in the open that they knew too much and they thought she was going to go and tell the cops.\u201d (Tommy said \u201cdon\u2019t do this, don\u2019t think about this, this is stupid.\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Merrill testified that, after the Flores murder, Ramirez \u201chad [Sanchez] basically in check.\u201d Sanchez \u201ccouldn\u2019t go anywhere. She couldn\u2019t do anything. She wasn\u2019t allowed to leave after the first murder.\u201d Merrill said that Sanchez tried to use the phone but was told by Mejorado that she could not use the phone. After the Flores murder, Ramirez and Mejorado left, taking \u201cthe stuff from the Impala,\u201d and went to Delano, taking Sanchez with them. They returned, then left again after burning the Impala. Merrill told Sanchez that \u201cthey were going to dome her\u201d and that she should leave and not come back. On one occasion, Merrill took Sanchez to the store and told her not to come back, but she did anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Merrill and Tommy drove to the Lopez house on the day Sanchez and San Miguel were murdered and saw Ramirez and Mejorado. While they were there with Ramirez, Merrill heard gunshots; Mejorado was sitting outside in a little chair at the time. Ramirez looked at Tommy and said, \u201cGet out of here,\u201d and Merrill and Tommy left. They went to their home, and a couple of hours later, Mejorado called and told Tommy \u201cthat they needed help.\u201d Merrill did not want Tommy to go, but \u201che had to go,\u201d because \u201c[t]hat was his family.\u201d Merrill testified that, \u201cI figured if I wouldn\u2019t have acted the way I did, I was cool with everything [(the murders of Sanchez, San Miguel and Flores)], I might have been the third one there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Merrill and Tommy returned to find David\u2019s car backed up to the front door, and Mejorado, Ramirez, Adan, David and Borjas were all there, standing behind the opened trunk., (Merrill did not recall seeing Sergio and Arceo.) She approached and saw a big bag and smelled \u201ca nasty stench.\u201d She went to sit in her truck, and saw Tommy and Adan holding up a blanket; she saw Mejorado and Ramirez moving something from the front entrance of the house into the trunk of the car. Ramirez then left in the car with the bodies in the trunk. Before Ramirez left with the bodies, he told Merrill, \u201cSee how easy this shit is,\u201d a comment which Merrill took as a threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Merrill and Tommy cleaned up some of the blood that was in the front (outside the house) and then went home. At some later point, David drove his car to Tommy and Merrill\u2019s house, and they helped him clean the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Merrill agreed that her memory was better when she was interviewed by the police two months after the murder. This exchange then occurred with the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">\u201cQ. Do you remember saying that [Sergio and Arceo], you seen them\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">\u201cA. In and out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">\u201cQ. \u2014at the house on the day of the murders of the two girls? [f] So ma\u2019am, you can answer the question. Do you remember, did you tell the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>police that you remember seeing [Sergio and Arceo] there very early on the day of the murders of the two girls?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">\u201cA. I recall seeing them. Like I said in and out those days, the day before and that day. I don\u2019t remember seeing them like talking to them. I didn\u2019t say anything to them, but I remember seeing them in and out. That\u2019s it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Merrill\u2019s testimony was read only to Arceo\u2019s jury, but both juries heard various parts of Merrill\u2019s statements that were declarations against interest. Thus Detective Martinez, who interviewed Merrill, testified that Merrill told him that she helped to clean up the blood from the Lopez home, and \u201cwe helped them clean the trunk\u201d of David\u2019s car, and talked about \u201chow we blew up the car\u201d (referring to Flores\u2019s car). After Sanchez and San Miguel were murdered, Merrill eventually called the police and told them what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">b. <em>David</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">David was asleep in the living room of the Lopez house on the night of the Flores murder, when Mejorado knocked on the door. David opened the door and Mejorado and Ramirez were there. They were \u201ckind of panicking,\u201d \u201c[k]ind of like a freak mode, like they were in a rush to do things.\u201d Mejorado told him \u201cthey had murdered some guy.\u201d David told the police that Mejorado asked David if he had heard a gunshot, and said, \u201cMan, we murdered somebody, we murdered somebody, hurry up,\u201d and \u201c[w]e just murdered somebody.\u201d Mejorado grabbed some clothing and ran back out. David responded, when asked if he told police that only Mejorado came into the house and he (David) did not actually see Ramirez, \u201cThat could be right.\u201d When Mejorado said, \u201cWe just killed someone,\u201d David\u2019s impression was that Mejorado was talking about him (Mejorado) and Ramirez. David asked Mejorado, \u201c \u2018Where,\u2019 and he said, \u2018In the alley.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">David went back to sleep, and when he woke at 5:30 the next morning, he saw Flores\u2019s car with blankets on it in the driveway. A day or so later, he saw Mejorado and Ramirez stripping the car. They took the tires off the car and put some spare tires on it, and took stereo equipment, compact discs, and televisions out of the car. Sanchez was with them, sitting inside the car. Ramirez got some gas that he put in a milk container. Ramirez drove away in the car with Sanchez, and Tommy and Merrill drove away with Mejorado. David later saw Mejorado with bums on the side of his face. Mejorado told him he got burned because he tried to set the car on fire. (David did not tell the police about Mej orado\u2019s statement the first time he was interviewed, during which he \u201clied to the police and totally protected [Mejorado] and told [police] [he] didn\u2019t know anything\u201d; David lied because \u201c[h]e\u2019s family . . . .\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">When Mejorado told David that they had just killed somebody, he did not identify the victim. David found out later that it was Flores, \u201c[w]hen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>[Ramirez] bragged about it.\u201d (David told police that it was Mejorado who told him they had killed Flores.) David testified that a couple of days before the Flores murder, a girl he did not know told Mejorado (and perhaps Ramirez) that Flores had $18,000 because of a \u201ctax return or something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">After the Flores murder, David observed that Sanchez \u201ccouldn\u2019t go nowhere without\u2014without them [(Ramirez and Mejorado)] being with her or without their authorization.\u201d \u201cShe would go to the alley, you know, they had to be aware of it. She couldn\u2019t just go off anywhere by herself.\u201d On one occasion, Sanchez tried to go to the alley, \u201cand I think [Mejorado] ran after her and then asked her where she was going.\u201d It appeared to David that \u201cthey weren\u2019t letting her leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Twelve days after the Flores murder, Sanchez and San Miguel were in the garage socializing and drinking beer with David, Mejorado, Arceo, Ramirez, Sergio, and Borjas. In the course of the evening, Arceo, Sergio, Ramirez and Borjas were talking in a group, and Arceo had a .380-caliber or nine-millimeter handgun. The four of them rushed into the bathroom and David followed them because he wanted to know what was going on. (Mejorado did not follow the group into the bathroom; he had recently been shot in the leg and it was difficult for him to get around.) Ramirez and Sergio then walked out of the bathroom, and Borjas said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to tie these bitches up,\u201d which David understood to mean that Sanchez and San Miguel \u201cknew too much so they had to get rid of them.\u201d David\u2019s impression was that Sergio and Ramirez \u201cdidn\u2019t want me to hear anything. Every time I got close to them, they kind of like backed away from me.\u201d Sergio said something like \u201cI have home girls that are down to kill,\u201d or \u201cdown for murder.\u201d David took Sergio\u2019s comment as meaning \u201cthat the girls are down to kill people\u201d and as an indirect threat to David, so David left the garage and went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In the morning, Mejorado woke David up and asked to borrow David\u2019s car; Sergio was sitting on the couch and was sweating. David gave Mejorado the keys and went back to sleep. When he woke up again and went outside, Mejorado, Arceo, Sergio and Borjas were there. Borjas told David not to go into the garage because \u201cthey had just killed Jennifer and Erica.\u201d Arceo bragged about the murders, telling David that Sergio had grabbed San Miguel, shoved her into the bathroom, and shot her a couple of times, and that he (Arceo) then took the gun from Sergio, grabbed Sanchez by her hair, \u2022 and shot her. Sergio bragged about his part in the murders as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">David said that Adan came outside the house and asked David if he had seen what was inside, referring to the bodies. David then went inside and saw the bodies for the first time. Mejorado, Sergio and Ramirez loaded the bodies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>into the trank of David\u2019s car. David and Adan held up blankets while the bodies were being loaded in the car, so that no one in the neighboring church parking lot could observe what was being done.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">After the bodies were loaded up, Ramirez drove the car away. David never saw Ramirez return to the Lopez house after that time, nor did he ever see Mejorado again. David helped clean up the house, \u201cmeaning mop up blood and stuff like that.\u201d David painted and cleaned up \u201cthe blood and stuff in the shower.\u201d Tommy and Merrill were present when the house was being cleaned up.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">David later called Mejorado to tell him he (David) wanted his car back. Mejorado was angry at David for demanding the return of his car and David felt threatened. Ramirez eventually brought the car back to the driveway of the Lopez house. One of the sides of the car was \u201ctrashed.\u201d David took the car to Tommy\u2019s house and David, Tommy and Merrill cleaned the trank of his car. Ramirez told David to bum the car, but David refused; Ramirez then told him to change the tires, and David did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">David said that after the murders, Ramirez and Mejorado fled to Guadalajara (and tried to get David to go with them); David moved to Delano to live with his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">David was interviewed by the police several different times in May 2005, and twice more in May and July 2006. During his first interview, he lied to the police to protect Mejorado and told them he did not know anything. In subsequent interviews, he told \u201cpart of the truth . . . and some I held back.\u201d Sometime after the May 2005 interviews, David moved to Oregon. He was arrested in Oregon by federal agents in March 2006, and told them that his cousin (or cousins) \u201cshot [a] couple of girls for no reason\u201d and all he did was to clean up blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">David was charged with aiding and abetting after the fact (\u00a7 32); he pled guilty and was put on probation (after serving a little time in county jail). David first told the police that Arceo and Sergio had bragged to him about shooting the girls in his fifth interview, in July 2006, after he had served his time on the accessory'charge and had been relocated back to Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">c. <em>Adan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">Adan is the uncle of Mejorado, David and Tommy, and lived in the Lopez house. Mejorado was his favorite nephew. Like David, he was arrested and pled guilty to charges of aiding in the murders after the fact (\u00a7 32). He was in custody when he testified at trial because he had called Detective Martinez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>and told Mm he would not testify unless Mejorado was released. He said that he feared for his life because he was testifying, and when he talked to the police in May 2005, he was concerned that he might be killed by friends or \u201chomeboys\u201d of Arceo\u2019s or Sergio\u2019s. Adan told police he lied to them in Ms first interview because, when Ramirez, Arceo and Sergio\u2019s homeboys\u2014their fellow gang members\u2014\u201cfind out that I\u2019m telling you that I told you everything, they\u2019re going to be\u2014they\u2019re going to be on me and they\u2019re going to try to kill me. That\u2019s why I lied the first time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Adan was also asleep in the living room of the Lopez house on the night of the Flores murder, when he was awakened by Mejorado\u2019s knocking on the door. Mejorado looked scared. Adan walked out on the porch, heard a car engine and saw a green car; Ramirez was in the car. Adan then went back to sleep. The next morning, he saw the green Impala covered with blankets.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Adan also saw Mejorado and Ramirez taking the rims off the car. Ramirez told Adan that he shot Flores in the back of his head. After they took the rims off the car and put them in the garage, Ramirez drove away in the car with Sanchez. Mejorado left with Tommy and Merrill. The next day, Adan saw Mejorado with bums on Ms face.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">When Adan woke up on the morning after Sanchez and San Miguel were killed, he saw Sergio sitting on the couch. He went back to sleep and when he woke up again, he saw San Miguel\u2019s body wrapped in a blanket behind the couch. He \u201cgot freaked out\u201d and went outside, where he saw Sergio and Ramirez. He eventually saw Mejorado walk out of the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Sergio told Adan that he had gone in the bathroom and shot Sanchez while she was standing in the shower. Sergio said he was going to shoot San Miguel, but Arceo told Sergio that he would take care of San Miguel; Sergio handed the gun to Arceo and Arceo shot San Miguel in the head. At trial, Adan said he never spoke to Arceo, but Adan told the police that Arceo told him (Adan) the same story that Sergio told him, including that Arceo told Sergio to give him (Arceo) the gun, Sergio did so, \u201c \u2018and that\u2019s when he [(Arceo)] got [San Miguel] and took her to the restroom.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Adan saw that Sanchez\u2019s body was put in his (Adan\u2019s) duffle bag. Adan testified he saw Ramirez and Borjas loading the bodies into a car, but when he was first interviewed by Detective Martinez, he told Martinez \u201cit was [Ramirez] and [Mejorado] loading the bodies,\u201d and Sergio and Arceo were gone by tMs time.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>After he found out how Sanchez and San Miguel were killed and after the bodies were moved, Adan helped Mejorado clean up the house. He washed down the blood in the driveway and mopped up the blood in the living room. Tommy and Merrill arrived during the cleanup of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Adan told the police that Mejorado told him that Arceo and Sergio killed Sanchez and San Miguel. Adan told police that Ramirez told him that they killed the girls because they were afraid Sanchez was going to snitch on them (about the Flores murder). Ramirez drove away with the bodies and Borjas burned clothing in the alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">5. <em>The Verdicts and Sentences</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">a. <em>Arceo</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Arceo\u2019s jury convicted him of the first degree murders of Sanchez and San Miguel and of the two conspiracy counts, and found all the enhancing allegations and special circumstances true. The jury declared itself deadlocked on the death penalty, and the prosecution decided not to retry the penalty phase. The court sentenced Arceo to life in prison without the possibility of parole for each of the two murders. As to count 1 (San Miguel), the court imposed a consecutive sentence of 25 years to life under section 12022.53, subdivision (d) (personally and intentionally discharging a firearm proximately causing death) and stayed the findings on the other firearm enhancements (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (b), (c) &amp; (e)(1)). As to count 2 (Sanchez), the court also imposed a consecutive term of 25 years to life under section 12022.53, subdivisions (d) and (e)(1) (for a principal\u2019s personal and intentional discharge of a firearm causing death with a \u00a7 186.22 gang allegation found to be true). The court imposed and stayed sentences of fife imprisonment without parole on the conspiracy counts (\u00a7 654), and made various other orders on restitution, presentence custody credits and so on.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">b. <em>Mejorado</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">Mejorado\u2019s jury found him guilty of the first degree murder of Flores. The jury found true the allegations that a principal personally and intentionally discharged a firearm proximately causing the death of Flores (as well as the lesser firearm allegations), and found the special circumstance allegation (that Mejorado committed the murder while engaged in a robbery) to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">The jury also found Mejorado guilty of the first degree murders of San Miguel and Sanchez, and found true the allegations that a principal personally and intentionally discharged a firearm proximately causing the deaths of San Miguel and Sanchez (as well as the lesser firearm allegations and the gang <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>allegation). The jury found the special circumstance allegations that San Miguel was intentionally killed because she was a witness to a crime, and that Mejorado committed more than one offense of murder, to be true. The jury also found Mejorado guilty of conspiracy to commit the murders of San Miguel and Sanchez, and found the gang allegations attached to those counts to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The jury could not reach verdicts on the special allegation that Sanchez was killed because she was a witness to a crime or on the gang allegation attached to the Flores murder count, and the court declared a mistrial on those allegations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">As in Arceo\u2019s case, Mejorado\u2019s jury declared itself deadlocked on the death penalty. The court sentenced Mejorado to three terms of life without parole, plus 50 years to life for the firearm enhancements with respect to the San Miguel and Sanchez murders. The court imposed and stayed sentences on the conspiracy counts under section 654, and made various other orders on restitution, presentence custody credits and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Arceo and Mejorado filed timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">1. <em>Arceo</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">a. <em>The admission of testimony from David and Adan did not violate Arceo\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront adverse witnesses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Before and throughout the trial, Arceo sought to exclude and objected to the admission of testimony from David and Adan recounting the inculpatory statements that Sergio and Mejorado made to them. Likewise on appeal, Arceo challenges the introduction of those statements as a denial of his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights. Specifically, Arceo complains of three sets of statements: (1) David\u2019s testimony that Sergio confirmed Arceo\u2019s own account of the murders; (2) Adan\u2019s testimony that Sergio bragged to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>about the murders; and (3) Adan\u2019s prior statement to the police (elicited by counsel for Borjas) that Mejorado told him that Sergio and Arceo perpetrated the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The substance of Arceo\u2019s claim is that the testimony in question consisted of hearsay statements of nontestifying codefendants, and that such statements are inadmissible under <em>Bruton v. United States </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 123 [20 L.Ed.2d 476, 88 S.Ct. 1620] <em>(Bruton) </em>and <em>People v. Aranda </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 518 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265] <em>(Aranda). </em>Further, the argument continues, various exceptions to the <em>Bruton/Aranda </em>rule\u2014declarations against interest, hearsay statements containing particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, and coconspirator statements in furtherance of a conspiracy\u2014do not apply. Ergo, use of incriminating statements by nontestifying codefendants (Sergio and Mejorado) who cannot be cross-examined violates the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Our review of the applicable precedents leads us to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">(1) <em>The applicable law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">First, the confrontation clause has no application to out-of-court nontestimonial statements <em>(Whorton v. Bockting </em>(2007) 549 U.S. 406, 420 [167 L.Ed.2d 1, 127 S.Ct. 1173] <em>(Whorton); People v. Gutierrez </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 789, 812 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 225, 200 P.3d 847]), including statements by codefendants. <em>(U.S. v. Figueroa-Cartagena </em>(1st Cir. 2010) 612 F.3d 69, 85 <em>(Figueroa-Cartagena) [Bruton </em>must be viewed \u201cthrough the lens of <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis\u201d;</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>if the challenged statement is not testimonial, the confrontation clause has no application]; see also <em>U.S. v. Johnson </em>(6th Cir. 2009) 581 F.3d 320, 326 [\u201c[b]ecause it is premised on the Confrontation Clause, the <em>Bruton </em>rule, like the Confrontation Clause itself, does not apply to non-testimonial statements\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Second, even if the <em>Bruton </em>rule applied to nontestimonial statements of nontestifying codefendants, <em>Bruton </em>itself involved hearsay statements of codefendants that were \u201cclearly inadmissible\u201d under the rules of evidence. As Arceo necessarily concedes, under <em>Bruton </em>and its progeny, a codefendant\u2019s hearsay statement <em>is </em>admissible \u201cif it falls within a \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 hearsay exception or is \u2018supported by a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Mussare </em>(3d Cir. 2005) 405 F.3d 161, 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Third, California courts before and after <em>Crawford </em>have held that the admission of statements possessing sufficient indicia of reliability to fall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>within the hearsay exception for declarations against interest does not deny a defendant the right of confrontation guaranteed by the United States Constitution. <em>(People v. Cervantes </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 162, 176-177 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 774] (Cervantes); <em>People </em>v. <em>Greenberger </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 298, 330-331 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 61] <em>(Greenberger).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">We reprise the pertinent cases in more detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In <em>Bruton, </em>the high court held that the introduction of a codefendant\u2019s confession implicating the defendant in a joint trial violated the right of cross-examination secured by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment, even if the jury is instructed to consider the confession only against the codefendant. <em>(Bruton, supra, </em>391 U.S. at p. 137; see also <em>People v.

The court continued: \u201cThere is not before us, therefore, any recognized exception to the hearsay rule insofar as [defendant Bruton] is concerned and we intimate no view whatever that such exceptions necessarily raise questions under the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) In Aranda, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 518, which preceded <em>Bruton, </em>the California Supreme Court adopted an approach similar to the <em>Bruton </em>rule as \u201cjudicially declared rules of practice.\u201d <em>(Aranda, </em>at pp. 530-531.) <em>(Aranda </em>was abrogated in 1982\u2014\u201c[t]o the extent that <em>[Aranda] </em>constitutes a rule governing the admissibility of evidence, and to the extent this rule of evidence requires the exclusion of relevant evidence .that need not be excluded under federal constitutional law\u201d\u2014by the \u201ctruth-in-evidence\u201d provision of Prop. 8 (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (d)).) <em>(People v. Fletcher, supra, </em>at p. 465.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">In <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. 36, the high court held that the confrontation clause barred the admission of testimonial statements of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>witness who did not appear at trial, unless he was unavailable to testify and the defendant had had a previous opportunity for cross-examination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In <em>Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at page 821, the high court explained that \u201c[o]nly statements of this sort [(testimonial statements)] cause the declarant to be a \u2018witness\u2019 within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause. [Citation.] It is the testimonial character of the statement that separates it from other hearsay that, while subject to traditional limitations upon hearsay evidence, is not subject to the Confrontation Clause.\u201d (See <em>People v. Garcia </em>(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 261, 291 [85 Cal.Rptr.3d 393] [\u201cafter <em>Davis, </em>the determination of whether the admission of a hearsay statement violates a defendant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause turns on whether the statement is testimonial\u201d; if the statement is not testimonial, \u201cit does not implicate the confrontation clause, and the issue is simply whether the statement is admissible under state law as an exception to the hearsay rule\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In <em>Greenberger, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th at pages 330-331, a case predating <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis, </em>the court held that the \u201cadmission of a statement [of a codefendant] possessing sufficient indicia of reliability to fall within the hearsay exception of a declaration against penal interest does not deny a defendant the right of confrontation guaranteed by the United States Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In <em>Cervantes, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th 162, the court, relying on <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Greenberger, </em>explained that <em>Crawford </em>recognized that if the statement at issue is nontestimonial, the rules of evidence, including hearsay rules, apply; state courts may consider \u201c \u2018reliability factors beyond prior opportunity for cross-examination when the hearsay statement at issue was not testimonial. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cervantes, </em>at p. 173.) Thus <em>Cervantes </em>held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>trial court properly admitted a codefendant\u2019s nontestimonial statement as against the other defendants, because the statement qualified as a declaration against interest and satisfied the constitutional standard of trustworthiness. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">(2) <em>This case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Arceo concedes that the statements by Sergio and Mejorado to David and Adan were not testimonial. But he resists the conclusion that, because the statements were not testimonial, there was no confrontation clause violation. Instead, he asserts that the <em>Bruton </em>line of cases represents a \u201cspecial rule\u201d that applies to extrajudicial statements of unavailable codefendants who make incriminating statements, \u201ca rule that survives the \u2018testimonial vs. nontestimonial\u2019 classification.\u201d Arceo points to <em>People v. Garcia, </em>where the court observed that, \u201cWhether the <em>Aranda/Bruton </em>rule applies only to extrajudicial <em>testimonial </em>statements appears to be an unsettled question, and one that we need not address in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(People v. Garcia, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.4th at p. 282, fn. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">But, as we have seen, since <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia\u2019s </em>observation, a number of federal courts have expressly held that the <em>Bruton </em>rule does not apply to nontestimonial statements. (E.g., <em>Figueroa-Cartagena, supra, </em>612 F.3d at p. 85; <em>U.S. v. Johnson, supra, </em>581 F.3d at p. 326.) In <em>Figueroa-Cartagena, </em>where the extrajudicial statements at issue were nontestimonial, the court first pointed out that <em>Davis </em>stated that nontestimonial statements \u201cdo not \u2018cause the declarant to be a \u201cwitness\u201d \u2019 within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment and thus are \u2018not subject to the Confrontation Clause.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Figueroa-Cartagena, </em>at p. 84.) The court then discussed the earlier Bruton/Richardson<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> framework for determining admissibility when a nontestifying defendant\u2019s statement is proffered at trial. <em>(Figueroa-Cartagena, </em>at p. 85.) The court reasoned that the <em>Bruton/Richardson </em>framework \u201cpresupposes that the aggrieved co-defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to confront the declarant in the first place.\u201d <em>(Figueroa-Cartagena, supra, </em>at p. 85.) The court continued: \u201cIf none of the co-defendants has a constitutional right to confront the declarant, none can complain that his right has been denied. It is thus necessary to view <em>Bruton </em>through the lens of <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis. </em>The threshold question in every case is whether the challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>statement is testimonial. If it is not, the Confrontation Clause \u2018has no application.\u2019 \u201d (Ibid., quoting <em>Whorton, supra, </em>549 U.S. at p. 420.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Arceo insists that Figueroa-Cartagena\u2019s reasoning is flawed. He points out that <em>Whorton, </em>on which the <em>Figueroa-Cartagena </em>court relied for the proposition that under <em>Crawford, </em>the confrontation clause has no application to out-of-court nontestimonial statements <em>(Whorton, supra, </em>549 U.S. at p. 420), did not involve a statement by a nontestifying codefendant, and did not purport to overrule <em>Bruton. </em>Of course <em>Whorton </em>did not overrule <em>Bruton, </em>but there is nothing flawed in Figueroa-Cartagena\u2019s reasoning. <em>Bruton </em>itself did not purport to govern any recognized exception to the hearsay rule: \u201c[W]e intimate no view whatever that such exceptions necessarily raise questions under the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>(Bruton, supra, </em>391 U.S. at p. 128, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In sum, from this body of law we can draw only one conclusion. <em>Crawford, Davis, </em>and <em>Whorton </em>mean what they say\u2014the confrontation clause applies only to testimonial statements\u2014and nothing in the cases applying that principle to extrajudicial statements by nontestifying codefendants is inconsistent with or purports \u201cto overrule <em>Bruton,\u201d </em>which itself did not address \u201cany recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>(Bruton, supra, </em>391 U.S. at p. 128, fn. 3.) Accordingly, if Sergio\u2019s statements to David and Ad\u00e1n, and Mejorado\u2019s statement to Adan, were admissible under state law as exceptions to the hearsay rule, there was no error in the admission of that testimony.  And, as California courts have held, \u201c \u2018a declaration against interest may be admitted in a joint trial so long as the statement satisfies the statutory definition and otherwise satisfies the constitutional requirement of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cervantes, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at p. 177, quoting <em>Greenberger, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th at p. 334.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">We turn to the specific testimony at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>(a) <em>Sergio\u2019s statements to David and Adan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Arceo objects to David\u2019s testimony that Sergio confirmed Arceo\u2019s account of the murders. Specifically, after describing Arceo\u2019s account to him of the murders, which David described as \u201cbragging,\u201d David testified that he told the police that Mejorado, Sergio, Borjas and Arceo were all there during the bragging, and that Sergio \u201cbrag[ged] about his part too,\u201d and that \u201cthey both admitted their involvement.\u201d Similarly, Arceo objects to Adan\u2019s testimony that Sergio bragged to him about the murders. Specifically, Adan testified that Sergio described how he killed Sanchez, and told Adan that, when he was going to shoot San Miguel, Arceo told Sergio that he would take care of her. Sergio told Adan that he handed the gun to Arceo, who tried to grab San Miguel, and when she resisted, Arceo shot her. (Adan also told the police that Arceo told him the same story that Sergio told him.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">To the extent that Sergio\u2019s \u201cbragg[ing] about his part\u201d and \u201cadmitting] [his] involvement\u201d implicate Arceo (and respondent asserts they do not), the statements are declarations against interest and admissible under Evidence Code section 1230, as are Sergio\u2019s statements to Adan describing the murders. Section 1230 provides that: \u201cEvidence of a statement by a declarant having sufficient knowledge of the subject is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness and the statement, when made, ... so far subjected him to the risk of civil or criminal liability, . . . that a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Certainly Sergio\u2019s bragging to David about his part in the murders meets this statutory definition, as does Sergio\u2019s description to Adan of his and Arceo\u2019s actions; in each case, the statements subject Sergio to criminal liability. And, as <em>Greenberger </em>points out, statements genuinely and specifically inculpating the declarant provide particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>(Greenberger, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th at p. 329; see also <em>Cervantes, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at pp. 175-177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Arceo insists that <em>Greenberger </em>is \u201cwrong,\u201d and \u201cbad law,\u201d pointing to <em>Lilly v. Virginia </em>(1999) 527 U.S. 116 [119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117] <em>(Lilly), </em>where the plurality opinion held that a declaration against penal interest is not a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d exception to the hearsay rule, and does not necessarily render a statement trustworthy so as to be admissible. <em>(Lilly, </em>at pp. 126-134; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Schmaus </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 846, 857 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 521] [stating <em>Lilly </em>plurality opinion casts doubt on Greenberger].) But <em>Lilly, </em>which involved a 50-page custodial confession, also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>observed that \u201c[w]hen a court can be confident . . . \u2018the declarant\u2019s truthfulness is so clear from the surrounding circumstances that the test of cross-examination would be of marginal utility,\u2019 the Sixth Amendment\u2019s residual \u2018trustworthiness\u2019 test allows the admission of the declarant\u2019s statements.\u201d <em>(Lilly, supra, </em>at pp. 136, 139 [confession of an accomplice while in custody, primarily responding to leading questions and under the influence of alcohol were not so inherently reliable that cross-examination would have been superfluous].) Indeed, <em>Greenberger </em>recognizes that not all statements which incriminate the declarant and implicate the codefendant are admissible. The statement must satisfy the statutory definition and the trustworthiness requirement. \u201cThis necessarily requires a \u2018fact-intensive inquiry, which would require careful examination of all the circumstances surrounding the criminal activity involved . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Greenberger, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.4th at p. 332.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Here, our independent review of the circumstances surrounding Sergio\u2019s statements confirms that his statements bear sufficient indicia of trustworthiness and fall within the declaration against interest exception. Sergio\u2019s statements were specifically disserving of his penal interest. His statement to David \u201cbragg[ing] about his part\u201d and \u201cadmitting] [his] involvement\u201d patently disserves his penal interests. The same is true of his statements to Adan about Arceo\u2019s part in the murders; he told Adan that, when he (Sergio) was going to shoot San Miguel, Arceo said that he would take care of her and Sergio handed him the gun, clearly subjecting Sergio to criminal liability for the second murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The trustworthiness of Sergio\u2019s statements is equally clear. In addition to the \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of the veracity that ordinarily flows from a person\u2019s interest in not being criminally implicated <em>(People v. Spriggs, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d at p. 874), the circumstances surrounding Sergio\u2019s statements confirm their reliability. Sergio\u2019s statements were not made in a custodial context or in any other context remotely close to \u201can accomplice\u2019s statements that shift or spread the blame\u201d to another. <em>(Lilly, supra, </em>527 U.S. at p. 133.)

We have no hesitation in concluding that, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>circumstances presented by this record, Sergio\u2019s statements to David and Adan qualified as declarations against interest and were \u201c \u2018so trustworthy that adversarial testing would add little to [their] reliability ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Cervantes, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at p. 177, quoting <em>Idaho v. Wright </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 805, 821 [111 L.Ed.2d 638, 110 S.Ct. 3139].)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">(b) <em>Mejorado \u2019s statement to Adan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Arceo also challenges the admission of a statement by Mejorado to Adan to the effect that Sergio and Arceo perpetrated the Sanchez and San Miguel murders. This statement was elicited during Adan\u2019s cross-examination by counsel for Borjas to show inconsistencies in Adan\u2019s statements to the police. We agree with respondent that Mejorado\u2019s statement to Adan\u2014that Sergio and Arceo committed the murders\u2014was admissible as a statement by Mejorado in furtherance of a conspiracy.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Hearsay statements by coconspirators may be admitted against a party if independent proof of a conspiracy has been shown, and three preliminary facts are established: \u201c \u2018(1) that the declarant was participating in a conspiracy at the time of the declaration; (2) that the declaration was in furtherance of the objective of that conspiracy; and (3) that at the time of the declaration the party against whom the evidence is offered was participating or would later participate in the conspiracy.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hardy </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 139 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 825 P.2d 781].) \u201c[W]hether statements made are in furtherance of a conspiracy depends on an analysis of the totality of the facts and circumstances in the case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">As respondent points out, Mejorado, Arceo and the others were charged with conspiracy to murder San Miguel and Sanchez, and the prosecutor specifically alleged that overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy included transporting the victims\u2019 bodies to Tulare County and burning the bodies. The \u201ctotality of the facts and circumstances\u201d <em>(People v. Hardy, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 146) shows that the conspiracy extended to concealing the bodies of the victims. The evidence showed that when Adan woke up on the morning San Miguel and Sanchez were killed, he saw San Miguel\u2019s body wrapped in a blanket behind the couch, and \u201cfreaked out.\u201d It is reasonable to infer that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>because Adan saw one of the bodies, Mejorado had to explain what had happened in order to have Adan join in the conspirators\u2019 efforts to clean up the house, dispose of the bodies and otherwise conceal the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Arceo concedes that the scope and extent of a conspiracy and its objectives is a question of fact for the jury,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but insists there was \u201cno evidence that Arceo was part of a conspiracy to conceal the murders by cleaning up the garage or disposing of the bodies.\u201d Therefore (Arceo contends) Mejorado\u2019s statements were not made \u201cprior to or during\u201d the conspiracy to which Arceo was a party (the murders themselves). But no evidence that Arceo himself was \u201ca participant in the cleanup or disposal of the bodies\u201d was necessary. The scope of the conspiracy was for the jury to decide, and a conspirator is liable for the acts of his coconspirators until he effectively withdraws from the conspiracy. There was not the slightest evidence Arceo communicated to his cohorts any rejection or repudiation of the continuing conspiracy to dispose of the bodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In any case, even if Mejorado\u2019s statement had been inadmissible, Adan\u2019s testimony on this point was cumulative and harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Burney </em>(2009) 47 Cal.4th 203, 232 [97 Cal.Rptr.3d 348, 212 P.3d 639] <em>[Bruton/Aranda </em>error is scrutinized under the harmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824]; \u201c \u2018if <em>the </em>properly admitted evidence is overwhelming and the incriminating extrajudicial statement is merely cumulative of other direct evidence, the error will be deemed harmless.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d].) Here, the jury heard properly admitted testimony that Arceo himself told both David and Adan that he shot one of the victims, and that Sergio told both David and Adan the same story. Under these circumstances, it is inconceivable that the jury would not have convicted Arceo in the absence of Adan\u2019s additional statement that Mejorado told him the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>b., c. *</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">2. <em>Mejorado</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Bigelow, P.
