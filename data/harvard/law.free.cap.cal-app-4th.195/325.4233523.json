Among those laid off were a number of members of appellant Alameda County Management Employees Association (ACMEA), a labor organization representing certain Court employees in managerial classifications. After being notified of the impending action, a number of ACMEA members selected for layoff invoked the seniority provisions of the Court\u2019s personnel policies and requested demotions or transfers to lower paying classifications in which they had previously held tenure. Although these employees\u2019 seniority would have entitled them to demotions under the Court\u2019s personnel policies, in all but two instances, the Court denied their requests, citing the definition of seniority contained in a memorandum of understanding (MOU) it had negotiated with another union. The Court determined that the seniority definition contained in the MOU applied to ACMEA\u2019s members and that under that definition, they could not exercise the demotion rights they would otherwise have enjoyed under the Court\u2019s personnel policies. In addition, the laid-off ACMEA members requested due process hearings in front of a hearing officer, believing that their layoffs were disciplinary in character. The Court denied those requests also.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">ACMEA and the employees later filed a petition for writ of mandate, alleging that the Court had violated the provisions of the Trial Court Employment Protection and Governance Act (Act; Gov. Code, \u00a7 71600 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by failing to meet and confer with ACMEA before changing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>seniority and demotion rights of its members. They also claimed the Court had violated its own policies and rules by refusing to grant the requests to demote in lieu of layoff. Finally, they alleged the Court had violated their due process rights under the federal and California Constitutions by failing to accord them due process hearings. The petition was heard under the special provisions of the Act, and after hearing, the trial judge denied the petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">ACMEA now appeals from that adverse judgment. We agree with ACMEA that the Court\u2019s actions violated the Act and the Court\u2019s own policies and rules. We disagree that the Court denied the laid-off employees due process. Accordingly, we will reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The Statutory Background</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">ACMEA contends the Court violated the provisions of the Act by changing its members\u2019 seniority rights without first meeting and conferring with their union. (See \u00a7 71634.2, subd. (a).) To our knowledge, only one other California appellate court has construed the Act. <em>(OCEA, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th 287.) We will therefore briefly review its origins and the relevant provisions of the Act before turning to the merits of the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\n<em>Origins of the Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The Trial Court Funding and Improvement Act of 1997 established a Task Force on Trial Court Employees (the Task Force) \u201ccharged with recommending an appropriate system of employment and governance for trial court employees.\u201d (See Stats. 1997, ch. 850, \u00a7 48, p. 6009, codified at \u00a7 77600 et seq.) The Legislature\u2019s stated goal was \u201cto adopt a plan to transition all existing court employees into an appropriate employment status\u201d by January 1, 2001. (Stats. 1997, ch. 850, \u00a7 3(g)(2), pp. 5969, 5970.) It also wished to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>consider \u201ca mechanism for involvement of the local judiciary in the negotiations regarding compensation of court employees.\u201d (Stats. 1997, ch. 850, \u00a7 3(g)(3), pp. 5969, 5970.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The Legislature directed the Task Force to study a number of components of personnel policy, including such issues as employment status, classification, and salary; retirement and other benefits; and bargaining procedures and agreements. (\u00a7 77603, subds. (a)-(e).) In addition, the Task Force was directed to examine and outline issues for establishing a local personnel structure for trial court employees and then to recommend such a structure. (\u00a7 77603, subds. (g), (i).) The Legislature\u2019s intent was to enact a personnel system for trial court employees that would have \u201cuniform statewide applicability and promote organizational and operational flexibility . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 77605, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">In its final report, the Task Force made recommendations regarding the components of a personnel system for trial court employees. (See Task Force on Trial Court Employees (Dec. 31, 1999) Final Rep., pp. 63-201 (Final Report).) Relevant here is the Task Force\u2019s recommendation for a meet and confer model under which representatives of the trial courts and representatives of recognized employee organizations \u201cshall meet and confer and be authorized to reach tentative agreement regarding all subjects within the scope of representation on behalf of their respective principals.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 VI, p. 84.) The Task Force recommended meet-and-confer provisions for the new Act based on the language of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (MMBA; \u00a7\u00a7 3500-3511). (Final Rep., at <em>\u00b6 </em>II, p. 84.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The Legislature responded to the Task Force recommendations with Senate Bill No. 2140 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.). (See <em>id., </em>\u00a7 14.) Senate Bill No. 2140 embraced the recommendations by adopting \u201ca mechanism for setting the terms and conditions of trial court employment, incorporating various provisions of the [MMBA]; [and by] providing] that recognized employee organizations and court representatives shall utilize the \u2018meet and confer\u2019 process . . . .\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, 3d reading analysis of Sen. Bill No. 2140 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 25, 2000, p. 1; Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 2140 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 5, 2000, p. 1.) The Act was signed into law on September 29, 2000. (\u00a7 71600 et seq.; Stats. 2000, ch. 1010, \u00a7 14, p. 7356.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\n<em>Labor Relations Under the Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">The provisions of the Act governing labor relations are found in title 8, chapter 7, article 3 of the Government Code. One purpose of the statute is \u201cto promote full communication between trial courts and their employees by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>providing a reasonable method for resolving disputes regarding wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment between trial courts and recognized employee organizations.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u00a7 71630, subd. (a).) Another stated purpose of this article is \u201cto extend to trial court employees the right, and to require trial courts, to meet and confer in good faith over matters within the scope of representation, consistent with the procedures set forth in this article.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The Act therefore guarantees trial court employees \u201cthe right to form, join, and participate in the activities of employee organizations of their own choosing for the purpose of representation on all matters of employer-employee relations.\u201d (\u00a771631.) Recognized employee organizations, in turn, are empowered to represent their members in employment relations with trial courts as to the matters covered by the Act. (\u00a7 71633.) Under the Act, the scope of representation includes \u201call matters relating to employment conditions and employer-employee relations, including, but not limited to, wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d (\u00a7 71634, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Trial courts are therefore required to meet and confer in good faith with representatives of recognized employee organizations regarding matters within the scope of representation. (\u00a7 71634.2, subd. (a).) The Act mandates that trial courts \u201cconsider fully the presentations as are made by the recognized employee organization on behalf of its members prior to arriving at a determination of policy or course of action.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>If the trial court and the employee organization reach agreement, they must prepare a written MOU and present it to the trial court for determination. (\u00a7 71634.3.) If the trial court adopts the MOU, the written agreement becomes \u201cbinding upon the parties.\u201d (\u00a7 71639.5, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\n<em>Transitional Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Unless expressly provided by the statute, the enactment of the Act did not itself require \u201cmodification or elimination of any existing . . . terms and conditions of employment of trial court employees.\u201d (\u00a7 71612.) Save for minimum standards prescribed by the Act, however, the statute permits the elimination or modification of preexisting terms and conditions of employment \u201cthrough the meet and confer in good faith process.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In establishing local personnel structures for their employees, trial courts are required to give consideration to \u201cprotecting the rights accmed by trial court employees under their current systems,\u201d but the Act permits reconsideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>of prior contractual obligations and rights, again subject to obligation to meet and confer in good faith. (\u00a7 71615, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The facts of this case are undisputed. In the court below, the parties filed joint stipulations regarding the facts and the procedures governing the conduct of the litigation. The parties specifically agreed their stipulations \u201ccontain[ed] all material facts upon which the parties . . . intend to rely in the merits phase of this litigation.\u201d We therefore take our factual statement from these stipulations and their attached exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\n<em>The Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">ACMEA is a labor organization and is the certified bargaining representative of various Court employees holding certain managerial, supervisory, and administrative positions. The employee classifications represented by ACMEA are listed in appendix A to the most recent MOU between ACMEA and the Court. The Court has recognized ACMEA as the exclusive bargaining representative of employees in those classifications. ACMEA qualifies as an \u201cemployee organization\u201d within the meaning of section 71601, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Petitioners Bridget Conner, Donna Fabian, Linda Fisher, Sylvia Gee, Dena Gomez, Danith Kincaid, Alina Mateo, Denise Martinez, Rosalina Neeley, Nikki Riley, Carla Schengel, Alisa Taylor, and Deborah Williams (collectively, the Individual Petitioners) are individuals who were at all relevant times employees of the Court. The Individual Petitioners are \u201ctrial court employees\u201d within the meaning of section 71601, subdivision (Z) and were members of the bargaining unit represented by ACMEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">The Court is a superior court of the State of California and is a \u201ctrial court\u201d within the meaning of section 71601, subdivision (k).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">\n<em>Relevant Personnel Policies and Agreements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">Effective November 15, 2001, the Court promulgated a set of personnel organization policies and rules (the Personnel Policies) after meeting, conferring, and reaching agreement on the content of these policies and rules with ACMEA and other labor organizations representing Court employees. The Court later amended and repromulgated the Personnel Policies effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>March 14, 2003, April 12, 2006, and again in May of 2008.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since May 2008, the Court has not promulgated any amendments to, or new versions of, its Personnel Policies. The Personnel Policies contain a preface that states in relevant part: \u201cThe policies and rules contained in this manual apply to employees in represented and unrepresented court classifications . . . . . [|] Where these policies and rules conflict with provisions of a memorandum of understanding between the Court and a recognized employee organization, the MOU provisions will govern as to employees occupying positions in classifications covered by the MOU.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In accordance with section 7.1 of the Personnel Policies, the Court promulgated a \u201cLayoff Policy\u201d that became effective May 14, 2003. The Layoff Policy has not been amended or repromulgated since that time, and no other layoff instructions have been issued. Section X of the Layoff Policy is entitled \u201cLayoff Options &amp; Displacement (\u2018Bumping\u2019) Rights.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It provides that \u201c[i]n the event of a layoff, an employee in a classification affected by a reduction in force shall have the following options: [ID \u2022 Elect to demote to a lower paying class, if the employee previously held tenure in the lower paying class . . . .\u201d This language is similar to section 7.1.2 of the Personnel Policies, under which \u201c[a]n employee in a classification affected by a reduction in force may, in lieu of layoff, elect to demote to a lower paying classification, provided that such employee held tenure in the lower paying classification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">ACMEA and the Court negotiated an MOU in 2008. This MOU is effective between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The Service Employees International Union, Local 1021 (SEIU) represents Court employees holding jobs in the classifications of administrative services clerk, fiscal assistant, trial court financial hearing officer, legal processing assistant, and courtroom clerk. The Court and SEIU have negotiated an MOU regarding conditions of employment that is effective from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2011 (the SEIU MOU). The Court and SEIU entered into the SEIU MOU without providing any notice to ACMEA and without providing ACMEA the opportunity to meet and confer over any part of the agreement\u2019s contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The SEIU MOU includes new language that had not been in any prior MOU. Section 30, entitled \u201cSeniority,\u201d states: \u201cSeniority Defined: Except for layoff and recall which utilize classification seniority, seniority shall be measured by hours worked (paid status) using the total service for the Court or the Court and Alameda County if the employee has worked in a classification assigned to the Court prior to January I, 2001.\u201d Section 30.C.4 also includes new language providing that \u201cSeniority shall be terminated by: [f] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 HD \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Failure beyond six (6) months to return from a non bargaining unit position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\n<em>The June 2009 Layoffs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">For the 2009-2010 year, the Court experienced a reduction in budget of approximately $5,944,151. Effective June 26, 2009, the Court implemented a significant reduction in force. It laid off 72 employees, including 37 employees in the SEIU bargaining unit and 28 in the ACMEA bargaining unit, as well as seven unrepresented employees. The individuals selected for layoff from ACMEA positions, including the Individual Petitioners, were those with the least courtwide seniority in the classifications selected for layoff, as provided in Section 7.1 of the Court\u2019s Personnel Policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The Court issued layoff notices to all of the Individual Petitioners. As required by section 10 of the ACMEA MOU, both ACMEA and the Individual Petitioners received sufficient advance notice of the layoffs. Each Individual Petitioner advised of her impending layoff was informed that, \u201c[i]f you think that the Court has incorrectly determined to layoff your position, you may within three (3) working days from receipt of this notice, submit an explanation in writing to the Assistant Executive Officer . . . .\u201d None of the Individual Petitioners made any substantive challenge to the accuracy of the Court\u2019s calculations regarding the number of years of courtwide seniority they held.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">But for any effect of the SEIU MOU\u2014which the parties to this appeal dispute\u2014Individual Petitioners Gomez, Kincaid, Martinez, Mateo, Neeley, Riley, Schengel, Taylor, and Williams would have been entitled, under the terms of the Court\u2019s Personnel Policies, to transfers or demotions to classifications in which they had previously held tenure in the SEIU bargaining unit, to the extent that those positions are currently filled by less senior employees. The aforementioned employees notified the Court that they wished to transfer or demote to classifications in the SEIU bargaining unit in which they had previously held tenure. The Court did not demote these employees as they requested, on the grounds that they had been out of the SEIU bargaining unit for more than six months, and instead laid them off. The Court maintains that these employees do not have the right to be placed on a reemployment list for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>classifications in which they previously held tenure within the SEIU bargaining unit, because, as of the date of their layoffs, they had been out of the SEIU bargaining unit for more than six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\n<em>Reclassification of the \u201cSecretary II\u201d Position</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">At the time of court consolidation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a classification consultant was retained to conduct a job audit of all Court employees who held the \u201cSecretary II\u201d classification. Based on the results of this audit, each individual who held the Secretary II position was reclassified into one of three possible classifications, depending upon the specific job duties that he or she was actually performing at the time. Those three classifications were (1) \u201cDivision Assistant,\u201d (2) \u201cDivision Secretary, Confidential,\u201d and (3) \u201cSenior Division Secretary, Confidential.\u201d All of these titles have been within the bargaining unit represented by ACMEA and have never been within the bargaining unit represented by SEIU.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">As a result of this reclassification process, Fabian\u2019s title changed from Secretary II to Division Assistant, without any material change in the job functions she was performing. Fabian continued to hold the position of Division Assistant at the time of the 2009 layoffs. In lieu of layoff, Fabian requested to demote or transfer to the classification of Division Secretary, Confidential. The Court denied the request and did not demote Fabian, stating that she had never held tenure in the Division Secretary, Confidential classification, nor had she ever performed the essential duties of that classification. Fabian was instead laid off.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\n<em>Requests for Due Process Hearings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Conner, Fabian, Gomez, Kincaid, Martinez, Mateo, Neeley, Riley, Schengel, Taylor, and Williams requested that the Court provide them due process hearings in front of a hearing officer, on the ground that they claimed they had reason to believe their impending layoffs were, in truth, disciplinary in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">The Court allowed Fisher and Gee to elect to demote in lieu of layoff. Both Fisher and Gee demoted from the classification of \u201cFiscal Services Supervisor\u201d to the classification of \u201cAccounting Technician.\u201d The classification of Accounting Technician is not in any union-represented bargaining unit. Fisher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>and Gee earn less money in their new positions than they did in the positions from which they were laid off. Fisher and Gee also requested that the Court accord them due process hearings in front of a hearing officer, on the ground that they had reason to believe their demotions were, in truth, disciplinary in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In their requests for due process hearings, none of the petitioners presented any specific facts or evidence in support of their beliefs that their layoffs or demotions were disciplinary in nature. Had such a hearing been granted, however, each Individual Petitioner was prepared to present such evidence at the due process hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The Court contends that this was a layoff based on the organizational necessity of the Court and that the actions taken against the Individual Petitioners were not disciplinary in nature. Therefore, the Court contends that the Individual Petitioners had no right to due process hearings. For this reason, the Court did not provide due process hearings to the Individual Petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\n<em>Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">On July 23, 2009, ACMEA and the Individual Petitioners filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint seeking damages and declaratory and injunctive relief (the Petition) in Alameda County Superior Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Petition alleged the Court had violated both its Personnel Policies and the Act when it denied the Individual Petitioners\u2019 requests to demote to other classifications in lieu of layoff. It also alleged the Court had violated the Individual Petitioners\u2019 due process rights under both the state and federal Constitutions by failing to provide evidentiary due process hearings before a neutral hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">The litigation was bifurcated into a merits phase and a remedial phase. With the approval of the trial judge, the parties filed cross-briefs on the merits. The trial judge issued a draft tentative decision after the merits phase of the case, and after oral argument, issued a tentative decision. On January 12, 2010, the trial judge issued a proposed statement of decision, to which ACMEA filed objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">The trial judge issued a statement of decision on February 3, 2010. He rejected all of ACMEA\u2019s objections to the statement of decision and denied all of the Individual Petitioners\u2019 claims save Conner\u2019s. Thereafter, the parties were able to work out a remedy for Conner without the trial judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>involvement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They notified the trial judge that they had settled all aspects of the remedial phase of the litigation and requested that the trial judge issue judgment. ACMEA and the Individual Petitioners reserved the right to appeal the trial judge\u2019s decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Judgment was entered on the merits phase of the case on April 12, 2010. ACMEA and the Individual Petitioners then filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\n<em>Proceedings in This Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">This appeal was argued and submitted on February 17, 2011. On March 7, 2011, we filed our initial opinion. We held the Court had violated the Act by refusing to permit nine of the Individual Petitioners to demote in lieu of layoff. We agreed with ACMEA that because the Individual Petitioners\u2019 seniority and bumping rights derived from the Personnel Policies, and the Personnel Policies predated the implementation date of the Act, the statute\u2019s transitional provisions required the Court to meet and confer with ACMEA before making any changes to the rights conferred by those policies. (See \u00a7\u00a7 71615, subd. (d), 71639, subd. (b).) We based that holding on ACMEA\u2019s uncontested contention that the Act became effective January 1, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">After we issued our opinion, the Court obtained new counsel, who filed a petition for rehearing. In the petition, the Court asserted that the Act\u2019s implementation date was in fact January 1, 2001. It therefore contended there had been no violation of sections 71615, subdivision (d) and 71639, subdivision (b), because the seniority and bumping rights at issue did not predate the implementation of the Act. The Court requested that we correct the mistake of law regarding the Act\u2019s implementation date, but it did not argue that correction of the mistake should result in affirmance of the judgment below.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AlR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>On March 28, 2011, we granted the petition for rehearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We also ordered ACMEA to file a response addressing the correctness of the Court\u2019s contentions about the Act\u2019s implementation date and whether the error identified by the Court would affect the result we had reached. ACMEA\u2019s response disputed the Court\u2019s claim regarding the Act\u2019s implementation date and argued that, even if correct, it would not change the result. The Court\u2019s reply took no position on whether its arguments regarding the Act\u2019s implementation date would dictate a different result. Since the Court has not disputed ACMEA\u2019s contentions on this point, we deem the matter submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>on ACMEA\u2019s response. (See <em>County of Butte v. Bach </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 848, 867 [218 Cal.Rptr. 613] [where respondent made no reply to appellants\u2019 argument, court deemed matter submitted on appellants\u2019 brief].)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">ACMEA challenges the decision below in several respects. First, it contends the trial judge misconstrued the Act by finding the Court did not change its Personnel Policies when it applied the SEIU MOU\u2019s definition of seniority to ACMEA members. Second, ACMEA asserts the trial judge erred in concluding that the Court did not violate its own policies when it refused to permit nine of the Individual Petitioners to demote in lieu of layoff. Third, ACMEA claims the trial judge wrongly concluded Fabian had no right to demote to the position of Division Secretary, Confidential in lieu of layoff. Finally, ACMEA argues the trial judge improperly determined that the Court\u2019s failure to grant the Individual Petitioners\u2019 request for hearings did not violate due process. We address these arguments in the order presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">I. <em>Standard of Review and Statutory Construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Our standard of appellate review is de novo. <em>(Steinhebel v. Los Angeles Times Communications, LLC </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 696, 704 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 351].) We apply this standard because \u201cthe decisive facts are undisputed, [and] we are confronted with a question of law . . . .\u201d <em>(Ghirardo v.

The matter was submitted to the trial judge on stipulated facts, and the lower court resolved purely legal questions. <em>(Sea World, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1397 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 194].)

We do not write on an entirely clean slate, however.

After outlining ACMEA\u2019s contentions, we will analyze their merits. Finally, we will consider the arguments the Court raises in defense of the trial judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">A. <em>The Statement of Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The trial judge\u2019s statement of decision acknowledged that the Court\u2019s Personnel Policies granted ACMEA members the right to demote to lower paying classifications without limiting those classifications to a specific bargaining unit. Thus, the trial judge agreed that before January 1, 2009\u2014the effective date of the SEIU MOU\u2014the Personnel Policies gave employees in ACMEA classifications the right to demote to classifications represented by SEIU, provided the ACMEA member had tenure in that classification and was bumping a less senior SEIU member.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The trial judge held that after January 1, 2009, the Court became bound by the definition of seniority in section 30.C.4 of the SEIU MOU, rather than by the demotion provisions of the Personnel Policies. The trial judge based this holding on his reading of the preface to the Court\u2019s Personnel Policies, which provides in relevant part: \u201cWhere these policies and rules conflict with provisions of a memorandum of understanding between the Court and a recognized employee organization, the MOU provisions will govern as to employees occupying positions in classifications covered by the MOU.\u201d Thus, the trial judge concluded, \u201cthe MOU\u2019s definition of seniority trumps the conflicting demotion provision in the Personnel Policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">The trial judge ruled that seniority rights arise from contract and concluded that the Act allows for the renegotiation of such rights when MOU\u2019s are renegotiated. He recognized that the SEIU MOU changed the definition of seniority in such a way that it conflicted with the Personnel Policies, but held that under the language of the preface, the Court was bound by the SEIU MOU, not its Personnel Policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">The trial judge went on to hold the Court\u2019s actions did not violate the Act. The statement of decision begins its analysis of this issue by noting that the Act does not define \u201cseniority\u201d and leaves trial courts and recognized employee organizations free to adopt their own definitions through the meet and confer process. The trial judge also pointed out that the Court had met and conferred separately with both ACMEA and SEIU before adopting their respective current MOU\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>The trial judge then found that <em>\u201c[a\\fter </em>the Personnel Policies were adopted, the SEIU changed the definition of seniority in its MOU in such a way that the definition conflicted with the definition used in the Personnel Policies.\u201d The trial judge further found that this change affected ACMEA members who were not represented by SEIU in that it \u201cabrogated\u201d their seniority with respect to SEIU classifications. While the trial judge properly recognized that an MOU \u201csets forth the terms and conditions of employment applicable to members of a specific union,\u201d he determined that section 30.C.4 of the SEIU MOU \u201cgoverned the seniority of SEIU members <em>and former members.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The trial judge held that the Court did not change its rules, policies, or practices by agreeing to the new definition of seniority in section 30.C.4 of the SEIU MOU. Instead, the trial judge found that only a contract between the Court and the SEIU had changed. Although the Personnel Policies supposedly did not change, the trial judge nevertheless went on to hold that ACMEA members had lost their right to demote\u2014a right arising from the Personnel <em>Policies\u2014because </em>o/the definition of seniority in the SEIU MOU. Thus, on the one hand, the trial judge found that the Personnel Policies did not change, while on the other, he concluded that the bumping rights ACMEA members had enjoyed under those policies had been lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">According to the trial judge, this did not violate the Act because the preface to the Personnel Policies required the Court to comply with the terms of any future MOU to the extent it was inconsistent with the Personnel Policies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, in agreeing to the SEIU MOU, the Court did not \u201creconsider\u201d any prior accrued employee rights and therefore had no duty to meet and confer with ACMEA about the new definition of seniority. (Cf. \u00a7 71615, subd. (d).) Furthermore, the trial judge found that even if the Court had \u201creconsidered\u201d a prior contractual obligation or right, the only right at issue was the new definition of seniority in the SEIU MOU. As a consequence, he concluded the Court had no obligation to meet and confer with ACMEA over changes in another union\u2019s MOU.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The trial judge did not find it significant that the Court meets and confers with both ACMEA and SEIU in formulating its Personnel Policies. He distinguished personnel policies, which are of general application, from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>terms of an MOU, which apply only to the members of a specific union, and observed that trial court personnel policies and union MOU\u2019s are subject to different provisions of the Act. Since the Act \u201ccontemplates that only <em>two </em>parties\u2014an employer and <em>a </em>union\u2014will negotiate changes in a union\u2019s MOU\u201d but \u201cmakes no reference to the number of parties . . . that should negotiate changes in an employer\u2019s personnel policies,\u201d the trial judge concluded that the Act imposed no duty on the Court to meet and confer with two different unions over changes in one union\u2019s MOU.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">B. <em>ACMEA\u2019s Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">ACMEA\u2019s statutory argument is premised on the stipulated fact that the Court\u2019s Personnel Policies would have entitled nine of the Individual Petitioners to demote to classifications in the SEIU bargaining unit in which they had held tenure. The parties agree that the only reason the nine were laid off rather than being permitted to demote was the disputed effect.of the SEIU MOU. Specifically, the Court refused to allow the nine Individual Petitioners to demote because they had been out of the SEIU bargaining unit for more than six months. It therefore applied the definition of seniority in section 30.C.4 of the SEIU MOU to members of ACMEA in determining whether they could exercise bumping rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">ACMEA contends the Court\u2019s action violated three separate sections of the Act, each of which required the Court to meet and confer with ACMEA before modifying the seniority rights at issue. First, ACMEA explains that the seniority and bumping rights at issue here arise from the Personnel Policies and the Layoff Policy, which were adopted November 15, 2001. As it did below, ACMEA argues the Act took effect on January 1, 2004, and therefore the Personnel Policies predate the implementation of the Act. ACMEA contends the Act mandates that the Court follow a specific process before modifying employee rights that arise from Court \u201cpersonnel rules, policies, and practices\u201d that antedate implementation of the Act. (\u00a7 71639, subd. (b).) ACMEA points to section 71612, which states that passage of the statute itself was not intended to \u201cbe a cause for the modification or elimination of any existing . . . terms and conditions of employment of trial court employees.\u201d ACMEA concedes that the Act does not <em>prohibit </em>the elimination or modification of such terms and conditions of employment, but contends it requires that any changes be negotiated \u201cthrough the meet and confer in good faith process.\u201d (\u00a7 71612.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Second, ACMEA notes that in the specific case of seniority rights, the Act mandates that as of the date of the Act\u2019s implementation, the employment seniority of trial court employees \u201cas calculated and used under the system in effect prior to the implementation of this [A]ct, shall be calculated and used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>in the same manner by the trial court.\u201d (\u00a7 71615, subd. (c)(2).) The legislation further directs that in establishing local personnel structures, trial courts shall give consideration to protecting the rights accrued by trial'court employees under their current systems. (\u00a7 71615, subd. (d).) Once again, the Act provides that such accrued rights \u201cmay be reconsidered subject to the obligation to meet and confer in good faith.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Third, ACMEA relies on the obligation to meet and confer in good faith codified in section 71634.2 of the Act, which requires the trial court (or its designated representatives) to \u201cmeet and confer in good faith regarding wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment within the scope of representation . . . with representatives of the recognized employee organizations . . . [and to] consider fully the presentations as are made by the recognized employee organization on behalf of its members prior to arriving at a determination of policy or course of action.\u201d (\u00a7 71634.2, subd. (a).) The Act\u2019s definition of \u201cmeet and confer in good faith\u201d imposes an obligation on both the trial court and the recognized employee organizations to exchange information, opinions, and proposals, \u201cand to endeavor to reach agreement on matters within the scope of representation.\u201d (\u00a771601, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">ACMEA asserts that since no party disputes that (1) the Individual Petitioners\u2019 seniority and bumping rights are matters within the scope of representation<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and (2) those rights arise from Personnel Policies predating implementation of the Act, the Court could not change those rights without first meeting and conferring with the Individual Petitioners\u2019 exclusive bargaining representative\u2014ACMEA. (See \u00a7\u00a7 71634.2, subd. (a), 71639, subd. (b).) In addition, ACMEA claims that the seniority rights at issue are specifically protected by section 71615, subdivision (c)(2) and thus any changes to such rights are subject to the meet and confer in good faith process. (\u00a7 71615, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">C. <em>The Definition of Seniority in the SEIU MOU Constitutes a Change in Terms and Conditions of Employment Subject to the Duty to Meet and Confer in Good Faith</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">We agree with ACMEA that the Court violated its duty to meet and confer in good faith under section 71634.2, subdivision (a), and thus the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>judge erred in holding the Court did not contravene the Act. The parties agree that the Personnel Policies affected a \u201cmatter within the scope of representation\u201d because they conferred seniority and bumping rights on ACMEA members. (\u00a7 71634, subd. (a) [defining scope of representation]; <em>Steele </em>v. <em>L. &amp; N. R. Co. </em>(1944) 323 U.S. 192, 203 [89 L.Ed. 173, 65 S.Ct. 226] [seniority rights are within scope of representation].) The parties have stipulated that, but for the SEIU MOU, the Personnel Policies would have entitled nine of the Individual Petitioners to demote to SEIU classifications in which they had previously held tenure. Indeed, the trial judge specifically found that the definition of seniority in section 30.C.4 of the SEIU MOU deprived the Individual Petitioners of these seniority rights by preventing them from demoting to SEIU classifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">By curtailing the seniority and bumping rights of ACMEA members, it is apparent that the SEIU MOU purported to effect a change in \u201cterms and conditions of employment within the scope of representation, as defined in Section 71634.\u201d (\u00a7 71634.2, subd. (a).) As a consequence, before changing those terms and conditions, the Court was required to \u201cmeet and confer in good faith . . . with representatives of the recognized employee organization!] \u2022 \u2022 - and to \u201cconsider fully the presentations as are made by the recognized employee organization on behalf of its members <em>prior to arriving at a determination of policy or course of action.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 71634.2, subd. (a), italics added.) Because ACMEA is recognized as the exclusive representative of employees affected by the changes, we hold that the Court was required to meet and confer in good faith with ACMEA prior to making this change.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (\u00a7\u00a7 71634, subd. (a), 71634.2, s\u00fcbd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">D. <em>The Court\u2019s Counterarguments Are Unpersuasive</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The Court offers a number of arguments in support of the trial judge\u2019s decision. As we explain below, we find none of these persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">1. <em>The Seniority Rights at Issue Do Not Arise from Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">In rejecting ACMEA\u2019s argument that the Court was required to meet and confer over this change, the trial judge observed that seniority rights generally arise solely from contract and that unions are free to renegotiate the seniority provisions of their collective bargaining agreements. Quoting federal authority, the trial judge explained: \u201cNegotiating seniority provisions is a duty uniquely within the province of the bargaining agent. The union is free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>renegotiate seniority provisions.\u201d <em>(Papcin v. Dichello Distributors, Inc. </em>(D.Conn. 1988) 697 F.Supp. 73, 80, affd. (2d Cir. 1988) 862 F.2d 304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">We agree that seniority rights <em>generally </em>arise from contract, and we do not question a union\u2019s right to renegotiate seniority provisions on behalf of its members. But neither of those general propositions fits the facts of this case. First, the seniority and bumping rights at issue here arose not from an MOU negotiated by ACMEA or any other union, but rather from the Court\u2019s Personnel Policies. Second, unlike the cases cited in the statement of decision, the seniority rights with which we are concerned were not renegotiated by a union on behalf of its <em>own </em>members. Instead, the Court purported to change the seniority rights of <em>ACMEA members </em>in its negotiations with <em>SEIU. </em>None of the cases upon which the trial court relied involved a situation in which an employer altered the seniority rights of members of one union through an agreement with a wholly different union.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>Social Services Union </em>v. <em>Alameda County Training &amp; Employment Bd. </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1458, 1462, 1464-1466 [255 Cal.Rptr. 746] [union\u2019s MOU with employer held to supersede public agency\u2019s personnel policies and procedures \u201c \u2018regarding employees identified in [the MOU]\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Thus, whether ACMEA, SEIU, or any other employee organization may renegotiate the contractual seniority rights of its own members is not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>issue. The issue is whether the Act permits the Court to change its Personnel Policies and alter the seniority rights of employees who are members of ACMEA by meeting and conferring only with SEIU. It is clear the Court may not do so.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">2. <em>The Preface to the Personnel Policies Does Not Require the Court to Apply the SEIU MOU to Employees Outside the SEIU Bargaining Unit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The argument that the preface to the Court\u2019s Personnel Policies required the Court to comply with the definition of seniority in the SEIU MOU rather than with the Personnel Policies misreads the language of the preface. By its plain terms, the preface provides that where the Personnel Policies \u201cconflict with provisions of a memorandum of understanding between the Court and a recognized employee organization, the MOU provisions will govern <em>as to employees occupying positions in classifications covered by the MOU.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Since it is undisputed that ACMEA members do not occupy positions in classifications covered by the SEIU MOU, the provisions of that agreement do not displace the seniority rights granted by the Personnel Policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The Court argues the protections of section 30.C.4 of the SEIU MOU cannot be fully realized unless the definition of seniority in the SEIU MOU is applied to ACMEA members seeking to bump back into their previous positions in classifications represented by SEIU. The Court also contends that the SEIU MOU\u2019s definition of seniority applies only to SEIU positions, and it is therefore an issue that can be negotiated only with SEIU, which is the exclusive bargaining representative for employees in those classifications.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But by arguing that the protections afforded by section 30.C.4 of the SEIU MOU cannot be realized unless they are applied to former SEIU members who are now represented by ACMEA, the Court is essentially asking us to disregard the preface and impose the provisions of the SEIU MOU on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>employees who do not \u201coccupy[] positions in classifications covered by the MOU.\u201d The Court does not explain why we should disregard this plain language and expand the reach of the SEIU MOU to members of a completely separate bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">We therefore hold that the preface to the Personnel Policies does not permit the Court to apply the terms of the SEIU MOU to ACMEA\u2019s members. Our holding necessarily means that the Court violated its own policies when it denied the nine Individual Petitioners the right to bump back into their former SEIU classifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">3. <em>The Requirements of the Act Prevail over the Preface to the Personnel Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Even if we were to accept the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of the preface to the Personnel Policies, it could not affect the result we reach, because the Court may not absolve itself of duties imposed by the Act by adopting a policy that conflicts with the statute. (See <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers </em>v. <em>City of Gridley </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 191, 202 [193 Cal.Rptr. 518, 666 P.2d 960] [scope of local government\u2019s rulemaking power in public sector labor relations is limited by the policies and purposes of the MMBA]; cf. <em>Sierra Craft, Inc. v. Magnum Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1255 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 681] [\u201clocal [court] rules and policies may implement but may not be inconsistent with statutory requirements\u201d].) Construing the preface to permit the Court to apply provisions of the SEIU MOU to employees occupying positions in classifications not covered by that MOU would contravene the policies of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">First, the Act gives trial court employees \u201cthe right to form, join, and participate in the activities of employee organizations of their own choosing for the purpose of representation on all matters of employer-employee relations.\u201d (\u00a7 71631.) Recognized employee organizations have \u201cthe right to represent their members in their employment relations with trial courts as to matters covered by this article.\u201d (\u00a7 71633.) The Act requires trial court employers to meet and confer in good faith with representatives of recognized employee organizations to fully consider the presentations made by the recognized employee organization on behalf of its members. (\u00a7\u00a771601, subd. (e), 71634.2, subd. (a).) The Act is therefore intended to provide \u201c \u2018strong protection for the right of employees to be represented by unions of their own choosing.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Service Employees Internal. Union v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1394 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 505].)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Applying the SEIU MOU\u2019s definition of seniority to ACMEA members would violate both the statutory right of ACMEA members to be represented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>by their chosen union and the statutory right of ACMEA to represent its members in their relations with the Court. (\u00a7\u00a7 71631, 71633.) Moreover, since the Court has recognized ACMEA as the exclusive representative for employees in specified classifications, <em>only </em>ACMEA has the right to represent those employees on matters within the scope of representation. (Zerger et al., Cal. Public Sector Labor Relations (2010) Employee Organization Rights, \u00a7 30.05[1], p. 30-27 (rel. 17-6/2006) [\u201cif an employee organization is recognized or certified as the exclusive representative for a unit of employees, only that organization has a right to represent employees\u201d]; see <em>San Bernardino Public Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Fontana </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1220 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 634] [MMBA \u201crequires public agencies to negotiate exclusively with the collective bargaining units\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Second, applying terms in the SEIU MOU to employees outside of the SEIU bargaining unit would make the SEIU MOU binding on employees and employee organizations who are not parties to it. But the Act expressly makes such agreements \u201cbinding <em>upon the </em>parties.\u201d (\u00a7 71639.5, subd. (a), italics added.) We find nothing in the statute that would make an MOU binding upon employees holding positions in classifications not covered by the MOU. (See <em>Valencia v. County of Sonoma </em>(2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 644, 652 [69 Cal.Rptr.3d 881] [\u201cThe MOU establishes certain terms of employment applicable to the members of the Union, but these terms are effective <em>only for the covered employees </em>. . . .\u201d (italics added)]; cf. <em>Fire Fighters Union v. City of Vallejo </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 608, 618 [116 Cal.Rptr. 507, 526 P.2d 971] [noting that union\u2019s proposal on vacancies and promotions would not apply to deputy fire chief if he were found to be outside of bargaining unit].)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Consequently, even if the trial judge were correct in his interpretation of the preface to the Personnel Policies, the language of the preface could not override the obligations imposed by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">III. <em>The Question of Fabian\u2019s Entitlement to Demotion Must Be </em>Remanded<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>IV. <em>The Individual Petitioners Were Not Entitled to Due Process Hearings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The trial judge entered judgment in favor of the Court on ACMEA\u2019s causes of action alleging violations of the Individual Petitioners\u2019 due process rights. In his statement of decision, the trial judge assumed that even if a prelayoff proceeding of some kind was constitutionally required, the Individual Petitioners received all the process that was due to them. The trial judge found that ACMEA had forfeited any claim that the Court did not provide adequate postlayoff hearings by failing to support the claim with \u201ctimely, pertinent authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">ACMEA challenges both rulings. We affirm the trial judge as to both of these claims, although we apply a somewhat different analysis to the claim regarding prelayoff hearings. (E.g., <em>Little v. Los Angeles County Assessment Appeals Bds. </em>(2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 915, 925, fn. 6 [66 Cal.Rptr.3d 401] [the trial court\u2019s judgment denying the petition for writ of mandate must be affirmed if it \u201cis correct in result\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">A. <em>No Prelayoff or Predemotion Hearings Were Required Because the Layoffs Were the Result of Budgetary Constraints</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">ACMEA challenges the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the Court afforded the Individual Petitioners sufficient due process prior to their layoffs and demotions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Court contends the Individual Petitioners received adequate due process because extensive prelayoff hearings are not required in cases of \u201ceconomic layoff.\u201d It further argues that such hearings would infringe on management prerogatives outside of the scope of representation. We hold that prelayoff hearings were not required because it is undisputed that the layoffs were imposed for budgetary reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">The Court relies on <em>Duncan v. Department of Personnel Administration </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1166 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 257] (Duncan) for the proposition that prelayoff hearings are not required when the layoff is due to budgetary constraints. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1183.) Duncan was a public employee who was selected for layoff after the agency for which he worked implemented a reduction in force for budgetary reasons. <em>(Duncan, </em>at pp. 1170-1172.) He demoted in lieu of layoff, but nevertheless sued the state claiming it had violated his right to due process by failing to provide a prelayoff hearing. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1172-1173.)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>To detennine whether Duncan was entitled to a prelayoff hearing, the court analyzed three factors: (1) the private interest to be affected by the official action, (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest through the procedures used, and (3) the government\u2019s interest.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>(Duncan, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1179, 1180-1183.) The court ultimately concluded Duncan had no right to a prelayoff hearing. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1183.) It first found Duncan\u2019s private interest in his employment to be of lesser importance because he had been demoted, not laid off, and that in any event, layoffs do not carry the stigma associated with termination for cause. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1180-1181.) The court then held that because the state had used objective criteria such as financial information and seniority in implementing the layoff, the risk of an erroneous prehearing decision was reduced. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1182.) Finally, the court concluded that \u201cin a time of financial crisis, the State has a significant interest in taking quick steps to resolve its economic woes.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) Duncan </em>explained that in cases of budgetary layoffs, the rule is that individual prelayoff hearings are not necess\u00e1ry given the impracticality and expense of holding them. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1183; see also <em>California Sch. Employees Assn. v. Pasadena Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 318, 322 [139 Cal.Rptr. 633] <em>(Pasadena Unified) </em>[due process does not require individual hearings where layoff results from employer\u2019s financial condition].)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\"><em>Duncan </em>noted that an exception to this rule \u201cmay exist where the layoff is pretextual.\u201d <em>(Duncan, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 1183, fn. 12, citing <em>Franks v. Magnolia Hospital </em>(N.D.Miss. 1995) 888 F.Supp. 1310, 1315-1316 <em>(Franks)) Franks </em>cited several cases that had \u201crecognized the existence of a \u2018reorganization exception\u2019 to the general rule that a property interest in continued employment gives rise to a right to a due process hearing upon termination.\u201d <em>(Franks, </em>at pp. 1315-1316.) This exception applies in cases in which the layoffs are the result of cost-cutting measures. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1315.) <em>Franks </em>acknowledged that a few cases dealing with the so-called reorganization exception \u201crecognize that the exception can be avoided by a showing that the reduction in force was merely a pretext for a personal agenda to terminate [the] employee.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court went on to explain, however, that the exception for pretextual layoffs is limited: \u201c[T]hose cases all involve situations in which either one position or very few positions were eliminated, and all of the terminated employees were the focus of a pretextual elimination. In a case such as the one presently before this court, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>aggrieved employee is but one of many affected by a large-scale reduction in force, the reorganization exception would still apply.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1315-1316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Applying the analysis of <em>Duncan </em>and <em>Franks </em>to the stipulated facts, we conclude that the Individual Petitioners had no right to prelayoff or predemotion hearings. First, while the Individual Petitioners who were laid off doubtless have a significant private interest in retaining employment, that interest carries less weight here because, unlike a termination for cause, a layoff carries no stigma that would impair a laid-off employee\u2019s future job prospects. <em>(Duncan, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 1181.) Fisher\u2019s and Gee\u2019s interests are \u201cof little importance\u201d because they remain employed, \u201calbeit in a lower paying position\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1180), so theirs is not a case \u201cwhere \u2018a fired worker [must] find employment elsewhere ....\u2019\u201d (Ibid., quoting <em>Cleveland Board of Education </em>v. <em>Loudermill </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 532, 543 [84 L.Ed.2d 494, 105 S.Ct. 1487].)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Second, there is no dispute that the Court suffered a significant budgetary reduction for the 2009-2010 year. The Court therefore laid off 72 employees. In its brief, ACMEA admits that \u201cthe budget cut . . . led [the Court] to institute layoffs . . . .\u201d The parties also stipulated that the individuals laid off from ACMEA positions were those with the least courtwide seniority in the classifications selected for layoff and that this accorded with the Court\u2019s Personnel Policies. In addition, none of the Individual Petitioners challenged the accuracy of the Court\u2019s seniority calculations. ACMEA thus admits that the Court\u2019s budgetary problems are genuine and that the layoffs were undertaken for fiscal reasons. (See <em>Perkowski v. Stratford Bd. of Education </em>(D.Conn. 2006) 455 F.Supp.2d 91, 96 [laid-off employee failed to raise genuine issue of material fact where she admitted that employer\u2019s fiscal crisis was genuine and employer eliminated her position in attempt to resolve crisis].) It has also stipulated that the individuals selected for layoff were those with the least seniority. \u201cBy using objective criteria, such as financial information and seniority, the [Court] reduce[d] the risk of an erroneous prehearing decision.\u201d <em>(Duncan, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 1182.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Third, given that 72 employees were laid off, we are not faced with a case \u201cin which either one position or very few positions were eliminated, and all of the terminated employees were the focus of a pretextual elimination.\u201d <em>(Franks, supra, </em>888 F.Supp. at pp. 1315-1316.) Instead, the Individual Petitioners are among the several dozen employees laid off as a result of the Court\u2019s reduction in budget. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1316.) In such cases, prelayoff hearings are not required. (See <em>Pasadena Unified, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.3d at p. 322.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>On appeal, ACMEA seeks to reframe its argument regarding the allegedly pretextual nature of the layoffs.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We reject this argument because we can find no evidence that it was raised below. Moreover, even assuming hearings into such issues would not impermissibly intrude upon the Court\u2019s management prerogatives, the Individual Petitioners would have to plead and prove that they were \u201c \u2018not \u201cexpendable\u201d at the time\u2019 \u201d of their layoffs or demotions. <em>(Perkowski v.

(e); see \u00a7 71637.1 [authorizing trial courts to adopt reasonable rules providing for the designation of management and confidential employees].) Therefore, pursuant to section 71639.5, subdivision (c) and California Rules of Court, rule 10.660(c)(2), the matter was assigned for hearing to the Honorable Robert M. Mallano, Presiding Justice of Division One of the Second Appellate District. (Cal.

We recognize that the Court obtained new counsel after we filed our initial opinion, but that does not excuse the failure to raise this argument in a timely fashion. (See <em>Reichardt v. Hoffman </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 754, 765-766 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 770] [retention of new counsel no excuse for seeking to raise new issue in reply brief].) ACMEA contended below and in its briefs in this court that the Act became effective on January 1, 2004. Indeed, the Court\u2019s petition for rehearing characterizes this contention as \u201ccritical to the arguments [ACMEA] made to this Court.\u201d But the Court did not dispute this allegedly critical contention \u201cin the trial court, [or] in this court at any time prior to filing [its] petition for rehearing.\u201d <em>(Exarhos </em>v. <em>Exarhos </em>(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 898, 907 [72 Cal.Rptr.3d 409].) Even granting that, in the press of trial litigation, counsel failed to recognize the issue below, appellate counsel is generally expected to perform \u201cadditional research that trial counsel simply will not have had the time to do.\" <em>(In re Marriage of Shaban </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 398, 409 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 863].) As this appellate district explained over 50 years ago, \u201c[c]ounsel\u2019s duty to assist the court includes a duty to study and to discuss the available authorities . . . .\u201d <em>(Tate v. Can\u00f3nica </em>(1960) 180 Cal.App.2d 898, 900 [5 Cal.Rptr. 28].)

Had the Court\u2019s counsel raised the issue of the Act\u2019s implementation date either below or in its respondent\u2019s brief, rehearing could have been avoided. Counsel\u2019s failure has unnecessarily increased this court\u2019s workload and delayed resolution of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\"> Generally, \u201c[i]t is much too late to raise an issue for the first time in a petition for rehearing.\u201d <em>(Midland Pacific Building Corp. v. King </em>(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 264, 276 [68 Cal.Rptr.3d 499].) Counsel must ensure that all points are properly presented in the original briefs and argument before the matter is submitted <em>(Boydston v. Napa Sanitation Dist. </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1362, 1370 [272 Cal.Rptr. 458]), for once the case is submitted, we assume that counsel \u201chave presented all the reasons upon which they rely for an affirmance or a reversal of the judgment.\u201d <em>(San Francisco v. Pacific Bank </em>(1891) 89 Cal. 23, 25.) Our general refusal to consider arguments first presented on rehearing serves both judicial economy and fairness. It prevents counsel from arguing cases \u201cin a piecemeal fashion.\u201d <em>(Smith v. CrocketFirst Nat. Bank </em>(1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 832, 837 [314 P.2d 237].) And it protects the opposing party from having to defend against new theories that were not previously put in issue or raised at trial. <em>(Hittle v. Santa Barbara County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 374, 391, fn. 10 [216 Cal.Rptr. 733, 703 P.2d 73].) Thus, arguments first raised on rehearing are usually forfeited. (E.g., <em>Reynolds v. Bement </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 1075, 1092 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 483, 116 P.3d 1162].) Forfeiture might seem particularly appropriate here, because the argument raised in the petition for rehearing was available from the very inception of the litigation, and it comes to us \u201cunaccompanied by an explanation for the delay\" in bringing it to our attention. <em>(Singh </em>v. <em>Lipworth </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 40, 43, fn. 2 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 178].) Ordinarily, we would decline to consider the issue, and the Court would suffer the consequences of counsel\u2019s forfeiture. (See <em>County of Sacramento v. Loeb </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 446, 459, fn. 5 [206 Cal.Rptr. 626] [refusing to consider argument that claims at issue were precluded by controlling statutes, where statutory argument was first raised on rehearing].)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">When good cause exists, however, we may exercise our discretion to address issues first raised on rehearing. (See <em>Mounts </em>v. <em>Uyeda </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 111, 120-121 [277 Cal.Rptr. 730] [considering constitutionality of statute where statute\u2019s validity was called into question by federal decision issued after this court\u2019s original opinion].) We may grant rehearing \u201cfor the purpose of correcting any error which [we] may have made in [our] opinion\u201d where correction would likely produce either a different result or different reasoning. <em>(San Francisco v.

This case involves a statute that has not been widely construed. We therefore granted the Court\u2019s petition to correct a mistake of law that might otherwise have led to confusion in later cases interpreting the Act. (See <em>In re Jessup </em>(1889) 81 Cal. 408, 471 [22 P. 742] [rehearing may be granted to correct \u201cmistake of law\u201d in court\u2019s opinion].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b249-9\"> The trial judge reached this conclusion despite noting more than once that ACMEA was not a party to the SEIU MOU.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"ASy\"> The trial judge\u2019s rationale seems to have been that the preface to the Personnel Policies had always permitted the Court and a union to agree to provisions in an MOU that were inconsistent with the Personnel Policies. Since the preface permitted this procedure, the trial judge presumably reasoned that the Court had not \u201cchanged\u201d its Personnel Policies when it agreed to a definition of seniority that admittedly conflicted with those policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\"> The trial judge found that seniority rights fall within the scope of representation, and this finding is not contested on appeal.

California courts generally defer to PERB\u2019s interpretation of statutes defining the scope of representation. (See <em>San Mateo City School Dist. v.

The relevance of these arguments is unclear, since it is undisputed that nine of the Individual Petitioners would lose their demotion rights if the SEIU MOU\u2019s definition of seniority is applied to them. To the extent these contentions can be construed as an argument that any violation of the Court\u2019s statutory duty to meet and confer in good faith was merely de minimis, we reject them.
