The jury convicted him of attempted premeditated murder, assault with a deadly weapon, criminal threats, rape, rape with a foreign object, and fraudulently conveying an access card. Cordell contends that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it could consider whether he had an actual and reasonable, but mistaken, belief that the victim consented to the sexual acts. He also contends that there is insufficient evidence that he \u201cconveyed\u201d an access card within the meaning of Penal Code section 484e, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, he contends that the trial court should have stricken the one-year sentence for his prior prison term rather than staying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-13\">We conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct on the defense of mistake of fact because Cordell\u2019s defense was actual consent, not a mistaken belief that the victim consented to the sexual acts, and because there was no substantial evidence of equivocal behavior on the victim\u2019s part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1567\">*1567</page-number>that would warrant the instruction. However, we agree with Cordell that there is insufficient evidence that he \u201cconveyed\u201d an access card within the meaning of the statute under which he was charged, and that the court should have struck the one-year sentence for his prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-7\">A. <em>Factual background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-8\">1. <em>The prosecution\u2019s evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-9\">The victim was the primary witness for the prosecution. She testified that she lived in a house next door to a restaurant that her family owned. She worked at the restaurant with other members of her family. The victim met Cordell in June 2007 at a neighborhood bar, and they began dating. The victim invited Cordell to move in with her because he was staying in a motel at the time and she wanted to help him out. Cordell moved in on April 9, 2008. Shortly thereafter, Cordell told the victim that he had prostate cancer and that he did not want her to see him suffer, so he planned to move out on June 1, 2008. The victim thought that it was a good idea for Cordell to move out because she did not want to see him in pain. Cordell also told the victim that the medication he was taking \u201cwas messing up his head and making him do bad things.\u201d He told her that he did not want to undergo any more treatments for his cancer, and that without treatment he had only three to six months to live. At that time, Cordell was consuming a lot of alcohol during the day, every day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-10\">On May 30, 2008, two days before Cordell planned to move out, the victim awoke at around noon and had breakfast. Cordell was already drinking. He told the victim that he had an appointment at the \u201cVA Hospital\u201d at around 3:00 p.m., and said that the doctors wanted to talk to her. At around 2:00 p.m., Cordell told the victim that he wanted to have sex with her\u2014what he referred to as \u201ca quicky\u201d\u2014one last time. The victim did not really want to have sex, but agreed \u201cto make him feel better because he\u2019s going to the V.A.\u201d They proceeded to have consensual vaginal and anal intercourse on the couch.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1568\">*1568</page-number>Cordell used the victim\u2019s pi\u00f1a colada flavored lubricant during these sex acts. Afterward, they got dressed and the victim had something to eat.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">Cordell then told the victim that he had a surprise for her. He told her that he wanted to blindfold her. She refused, but agreed to close her eyes. While standing behind the victim, Cordell told her to open a dresser drawer. She opened the drawer and felt around, but the drawer was empty. She opened another drawer, but it, too, was empty. Cordell then told her to turn around and, according to the victim, \u201cthat\u2019s when the hammer started coming.\u201d She saw a glimpse of a hammer in Cordell\u2019s raised hand. The hammer was what the victim described as an \u201cengineer\u2019s hammer,\u201d with two heads that looked the same, instead of a head and claw. Cordell struck the victim in the back of her head and on her arm as she tried to shield herself. When she tried to run, Cordell grabbed her by her hair and threw her down on the hardwood floor. She tried to get up, but Cordell told her that he would kill her if she moved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">While the victim was lying facedown on the floor, Cordell hit her a few more times with the hammer. She was in pain, bleeding from her head and arm, and in shock. Cordell removed all of her clothing and started rubbing her body. He wanted her to say things that she did not want to say and to tell him that what he was doing to her felt good. The victim complied because \u201cI had to. He made me.\u201d He then inserted a vibrator into her vagina and her anus. He also rubbed the vibrator against her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">After Cordell rubbed the victim with the vibrator, he inserted his penis into her vagina. The victim initially testified that she did not know whether he also put his penis in her anus, but then remembered telling a police officer that Cordell had put his penis in her anus. In addition, the victim initially could not remember whether Cordell had also put his fingers in her vagina and anus, but then remembered having told an officer that he had. The victim testified that Cordell had not put his mouth on any part of her body, or that she could not remember whether he had done so. She then corrected herself and said that Cordell had orally copulated her vagina and anus. She also stated that she could not remember whether he had raped her vaginally more than once, and stated \u201cDefinitely once. Maybe twice.\u201d She reiterated that more than a year had passed since the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-7\">During the assault, the victim\u2019s mother, who had walked over to the victim\u2019s house from the restaurant, called to the victim through the side <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1569\">*1569</page-number>window of the house to tell her that she was needed at work. The victim felt that she could not yell or scream at the time, so she called back, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m coming.\u201d She was too frightened to call for help because she did not know what Cordell would do if she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">Cordell used the victim\u2019s clothing to wipe blood off of her body. He tried to make her wipe the blood off of her arm, but she could not do it because the pain was too intense. The victim heard Cordell take two photographs of her with a cell phone while she was lying facedown in her own blood. Cordell then put the cell phone, her bloody clothing, and the hammer in a white plastic bag. He told her to give him 15 minutes so that he could get away. He also told her that he had bought a gun, and said that the cops had better bring the SWAT team. He said that he would kill them before he killed himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">After the victim heard Cordell drive away, she got up slowly, put on clean clothes, and stumbled to the family restaurant next door. Her mother and father saw her stumble to the restaurant, saturated in blood, with her arm \u201ctwisted up.\u201d The victim told her parents that Cordell had tried to kill her with a hammer, and that he had raped and sexually assaulted her. The victim\u2019s sister called 911. In the meantime, a customer at the restaurant who had emergency medical technician (EMT) training began assisting the victim. The victim told the customer that she thought she was going to die. The entire assault lasted from 2:30 p.m. until 6:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\">At the hospital, the victim was treated for injuries to her head, neck and arm. The victim received approximately 65 stitches and had to undergo two surgeries on her arm. Her neck was fractured. She was placed in a neck brace, and her right arm was placed in a cast. A registered nurse conducted a sexual assault response team (SART) examination in the emergency room. The nurse did not see any bruising during the vaginal and rectal exams, except some bruising on the \u201cperihymenal tissue vestibule.\u201d The nurse was not surprised by the lack of trauma to the victim\u2019s genital area because Cordell had used lubrication during the assaults. Also, the nurse explained, there tended to be fewer injuries when a sexual assault is committed by a prior sexual partner because the sex partners are familiar with each other\u2019s anatomy and how they move. There would also be less injury if the victim had been incapacitated or was not struggling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">The morning after the attack, a neighbor saw Cordell kneeling near an access panel to a crawl space underneath the victim\u2019s house. The neighbor called 911 when he saw Cordell crawl under the house. Officers responded, and the SWAT team was summoned. Cordell engaged in a 12-hour standoff with officers, and told them that he would kill their \u201cwarriors.\u201d Cordell eventually gave up and voluntarily came out of the house to be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1570\">*1570</page-number>An investigator found Cordell\u2019s cell phone in the attic of the victim\u2019s house. The phone was broken into two pieces. The investigator also found a backpack stuffed under the floor of the house. Inside the backpack was another cell phone, bolt cutters, a brown jacket, an empty bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s, and a receipt dated May 30, 2008, from a liquor store. An FBI computer forensic examiner recovered photographs from the broken phone, including photos of a naked woman, lying facedown on the floor with her legs spread.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">During the investigation, the victim discovered several unauthorized debits on her bank account. Charges had been made to her account at Nick\u2019s At The Beach and Chriscola\u2019s Liquor Store on May 30, 2008. There was a second charge at the liquor store and a charge at Albertson\u2019s on May 31, 2008. The victim did not make these purchases and had not given Cordell permission to use her ATM card. The victim recognized Cordell\u2019s signature on receipts dated May 31, 2008, that bore her name, from Albertson\u2019s and from Hammer &amp; Nails Hardware, which is located about a block away from the victim\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">A surveillance tape showed Cordell purchasing two bottles of Coke and a bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s from Chriscola\u2019s at 6:06 p.m. on May 30, 2008. A manager of Hammer &amp; Nails Hardware testified that he had known the victim for about 18 years, and said that he had seen Cordell and the victim in the store together on a few occasions. On May 31, 2008, Cordell used a credit card to purchase bolt cutters and a padlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">As a result of the attack, the victim had to wear a neck brace for three to four weeks. Her right arm was in a cast for a couple of months. She was hospitalized for four days, and recovered at her parents\u2019 home for approximately one month. She was unable to return to work for five and a half months. At the time of the trial, she could not make a fist with her right hand, or rotate her right arm. She testified that she would occasionally become lightheaded and dizzy when she would lie down or get up.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">2. <em>Prior bad act evidence</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">In 1999, Laura K. met Cordell when he came into her hair salon for a haircut. He asked her out, but she declined and told him that she was gay. Cordell and Laura subsequently became friends, and Laura eventually trusted Cordell enough to give him the keys to her shop and her home. He told her that he had pancreatic cancer and that he did not have long to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1571\">*1571</page-number>One night, Laura awoke to find Cordell attempting to insert his penis into her from behind. She \u201cfreaked out\u201d and told him that they would no longer be friends if he did that again. Cordell apologized profusely, promised that it would never happen again, and sent her flowers the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">Laura began dating a woman named Angela W. Laura, Angela, and Cordell became friends and spent time together. In 2000, Laura and Angela went to Cordell\u2019s apartment for a Christmas celebration. Laura and Angela drank champagne while Cordell drank Jack Daniel\u2019s and Coke. The three of them exchanged gifts. Cordell said that he was upset because he had been waiting for a call from the Mayo Clinic about his pancreas transplant, but he had not received a call. They discussed that Cordell would be leaving soon to go to the East Coast for treatments. Laura was sad that Cordell might be dying.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">Cordell offered to give Laura a backrub and laid a blanket on the floor. While on the blanket, Cordell gave Laura a backrub and then said that he had more presents for Laura and Angela in his backpack, which was in his truck. Cordell sent Angela for the presents. After Angela left the apartment, Cordell dead-bolted the door and turned up the volume of the stereo. Laura, who was lying on the floor on her stomach, felt something very hard hit the back of her head. She looked over her shoulder and saw Cordell holding a wooden club over his head, wielding it like an ax. She scrambled to escape, but Cordell continued to strike her in the head repeatedly while she screamed and attempted to shield the blows with her arms. The two struggled over the club, and Cordell eventually let go, but told her to \u201cStop screaming or I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">Laura was able to escape when Cordell went to get a knife. She thought she was going to bleed to death from the injuries to her head. She required 60 stitches on her head, and her finger was broken. Laura testified that Cordell looked \u201cthrilled\u201d while he was attacking her and that \u201che looked like he was going to enjoy killing me.\u201d As a result of the beating by Cordell, Laura\u2019s head is dented, and she has scars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-8\">3. <em>The defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-9\">Cordell testified on his own behalf. He moved in with the victim in August 2007, but went to prison for a parole violation three weeks later. When he was paroled in April 2008, he moved back in with the victim. At first, they were very happy and had a loving relationship. But then he began drinking heavily. It really bothered the victim when Cordell would drink during the day. He also started to have medical problems. According to Cordell, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was receiving injections and radiation treatments. He was also running low on money. The victim asked him to</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>move out of the house. One day, he went out for a walk, and when he came back to the house, he found all of his possessions near the front door. He tried to talk with the victim about it, and told her that she was his \u201ctrue love.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">On May 30, 2008, Cordell and the victim were hanging around the house before she was scheduled to work between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. He told the victim that he had an appointment at 3:00 p.m. that day, but this was not true. They had vaginal and anal intercourse at approximately 2:00 p.m. They took a break, and the victim had some tea or water, while Cordell drank alcohol. They had sex a second time at around 4:00 p.m. They started in the kitchen, then went to the sofa, and then had sex on a rug on the hardwood floor. They had vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Cordell used a vibrator during their encounter. He took a cell phone photo of the victim while she was lying naked on the floor with her legs spread. Cordell said that he took this photograph for his personal viewing pleasure, and to use as his cell phone wallpaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">After they had sex for the second time and he had taken the cell phone photo, Cordell and the victim began arguing about his impending move out of the house. The argument took place about 5:00 or 5:15 p.m. Cordell became angry because he loved the victim and did not want to move out. He also did not think that she was capable of handling his health situation. About 5:30 p.m., he \u201cjust lost it\u201d and \u201csnapped.\u201d Unable to control his temper, he grabbed a hammer that he had been using for home repairs and hit the victim four times before he realized what he was doing. She tried to run, but he either pushed her to the floor, or she fell. He then struck her one or two more times with the hammer. He was unaware of how seriously he had injured her because her hair was thick, and her arm did not look very swollen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">After Cordell hit the victim with the hammer, he panicked. He knew that he was in \u201cbig trouble\u201d because he had been to prison before. He took the hammer, the cell phones, and the victim\u2019s credit card, and drove to Chriscola\u2019s to buy more alcohol because he was very upset. When he left, the victim was just sitting there, looking at him. He threw the hammer into a dumpster. Cordell made four purchases with the victim\u2019s credit card without her permission, as he had done before. He had always paid her back when he had used her credit card in the past. He then went to the beach and just \u201csat there.\u201d Later, he went back to the liquor store and purchased more alcohol. He denied having told the victim that he had a surprise for her, and said that he never told her to close her eyes and open any drawers. According to Cordell, none of the sexual activities were performed against the victim\u2019s will, and he did not intend to kill her. Cordell denied that he sexually assaulted the victim at any time after he hit her with the hammer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-7\">Cordell slept in his car that night, and went back to the house the following day to get his things. He did not have his keys to the house, so he stopped at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1573\">*1573</page-number>the hardware store and bought bolt cutters. He used the bolt cutters to access the crawl space under the victim\u2019s house, so that he could enter undetected. Once inside, he just sat and drank Jack Daniel\u2019s and was \u201covercome by [the victim\u2019s] scent\u201d which he could detect because she had lived in the house for so long. After the police arrived, he tried to talk with them, but they shot him in the hand with a rubber bullet. Cordell said that after police shot him with the rubber bullet, he went to the attic to seek protection, because he was afraid. After a while, he just gave up and turned himself in. He lied to one of the officers when he said that he did not know that the victim was hurt. He also told the officer that he thought the blood on the floor of the house was from the victim\u2019s menstrual period. While in jail, Cordell wrote a letter to the victim in which he falsely stated that he had blacked out from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. on the day of the hammer attack. He said that he did not remember threatening to kill any of the officers during the standoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">Cordell admitted that he pled guilty in 2001 to assault with a deadly weapon in relation to the incident involving Laura. He also admitted that he told Laura he had pancreatic cancer, and that this was not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">B. <em>Procedural background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">Cordell was charged with attempted premeditated murder (\u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189, 664; count 1); assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1); count 2); making a criminal threat (\u00a7 422; count 3); rape (\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2); counts 4 &amp; 5); forcible sodomy (\u00a7 286, subd. (c)(2); count 6); rape with a foreign object (\u00a7 289, subd. (a)(1); counts 7 through 10); forcible oral copulation (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c)(2); counts 11 &amp; 12); and sale/transfer of an access card (\u00a7 484e, subd. (a); count 13). Great bodily injury enhancements were alleged as to all of the offenses except the criminal threat and access card .offenses. (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (e), 12022.8.) Each sex offense carried an allegation of use of a deadly weapon. (\u00a7 12022.3, subd. (a).) Great bodily injury and personal use of a deadly weapon allegations were alleged to aggravate the sex offenses within the meaning of the one strike law. (\u00a7 667.61, subds. (b), (c) &amp; (e).) Cordell\u2019s 2001 conviction for assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)) was alleged as a serious felony, a strike, and as a prior prison term (\u00a7\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b), 667, subds. (a)(1), (b)-(i), 668, 1170.12).</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">A jury trial was held between August 27 and September 15, 2009. The jury convicted Cordell of attempted premeditated murder, assault with a deadly weapon, criminal threats, one count of rape, one count of rape with a foreign object, and the access card offense (counts 1 through 4, 7 &amp; 13 respectively). With respect to the attempted murder count, the jury found true the allegation that Cordell personally inflicted great bodily injury. As to the assault with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number>deadly weapon count, the jury found that Cordell personally used a deadly weapon and that he inflicted great bodily injury. With respect to the rape and rape with a foreign object counts, the jury found that Cordell personally used a deadly weapon, but did not find that he inflicted great bodily injury. The jury was deadlocked on the remaining counts and allegations. The court declared a mistrial on the deadlocked counts and allegations, and dismissed them at the prosecution\u2019s request. Cordell admitted the truth of his prior strike conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">On October 15, 2009, the trial court sentenced Cordell to prison for an indeterminate term of life, plus a consecutive indeterminate term of 60 years to life, plus a determinate term of 32 years four months, calculated as follows: life with the possibility of parole for attempted premeditated murder, plus five years for the great bodily injury enhancement, plus five years for the serious felony prior; two consecutive 30-year-to-life sentences (two 15-year terms, doubled for the strike prior) for forcible rape with a foreign object under the one strike law, with each count enhanced by five years for the serious felony prior; six years for the criminal threat (the upper term, doubled); and a consecutive term of one year four months for the access card violation (one-third the middle term, doubled), plus five years for the serious felony prior conviction. The court stayed the sentence on the conviction for assault with a deadly weapon and its related enhancements, under section 654.

Specifically, Cordell maintains that the term \u201cconveys\u201d as used in the statute refers to the transfer of ownership, possession, custody or control of an access card to another, and not to the temporary transfer of possession of an access card to a merchant for the purpose of purchasing goods or services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">1. <em>Governing law and standard of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">a. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">In evaluating a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>{Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 99 S.Ct. 2781].) \u201c[T]he court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-8\">b. <em>Statutory construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-9\">\u201cIn construing any statute, \u2018 [w] ell-established rules of statutory construction require us to ascertain the intent of the enacting legislative body so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018We first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.

Finally, we keep in mind that \u201c \u2018[t]he defendant is entitled to the benefit of every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number>reasonable doubt, whether it arise out of a question of fact, or as to the true interpretation of words or the construction of language used in a statute.\u2019 \u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Palmore </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1295 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 784].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">In discerning the Legislative intent in enacting a statute, courts may rely on the doctrine that a specific statute precludes prosecution under a general statute. <em>(People v. Butler </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1224, 1242-1243 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 150].) Under this doctrine, \u201c[t]he fact that the Legislature has enacted a specific statute covering much the same ground as a more general law is a powerful indication that the Legislature intended the specific provision alone to apply. Indeed, in most instances, an overlap of provisions is determinative of the issue of legislative intent and \u2018requires us to give effect to the special provision alone in the face of the dual applicability of the general provision . . . and the special provision . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 494, 505-506 [170 Cal.Rptr. 1, 620 P.2d 587]; see <em>Butler, </em>at p. 1243.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">2. <em>Additional procedural background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">Cordell was charged in count 13 with \u201cSELLS/TRANSFERS ACCESS CARD.\u201d Specifically, count 13 alleges that Cordell \u201cdid unlawfully, with intent to defraud, sell, transfer and convey an access card without the cardholder\u2019s and issuer\u2019s consent,\u201d in violation of section 484e, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">As to this count, the trial court instructed the jury solely on the theory that Cordell \u201cconveyed\u201d an access card. The relevant portion of the jury instruction provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-8\">\u201cThe defendant is charged in Count Thirteen with conveying an access card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-9\">\u201cTo prove that the defendant is guilty of this crime, the People must prove that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-10\">\u201c1.

HQ</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-8\">\u201cIt is not necessary that anyone actually be defrauded or actually suffer a-financial, legal, or property loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d (CALCRIM No. 1950, original italics.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">3. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-10\">The word \u201cconvey\u201d is not explained in the definitional portion of the access card fraud statute (\u00a7 484d), the related statutes involving access card fraud, or in the relevant standard jury instructions, and we are aware of no case that has directly addressed the meaning of this word as used in section 484e, subdivision (a). Relying in part on Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Cordell posits that collectively, the words \u201csells, transfers or conveys\u201d refer to the transfer of ownership, possession, custody or control of an access card to another, and not to the temporary, momentary or fleeting possession afforded a merchant for the purposes of transacting a purchase of goods or services. Respondent counters by proposing three different dictionary definitions of the word \u201cconvey,\u201d and contends that each time Cordell presented the victim\u2019s credit card without her consent, \u201che had to give, or convey, the card and its account numbers, to the sales people inside the stores in order to complete his transactions.\u201d Finally, respondent states that the plain and common meaning of the word \u201cconvey\u201d in the instruction \u201cwas understood by all to mean to use or provide.\u201d Respondent maintains that the verdict itself establishes that the jurors had no trouble understanding that Cordell necessarily conveyed the victim\u2019s access card.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-11\">We conclude that the evidence is insufficient to support Cordell\u2019s conviction for fraudulently conveying an access card. It is clear from the statutory scheme governing crimes involving access cards that the Legislature differentiated between crimes that involve the fraudulent selling, transferring or conveying of an access card, and those that involve the fraudulent \u201cuse\u201d of an access card, when it made these acts punishable under different provisions of the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1578\">*1578</page-number>A comparison of the two most relevant statutes\u2014the statute under which Cordell was charged\u2014section 484e, and related section 484g\u2014reveals that the Legislature has distinguished between crimes that involve the fraudulent acquisition, retention or transfer of an access card and crimes that involve the fraudulent <em>use </em>of an access card to obtain cash or to make purchases. Section 484e, pertains to crimes in which a person \u201cacquires\u201d (\u00a7 484e, subds. (b)-(d)), \u201cretains\u201d (\u00a7 484e, subds. (c) &amp; (d)), \u201csells, transfers, or conveys\u201d (\u00a7 484e, subd. (a)) an access card. Section 484g, on the other hand, pertains to crimes in which a person fraudulently \u201cuses\u201d an access card to obtain money, goods, or services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">Support for our reading of the statute can be found by examining section 484g. That section provides in relevant part: \u201cEvery person who, with the intent to defraud, (a) <em>uses, </em>for the purpose of obtaining money, goods, services, or anything else of value, an access card . . . that has been altered, obtained, or retained in violation of Section 484e or 484f[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] ... or (b) obtains money, goods, services or anything else of value by representing without the consent of the cardholder that he or she is the holder of an access card and the card has not in fact been issued, is guilty of theft.\u201d (\u00a7 484g, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">It is apparent from the enactment of section 484g that the Legislature has separately proscribed the fraudulent \u201cuse\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of access cards, and that' it distinguished the fraudulent \u201cuse\u201d of an access card from fraudulently selling, transferring or conveying one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-6\">Cordell was charged with violating section 484e, subdivision (a). The jury was instructed that in order to convict him of this offense, it had to find that he \u201cconveyed\u201d the victim\u2019s access card. However, the evidence presented with respect to count 13 was that Cordell used the card to purchase goods without the victim\u2019s permission on four separate occasions. Indeed, the prosecutor\u2019s argument to the jury\u2014in which the prosecutor misstated the specific charge, the jury instruction, and section 484e, subdivision (a), was: \u201cThe last count is unauthorized <em>use of an ATM Card. </em>Here, I have to show that the defendant <em>used </em>an ATM card. He did so without the consent of [the victim].\u201d \u201c[Cordell] was out and about partying it up <em>using </em>[the victim\u2019s] ATM card going to Chriscola\u2019s Liquor, hanging out at the beach.\u201d (Italics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1579\">*1579</page-number>added.) The prosecutor neither produced evidence, nor argued to the jury, that Cordell \u201cconveyed\u201d the victim\u2019s access card when he handed it to store clerks to make purchases, nor did the prosecutor in any way explain what the word \u201cconvey\u201d meant in the context of his closing argument. Further illustrating the error, the trial court stated at the sentencing hearing that it was sentencing Cordell for <em>\u2018\u2018\u2019\u2019using </em>[the victim\u2019s] credit to go buy alcohol.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">We conclude that the word \u201cconveys\u201d as used in section 484e, subdivision (a) does not pertain to the conduct at issue in this case, i.e., the defendant\u2019s use of an access card to purchase goods without the cardholder\u2019s permission. To uphold Cordell\u2019s conviction on count 13 would require that we insert the words \u201cor uses\u201d into section 484e, subdivision (a), so that it would read \u201c[e]very person who, with the intent to defraud, sells, transfers, . . . conveys, <em>[or </em>uses] an access card, without the cardholder\u2019s . . . consent, is guilty of grand theft.\u201d We are precluded from intruding into the Legislature\u2019s domain in such a manner. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Massicot </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 920, 925 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 705] [the judiciary\u2019s role is to \u201csimply ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained in the statute, not to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been included.\u201d].) Further, because the Legislature has clearly proscribed the fraudulent <em>use </em>of an access card in a different, specific statutory provision, prosecution of Cordell under section 484e, subdivision (a) was improper. <em>(People v. Jenkins, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at pp. 505-506.) Based on a plain reading of the relevant statutory provisions, there is no evidence to support Cordell\u2019s conviction under section 484e, subdivision (a). We therefore reverse the conviction on count 13 and vacate the corresponding sentence. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Leon </em>(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 149, 161, 171 [73 Cal.Rptr.3d 786].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">C. <em>Other corrections to the abstract of judgment.* </em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-9\">The conviction on count 13 is reversed and the corresponding sentence is vacated.
