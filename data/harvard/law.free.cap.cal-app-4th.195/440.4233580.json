(Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6251 et seq., 31450 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">The Public Records Act generally requires public agencies to disclose public records, subject to exemptions. (See <em>International Federation of Professional &amp; Technical Engineers, Local 21, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 319, 328-329 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 693, 165 P.3d 488] <em>(International Federation),) </em>Part of the Retirement Law provides: \u201cSworn statements and individual records of members shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to anyone except insofar as may be necessary for the administration of this chapter or upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or upon written authorization by the member.\u201d (\u00a7 31532.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">After much public outcry about government pensions, The Sacramento Bee and the First Amendment Coalition (collectively, the Bee) filed a petition for writ of mandate to compel the Sacramento County Employees\u2019 Retirement System (SCERS) to reveal the pension benefits of named retirees. The trial court concluded the amounts of pension benefits were not part of the \u201cindividual records of members\u201d (\u00a7 31532) and ordered SCERS to disclose the requested information.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>SCERS promptly petitioned this court for a writ of mandate to overturn the disclosure order. (See \u00a7 6259, subd. (c).) We stayed that order, and issued an order to show cause. For the reasons detailed below, we shall deny the writ petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The California Supreme Court has held that the public has a general right to know the names and salaries of public officials and employees under the Public Records Act. (See <em>International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at pp. 328-340.) The Attorney General, in an opinion cited with approval by the California Supreme Court, has reached a similar conclusion regarding the Retirement Law, finding that the phrase \u201cindividual records of members\u201d protected by section 31532 does <em>not </em>embrace the pension amounts of named county retirees. <em>(County Payroll Records as Public Records\u2014Confidentiality of Documents of Hearing on Claimed Disability, </em>60 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 110 (1977) <em>(County Payroll Records); </em>see <em>International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 331; <em>Commission on Peace Officer Standards &amp; Training </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 278, 296 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 661, 165 P.3d 462] <em>(POST).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In this case, we first reject SCERS\u2019s claim that a prior suit collaterally estops the Bee from relitigating the scope of section 31532. As we will explain, the law has materially changed since that litigation concluded, and in any event the public interest exception to collateral estoppel applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Next, addressing the merits, because exemptions from the general rule of disclosure are construed narrowly, we conclude that pension amounts are not part of the \u201cindividual records of members\u201d protected by section 31532. Based on the legislative history of section 31532 and analogous retirement board statutes, we construe that phrase narrowly to mean data filed with SCERS <em>by </em>a member or on a member\u2019s behalf, not broadly to encompass all data held by SCERS that <em>pertains to </em>a member. We also conclude that SCERS has not shown the privacy interest served by nondisclosure \u201cclearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.\u201d (\u00a7 6255, subd. (a).) Nor, for reasons we shall explain, is there cause to remand to the trial court for a hearing on whether each individual\u2019s pension benefits should be kept confidential, as suggested by some amici curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Therefore, SCERS must disclose names and corresponding pension benefit amounts of its members. This does <em>not </em>include the members\u2019 home or e-mail addresses, telephone numbers or Social Security numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Much of the briefing by SCERS and its allied amici curiae argues disclosure is bad policy that will expose its members\u2014many of whom are elderly\u2014to unwelcome attention, obloquy, and financial predation. \u201cHowever, this court does not legislate. [SCERS\u2019s] remedy properly lies \u2018on the other side of Tenth Street, in the halls of the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Williams v. California Physicians\u2019 Service </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 722, 731 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 497].)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Because the trial court properly ordered disclosure of the requested records, we deny SCERS\u2019s writ petition in this court, and vacate the stay we previously issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">On April 15, 2010, the Bee filed a petition for writ of mandate under the Public Records Act. (See \u00a7 6258.) The Bee contended that on May 6, 2009, it asked SCERS for a list of retirees who received over $100,000 annually, seeking the name of each retiree, the gross amount received, the department from which he or she retired, the last position held, and the date of retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Ten days later, SCERS advised the Bee that it had prepared a list of 221 \u201cretiree amounts\u201d exceeding $8,333 per month \u201calong with the information regarding employing Departments.\u201d The list did not include the names, dates of retirement or last employed position of those retirees. SCERS stated it was withholding the latter information under the authority of section 31532. (See \u00a7 6253, subd. (c) [agency normally has 10 days to respond to request].)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">In the ensuing months, the Bee made further requests, expanded to include all SCERS members, not just those receiving more than $100,000 per year. Although SCERS provided additional details, including the years of service, dates of retirement and some departmental information about its retirees, SCERS refused to provide the \u201cnames or personal identifiers\u201d of members.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">The Bee submitted declarations from journalists describing rising public interest in public pensions. According to the declarations, the names of members are sought in order to investigate issues such as cashing out of vacation time or working overtime in the last year of employment, either of which can result in so-called \u201cpension spiking,\u201d instances of \u201cdouble dipping,\u201d where a person receives a pension and salary, instances of \u201ctriple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>dipping,\u201d where a person receives a pension, salary and unemployment benefits in one year, and other controversial pension practices. The trial court overruled SCERS\u2019s objections to these declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The Bee submitted copies of other trial court decisions mandating disclosure of such information,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and documents showing that some county retirement boards provide such information. The trial court overruled SCERS\u2019s objections to this material, but found it lacked evidentiary or precedential value.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The Bee also provided copies of a prior Sacramento County Superior Court decision, <em>McClatchy Co. v. County of Sacramento </em>(Super. Ct. Sac. Co., 2005, No. 04CS01398) (the <em>McClatchy </em>case). SCERS did not object to judicial notice of the <em>McClatchy </em>case, and sought judicial notice of a memorandum the County of Sacramento had filed in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">In opposition to the Bee\u2019s request for names, SCERS asserted \u201cthe names or personal identifiers\u201d of members were confidential, \u201cconstitutionally protected, private financial information.\u201d SCERS also asserted the Bee was collaterally estopped from arguing that member names should be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">SCERS\u2019s chief executive officer declared that SCERS \u201cmaintains individual records for members, including such personal information as compensation, years of service, age, amount of retirement allowance, addresses, telephone numbers, social security numbers, marital status, and information pertaining to beneficiaries, including spouses and children.\u201d SCERS always interpreted section 31532 as requiring it to keep this information confidential. About 70 percent of the money that pays county pensions comes from investment returns, 20 percent comes from public employer contributions and 10 percent comes from member contributions. The average SCERS retiree is over 68, and SCERS provides retirees information on elder abuse. The trial court overruled the Bee\u2019s evidentiary objections to this evidence, but stated it disregarded legal conclusions and argument contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>At oral argument in the trial court, SCERS conceded public pensions were backed by public money, in the event investment returns declined. In a supplemental declaration filed over the Bee\u2019s objection, SCERS attached a Public Records Act request from an individual seeking the names of deceased members with a lump sum due of at least $20,000, and the names of their beneficiaries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The trial court granted the Bee\u2019s writ petition, and ordered SCERS to disclose the records requested by the Bee in a letter dated February 11, 2010, namely, \u201cthe pension benefits retirees received from SCERS in calendar year 2009,\u201d including the name of each recipient, the date of retirement, the department retired from, last position held, years of service, base allowance, cost of living adjustment, total health allowance and monthly benefit. We will refer to this information collectively as the \u201cindividual pension.\u201d SCERS promptly filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court and sought a stay, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">We previously granted SCERS\u2019s motion for judicial notice of legislative materials. We now grant the Bee\u2019s motion and SCERS\u2019s supplemental motion for judicial notice of further legislative materials. But, as we have cautioned before, taking judicial notice of legislative materials does not mean they will be helpful in resolving a given interpretive question. <em>(Kaufman &amp; Broad. Communities, Inc. v. Performance Plastering, Inc. </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 26, 29-30 [34 Cal.Rptr.3d 520] <em>{Kaufman).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">We deny the motion by amicus curiae California Newspaper Publishers Association and allied media for judicial notice of newspaper articles about public pensions, and the Bee\u2019s two motions for judicial notice of similar material, as well as purported budget information. The Bee\u2019s motions were procedurally improper, because they were buried in footnotes in responses to amicus curiae briefs. (See <em>Chinn v. KMR Property Management </em>(2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 175, 180, fn. 3 [82 Cal.Rptr.3d 586]; <em>Canal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tackett </em>(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 239, 243 [11 Cal.Rptr.3d 626].) Further, the materials contained in all three of these motions were not before the trial court, and are cumulative to material in the record. Finally, SCERS does not deny that there is now great public interest in public employee pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Because SCERS\u2019s collateral estoppel claim\u2014if successful\u2014would obviate the need to reach the merits, we address that claim first. In part I, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>conclude two settled exceptions to collateral estoppel apply. First, the applicable law has materially changed; second, this case raises an issue of public interest regarding the statutory duties of a public agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In part II, after outlining the Public Records Act generally, we reach the merits and consider and reject SCERS\u2019s contention that section 31523 provides an explicit statutory exemption from disclosure of individual pensions. Based on the history of section 31532 and analogous statutes, we construe section 31532 narrowly to protect data filed with SCERS <em>by </em>a member or on a member\u2019s behalf, not broadly to encompass all data held by SCERS that <em>pertains to </em>a member. We also conclude that SCERS has not shown the privacy interest served by nondisclosure \u201cclearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.\u201d (\u00a7 6255, subd. (a).) Finally, we explain why individual county retirees are not entitled to notice and a hearing before their individual pensions are disclosed, as suggested by amici curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\n<em>Collateral Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">In the <em>McClatchy </em>case, The McClatchy Company, doing business as The Sacramento Bee, sued the County of Sacramento (County) under the Public Records Act, seeking disclosure of retiree pension information. The County had access to the information \u201cby virtue of the County\u2019s role as the payroll agent for SCERS\u201d and SCERS, although not a party, had represented to the court that it would \u201ccollaborate with the County\u201d to provide the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">At that time (2005), two published cases had found that public employees had a right of privacy in their salary information. <em>(Teamsters Local 856 v. Priceless, LLC </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1500, 1511-1523 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 847] (Priceless) [upholding preliminary injunction barring release of information]; <em>City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 883, 890-892 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 915] <em>(Los Angeles) </em>[peace officer salary part of protected personnel file].) Relying largely on those two cases and section 31532, the trial court ordered the County to disclose some pension information, but not individual pensions. No appellate review of the disclosure order was sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">SCERS now contends the Bee is collaterally estopped from litigating the scope of section 31532. Collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of issues decided in a prior lawsuit if several requirements are met, including that the party against whom preclusion is sought is \u201cthe same as, or in privity with, the party to the former proceeding.\u201d <em>(Lucido v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 335, 341 [272 Cal.Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223].) The Bee contends collateral estoppel should not be applied because the First Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Coalition, a party herein, was not a party in the <em>McClatchy </em>case, and therefore privity is absent. The Bee also contends there has been a material change in the law since the <em>McClatchy </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Some amici curiae generally allied with SCERS ask us to reach the merits, to avoid further county-by-county litigation. SCERS, too, states in its petition in this court that \u201cthe varying interpretations by Superior Courts support the importance of the Court of Appeal taking this case and deciding the issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">We need not address the question of privity, nor whether SCERS\u2019s inconsistent positions result in a forfeiture of the estoppel claim. The trial court correctly overruled the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">First, collateral estoppel will not be applied where there has been a material change in the law. (See <em>United States Golf Assn. v. Arroyo Software Corp. </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 607, 615-617 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 708].) In the <em>McClatchy </em>case, the trial court was bound to follow then extant precedent, namely, <em>Priceless, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th 1500 and <em>Los Angeles, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.4th 883. However, our Supreme Court later concluded the salaries of public employees were <em>not </em>confidential, declined to follow <em>Priceless, </em>and disapproved of <em>Los Angeles. (International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at pp. 335-336, 345.) This shows a sufficient material change in the law to preclude collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Second, as we have said before, collateral estoppel will not be applied \u201cto foreclose the relitigation of an issue of law covering a public agency\u2019s ongoing obligation to administer a statute enacted for the public benefit and affecting members of the public not before the court.\u201d <em>(California Optometric Assn. </em>v. <em>Lackner </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 500, 505 [131 Cal.Rptr. 744]; see <em>People v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. </em>(2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1244-1245 [47 Cal.Rptr.3d 92].)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Whether or not section 31532 bars disclosure of individual pensions is a matter of public interest. Further, applying collateral estoppel ultimately would be futile, because if we concluded the Bee were estopped, any newspaper or even any private citizen could request the same information tomorrow and litigate SCERS\u2019s refusal to disclose it. (Accord, <em>Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1336 [283 Cal.Rptr. 893, 813 P.2d 240] <em>(Times </em>Mirror) [\u201cjudicial economy and the significance of the questions presented militate in favor of a decision sooner rather than later\u201d].) Moreover, the amici curiae, representing another county retirement board, several associations of county retirees (including SCERS retirees), media, and public interest groups, have great interest in the decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">Accordingly, because the law has materially changed since the <em>McClatchy </em>case was decided, and because this lawsuit tenders an issue of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>importance regarding a county retirement board\u2019s duties under the Public Records Act and the Retirement Law, we conclude that collateral estoppel should not be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\n<em>Public Records Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The Public Records Act was adopted in 1968, replacing \u201ca hodgepodge of statutes and court decisions relating to disclosure of public records.\u201d <em>(Times Mirror, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1338; see Stats. 1968, ch. 1473, \u00a7 39, pp. 2945-2948.) The Legislature, \u201cmindful of the right of individuals to privacy,\u201d declared that \u201caccess to information concerning the conduct of the people\u2019s business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.\u201d (\u00a7 6250.) Most records may be inspected during regular office hours, and copies may be obtained upon payment of costs. (\u00a7 6253, subds. (a), (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The Public Records Act has exemptions for some records. Creating a general right of access subject to exemptions places the burden on an agency to show that a particular public record is exempt from disclosure. (See <em>International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 329; <em>County of Santa Clara v. Superior Court </em>(2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1319-1321 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 374].) We must construe statutory exemptions from disclosure narrowly. <em>(Dixon </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1271, 1275-1276 [88 Cal.Rptr.3d 847] <em>(Dixon); California State University, Fresno Assn., Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 810, 831 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 870] <em>(Fresno).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">In an early case construing the Public Records Act, Associate Justice Leonard M. Friedman, writing for this court, made the following pertinent observation: \u201cGovernment files hold massive collections which are roughly divisible into public business and private revelations. Statutory and decisional law on public record disclosure reveals two fundamental if somewhat competing societal concerns\u2014prevention of secrecy in government and protection of individual privacy. \u2018The people\u2019s right to know\u2019 is a rubric which often accompanies disclosure claims. The \u2018right to know\u2019 demands public exposure of recorded official action. A narrower but important interest is the privacy of individuals whose personal affairs are recorded in government files. Societal concern for privacy focuses on minimum exposure of personal information collected for governmental purposes. The California courts have equated the right of privacy with the right \u2018to be let alone,\u2019 which must be balanced against public interest in the dissemination of information demanded by democratic processes.\u201d <em>(Black Panther Party v. Kehoe </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 645, 651-652 [117 Cal.Rptr. 106] <em>(Black Panther).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Justice Friedman also pointed out: \u201cAlthough personal information which private persons supply to government may not itself reveal official action, it may have sharp relevance to inquiries into official conduct.\u201d <em>(Black Panther, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d at p. 652.) \u201cThe objectives of the Public Records Act thus include preservation of islands of privacy upon the broad seas of enforced disclosure.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 653.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">At the November 2, 2004 General Election, the People adopted Proposition 59, a legislative constitutional amendment that \u201censhrined\u201d the right of access to public records in the California Constitution. <em>(POST, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 288; <em>International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 329; see Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 3, subd. (b).) Although Proposition 59 continued the presumptive right of access to public records and the rule that exemptions should be \u201cnarrowly construed,\u201d by its own terms it does not \u201caffect[] the construction of any statute\u201d protecting the right to privacy provided by article I, section 1 of the California Constitution, and \u201cdoes not repeal or nullify, expressly or by implication\u201d any existing \u201cconstitutional or statutory exception to the right of access to public records.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 3, subd. (b)(1), (2), (3) &amp; (5).)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">SCERS concedes the individual pensions are public records. We agree. (See \u00a7 6252, subd. (e) [\u201cany writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public\u2019s business\u201d].) SCERS therefore bears the burden to show that an exemption from the general rule of disclosure applies. <em>(International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 329.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">In part IIA. and B., we consider SCERS\u2019s candidate exemptions in turn, applying the following standard of review: \u201cFactual findings made by the trial court will be upheld if based on substantial evidence. But the interpretation of the Public Records Act, and its application to undisputed facts, present questions of law that are subject to de novo appellate review.\u201d <em>(BRV, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 742, 750 [49 Cal.Rptr.3d 519].) In part IIC., we reject the contention that each member is entitled to notice and a hearing before the member\u2019s individual pension information may be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">A. <em>Scope of Section 31532 Exemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">The Public Records Act provides that various records need not be disclosed, including \u201cRecords, the disclosure of which is exempted or prohibited pursuant to federal or state law.\u201d (\u00a7 6254, subd. (k).) SCERS correctly contends this incorporates the confidentiality rule provided by section 31532, but the parties dispute the scope of that confidentiality rule. The trial court did not provide an interpretation of section 31532, but ruled that the requested individual pension information did not fall within the protected \u201cindividual records of members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Although SCERS argues the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of section 31532 controls, we cannot tell from the statute itself what is or is not meant by \u201cindividual records of members.\u201d SCERS asserts that the Public Records Act \u201ccross-references\u201d section 31532. This is true, but irrelevant. The Public Records Act lists many confidentiality statutes alphabetically by topic, including section 31532, under the heading \u201cCounty Employees\u2019 Retirement, confidential statements and records.\u201d (\u00a7 6276.12.) The list was created to \u201cassist members of the public and state and local agencies in identifying exemptions,\u201d and the Legislature cautioned that one must \u201creview the applicable statute to determine the extent to which the statute, in light of the circumstances surrounding the request, exempts public records from disclosure.\u201d (\u00a7 6275.) Therefore, the listing of section 31532 in the Public Records Act does not speak to the <em>scope </em>of section 31532.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">SCERS contends, in essence, that the phrase \u201cindividual records of members\u201d refers to all information <em>about </em>a member that is held <em>by </em>SCERS. The Bee contends, in essence, that the same phrase refers to information <em>provided by </em>a member, or by inference on the member\u2019s behalf, <em>to </em>SCERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">We have said that a \u201cparty demonstrates ambiguity by tendering an alternative candidate of meaning, that is, a grammatically plausible reading of the language at issue.\u201d <em>(Niles Freeman Equipment v. Joseph </em>(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 765, 780 [74 Cal.Rptr.3d 690] <em>(Niles Freeman).) </em>Both meanings tendered by the parties are plausible. This is because the phrase \u201cindividual records of members\u201d in the abstract does not tell us what is and what is not within the \u201cindividual record\u201d of a member in the context of a public pension system. (See <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 786, 795 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 545] [\u201cA claim of ambiguity cannot always be decided from the face of the statute. It may be latent.\u201d].) The phrase could mean all records pertaining to or about an individual, or all records provided by or on behalf of an individual. Therefore, an ambiguity exists, authorizing us to consider extrinsic materials, such as the legislative history of section 31532 and analogous statutes. (See <em>Niles Freeman, supra, </em>161 Cal.App.4th at pp. 780-781.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Before embarking on what may otherwise seem an unnecessarily intricate exegesis, we explain why we interweave related statutes and Attorney General opinions into our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">In our order to show cause, we directed the parties to address the <em>timing </em>of a 1957 amendment to section 31532, after a 1956 Attorney General opinion construing a similar statute. We were mindful of two interpretive rules. First, \u201cWhen construing a statute, we may presume that the Legislature acts with knowledge of the opinions of the Attorney General which affect the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>matter of proposed legislation.\u201d <em>(Burden v. Snowden </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 556, 564 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 531, 828 P.2d 672].) Second, \u201cWhile not binding on us, the opinions of the Attorney General are entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>(Orange County Employees Assn., Inc. v. County of Orange </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 575, 578 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 695].)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In their responses, as well as at oral argument, the parties discussed apparently conflicting Attorney General opinions issued in 1955, 1956 and 1977. Both sides claim the benefit of longevity of legislative acquiescence and deference to Attorney General interpretations. SCERS claims individual pensions have been confidential since 1957, and denigrates the 1955 and 1977 opinions; the Bee claims they have been subject to disclosure since at least 1977, if not 1955, and purports to harmonize the 1956 Attorney General opinion with the other two.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">We are not normally required to parse Attorney General opinions finely, but in this case we shall do so. We find nothing in the extant record that shows the timing of the 1957 amendment to section 31532 was in any way related to the 1956 Attorney General opinion. For reasons detailed <em>post, </em>we conclude the 1956 opinion used overly broad language to define the confidentiality of pension records, which appears to have motivated a legislative change to an analogous statute <em>in 1985. </em>The 1955 and 1977 Attorney General opinions, recently cited with approval by our Supreme Court, properly state a narrower scope of confidentiality which we ultimately adopt in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">We begin at the beginning. From the adoption of the Retirement Law in 1937 to today, county retirement boards have been required to adopt regulations that include a provision \u201cFor the filing of a sworn statement\u201d by each member, \u201cshowing date of birth, nature and duration of employment with the county, compensation received, and such other information as is required by the board.\u201d (\u00a7 31526, subd. (b); see Stats. 1937, ch. 677, \u00a7 43.5, p. 1901.) This continued a similar provision in an even earlier retirement law. (See Stats. 1919, ch. 373, \u00a7 4, p. 784.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">As enacted in 1949, former section 31532 provided: \u201cSworn statements of members shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to anyone except insofar as may be necessary for the administration of this chapter.\u201d (Stats. 1949, ch. 1228, \u00a7 11, p. 2161.) It is not clear what precipitated this statute. We have examined Governor Warren\u2019s enrolled bill file and find no revealing information. But the provision clearly referenced the sworn statements required to be filed <em>by </em>the member.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>A similar provision pertaining to the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (CalSTRS) had been adopted in 1937. CalSTRS members, too, were required to provide information to their retirement board, subject to the following; \u201cSuch data as may be filed by any member or beneficiary with the retirement board shall be considered confidential, and no individual records shall be divulged by any official or employee who has access to them. . . .\u201d (Former School Code, \u00a7 5.843, added by Stats. 1937, ch. 626, \u00a7 4, pp. 1717, 1727-1728.) Similar language was employed when the Education Code was adopted. (Ed. Code, former \u00a7 14426, added by Stats. 1943, ch. 71, p. 601; see <em>State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, </em>20 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 76 (1952) [concluding that addresses filed by members were confidential].)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">It seems clear the term \u201cindividual records\u201d in the CalSTRS statute meant data filed <em>by </em>a member or beneficiary. In 1957, Education Code former section 14426 was amended to read; \u201cData filed by any member or beneficiary with the Retirement Board is confidential. No official or employee who has access to the individual records shall divulge any information concerning such records to any person\u201d with exceptions, and the information was to be used \u201cfor the sole purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this chapter.\u201d (Stats. 1957, ch. 2118, \u00a7 4, p. 3752.) Similar language continues in existence today. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 22306, as amended by Stats. 2007, ch. 323, \u00a74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In 1953, a similar confidentiality provision covering what is now known as CalPERS (California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System) was enacted, as follows: \u201cData filed by any member or beneficiary with the board is confidential, and no individual record shall be divulged by any official or employee having access to it to any person other than the member to whom the information relates or his authorized representative, the contracting agency by which he is employed, any state department or agency, or the University. Such information shall be used by the board for the sole purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this part.\u201d (Former \u00a7 20134, added by Stats. 1953, ch. 1186, \u00a7 6, p. 2686.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The CalPERS statute was later renumbered as section 20230. (Stats. 1995, ch. 379, \u00a7 2, pp. 1955, 1989, renumbered by Stats. 1995.) It seems clear that \u201cindividual record\u201d in the CalPERS statute meant data filed <em>by </em>a member or beneficiary, as with the analogous CalSTRS and Retirement Act statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">In 1955, the Attorney General issued an opinion, drafted by Deputy Attorney General Leonard M. Friedman, later an Associate Justice of this court, concluding that names and pensions of retired state employees were open to public inspection. <em>(State Employees\u2019 Retirement Act, </em>25 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 90 (1955).) This opinion predated .the Public Records Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>and was based on former section 1227, which provided, \u201cThe public records and other matters in the office of any officer, except as otherwise provided, are at all times during office hours open to inspection of any citizen of the State.\u201d (Stats. 1951, ch. 655, \u00a7 23, p. 1851.) The Attorney General reasoned as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u201cExamples of the information guarded by section 20134 are addresses of members and beneficiaries, statements as to age and disability, names of relatives and dependents, retirement option elections and similar matters. Utilizing such guarded information, the Retirement System calculates the monthly payment due each beneficiary. It then makes up and certifies to the Controller a monthly claim, supported by a roll which bears the names of individual payees and the amounts of individual payments (see Board of Control Rules 622-624, 656). The roll is used by the Controller as the basis for drawing individual warrants in favor of the individual payees. This roll is not \u2018data filed by any member of beneficiary,\u2019 nor is it an \u2018individual record.\u2019 Rather, it is a composite document which is the written act or record of the act of a public officer [citation]. <em>Thus the roll is outside the limited class of records guarded by section 20134 and within the larger category of public records. In our view, therefore, the names and amounts shown on the roll are open to public inspection. Consequently, the identical information shown in the Controller\u2019s warrant records is also open to inspection by citizens of the State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u201cWe have reached this conclusion by simple deduction from the express provisions of section 20134. Thus there is no real occasion to explore the legislative intent. We may observe, however, that our conclusion does not negate the Legislature\u2019s apparent objective. If section 20134 prevents disclosure of certain information in the office of [CalPERS], but leaves the gate ajar at the Controller\u2019s office, it would be self-frustrating. Granting that the statute intends to safeguard certain personal information, nevertheless it is a fact that the name of every public officer and employee, as well as the amount of his salary, is a matter of public record. <em>Thus the state-paid income of a retired person is no less open to the public gaze than the income of any active state officer or employee.\u201d {State Employees\u2019 Retirement Act, supra, </em>25 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. at p. 91, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The quoted portion of the 1955 Attorney General opinion concludes the records were not confidential whether held by the Controller or by CalPERS. The first paragraph states \u201cthe roll is outside the limited class of records guarded by section 20134\u201d and the \u201cidentical information shown in the Controller\u2019s warrant records is also open to inspection,\u201d and the second paragraph points out that making information confidential in one place, but accessible in another, would be pointless. <em>(State Employees\u2019 Retirement Act, supra, </em>25 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. at p. 91.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The next year, the Attorney General, in an opinion construing section 20134, drafted by a different deputy, stated broadly that \u201cInformation filed by members of the system <em>and information pertaining to individual members of the system </em>is confidential and may not be divulged.\u201d <em>(State Employees\u2019 Retirement </em>System, 27 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 267 (1956), italics added.) CalPERS had asked whether specified information was or was not confidential, including individual monthly contributions of members, accumulated contributions of members, and the \u201camount and detail of calculation\u201d of the service or disability retirement allowance, and \u201cbasic or special death benefit payable to a beneficiary of a member,\u201d and records regarding \u201cphysical or mental disability\u201d of a member. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 267-268.) The Attorney General concluded that this information \u201cpertain[s] to individual members and [is] kept as part of the individual records of members. Such information is confidential and is not to be given out.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In part, the Attorney General\u2019s 1956 opinion stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u201cSection 20134 does two things, it makes confidential the data filed by a member and then goes on to forbid disclosure of individual records to unauthorized persons. A suggestion has been made that that portion of the section which forbids disclosure of individual records has reference only to data filed by the member, and does not cover information that comes to the system from other sources. Any such view should mean that the name, address, date of birth of the member, and the name of his beneficiary would be kept from public inspection, but that <em>the amount of his contributions and any reports as to his physical and mental condition </em>would be available for inspection by anyone who desired to do so. It would seem that the latter class of information even more than the first should enjoy the protection of the statute. If anything is to be kept from public scrutiny it would seem to be the reports concerning the member\u2019s mental and physical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u201cAside from practical considerations the wording of the section would indicate that all information pertaining to the individual and not simply that which is given by him is to be protected. Section 20134 does not absolutely prohibit the release of information; it provides that the information shall not be divulged to anyone other than the member, his authorized representative, or his employer. Information which is otherwise confidential may then be given to the member. What information is this? It seems hardly necessary to authorize the release to the member of information as to his age, address or \u2022beneficiary; the system obtained this from the member himself. What the member would be seeking would be the information coming from other persons. The information which is not to be divulged except to authorized persons does then include the material which is obtained from sources other than the member.\u201d <em>(State Employees\u2019 Retirement System, supra, </em>27 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. at pp. 268-269, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The opinion later notes that \u201c[t]he information protected by Government Code section 20134 is data that must eventually come before the board either in connection with a request for retirement, withdrawal of contributions or payment of a death benefit.\u201d <em>{State Employees\u2019 Retirement System, supra, </em>27 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. at p. 269.) This opinion does not perceive a conflict with the 1955 opinion, and, as the two portions quoted above indicate, was motivated to ensure that in addition to information filed <em>by </em>members, information <em>about </em>members filed by others on their behalf, such as contribution amounts and medical reports, would be protected. However, it was phrased broadly to state that \u201call information <em>pertaining to </em>the individual\u201d was confidential. <em>{State Employees\u2019 Retirement System, supra, </em>27 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. at pp. 268-269, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In 1957, section 31532 was amended to read substantially as it does today, with the changes in italics; \u201cSworn statements <em>and individual records </em>of members shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to anyone except insofar as may be necessary for the administration of this chapter <em>or upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d </em>(Stats. 1957, ch. 1386, \u00a7 2, p. 2719, italics added.) We do not perceive the need to address the latter change regarding court orders, although the parties have. We confine ourselves to the former change, adding the words \u201cand individual records\u201d to the statute. (\u00a7 31532.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">What fragmentary legislative materials exist fail to reveal the motivation for this change. A Legislative Counsel report and the Legislative Digest summarize the amendment, but do not explain the reason for it. (See Legis. Counsel, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 3015 (1957 Reg. Sess.) pp. 1-2; Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 3015 (1957 Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 546.) There is no reference to either of the earlier Attorney General opinions regarding former section 20134. If there were a relationship\u2014other than temporal\u2014between the 1956 opinion and the 1957 amendment, the available records do not demonstrate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">SCERS points to a document in Governor Knight\u2019s enrolled bill file, drafted by the same deputy who authored the 1956 Attorney General opinion. That document states <em>in full: </em>\u201cWe have examined the above bill and find no substantial legal objection thereto.\u201d (Off. of Atty. Gen., Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 3015 (1957 Reg. Sess.) prepared for Governor Knight (June 6, 1957) p. 1.) Although we are compelled to accept that an enrolled bill report prepared by the executive branch may shed light on the <em>Legislature\u2019s </em>intent (see <em>Kaufman, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at pp. 40-42 [disagreeing with rule, but bound by precedent]), this tepid statement of nonopposition does not tie the 1957 amendment to the 1956 Attorney General opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>In fact, there were \u201ca number of widely dispersed but related code sections dealing with the meetings and records of various specific State agencies which were enacted in 1957 and subsequent sessions.\u201d <em>(.Records of the State Board of Pilot Commissioners, </em>53 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 136, 140 (1970); see, e.g., Stats. 1957, chs. 2170-2233, pp. 3848-3872 [addressing records of 50 different agencies].) As stated earlier, in 1957 the Legislature also amended the CalSTRS provision, Education Code former section 14426, referring to \u201cindividual records\u201d in a context meaning data filed <em>by </em>members. (Stats. 1957, ch. 2118, \u00a7 4, p. 3752.) And, as also stated earlier, the CalPERS statute adopted in 1953 used \u201cindividual records\u201d in a context meaning data filed <em>by </em>members. (Stats. 1953, ch. 1186, \u00a7 6, p. 2686.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Accordingly, although our order to show cause questioned whether the timing of the 1957 amendment adding the phrase \u201cindividual records of members\u201d to section 31532 was a response to the 1956 Attorney General opinion, we find nothing to link the two. Further, the 1956 Attorney General opinion itself was primarily concerned with protecting material filed <em>on behalf of members, </em>such as medical reports. Indeed, the only published case cited by the parties that mentions section 31532 stands only for the narrow proposition that a medical exam required to be given to a safety member would remain confidential. <em>(Smith v. Nettleship </em>(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 393, 396-397, 401\u2014402 [15 Cal.Rptr. 836].) And, as the Bee points out, the same 1957 bill that amended section 31527 also added a provision for county retirement boards to provide \u201c[f]or the periodic physical examination, at county expense, of safety members.\u201d (Stats. 1957, ch. 1386, \u00a7 1, p. 2719.) Thus, by adding \u201cindividual records\u201d to section 31532 at the same time, the Legislature ensured the reports of such examinations, filed on behalf of members, would be as protected as sworn statements of members.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Given the above, we conclude the Legislature did not add \u201cindividual records of members\u201d to section 31532 for the purpose of incorporating the broadly worded 1956 Attorney General opinion construing the analogous CalPERS statute to mean \u201call information pertaining to the individual.\u201d <em>(State Employees\u2019 Retirement System, supra, </em>27 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. at pp. 268-269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">However, the history of section 31532 does not end in 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">As stated earlier, in 1968, the Public Records Act was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">In 1969, section 31532 was amended to allow a member to authorize disclosure. (Stats. 1969, ch. 239, \u00a7 1, pp. 584\u2014585.) According to a legislative document in SCERS\u2019s supplemental motion for judicial notice, \u201cIt appears, from conversations with proponents, that the present wording of the section . . . may not be considered broad enough to allow a member to find out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>what his contributions have amounted to. [j[] The amendment would clarify this, without having to resort to a court order.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Public Employment and Retirement, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 835 (1969 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 16, 1969.) Contrary to SCERS\u2019s contention, this does not indicate the prior version of the statute was understood by the Legislature to make all records \u201cpertaining to\u201d an individual confidential. Presumably, contributions are regularly made by the county to SCERS <em>on behalf of </em>particular members. This amendment would clarify that the member could obtain this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">In 1977, the Attorney General interpreted section 31532 and the Public Records Act, and concluded that the pensions paid to county retirees <em>were not confidential. (County Payroll Records, supra, </em>60 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 110.) The opinion noted a similarity between section 31532 and former section 20134, stating: \u201cAlthough the language of these two sections is somewhat different the obvious purpose and intent of both sections are quite similar, that is, to maintain the privacy of retired employees.\u201d (60 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. at p. 112.) After quoting approvingly from the 1955 Attorney General opinion, the 1977 opinion states:</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u201cSection 31532 provides the authorization for the transmission of the information relating to name and amounts paid of retired persons to the county auditor/controller. It provides for confidentiality of records \u2018except insofar as may be necessary for the administration of this chapter.\u2019 It is obviously necessary for the administration of the chapter for the retirement system to provide the county auditor/controller with the necessary information so that proper payments may be made to retired employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u201cCertainly it cannot be argued that the records in the possession of the county auditor/controller are anything other than public records. \u00a7 6250 <em>et seq. </em>The only exceptions to those records being public would be found in section 6254 through section 6255. An examination of these sections does not reveal any exemption from the general Public Records Act for records held by the county auditor/controller showing the names and amounts paid to retirees.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">\u201cGiven the similarity of sections 20134 and 31532, it is therefore our opinion that the records of the county auditor/controller showing the names and amounts paid to retirees are public records and are subject to the inspection of the public or the press.\u201d <em>(County Payroll Records, supra, </em>60 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. at p. 113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">In a separate portion of the opinion, addressing records pertaining to disability hearings, the Attorney General mentioned the 1956 Attorney General opinion, stating that \u201cwe considered the status of <em>similar records held </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number><em>by </em>[CalPERS] <em>under section 20134. </em>It was our conclusion that such records were confidential. Section 31532 clearly designates such records as confidential and prohibits their disclosure to anyone except as necessary to persons who carry out the functions of the retirement system or as ordered by a proper court. They are thus specifically exempted from the Public Records Act by section 6254 subdivision (k). . . .\u201d <em>(County Payroll Records, supra, </em>60 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. at p. 113, italics added.) In the portion of the opinion we have italicized, the Attorney General clarified that the 1956 Attorney General opinion pertained to records concerning a member\u2019s medical and physical condition. This interpretation is in accord with our earlier observation that, notwithstanding broad language used in the 1956 opinion, its intended <em>application </em>was narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">SCERS perceives significance in the fact that, in 1985, the CalPERS statute, former section 20134, was amended to state that the name and gross pension benefit of a CalPERS retiree is <em>not </em>confidential. Apparently, such information was routinely released by the Controller, but <em>not </em>CalPERS, and the amendment required CalPERS to release the information directly. (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 808 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) May 20, 1985, p. 2; see Stats. 1985, ch. 1508, \u00a7 1, p. 5559.) But the 1985 amendment does not show, as SCERS contends, that in its absence the confidentiality of the \u201cindividual record\u201d of a CalPERS member precludes the disclosure of pension benefits, nor does it show that the failure to make a similar change in section 31532 has significance. Instead, it shows the Legislature wanted to eliminate lingering confusion resulting from the 1955 Attorney General opinion concluding that such records were not confidential and the 1956 Attorney General opinion which suggested that indeed they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">We also find it telling that SCERS has not offered any reason the Legislature would have for designating county employee pensions\u2014and no other public pensions\u2014confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">We return to the familiar mle that we must construe statutory exemptions narrowly. <em>(Dixon, supra, </em>170 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1275-1276; <em>Fresno, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at p. 831.) By applying that rule, we conclude the term \u201cindividual records,\u201d as used in section 31532, refers to information provided <em>by </em>a member or on the member\u2019s behalf (such as medical reports), <em>to </em>SCERS, and <em>not </em>all records that <em>pertain to </em>or <em>relate to </em>a member.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">In additional support of this view, we note SCERS\u2019s maintenance of other records that pertain or relate to a member, but are not provided by a member or on a member\u2019s behalf. For example, SCERS must maintain financial records including the \u201ctotal accumulated contributions of retired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>members less the annuity payments made to the members,\u201d and must report its \u201cfinancial transactions\u201d each year in an annual statement. (\u00a7\u00a7 31599, subd. (b), 31597; see \u00a7 31598.) While this does not mean its annual report must be at the level of detail sought by the Bee, it shows that SCERS maintains <em>its own </em>records of transactions, including \u201cpayments made to the members.\u201d (\u00a7 31599, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Our conclusion is further bolstered by two California Supreme Court cases interpreting the Public Records Act as it applies to requests for public employee <em>salary </em>information.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In <em>POST, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th 278, our Supreme Court considered whether the names, employing departments and employment dates of peace officers were confidential. The relevant statutory language was that personnel records \u201cor information obtained from these records, are confidential\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 832.7, subd. (a)), and \u201c \u2018[personnel records\u2019 \u201d was defined as \u201cany file maintained under that individual\u2019s name by his or her employing agency and containing records relating to any of the following: [$] (a) Personal data, including marital status, family members, educational and employment history, home addresses, or similar information.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 832.8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\"><em>POST </em>rejected the view that any \u201cinformation\u201d in \u201cany file maintained under that individual\u2019s name\u201d would be confidential, concluding that would lead to \u201carbitrary and anomalous results.\u201d <em>(POST, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 290.) Under that interpretation, \u201cthe circumstance that a document was placed into a file that also contained the type of personal or private information listed in the statute would render the document confidential, regardless of whether the document at issue was of a personal or private nature, and regardless of whether it was related to personnel matters.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cWe consider it unlikely the Legislature intended to render documents confidential based on their location, rather than their content.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 291.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">This bolsters our view that the phrase \u201cindividual records of members\u201d does not mean any information <em>pertaining to </em>a member. And as the trial court observed, <em>POST </em>answers SCERS\u2019s contention that the various Attorney General opinions we quoted earlier should be interpreted by parsing which agency (e.g., the Controller, CalPERS, or a county auditor) held particular information. Even if the identity of the information\u2019s caretaker previously made a difference, it is a distinction without a difference <em>post-POST.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Our Supreme Court also held: \u201cSubdivision (a) of [Penal Code] section 832.8 refers to \u2018Personal data, including marital status, family members, educational and employment history, home addresses, or similar information.\u2019 Each of the items listed, including \u2018employment history,\u2019 is presented as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>example of \u2018personal data.\u2019 The items enumerated in subdivision (a) do not constitute information that arises out of an officer\u2019s employment. Rather, they are the types of personal information that commonly are supplied by an employee to his or her employer, either during the application process or upon employment.\u201d <em>(POST, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 294.) \u201cWe find no indication that the Legislature, in adopting sections 832.7 and 832.8, was concerned with mating confidential the identities of peace officers or the basic fact of their employment. Rather, the legislative concern appears to have been with linking a named officer to the private or sensitive information listed in section 832.8.\u201d (Id. at p. 295.) \u201cA name might be viewed as \u2018personal data\u2019 in the broadest sense of that phrase, because it relates to a person. \u2018Personal\u2019 generally is defined to mean \u2018of or relating to a particular person.\u2019 [Citations.] The word \u2018personal,\u2019 however, also carries a connotation of \u2018private,\u2019 meaning \u2018peculiar or proper to private concerns,\u2019 \u2018not public or general\u2019 [citation], or \u2018[concerning a particular person and his or her private business, interests, or activities; intimate\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 296.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Similarly, \u201cindividual\u201d commonly means \u201cof, belonging to, arising from, or possessed by an individual.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Intemat. Diet. (1971) p. 1152.) Under this view, purely personal information \u201csupplied by\u201d a member (see <em>POST, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 294) such as a home address or spouse\u2019s name would fall within a member\u2019s \u201cindividual\u201d record, but the records of how much money is given <em>to </em>the member <em>by </em>the retirement board, and how that amount was calculated (years of service, position held, date of retirement, and so forth) would not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\"><em>POST </em>also cited with approval the 1955 and 1977 Attorney General opinions we have already described at length: \u201cWithout a more specific indication in the statute, we hesitate to conclude that the Legislature intended to classify the identity of a public official whose activities are a matter of serious public concern as \u2018personal data.\u2019 The names of all public employees are viewed as public information under both state and federal law. The Attorney General has long held the position that \u2018the name of every public officer and employee ... is a matter of public record.\u2019 <em>(State Employees\u2019 Retirement Act, </em>25 Ops .Cal. Atty.Gen. [, <em>supra,] </em>90, 91 . . .

[county payroll records of names and amounts received by retirees are public records].)\u201d <em>(POST, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 296; see <em>International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 331 [also citing those two opinions with approval].)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>POST </em>also made this observation: \u201cHad the Legislature intended to prevent the disclosure of officers\u2019 identities as such, an obvious solution would have been to list \u2018name\u2019 as an item of \u2018[p]ersonal data\u2019 under subdivision (a) of section 832.8.\u201d <em>(POST, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 298 [listing other statutes that preclude release of names]; see <em>International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 343 [\u201cwe would expect to see specific language to that effect in the statute\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Similarly, if the Legislature wanted to make all records <em>pertaining to, relating to, </em>or <em>about </em>an individual SCERS member confidential, it could have done so. (See, e.g., Ed. Code, \u00a7 49061, subd. (b) [\u201cpupil record\u201d includes \u201cany item of information directly related to an identifiable pupil\u201d with exceptions]; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(a)(4) [under federal Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub.L. No. 93-579, 88 Stat. 1896), \u201crecord\u201d includes \u201cany item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Some statutes containing language specific to other statutory schemes are cited by SCERS to show that <em>in those statutes, </em>\u201cthe Legislature is referring to a collection or grouping of information about a natural person.\u201d (See, e.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7 1799, subd. (e) [defining \u201crecord\u201d as \u201cany item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual or business entity\u201d]; Ed. Code, \u00a7 49558, subd. (a) [\u201cAll applications and records concerning any individual\u201d are confidential]; Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 4903, subd. (b) [\u201cIndividual records that shall be available . . . shall include ... all of the following information and records related to the investigation . . . .\u201d].) Two of SCERS\u2019s examples have a familiar ring: \u201cInformation filed with the system by a participant or beneficiary is confidential and shall be used by the system for the sole purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this part.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 26215, subd. (a); see also Fish &amp; G. Code, \u00a7 8022, subd. (a) [records filed are confidential and \u201cinformation contained in the records shall be compiled or published as summaries, so as not to disclose the individual record or business of any person\u201d].) Those definitions do not apply outside their statutory schemes and do not support a broad reading of section 31532. They <em>do </em>show that the Legislature could have worded section 31532 more broadly had it so desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Finally, SCERS contends <em>its own </em>interpretation of section 31532, an interpretation shared by some other county retirement boards, is entitled to weight. Although courts will at times grant deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statutes it is charged with administering (see <em>Yamaha Corp. of America </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 6-15 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 960 P.2d 1031]), that deference is not granted in Public Records Act cases. \u201cWhether or not a particular type of record is exempt should not depend upon the peculiar practice of the government entity at issue\u2014otherwise, an agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>could transform public records into private ones simply by refusing to disclose them over a period of time.\u201d <em>(International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 336.) Moreover, SCERS does not dispute that some county retirement boards interpret section 31532 narrowly, and disclose names and individual pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In short, the confidentiality conferred by section 31532 protects information provided <em>by </em>a member or on the member\u2019s behalf <em>to </em>SCERS, not all information held by SCERS that <em>pertains to </em>or <em>relates to </em>the member. The confidential record does <em>not </em>include the name, date of retirement, department retired from, last position held, years of service, base allowance, cost of living adjustment, total health allowance and monthly pension benefit of each retiree. Therefore, the trial court correctly concluded that this information, as requested by the Bee, was not protected from disclosure by section 31532.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">B. <em>Catchall Exemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u201cWe thus come to whether, under section 6255, [SCERS] satisfied [its] burden of demonstrating a public interest in nondisclosure that clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure on the facts of this particular case. [Citations.] This is a matter on which we exercise de novo review, according the usual deference to any express or implied factual findings of the superior court supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(Connell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 601, 612 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 738] <em>(Connell), </em>see <em>San Gabriel Tribune v.

We address these four points seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>First, we agree that Californians enjoy a right to privacy in their <em>private </em>financial affairs. \u201cA constitutional amendment adopted in 1974 elevated the right of privacy to an \u2018inalienable right\u2019 expressly protected by force of constitutional mandate. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1.) . . . [W]e may safely assume that the right of privacy extends to one\u2019s confidential financial affairs as well as to the details of one\u2019s personal life.\u201d <em>(Valley Bank of Nevada </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 656 [125 Cal.Rptr. 553, 542 P.2d 977].) However, <em>public </em>pensions are not <em>private </em>information.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u201cAlthough one does not lose his right to privacy upon accepting public employment, the very fact that he is engaged in the public\u2019s business strips him of some anonymity.\u201d <em>(Braun </em>v. <em>City of Taft </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 332, 347 [201 Cal.Rptr. 654].) Public salary information \u201cis not private information that happens to be collected in the records of a public entity. Rather, it is information regarding an aspect of government operations, the disclosure of which contributes to the public\u2019s understanding and oversight of those operations by allowing interested parties to monitor the expenditure of public funds. The disclosure of such information under the Act does not violate the right of privacy protected by the California Constitution.\u201d <em>(International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 340.) We believe the same can be said for public pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">In <em>International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 319, a case mandating disclosure of public salaries, our Supreme Court distinguished an earlier case involving personal financial matters:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">\u201cThe present case, in contrast, involves disclosure of financial matters directly related to the individual\u2019s public employment. Of course, we recognize that many individuals, including public employees, may be uncomfortable with the prospect of others knowing their salary and that many of these individuals would share that information only on a selective basis, even within the workplace. Nor do we question that public disclosure of an individual\u2019s salary may cause discomfort or embarrassment. Nonetheless, in light of the strong public policy supporting transparency in government, an individual\u2019s expectation of privacy in a salary earned in public employment is significantly less than the privacy expectation regarding income earned in the private sector.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">\u201cTo the extent some public employees may expect their salaries to remain a private matter, that expectation is not a reasonable one . . . .\u201d <em>(International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 331.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">The court also held: \u201cCounterbalancing any cognizable interest that public employees may have in avoiding disclosure of their salaries is the strong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>public interest in knowing how the government spends its money. As we have observed in the context of the public\u2019s right of access to court proceedings and documents, public access makes it possible for members of the public \u2018 \u201cto expose corruption, incompetence, inefficiency, prejudice, and favoritism.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 333.) The court explained that the trial court had been given \u201cnumerous examples of articles published throughout the state that used information concerning public employee salaries to illustrate claimed nepotism, favoritism, or financial mismanagement in state and local government.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 334.) But <em>two </em>of the examples cited involved public <em>pensions. (Ibid.) </em>Thus, the court implicitly concluded that a <em>public </em>pension is not <em>private </em>financial information.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">SCERS emphasizes that a portion of each pension stems from member contributions or investment returns, and the actual amount is derived from many individual factors, such as longevity of service and purchased service credits. But SCERS\u2019s chief executive officer declared that most of each pension was public money or investment returns, which would include returns on <em>public </em>money, and SCERS conceded in the trial court that the taxpayer must back public pensions in case of investment failure. (See <em>County of Orange v. Association of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs </em>(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 21, 29 [121 Cal.Rptr.3d 151] [\u201cAny shortfall ... is made up through increases in employer contributions . . . .\u201d]; <em>Pulitzer Publishing Co. v.

Thus, although some neighbors or others may become envious upon learning of a particular pension, the fact of such pension would not necessarily expose the member to public shame or abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In requiring disclosure of concealed weapons permits, the California Supreme Court rejected a claim of privacy as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u201cThe concern in <em>[American Civil Liberties Union Foundation </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 440 [186 Cal.Rptr. 235, 651 P.2d 822]] was for the harm that might result from the public revelation of the names or associates of individuals listed in an organized crime index. [Citation.] That information was in essence an allegation that the individual was a participant in criminal activity. None of these allegations had been substantiated in a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u201cIn contrast, the information sought here would not inflict the kind of immediate social stigma that arises from having one\u2019s name included on a list of suspected members of organized crime.\u201d <em>(CBS, Inc. v.

Also, \u201cWe do not view the fact of an individual\u2019s <em>public </em>employment, however, as a <em>personal </em>matter. Furthermore, dissemination of information concerning where and when a particular individual has served as a peace officer is not likely to cause \u2018unjustified embarrassment or indignity.\u2019 [Citation.] To the contrary, a peace officer occupies an especially honorable position, one vested with great responsibility, trust, and confidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 300-301.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Similarly, we do not view the fact of an individual\u2019s <em>public </em>retirement to be a <em>personal </em>matter or one likely to generate obloquy. The records will reveal that an individual was a county employee (whose salary amount was public record) and now is a .retiree (whose pension amount is public record). SCERS\u2019s claim of severe unwelcome attention to retirees in particular is not compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">Accordingly, we find SCERS\u2019s second ground provides modest support, at best, for keeping the information confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Third, SCERS and allied amici curiae assert release of individual pension amounts will expose members to financial predation.

The City has not been asked to disclose any contact information for these employees, such as home addresses or telephone numbers.\u201d <em>(International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 339; see <em>Fresno, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at p. 834 [possibility that releasing financial donor names would cause them to be solicited not grounds to withhold names].)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Many cases limiting identifying information in various contexts involve <em>home addresses </em>and <em>home telephone numbers. </em>(See, e.g., <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Employee Relations Com. </em>(2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1231 [119 Cal.Rptr.3d 213] [home addresses and telephone numbers of nonunion members]; <em>Planned Parenthood Golden Gate v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 347 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 627] [home addresses and telephone numbers of abortion clinic workers]; <em>National Assn. of Retired Federal Employees v. Homer </em>(D.C. Cir. 1989) 879 F.2d 873 [no public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>interest in releasing names <em>and home addresses </em>of federal retirees, therefore release would be a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6)].) But home and e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and Social Security numbers are data provided <em>by </em>members <em>to </em>SCERS and therefore are confidential under section 31532. (Accord, <em>MOSERS, supra, </em>927 S.W.2d at p. 483 [disclosure of individual pensions did not include addresses and telephone numbers, minimizing risk of \u201cexploitation of vulnerable, elderly retirees by unscrupulous elements who might request blanket information for inappropriate purposes\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Although it is possible, as some amici curiae posit, that some persons may be able to use other means to link a retiree with a home address or telephone number, that possibility does not materially advance SCERS\u2019s claim that releasing individual pensions will endanger retirees.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Accordingly, we find SCERS\u2019s third ground provides modest support, at best, for keeping the information confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Fourth, SCERS contends the Bee has alternative ways to investigate public pensions. This claim is not persuasive. Whether data is disclosable does not turn on who requests it. The Bee has no special right of access to public records, and its motives or needs are irrelevant. (See <em>State Bd. of Equalization v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1190-1191 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 342]; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 469, 476, fn. 4 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 412]; <em>Black Panther Party, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d at p. 656.) Further, the Bee submitted declarations explaining a need to link pensions to specific people to determine if certain abuses occur. The trial court overruled SCERS\u2019s objections to this evidence and SCERS does not challenge that ruling. This is the kind of information our Supreme Court found militated in favor of disclosure of public salaries. <em>(International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at p. 334.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Accordingly, we reject SCERS\u2019s fourth ground for keeping individual pensions confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">Although SCERS has identified some legitimate interests in nondisclosure, they fall far short of <em>compelling. </em>SCERS has not carried its \u201cburden of demonstrating a public interest in nondisclosure that clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\u201d <em>(Connell, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at p. 612.) \u201cSince there is a strong public interest in disclosure, the balance must tip in favor of access\u201d to the information. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 617.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">C. <em>Individual Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">Some amici curiae allied with SCERS assert that retirees are entitled to individual notice before their pensions are revealed. SCERS did not raise this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>point in the trial court or in this court, although it cites a case touching on this point in its traverse, in connection with its discussion of releases of court-ordered release of records.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u201cGenerally courts will only consider issues properly raised by the parties on appeal. [Citations.] However, the Supreme Court has recognized two exceptions to this rule. First, under the theory that an appeal should be affirmed if the judgment is correct on any theory, amicus curiae may raise an issue which will support affirmance. Second, amicus curiae may assert jurisdictional questions which cannot be waived even if not raised by the parties.\u201d <em>(Costa v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1187-1188 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 289]; see <em>California Assn. for Safety Education </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1274-1275 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 404].) Neither of those exceptions applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">It has also been suggested that, by extension of the rule that a <em>party </em>can raise a purely legal issue for the first time on appeal, an appellate court may exercise its discretion to permit amicus curiae to raise new issues where the issues touch on public policy and the facts are undisputed. (See <em>Lavie </em>v. <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 496, 502-503 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 486].) Assuming we may consider the point absent briefing <em>by the parties </em>(cf. \u00a7 68081), we find it lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">SCERS does not contend its members have varying claims to privacy. Nor do the amici curiae describe any reason for protecting a special class of county retirees. They rest their claim to individual notice on the assumption that individual pensions are personal, confidential information. But we have already held to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">In <em>International Federation, </em>our Supreme Court rejected a claim that disclosing public salaries required consideration of each employee\u2019s privacy interests, noting that no evidence had been presented justifying such an approach. <em>(International Federation, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at pp. 336-338.) In contrast, in <em>POST, </em>a colorable claim was made that undercover peace officers would face special danger if their information was revealed, and a hearing was ordered to consider that claim. <em>(POST, supra, </em>42 Cal.4th at pp. 301-303.) No similar colorable claim for treating a special class of retirees differently than other retirees has been articulated in this case; therefore no remand for individual notice is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The petition for writ of mandate is denied. The stay previously issued by this court is vacated. SCERS shall pay the Bee\u2019s \u201ccosts and reasonable attorney fees\u201d in an amount to be determined by the trial court. (\u00a7 6259, subd. (d); see <em>Motorola Communication &amp; Electronics, Inc. v. Department of General Services </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1340, 1344 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 477]; <em>San Gabriel, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d at pp. 781-782.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Raye, P. J., and Robie, J. concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 8, 2011.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-12\"> Further unspecified section references are to the Government Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\"> For completeness, we note that two similar trial court decisions are under review, in the First and Fourth District Courts of Appeal. (See <em>Sonoma County Employee\u2019s Retirement Assn. v. Superior Court </em>(A130659)  ; <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. v. Superior Court </em>(0058962)  )</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b316-11\"> The point was to show that some people might request names of members for questionable purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b322-10\"> At oral argument, the Bee appeared to take the position that the 1956 opinion was poorly reasoned and unintentionally overbroad, rather than continuing to attempt to harmonize the three opinions. As we explain <em>post, </em>we agree that the 1956 opinion was unintentionally overbroad.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\"> At oral argument, SCERS asserted that upholding the disclosure order in this case would open the floodgates to litigation regarding whether each specific item of information about a member would or would not be protected. We disagree. The trial court\u2019s order specified the material to be disclosed in this particular case, and the interpretation of \u201cindividual records\u201d we adopt should not prove difficult to apply in future cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
