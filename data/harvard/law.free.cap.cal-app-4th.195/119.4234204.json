Defendants argue that the court erred in failing to stay this action under the doctrine of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction and, alternatively, that the court incorrectly determined that Insurance Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 11873 prohibits the Governor from furloughing State Fund employees. Following remand of this case from the Supreme Court and the change in administration, the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the appeal and issuance of a remittitur affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment as the final judgment in the matter. Because the authority of the Governor to order the furlough of State Fund employees is an issue of continuing public interest, we have declined to dismiss the appeal and shall, in the published portion of this opinion, set forth the reasons for which the trial court correctly concluded that the Governor lacks such authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the unpublished portion of the opinion we conclude that the trial court was also correct in reftising to stay the action. We shall therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">On December 19, 2008, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger issued Executive Order No. S-16-08. The order recites that the state is facing a fiscal and cash crisis and that the general fund deficit was projected to grow to $42 billion over the following 18 months. Finding that \u201ca furlough will reduce current spending and immediately improve the State\u2019s ability to meet its obligations to pay for essential services,\u201d the order directs the Director to \u201cadopt a plan to implement a furlough of represented state employees and supervisors for two days per month, regardless of funding source. This plan shall include a limited exemption process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">On February 10, 2009, after the Sacramento Superior Court had denied a petition seeking to prohibit the Governor from implementing the furlough order with respect to executive branch employees,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and after the Director indicated that the furlough order would be applied to State Fund employees, California Attorneys, Administrative Law Judges and Hearing Officers in State Employment (CASE) and individual plaintiffs Glen Grossman, Mark Henderson and Geoffrey Sims filed the present action in San Francisco Superior Court against the Governor, the Director, John Chiang, as State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Controller, and Jan Frank, as president of State Fund.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The petition seeks an injunction prohibiting the Governor from imposing the furloughs on CASE members employed by State Fund on the ground that section 11873 prohibits the Governor from furloughing State Fund employees. After briefing and argument, the court agreed with CASE that section 11873 prohibits the Governor from furloughing State Fund employees. An order granting the writ of mandate and a corresponding judgment were entered on April 15. The Governor and the Director filed a timely notice of appeal and the trial court subsequently granted CASE relief from the automatic stay provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 916, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">On March 19, 2010, this court affirmed the judgment of the superior court. On May 19, 2010, the Supreme Court granted review (S182581) and, following its decision in <em>Professional Engineers in California Government v. Schwarzenegger </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 989 [116 Cal.Rptr.3d 480, 239 P.3d 1186], transferred the matter back to this court for reconsideration in light of that decision. After considering supplemental briefs submitted by the parties, we find nothing in the Supreme Court decision inconsistent with our prior conclusions and therefore again affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">1. <em>Exclusive Concurrent Jurisdiction</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>2. <em>Section 11873</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The California Constitution vests the Legislature with plenary power \u201cto create . . . and enforce a complete system of workers\u2019 compensation, . . . including the establishment and management of a State compensation insurance fund . . . .\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 4.) The Legislature has exercised this authority by creating State Fund within the provisions of the Insurance Code. (\u00a7 11770 et seq.) Section 11873, subdivision (a) provides that except for several provisions specified in subdivision (b), \u201cthe fund shall not be subject to the provisions of the Government Code made applicable to state agencies generally or collectively, unless the section specifically names the fund as an agency to which the provision applies.\u201d Under this statutory scheme, State Fund \u201cis at once both an agency of the state and an insurance carrier. In these two roles, it is self-operating and of a special and unique character.\u201d <em>(P. W. Stephens, Inc. v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1833, 1835 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 107].) \u201cAll duties, powers, and jurisdiction relating to the administration of the State Compensation Insurance Fund [are] vested in the Board of Directors . . . .\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 57.5; see Ins. Code, \u00a7 11781.)  The board\u2019s authority over the administration of the fund is comparable to that of \u201cthe governing body of a private insurance carrier.\u201d (\u00a7 11781.) State Fund is designed by the Legislature to \u201cbe fairly competitive with other insurers\u201d and intended to be \u201cneither more nor less than self-supporting.\u201d (\u00a7 11775.) State Fund \u201cmoneys deposited with the State Treasurer are not state moneys . . .\u201d (\u00a7 11800.1) and must be tracked by separate ledger (\u00a7 11800.2). By statute, State Fund\u2019s assets are only \u201capplicable to the payment of losses sustained on account of insurance and to the payment of the salaries and other expenses charged against it.\u201d (\u00a7 11774.) Profits earned by State Fund may not be retained by State Fund or the state but must be returned to \u201cits insureds as a dividend or credit.\u201d <em>(Gordon\u2019s Cabinet Shop </em>v. <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 33, 35 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 541] [\u201cUnder the statutory scheme, [State Fund] ... is not intended to accumulate and hold assets over and above the amounts needed for liabilities, necessary reserves, and a reasonable surplus.\u201d]; see \u00a7 11775.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Defendants note correctly that under section 11873, subdivision (b), State Fund is subject to the Ralph C. Dills Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3512 et seq.), which contains the collective bargaining provisions for state employees, and to other provisions of the Government Code including sections 19851 and 19849.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Director is responsible for \u201cmanaging the nonmerit aspects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the state\u2019s personnel system\u201d and \u201c[i]n general, the [Director] has jurisdiction over the state\u2019s financial relationship with its employees, including matters of salary, layoffs and nondisciplinary demotions.\u201d <em>(Tirapelle v. Davis </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1317, 1322 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 666].) The memorandum of understanding with State Fund employees represented by CASE was negotiated by the Director.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a statutorily created administrative agency, however, the Director \u201ccan act only to the extent and in a manner consistent with the legislative delegation of authority.\u201d (20 Cal.App.4th at p. 1323, fn. 8.) It is unnecessary to decide whether in the absence of more explicit legislation the Ralph C. Dills Act would authorize the Governor to override the authority of State Fund\u2019s board of directors over the administration of State Fund by furloughing its employees, because subdivision (c) of section 11873 expressly provides that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Section 11873, subdivision (c) provides, \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of the Government Code or any other provision of law, the positions funded by the State Compensation Insurance Fund are exempt from any hiring freezes and staff cutbacks otherwise required by law.\u201d As the more specific provision, the express exemption found in subdivision (c) is controlling to the extent it conflicts with other more general provisions of the Government Code. <em>(Stone Street Capital, LLC v. California State Lottery Com. </em>(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 109, 119 [80 Cal.Rptr.3d 326] [\u201cIf inconsistent statutes cannot otherwise be reconciled, \u2018a particular or specific provision will take precedence over a conflicting general provision.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Defendants argue that section 11873 limits only the Governor\u2019s authority to lay off employees and does not preclude the Governor from reducing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>number of hours each employee works. The trial court rejected this argument, explaining, \u201cThe term \u2018staff cutback\u2019 has to be read in its commonsense meaning, and to the extent that it is informed by the policy concerns expressed in the legislative history as anything to the contrary, it is that a furlough program designed to reduce the availability of staff is a cutback for purposes of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The issue of statutory interpretation is reviewed de novo. <em>(California Teachers Assn. v. Governing Bd. of Hilmar Unified School Dist. </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 183, 190 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 323].) \u201c \u2018Our fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute. [Citation.] We begin by examining the statutory language, giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citation.] If there is no ambiguity, then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said, and the plain meaning of the language governs. [Citations.] If, however, the statutory terms are ambiguous, then we may resort to extrinsic sources, including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 191.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that section 11873, subdivision (c) limits the Governor\u2019s authority to impose furloughs on State Fund employees is consistent with the language of the statute, the larger statutory scheme, and the legislative history of the State Fund authorizing legislation. The authority to determine staffing needs is vested in the State Fund board- and not the Governor, consistent with State Fund\u2019s structure as a \u201cquasi-govemmental entity\u201d mandated to be self-sufficient. <em>(Tricor California, Inc. v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 230, 241 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 550].) Defendants\u2019 suggestion that the exemption for State Fund employees from \u201cstaff cutbacks\u201d prevents layoffs but not a reduction in hours is not sensible. Staff is \u201ccut back\u201d whether hours are reduced or employees are terminated. The reduction in total hours worked by State Fund employees is the same whether achieved by a furlough imposed on all employees or the layoff of only some employees. The exemption in subdivision (c) was enacted \u201cto allow [State Fund]\u2019s executive leadership to exercise its best business judgment on [State Fund]\u2019s staffing needs\u201d with the hope that such flexibility would \u201chave a positive impact on controlling policy costs and providing better service to policyholders.\u201d (Cal. Dept. of Industrial Relations, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 227 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 29, 2003, p. 15.) This objective would be undermined by the interpretation of the statute that defendants propose. Moreover, defendant\u2019s interpretation would not achieve the announced purpose of the Governor\u2019s executive order, to improve the state\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligations. Any cost savings realized from a furlough of State Fund employees would accrue not to the benefit of the state\u2019s general fund, but to the ledger account maintained for the exclusive use of State Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Hence, we conclude that the trial court correctly interpreted section 11873, subdivision (c) and issued a writ of mandate directing the Governor to set aside Executive Order No. S-16-08 insofar as it applies to State Fund employees represented by CASE.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The judgment granting the petition for writ of mandate is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">McGuiness, P.

On appeal, both the Controller and the State Fund president have filed briefs arguing that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b129-9\"> This case involves State Fund employees rather than employees of the executive branch and its resolution turns on different statutory provisions from those at issue in <em>Professional Engineers in California Government v. Schwarzenegger, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th 989. Moreover, to the extent the Supreme Court decision furnishes any guidance here, our holding is supported by the court\u2019s conclusion: \u201cwe find unpersuasive the Governor\u2019s contention that either the constitutional authority granted to him by the California Constitution or the existing statutory provisions pertaining to the terms and conditions of state employment granted him or the [Director] the authority unilaterally to impose a mandatory unpaid furlough on state employees.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1041.) Funding for the compensation of State Fund employees is not included in the annual budget act. (\u00a7 11774; 15 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 210, 211 [\u201cAll salaries and other expenses of the State Fund are paid out of premiums received from its contributing policy holders . . . .\u201d].) Therefore, the legislation revising the 2008 Budget Act and approving the Budget Act of 2009 that the court held to have authorized furloughs for executive branch employees has no application to State Fund personnel. (See 50 Cal.4th at pp. 1005-1006, 1043-1052; Stats. 2009, 3d Ex. Sess. 2009-2010, chs. 1, 2.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b129-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 119.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\"> Government Code section 19849 provides: \u201c(a) The department shall adopt rules governing hours of work and overtime compensation and the keeping of records related thereto, including time and attendance records.
