The first count of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>indictment charged him with forging \u201c a certain order for the payment of money, which said forged order for the payment of money is as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\">\u201c \u2018 Mr. Davis Wen. 19th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-6\"><em>\u201c \u2018 </em>pleas let the boy have $6,00 dolers for me</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-7\">\"'B.

The prisoner excepted, and the admission of the paper as evidence is now assigned for error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-12\">It is not claimed that the instrument set forth varies from that offered in evidence, but the single point now urged is, that the instrument in question is not an \u201c <em>order\u201d </em>for the payment of money, as named in the first count, but only a \u201c request.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-13\"><em>P.

P. </em>Wolcott, Attorney General, for the state.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-16\">The instrument set forth in the indictment is properly designated an \u201c order.\u201d Such is not only its general and popular meaning, but the words \u201corder\u201d and \u201crequest\u201d are frequently used in the law as exact synonyms. 2 Bl.

(47 E. C. L.) 471; <em>Reg. </em>v. <em>Snelling, </em>21 Eng. Law and Eq. Rep. 600; <em>Reg. </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>1 Eng. Law and Eq. Rep. 590; <em>Reg. </em>v. <em>Illidge, </em>2 Car. and Kir.

Cas. 352,) speak an uniform language ignoring or denying the distinction between \u201c orders \u201d and \u201crequests.\u201d <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>17 Mass. Rep. 46; <em>Peoples.

Rep. 92-101; <em>State </em>v. <em>Holly, </em>2 Bay 262, cited in 2 Russ, on Cr. 318, note.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b206-6\">Scott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5v\">If we look simply to the terms of the false instrument set out in the indictment in this case, a decision, either way, of the question presented, might be sustained by a copious reference to authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The leading English cases would decide the question in favor of the plaintiff in error. Perhaps the instincts of humanity had their influence in those decisions; for under their statute, then in force, the question became one of life or death to the prisoner. Under the more humane criminal codes of an advancing civilization, the courts of this country have generally held a different doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">It is by no means surprising, that this conflict of authorities should be found in relation to instruments similar in their terms. The language employed may be such that the legal character of the instrument would depend upon the relations subsisting between the parties and the circumstances of the case. These circumstances may have been such in the present case, as, had the paper been genuine, would have given Earl, the drawer, a right to expect and require the compliance of Bavis with its terms. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>may, for instance, have had funds in the hands of Davis, subject to his own order; and, in such case, the instrument in question would naturally be regarded and treated by the parties as an \u201c <em>order,\u201d </em>and would both in fact and in law he such, notwithstanding the civility and courtesy of the terms m which it is couched. The style alone cannot determine the legal character of the instrument, for a rude <em>request </em>may be more mandatory in its form than a courteous <em>order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In this case, there was no special finding of the facts by the jury, and the bill of exceptions does not purport to contain a statement of all the evidence, but seems \u25a0 to proceed on the idea that this instrument, from its very terms, could not, under any circumstances, be regarded as a statutory \u201c <em>order\u201d </em>for the payment of money. We think otherwise. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b207-6\">Bartley, C. J., and Swan, Brinkerhoef and Bowen, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
