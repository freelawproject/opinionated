To constitute forgery, under the crimes act of this state, it is essential that the fabricated writing shall not only'answer'the general description of some one of those enumerated in the statute, but that it shall also be such an instrument as that, if genuine, it would tend in the law, to establish or defeat some claim, impose some duty, create some liability, or otherwise prejudice one in his rights of person or of estate. The evident purpose of the statute is to protect society against the falsification of those writings only which have some legal efficacy, and the instrument must, therefore, either on its face, or with reference to extrinsic facts, be capable, in the law, of accomplishing a fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-7\">H. This conclusion, derived from the intent of the statute, is fortified by the consideration that as every man is conclusively presumed to know the law, no one can, in legal contemplation, be damnified by the fabrication of an instrument to which, if genuine, the law would give no operative effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-8\">HI. Nor, in this respect, is there any difference between instruments, void on their face, and those which, though apparently operative, are yet not so by reason of matters <em>dehors </em>the paper. Wherever, upon all the proofs, it appears that the writing, however seemingly effective on its face, could have no legal tendency to affect injuriously the rights of another, the accused must go acquit. <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 15 Ohio Rep. 717.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-9\">IY. The settled rules of criminal pleading require that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>every indictment shall contain a complete description of the offense charged, with such particularity in respect to time, place and circumstance, as that the defendant may know with certainty \u201c the nature of the accusation against him.\u201d Accordingly an indictment for forgery must allege not merely the fabrication \u2014 with intent to damage some named person \u2014 of a writing which, either upon its face, or in connection with the extrinsic facts averred, may, in contemplation of law, be capable of compassing a fraud, but it must also show that the writing may exert this legal capacity to defraud against the very person so named. If, then, it do not appear, upon the face of the indictment, that the simulated writing, though seemingly effective for some purposes, may, by its apparent legal operation, tend to accomplish the fraudulent intent charged in the particular case, it must, as to all the purposes of the given case, be deemed invalid, and so not the subject of forgery under the circumstances then averred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b641-5\">V. Where, therefore, an indictment charges that Clarke, <em>with intent to defraud Lupton, </em>falsely altered a receipt made by a county treasurer to Lupton, reciting the payment of Lupton\u2019s taxes upon certain property, for a given year, so that the receipt, in its altered form, indicated the payment of a larger sum than that originally expressed therein, and does not aver any extrinsic circumstance, showing how this altered receipt was clothed with any apparent legal attributes by which it could operate to the prejudice of Lupton, it is bad. Whatever might be its legal tendency to defraud the treasurer, yet, as against Lupton, oh its face the writing seems utterly powerless, in the law, for mischief. Of itself it does not tend to impose on him any duty; defeat any of his rights'; charge him with any liability, nor could it be used as evidence against him. Quite possibly some circumstances can be imagined under which it might seem legally effective against Lupton, but if there were such, they should have been averred in the indictment, so that the court could judicially see that the writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>was invested with an ostensible legal capacity for evil. The indictment must always show a practicable fraud. Courts are not to explore for possible mischiefs, nor is the liberty of the citizen to be surmised away upon any such vague conjectures.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b642-5\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b642-6\"><bracketnum><em>1.</em></bracketnum><em> </em>An indictment for forgery must not only allege the false making or alteration of a writing specified in the statute, with intent to defraud some named person or body corporate, but it must also appear on the face of the indictement, that the fabricated writing, either of itself or in connection with the extrinsic facts averred, is such, that if genuine, it would be valid in the law to prejudice the rights of the person or body corporate thus named.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> Although in this case the indictment charges that Clarke, <em>with intent to defraud </em>Lupton, falsely altered the receipt made to Lupton by the county treasurer, for the payment of certain taxes due from Lupton, for the given year, so that the receipt, in its altered form, represented the payment of a sum larger than that originally expressed therein; yet, as the indictment does not aver any extrinsic circumstances giving the receipt an operation beyond that imported by its terms, and as by its terms, solely, the receipt had no legal efficacy as against Lupton, it could not, therefore, in contemplation of law, impair any of his rights-. The indictment is, therefore, on its face, defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and, cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
