On appeal, Hylton argues that the government\u2019s theory at trial and the district court\u2019s jury instructions constructively amended his indictment. Specifically, he argues that the government attempted to broaden the basis of conviction by indicating that his fraud conviction could be based upon a crime other than the specific prior offense cited in his indictment (armed bank robbery) and that the court\u2019s jury instructions bolstered the government\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">When raised for the first time on appeal, we review a claim of constructive amendment under plain error. <em>United States v. Rutherford, </em>175 F.3d 899, 906 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">A \u201cfundamental principle\u201d derived from the Fifth Amendment is that \u201ca defendant can only be convicted for a crime charged in the indictment\u201d because \u201c[i]t would be fundamentally unfair to convict a defendant on charges of which he had no notice.\u201d <em>United States v. Keller, </em>916 F.2d 628, 633 (11th Cir.1990). Hylton contends that his indictment was \u201cconstructively amended\u201d by the prosecutor\u2019s actions and the jury instructions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">A constructive amendment occurs \u201cwhen the essential elements of the offense contained in the indictment are altered to broaden the possible bases for conviction beyond what is contained in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">In determining whether an indictment was constructively amended, we look at whether the prosecutor\u2019s actions or the court\u2019s instructions, \u201cviewed in context,\u201d literally or effectively expanded the indictment. <em>United States v. Behety, </em>32 F.3d 503, 508-09 (11th Cir.1994). Similarly, we \u201cmust analyze jury instructions in the context of the evidence presented and the government\u2019s theory at trial\u201d in determining whether a constructive amendment occurred. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>527 F.3d 1235, 1247 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">Hylton has not shown that either the government\u2019s theory at trial or the court\u2019s jury instructions constituted a constructive amendment of his indictment. In context, neither of them indicated that Hylton\u2019s fraud charge could be based upon any prior crime other than the armed bank robbery that was referenced in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">During the trial, th\u00e9re were passing references to Hylton\u2019s unlawful transfer of a firearm, but these were made merely in the context of showing Hylton\u2019s involvement in the armed robbery. By contrast, the government referred to the armed bank robbery dozens of times during the trial, including in opening statements, in the questioning of several witnesses (including Hylton himself, who admitted to the robbery), and in closing statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">The references to Hylton knowingly committing \u201ca crime\u201d were made in the context of referring to the question that Hylton had fraudulently answered: whether he had \u201cknowingly committed any crime or offense\u201d for which he had not been arrested. The references to \u201ca crime\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>were also relevant to rebut Hylton\u2019s defense theory, which was that he could not be convicted because he did not know that aiding an armed robbery was actually a criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The jury instructions similarly provide no support for Hylton\u2019s argument. The district court read the indictment to the jury and specifically cautioned that Hylton was on trial \u201conly for the specific offense alleged in the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The indictment was not amended by the actions of the government or the district court. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ABm\">.
