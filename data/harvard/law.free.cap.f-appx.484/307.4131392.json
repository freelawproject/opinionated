In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Deglace challenged his 1998 convictions and sentences from the Northern District of Florida for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1), and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). He argued that, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010), the drug quantities used to determine his sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) were elements of the offense that had to be charged in the indictment and proved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>a jury. The district court dismissed his petition because Deglace could not show that the savings clause in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) applied such that he could file under \u00a7 2241. On appeal, Deglace argues that the district court erred when it found that the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) did not apply to allow him to file his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 <em>F.3d </em>1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from the court of appeals before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b), 2255(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">A provision of \u00a7 2225, however, permits a federal prisoner, under very limited circumstances, to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1305-06 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012). The burden is on the movant to establish the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy. <em>McGhee v. Han-berry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cA prisoner in custody pursuant to a federal court judgment may proceed under \u00a7 2241 only when he raises claims outside the scope of \u00a7 2255(a).\u201d <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1351 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, \u201cchallenges to the execution of a sentence, rather than the validity of the sentence itself, are properly brought under \u00a7 2241.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1352. Moreover, a remedy by motion under \u00a7 2255 is not rendered \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d simply because an individual is procedurally barred from filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">We have previously suggested that a prisoner might bring a \u00a7 2241 motion pursuant to the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause if the Supreme Court decided a \u201ccircuit law-busting, retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision\u201d that established that he had been convicted of a nonexistent crime. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999); <em>but see Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1319 (clarifying that this language was dicta and that \u201c[t]he actual holding of the <em>Wofford </em>decision ... is simply that the savings clause does not cover sentence claims that could have been raised in earlier proceedings\u201d). In addition, we have adopted a standard whereby \u201cthe petitioner must show that he was imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited; <em>i e., </em>he must show that he is actually innocent.\u201d <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1366. A petitioner may not argue the merits of his claim until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ing by demonstrating that the savings clause applies to his claim. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In this case, the district court did not err by dismissing Deglace\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. For starters, the claim that Deglace sought to raise in his \u00a7 2241 petition \u2014 that a jury should have been allowed to decide the drug quantity that triggered his mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) \u2014 could not be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition without application of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause, because it is within the scope of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Antonelli, </em>542 F.3d at 1351 n. 1. Deglace is not challenging the execution of his sentence, but he is attacking collaterally the validity of his total sentence, and this type of claim cannot be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Id. </em>at 1352. He acknowledged having filed at least one previous \u00a7 2255 motion, which was denied. Thus, his claim did not fall within \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause because it was a sentencing claim that could have been, and indeed was, raised in an earlier proceeding. <em>See Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1319; <em>United States v. Deglace, </em>353 Fed.Appx. 310, 311 (11th Cir.2009). Therefore, Deg-lace could only have raised this sentencing issue in a successive \u00a7 2255 motion upon permission from this Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b), 2255(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Moreover, Deglace cannot rely upon the <em>Wofford </em>dicta to show that the remedy available under \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention, because he was not convicted of any crime which a \u201ccircuit law-busting, retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision\u201d has made \u201cnonexistent.\u201d <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245; <em>Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1319. As for Deglace\u2019s claim that he is relying on a new rule of law that comes from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>the holding in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>was limited to a rule of statutory construction of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B)(ii). <em>See O\u2019Brien, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2180. It concerns only a narrow provision within \u00a7 924(c), and does not apply to Deglace\u2019s conviction for a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 offense. <em>See id. </em>Deglace has pointed to no case law suggesting that the holding in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>might be extended to stand for the proposition that the quantity of drugs for which a defendant is convicted is a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Finally, even assuming that Deglace had shown that <em>O\u2019Brien </em>applied to the facts of his conviction and was made retroactive, he has not shown that he was imprisoned for a nonexistent offense. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245. As applied to Deglace\u2019s case, <em>O\u2019Brien </em>would only clarify the standard necessary to prove the drug quantities that trigger the mandatory minimum sentences under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b), and would not invalidate the underlying offenses. <em>See Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1366 (explaining that a claim that merely clarifies the standard by which a defendant may be found guilty does not open the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding). Deglace does not suggest that he did not actually commit the crimes of distribution and possession with the intent to distribute cocaine, but makes only a legal argument that a jury should have been allowed to decide the quantities that were involved in those offenses. Thus, he has not raised the type of defect that can support a claim under the savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\">. In <em>Bonner v.
