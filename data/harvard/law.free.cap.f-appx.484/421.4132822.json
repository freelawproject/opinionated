Robinson claims that his detention is illegal because the federal government has failed to present \u201cofficial legal documents, such as birth records and other official docu-mentes]\u201d establishing that he is not a United States citizen. Accordingly, his lawsuit seeks immediate release and monetary damages. On appeal, Robinson contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to appoint counsel and <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing his complaint without first granting leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to appoint counsel for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Berger, </em>375 F.3d 1223, 1226 (11th Cir.2004). Appointment of counsel in a civil case is not a constitutional right, but a privilege that is justified only by exceptional circumstances. <em>Wahl v. McIver, </em>773 F.2d 1169, 1174 (11th Cir.1985). Robinson has failed to show the existence of exceptional circumstances in this case. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006), and review for an abuse of discretion a decision regarding leave to amend, <em>Troville v. Venz, </em>303 F.3d 1256, 1259 (11th Cir.2002). The standards that apply to a dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) apply to a dismissal under \u00a7 1915A. <em>See Leal v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001). A complaint may not be dismissed \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Lopez v. First Union Nat\u2019l Bank of Fla., </em>129 F.3d 1186, 1189 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). Complaints filed <em>pro se, </em>however, are \u201cheld to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Boxer X, </em>437 F.3d at 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">To state a claim under <em>Bivens, </em>a plaintiff must show that he or she was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under federal law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). Here, Robinson fails to establish that the government\u2019s alleged failure to produce his \u201cofficial documents\u201d before detaining him violated any federal right, and his demand of immediate release is not a remedy available in a <em>Bivens </em>action. <em>Abella v. Rubino, </em>63 F.3d 1063, 1066 (11th Cir.1995). The district court thus did not err in dismissing Robinson\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. Moreover, because an amendment would have been futile,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Robinson the opportunity to amend the complaint. <em>Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>367 F.3d 1255, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-12\">. The district court did not construe Robinson\u2019s complaint against the \"United States\u201d as a <em>Bivens </em>action, but we do so now because the alleged violations here constitute \"a cause of action for damages against federal officers,\u201d as opposed to a \u00a7 1983 suit against state officials. <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971); <em>Abella v. Rubino, </em>63 F.3d 1063, 1065 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-16\">. The district court purportedly dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, which provides for a preliminary review of certain civil actions brought by prisoners. We need not determine whether Robinson is a \"prisoner\u201d under \u00a7 1915A because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e), which governs proceedings <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>generally, similarly permits district courts to dismiss a case \"at any time\u201d if the complaint \"fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b445-6\">. Because claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and <em>Bivens </em>are similar, courts generally apply \u00a7 1983 law to <em>Bivens </em>cases. <em>See Abella v. Rubino, </em>63 F.3d 1063, 1065 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b445-22\">. Robinson\u2019s motion for leave to amend the complaint argues only that he would benefit from the assistance of court-appointed counsel. Robinson gives no indication of any potentially meritorious claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
