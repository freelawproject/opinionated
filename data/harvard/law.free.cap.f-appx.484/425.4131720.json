The district court dismissed Fields\u2019s petition because he had previously been denied relief on a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, and he had not demonstrated that he was entitled to pursue his claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. Fields is currently serving a life sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). A federal prisoner must ordinarily bring any collateral attacks on the validity of his conviction or sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). However, under the limited circumstances stated in \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause, a federal prisoner may file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255(e). Relief under \u00a7 2241 is only available if the prisoner can show that a \u00a7 2255 proceeding is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979) (per curiam). The statutory bar that prohibits a prisoner from filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion without prior authorization is not a sufficient ground to show that \u00a7 2255\u2019s remedy is inadequate or ineffective for the purposes of the savings clause. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">We have held that \u00a7 2255 remedies may be considered inadequate when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) that decision\u2019s holding established that the prisoner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) circuit law foreclosed the prisoner from bringing his claim at the earlier time it should have been raised \u2014 at trial, appeal, or in the first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999); <em>but see Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1319. A prisoner must establish all three prongs of this test before we will consider whether the petitioner can also establish actual innocence of the crime for which he has been convicted. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-16\">Fields argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>DePierre v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2225, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011) and <em>Carachuri-Rosen-do v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010) are retroactive and establish that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. In <em>DePierre, </em>the Supreme Court held that the term \u201ccocaine base,\u201d as used in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1), refers to not just crack cocaine, but any cocaine in its chemically basic form. 131 S.Ct. at 2227-28. In <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>the Supreme Court held \u2014 in the context of an immigration proceeding \u2014 that \u201cwhen a defendant has been convicted of a simple possession offense that has not been enhanced based on the fact of a prior conviction, he has not been \u2018convicted\u2019 under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1229b(a)(3) of a \u2018felony punishable\u2019 as such \u2018under the Controlled Substances Act,\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2).\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 2589.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Here, the indictment against Fields alleged that he distributed \u201ccocaine base\u201d and the evidence showed that Fields\u2019s offense had involved crack cocaine. Fields was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, and he received a sentence of life imprisonment because he had been convicted of two prior drug violations. Fields has not shown that <em>DePierre </em>and <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>are retroactive, nor has he demonstrated that either applies to the facts of his case to demonstrate that he was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Fields also argues that the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d) applies to him. The Supreme Court recently held that the FSA applies to those who committed acts prior to the passage of the FSA, but were sentenced following the August 3, 2010 effective date of the FSA. <em>See Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2336-37, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). However, Fields was sentenced prior to August 3, 2010, and thus the FSA does not retroactively apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">Because Fields has failed to demonstrate that he meets the criteria of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), he cannot proceed with his claims under a \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
