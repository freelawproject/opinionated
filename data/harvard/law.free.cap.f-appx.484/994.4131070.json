Lloyd then unsuccessfully challenged the Commissioner\u2019s decision in federal district court. For the following reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-17\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-18\">David Lloyd visited William H. Morrison, M.D., on March 29, 2006 after noticing blood in his urine and experiencing lower back pain. During this visit, Lloyd, who at the time was 48 years old, requested an appointment to see a cardiologist. After conducting a physical examination, Dr. Morrison prescribed Cipro and set up an appointment with Assad Mouhaffel, M.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>Dr. Mouhaffel examined Lloyd on May 1, 2006, and noted that Lloyd complained of chest pain, shortness of breath, easy fatigability, and nausea. Later that week, Dr. Mouhaffel conducted a nuclear stress test. According to Dr. Mouhaffel\u2019s notes, the result of Lloyd\u2019s stress test was abnormal, and Lloyd was diagnosed with a ventricular septal defect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Approximately two months later, on July 5, 2006, Lloyd filed an application for disability insurance benefits. In his application, Lloyd stated that he had been unable to work \u201cbecause of his disabling condition\u201d since November 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">On August 24, 2006, consultative examiner Ken Barrick, M.D., examined Lloyd. In his report, Dr. Barrick acknowledged Lloyd\u2019s congenital heart condition; indicated that Lloyd was complaining of daily chest pain, shortness of breath, and numbness in both arms and both legs; and noted that Lloyd claimed to have had a heart attack in 2000. In concluding his report, Dr. Barrick observed that, although Lloyd complained of functional problems due to his heart condition, there were \u201cno clinical exam findings to support [his] claim.\u201d Additionally, Dr. Barrick questioned Lloyd\u2019s assertion that he had experienced a heart attack on the grounds that no medical documentation supported Lloyd\u2019s assertion. Dr. Barrick concluded that despite Lloyd\u2019s complaints, he believed that Lloyd should have been \u201cable to sit, walk, and/or stand for a full workday with adequate rest breaks, lift/carry objects of at least 20 pounds, hold a conversation, respond appropriately to questions, [and] carry out and remember instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">The following month, Susan Snell, a medical consultant, completed a Physical Residual Functional Capacity Assessment in connection with Lloyd\u2019s application for disability benefits. In this assessment, Snell indicated that Lloyd could occasionally lift 50 pounds, frequently lift 25 pounds, and stand or walk with normal breaks for a total of about 8 hours in an 8-hour workday. Despite the evidence in Lloyd\u2019s file revealing a minor heart abnormality and atypical chest pain, Snell concluded that the evidence before her did not establish that Lloyd\u2019s physical restrictions were as serious as Lloyd described them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">Lloyd was admitted to the hospital on April 15, 2007 after complaining of chest pain. In his discharge report, Lloyd\u2019s physician, Dr. Mouhaffel, noted that he had previously seen Lloyd. This report also indicated that Lloyd\u2019s chest pain \u201cha[d] resolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">At the end of the ensuing month, Dr. Mouhaffel filled out a Residual Functional Capacity Questionnaire that was sent to him. In this form, which was submitted in May 2007, Dr. Mouhaffel restated his previous VSD diagnosis, and noted that Lloyd experienced fatigue, nausea, weakness, and had difficulties remembering. He also opined that Lloyd needed to shift positions at will from sitting, standing, or walking; take unscheduled rest periods during the day; and elevate his legs with prolonged sitting. Dr. Mouhaffel also indicated that Lloyd could only rarely lift 20 pounds, climb ladders, or go up stairs. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>to this form, Dr. Mouhaffel estimated that, on average, Lloyd would be ill about four days a month as a result of his ailments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">After his application was initially denied, Lloyd requested a hearing before an administrative law judge. His request for a hearing was granted, and Lloyd received his hearing on August 4, 2008. During this hearing, Lloyd testified about his physical limitations, the consequences of physical overexertion, and the blackouts he experienced. His wife also provided testimony regarding the blackouts. Two months after the hearing, the administrative law judge issued a written decision denying Lloyd\u2019s application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">Lloyd subsequently appealed the denial of benefits to the Appeals Council. On April 24, 2009, the Appeals Council vacated the hearing decision and remanded Lloyd\u2019s case back to an administrative law judge for clarification of the relationship between Dr. Mouhaffel\u2019s May 2006 treatment notes and his responses to the May 2007 Residual Functional Capacity Questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">In response to the remand order, the Social Security Administration sent Dr. Mouhaffel a letter requesting that he provide a \u201c[mjedical records update.\u201d Dr. Mouhaffel replied to this request in July 2009 by completing a Social Security Administration form entitled \u201cMedical Source Statement of Ability To Do Work-Related Activities (Physical).\u201d On the first page of this form, Dr. Mouhaffel provided a handwritten notation indicating that Lloyd had not been to his office since December 2007, and stating that his responses to the form were based on the information available to him in December 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">In this form, Dr. Mouhaffel indicated that Lloyd could continuously lift and carry 20 pounds; sit, stand, and walk without interruption for four hours; and frequently perform various postural activities, such as climbing stairs, crouching, and crawling. Dr. Mouhaffel also opined that Lloyd could perform activities like shopping, walking at a reasonable pace on rough or uneven surfaces, and using public transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">The month after Dr. Mouhaffel completed this form, Lloyd was treated in the emergency room for complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. After being admitted, Lloyd was stabilized on medications and released on August 18, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">An administrative law judge conducted a second hearing in connection with Lloyd\u2019s application on September 10, 2009. At this hearing, Lloyd testified about his past work experience, his various physical ailments, and why those ailments prevented him from working. Along with testimony from Lloyd\u2019s wife, the administrative law judge also heard testimony from Charles Smith, a vocational expert, who provided responses to various hypothetical that explored the boundaries of the type of work Lloyd could perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">In November 2009, the administrative law judge issued a written decision in which he concluded that Lloyd was disabled beginning on August 1, 2009. In arriving at this conclusion, the administrative law judge rejected Lloyd\u2019s assertion that he was disabled beginning on November 1, 2005. Notably, the administrative law judge determined that prior to August 1, 2009, Lloyd had the residual functional capacity to perform certain \u201clight work,\u201d as the term is defined by the applicable regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-15\">To support this determination, the administrative law judge referenced various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>portions of the testimony Lloyd provided, along with the medical documentation in the record. After reviewing the documentation, the administrative law judge opined that \u201cany possible previous inconsistencies in the medical records\u201d were resolved by the post-remand \u201cMedical Source Statement\u201d form Dr. Mouhaffel filled out in July 2009. In addition, the administrative law judge stated that the July 2009 form was not only more consistent with Dr. Mouhaffel\u2019s own records, \u201cwhich had failed to reflect any limitations\u201d prior to the May 2007 Residual Functional Capacity Questionnaire, but was also in greater harmony with the reports provided by Dr. Barrick and Susan Snell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">In short, the administrative law judge concluded that his determination that Lloyd could perform certain light work prior to August 1, 2009 was supported by the medical documentation contained in the record. It was on this basis that he ruled that Lloyd was not disabled from his alleged onset date of November 1, 2005 through August 1, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Lloyd subsequently sought review of this ruling in federal court. On December 7, 2011, a magistrate judge recommended that the administrative law judge\u2019s decision be affirmed. The following month, the district court concluded that the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation was correct, affirmed the administrative law judge\u2019s decision, and dismissed Lloyd\u2019s suit. Lloyd now appeals the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">\u201cIn reviewing the Commissioner\u2019s determination, we consider only whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standards and whether substantial evidence in the record supports the decision to deny benefits.\u201d <em>Audler v. Astrue, </em>501 F.3d 446, 447 (5th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). When conducting this review, \u201c[w]e may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cConflicts in the evidence are for the [Commissioner] and not the courts to resolve.\u201d <em>Brown v. Apfel, </em>192 F.3d 492, 496 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">On appeal, Lloyd contends that there is \u201cno substantial evidence\u201d to support the adverse portion of the administrative law judge\u2019s decision. Before addressing this contention, we will first lay out the applicable legal framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">\u201cThe Social Security Act provides for the payment of insurance benefits to persons who have contributed to the program and who suffer from a physical or mental disability.\u201d <em>Loza v. Apfel, </em>219 F.3d 378, 390 (5th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). The Commissioner applies a five-step sequential evaluation process for deciding whether an individual is disabled. \u201cThe first two steps involve threshold determinations that the claimant is not presently engaged in substantial gainful activity and has an impairment or combination of impairments which significantly limits his physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 404.1520(b)-(c), 416.920, 416.920(b)-(c)). \u201cIn the third step, the medical evidence of the claimant\u2019s impairment(s) is compared to a list of impairments presumed severe enough to preclude any gainful activity.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number><em>Id. </em>(citing 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, App. 1 (pt. A) (1999)). \u201cIf the claimant\u2019s impairment matches or is equal to one of the listed impairments, he qualifies for benefits without further inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(d), 416.920(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\">If the person cannot qualify under the listings, the evaluation proceeds to the fourth and fifth steps. Under the fourth step, the Commissioner must consider whether \u201cthe impairment prevents the claimant from doing past relevant work.\u201d <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 453 (5th Cir.2000) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520). \u201cThe claimant bears the burden of proof on the first four steps and the burden shifts to the Commissioner for the fifth step.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">For the fifth step, \u201cthe Commissioner must show that the claimant is capable of engaging in some type of alternative work that exists in the national economy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Chaparro v. Bowen, </em>815 F.2d 1008, 1010 (5th Cir.1987)). \u201cOnce the Commissioner makes this showing, the burden of proof shifts back to the claimant to rebut this finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">Here, Lloyd challenges the administrative law judge\u2019s conclusion at step five of this analysis. According to him, the administrative law judge\u2019s finding at step five was impermissibly based on the post-remand \u201cMedical Source Statement\u201d form Dr. Mouhaffel filled out in July 2009. This form, he argues, has \u201cseveral defects,\u201d such as conflicting with Dr. Mouhaffel\u2019s May 2007 report and being made without examining Lloyd, which undermine its reliability and credibility. Given these alleged defects, Lloyd maintains that the administrative law judge\u2019s reliance on this report was improper. Without this report, Lloyd asserts that there is \u201cno substantial evidence\u201d in the record to support the administrative law judge\u2019s finding at step 5 that Lloyd could perform certain light work prior to August 1, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-12\">We reject Lloyd\u2019s assertion. In conducting our review, we grant great deference to the administrative law judge\u2019s decision and can only disturb his determination if we cannot find substantial evidence in the record to support his decision, or if we conclude that he made an error of law. <em>Leggett v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir.1995). Contrary to what Lloyd contends, the administrative law judge\u2019s decision with respect to step 5 of the applicable analysis is supported by substantial evidence. Dr. Mouhaffel\u2019s July 2009 report, combined with the reports provided by Dr. Barrick and Susan Snell, provide a basis for a reasonable mind to conclude that Lloyd was able to perform certain light work prior to August 1, 2009.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are therefore unable to unsettle the administrative law judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-13\">At its core, Lloyd\u2019s appeal asks us to place the content of Dr. Mouhaffel\u2019s May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>2007 report above the rest of the administrative record. Doing so, however, would be tantamount to resolving a conflict in the evidence in his favor. Our case law makes clear that we are unable to satisfy Lloyd\u2019s request. <em>See Brown, </em>192 F.3d at 496 (noting that conflicts in the evidence are for the Commissioner, and not the courts, to resolve).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1017-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
