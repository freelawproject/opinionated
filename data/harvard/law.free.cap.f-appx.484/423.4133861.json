The district court denied his motion because his revised sentencing range remained 240 months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to the mandatory minimum in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b), even though he was sentenced below that minimum due to his substantial assistance. On appeal, Randolph argues that he was entitled to a reduction in his sentence because Congress intended for the amended statutory minimum penalties under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010) (\u201cFSA\u201d), to apply retroactively. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to not to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, \u201c[wjhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Specifically, a reduction in a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where a retroactively-applicable amendment does not lower the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range due to the operation of another statutory provision, such as a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.l). This applies even when the defendant was originally sentenced below the statutory minimum due to the government\u2019s filing of a substantial-assistance motion, because a district court\u2019s downward departure does not \u201celiminate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>otherwise applicable mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1340-41 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In this case, Randolph was not eligible for a reduced sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 750 did not alter his guideline range. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. As the record shows, Randolph\u2019s guideline range was dictated by the 20-year statutory minimum sentence for his offense, rather than by his offense level under the Guidelines. The fact that Randolph was sentenced below his statutory minimum is irrelevant, since the sentencing court\u2019s downward departure did not eliminate the otherwise-applicable mandatory minimum. <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1340-41. And although the district court in 2008 granted Randolph\u2019s prior unopposed \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and reduced his sentence pursuant to Amendment 706 (despite the fact that the prior reduction similarly would have been precluded by the reasoning in <em>Moore </em>and Williams), this fact alone does not prevent the government from opposing a further reduction under Amendment 750. Finally, Randolph\u2019s arguments concerning the retroactive application of the FSA\u2019s amended mandatory-minimum penalties are outside the scope of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), since \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides relief only when a defendant\u2019s sentence is based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, not by a statutory amendment enacted by Congress. In short, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Randolph\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
