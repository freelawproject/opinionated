Pack objected in the district court to a proposed settlement of a nationwide class action that alleged misleading and deceptive trade practices by Defendant Mead Johnson &amp; Johnson Company (\u201cMead Johnson\u201d). The district court overruled Pack\u2019s objections and approved the settlement, and Pack appeals. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">To understand the objections, we set forth the history of the class action and the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">A. Initial Class Action</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">In 2009, Plaintiff Allison Nelson filed a putative class action against Mead Johnson asserting that it falsely represented that its Enfamil LIPIL was the only baby formula containing two fatty acids that promote brain and eye development in infants. Mead Johnson filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">After discovery, Nelson moved for class certification. In 2010, following a hearing, the district court granted the motion and certified a class of all Florida consumers who purchased Enfamil LIPIL within the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">The parties mediated several times before a court-appointed mediator. On February 7, 2011, the parties notified the district court that they (1) had executed a memorandum of understanding to resolve the dispute on a nationwide class basis; (2) were preparing a stipulation of settlement; and (3) were continuing to mediate to memorialize formally the settlement terms. The parties noted that the settlement included several other cases filed around the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-17\">B. Consolidation of Multidistrict Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b453-18\">On February 9, 2011, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred, to the Southern District of Florida, five other Enfamil class actions, which were consolidated with Nelson\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-19\">On March 15, 2011, with Defendant Mead Johnson\u2019s consent, Plaintiff Nelson filed an amended class action complaint that established a nationwide class action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>and asserted claims under various states\u2019 laws. That same day, Nelson and Mead Johnson jointly moved for (1) conditional class certification, (2) conditional designation of Nelson as class representative, (3) appointment of Nelson\u2019s counsel as lead counsel for the class, (4) preliminary approval of the terms of the parties\u2019 proposed settlement, (5) approval of the forms and methods for providing notice to class members, and (6) scheduling of a final hearing to approve the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">C. Settlement Terms</p>\n<p id=\"ANb\">In the settlement agreement, Mead Johnson consented to certification of a nationwide class action for purposes of settlement. In exchange for dismissal of each class member\u2019s claims, Mead Johnson agreed to provide these benefits. Class members who purchased Enfamil LIPIL for six months or less would receive, at their option, either $6.00 in cash or one 12.5-ounce container of \u201cMead Johnson Product.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Class members who purchased Enfamil LIPIL for more than six months would receive, at their option, either $12.00 in cash or two 12.5-ounce containers of \u201cMead Johnson Product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The agreement caps the class payout at $12 million, as follows: \u201cIf the aggregate value of Mead Johnson Product (valued at retail) and cash actually claimed exceeds $12 million, then claims will be reduced pro <em>rata, </em>but in no event will those seeking Mead Johnson Product receive less than one 8-ounce container of Mead Johnson Product if falling within the six months or less category or two 8-ounce containers of Mead Johnson Product if falling within the greater than six months category.\u201d The agreement also sets a minimum class payout of $8 million, as follows: \u201cIf the aggregate value of the Product (valued at retail) and the cash awards actually paid are less than $8 million, then the remainder shall be paid in Mead Johnson Products to appropriate charities to be agreed upon by Class Counsel and Defendant, and approved by the Court, pursuant to the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The settlement agreement provides that: (1) Mead Johnson will pay all the costs of class notice and claim administration; (2) attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses \u201cwill be in addition to the other consideration to Plaintiff and the Class Members\u201d; (3) class counsel will apply to the court for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses\u2019; and (4) Mead Johnson will pay attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cin an amount not to exceed $3.5 million\u201d and expenses not to exceed $140,000.00, for total fees and expenses not to exceed $3.64 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">The settlement agreement also provides for \u201cPlaintiff Incentive Awards,\u201d which are \u201cin addition to the other consideration to Plaintiff and the Class Members.\u201d Plaintiff Nelson will receive an incentive award of $10,000.00, four named plaintiffs in the consolidated actions will each receive $2,500.00, and the remaining named plaintiffs in the consolidated actions will each receive $1,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">On March 18, 2011, following a hearing, the district court preliminarily approved the settlement and conditionally certified a settlement class of \u201c[a]ll purchasers of En-famil LIPIL infant formula in the United States between October 13, 2005, through and including March 31, 2010.\u201d The dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>trict court set an August 22, 2011 deadline for class members to object and set a final approval hearing for September 2011. The district court appointed Plaintiff Nelson as class representative, appointed class counsel, approved the form and method of class notice, and directed the claims administrator to publish the class notice and administer the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">D.Objections and Final Approval Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Appellant Sandra Pack and ten other claimants filed timely written objections to the proposed class action settlement. At a September 26, 2011 fairness hearing, counsel for Appellant Pack appeared and reiterated her written objections. At the end of the fairness hearing, the district court overruled all of the objections and approved the settlement, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">The Court has reviewed the stipulation of settlement, the objections that were filed, the arguments of counsel here this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">In addition, the Court has considered the six relevant factors set forth in <em>[Bennett v. Behring Corp., </em>737 F.2d 982, 986 (11th Cir.1984) ]. And the Court finds that the settlement achieved in this mul-tidistrict litigation case is fair, reasonable, and adequate and is not the product of collusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">The Court respectfully overrules each of the objections raised by each of the objectors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-11\">There is a strong judicial policy favoring settlement as a realization that compromise is the essence of settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-12\">Counsel for all parties appear to have performed them duties diligently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-14\">The parties\u2019 extensive submissions are highly detailed and demonstrate why the settlement is fair and reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">E. Final Approval Order</p>\n<p id=\"b455-16\">On November 14, 2011, the district court approved the settlement and dismissed the class members\u2019 claims with prejudice. In its order, the district court found that (1) Plaintiff Nelson \u201cinitiated the Action, acted to protect the Class, and assisted her counsel\u201d; (2) \u201c[t]he efforts of Class Counsel have produced the Stipulation entered into in good faith, ... which provides a fair, reasonable, adequate and certain result for the Class\u201d; and (3) class counsel\u2019s application for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs is \u201cfair, reasonable, and justified under the circumstances.\u201d The district court awarded class counsel $3.5 million in attorneys\u2019 fees and $140,000.00 in costs and awarded the plaintiffs the above incentive payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-17\">F. Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b455-18\">Pack appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both Plaintiff Nelson and Defendant Mead Johnson then moved the district court to require Appellant Pack to post a bond pending appeal. Plaintiff Nelson argued that counsel for Appellant Pack was a \u201cprofessional objector\u201d who was \u201cattempting to extort money from the parties in exchange for a dismissal of [her] appeal[ ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-19\">The district court imposed an appeal bond of $1,000.00. Notably, the district court found little merit to the appeal and found significant evidence of bad faith on the part of Appellant Pack. The district court noted that Pack\u2019s counsel offered to withdraw her appeal for $150,000.00, suggesting that her \u201cobjections are tied to her ability to garner a windfall for herself rather than ensuring an adequate settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>ment for the class.\u201d The district court described further evidence of bad faith, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">[T]he Court agrees that there is evidence of bad faith on the part of Pack. Pack is represented by her brother\u2019s law firm. When questioned regarding whether she had a retention agreement with her brother\u2019s law firm, Pack stated that she did not sign a retainer agreement with the firm. Pack also admitted that she had never read any documents concerning this litigation. Given Pack\u2019s close familial relationship with one of the attorneys representing her, the Court finds Pack\u2019s lack of knowledge about her own case worrisome and evidence of her lack of good faith.... Finally, the Court agrees with the parties that the representation of three previous objectors by [Pack\u2019s counsel] weighs in favor of requiring an appeal bond in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">On appeal, Pack argues that the district court abused its discretion by approving the class action settlement. We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s approval of a class action settlement agreement. <em>Leverso v. SouthTrust Bank of Ala., </em>18 F.3d 1527, 1531 (11th Cir.1994). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) provides no standards for such approval. Nevertheless, before approving a settlement, the district court must find that it \u201cis fair, adequate and reasonable and is not the product of collusion between the parties.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Behring Corp., </em>737 F.2d 982, 986 (11th Cir.1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[O]ur judgment is informed by the strong judicial policy favoring settlement as well as by the realization that compromise is the essence of settlement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">In determining whether the class action settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, the district court considers these factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">(1) the likelihood of success at trial; (2) the range of possible recovery; (3) the point on or below the range of possible recovery at which a settlement is fair, adequate and reasonable; (4) the complexity, expense and duration of litigation; (5) the substance and amount of opposition to the settlement; and (6) the stage of proceedings at which the settlement was achieved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-10\"><em>Id. </em>In considering the settlement, the district court may rely upon the judgment of experienced counsel for the parties. <em>Cotton v. Hinton, </em>559 F.2d 1326, 1330 (5th Cir.1977).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Absent fraud, collusion, or the like, the district court \u201cshould be hesitant to substitute its own judgment for that of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court should examine the settlement in light of the objections, and provide a reasoned response to those objections. <em>Id. </em>at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion by approving the settlement agreement as fair, adequate, and reasonable. The record shows that the district court properly considered the pertinent factors, explained its findings, and addressed Pack\u2019s objections. Although Pack argues that the district court failed to \u201cprovide its reasoning for overruling the objections,\u201d the district court gave Pack the opportunity to argue her objections at the hearing, and the district court explained why those objections were without merit. Specifically, Pack\u2019s objections to the inadequacy of the settlement consideration and the allocation of the settlement proceeds were conclusory and failed to account for other pertinent considerations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>including the plaintiffs\u2019 risk of losing at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in overruling Pack\u2019s objection to the potential <em>cy pres </em>distribution. Although Pack argued that <em>cy pres </em>was inappropriate unless all class members were fully compensated, Pack made no attempt to show what \u201cfull compensation\u201d to each class member would include. In any event, the settlement provides for the <em>cy pres </em>distribution only if the total amount claimed is less than $8 million. And, because the settlement provides for <em>pro rata </em>reduction in claims only if the total amount of claims exceeds $12 million, each class member will receive the \u201cfull compensation\u201d provided by the settlement before a <em>cy pres </em>distribution occurs. The <em>cy pres </em>distribution was a permissible method to distribute unclaimed settlement funds. <em>See In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., </em>588 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir.2009) (\u201c[CJourts are not in disagreement that cy pres distributions are proper in connection with a class settlement, subject to court approval of the particular application of the funds.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Nelson v. Greater Gadsden Hous. Auth., </em>802 F.2d 405, 409 (11th Cir.1986) (in class action involving utility allowances to tenants in a public-housing complex, affirming district court order providing that the defendant use any unclaimed compensatory damages to increase the energy efficiency of the apartment units at the complex).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion by approving the attorneys\u2019 fee provisions. Pack\u2019s argument that the notice of the fees was inadequate is belied by the fact that several class members, including Pack, responded to the class notice by submitting written objections to the attorneys\u2019 fee provisions in advance of the final approval hearing. Additionally, Pack\u2019s argument that the attorneys\u2019 fee provisions \u201cbear[] indicia of collusion\u201d is wholly unfounded. The settlement agreement was the result of extensive arms-length negotiations moderated by a court-appointed mediator. Pack\u2019s objection to the amount of the fee is likewise without merit. The $3.64 million fee award is approximately 25% of the \u201ccommon fund,\u201d and \u201cwell-settled law from this court [states] that 25% is generally recognized as a reasonable fee award in common fund cases.\u201d <em>Faught v. Am. Home Shield Corp., </em>668 F.3d 1233, 1243 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-6\">. The settlement agreement defines \"Mead Johnson Product(s)\u201d as \u201cone or more Mead Johnson infant formulas and toddler food products. The products will be either in liquid form or in powdered form for preparation and consumption in liquid form and are not solid foods.\u201d The \"Settlement Benefits\u201d section of the agreement states, \"The Mead Johnson Product to be provided shall be Mead Johnson Enfamil Premium Infant. Class Members can submit only one claim per household.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b455-13\">.
