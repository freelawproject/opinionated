In November 2011, Player moved the District Court to reduce his sentences on Counts 1 and 2 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Amendment 750, made retroactively applicable effective November 1, 2011, by Amendment 759, made permanent the temporary emergency Amendment 748, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amend. <em>and </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 759. As a result of these amendments, \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) now assigns a base offense level of 20 in cases involving at least 11.2.grams but less than 16.8 grams of crack cocaine. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(10) (2011). This represented a decrease of six levels from the offense levels the District Court used in calculating the sentence range for Player sentences on Counts 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">The District Court denied Player\u2019s motion in December 2011. The court concluded that the concurrent sentences on Counts 1 and 2 had already expired; thus, he was serving the consecutive Count 3 sentence. The court also concluded that he was not eligible for a sentence reduction because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. 3 provided that the term of imprisonment could not be reduced below the time served.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Given these conclusions, the court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>determine whether, in the exereise of its discretion, it should grant Player \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Player, appealing <em>pro se, </em>now appeals, arguing that the District Court improperly concluded that his crack cocaine sentences had already expired and that resentencing him within the new Guidelines sentence range would not have resulted in a sentence lower than the time he had already served. The Government concedes that the district court erred by denying Player\u2019s motion on the basis that he had already finished serving his crack cocaine sentences, and that its judgment denying Player\u2019s motion should be vacated and the case remanded for consideration of the merits of Player\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Section 924 of Title 18 in the U.S.Code provides that a person convicted of using, carrying, or possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime must be sentenced to a mandatory minimum of five years, or 60 months, of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i). That statute also states that \u201cno term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection [\u00a7 924(c) ] shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed ... including any term of imprisonment imposed for the ... drug trafficking crime during which the firearm was ... possessed.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (1) (D) (ii). The statute does not specify in what order the various sentences should run, but the legislative history to the addition of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(D) provides that \u201cthe Committee intends that the mandatory sentence under the revised subsection 924(e) be served <em>prior to the start of </em>the sentence for the underlying or any other offense.\u201d S.Rep. No. 98-225, at 313-14 (1984), <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3492 (emphasis added). Moreover, in <em>Jackson v. United States, </em>976 F.2d 679 (11th Cir.1992), we held, in a habeas context, that a mandatory consecutive sentence for possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime under \u00a7 924(c) must be served <em>before </em>any other sentence for the underlying offense. <em>Id. </em>at 682. The defendant in <em>Jackson </em>was convicted of armed robbery and using a firearm pursuant to \u00a7 924(c), and because the armed robbery sentence was parolable, the order in which the sentences were served could affect the total amount of time ultimately served. <em>See id. </em>We noted that, although the statute did not specify which sentence should run first, the legislative history discussed above indicated that the \u00a7 924(c) sentence should be served before any other sentence. <em>Id. </em>(citing S.Rep. No. 98-225, at 313 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The District Court abused its discretion by denying Player\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on the basis that he had already completed his sentences on Counts 1 and 2, because <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>reasoning remains valid in this circuit. Under <em>Jackson, </em>Player has served his Count 2 sentence. Therefore, when he filed his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in November 2011, he had served approximately three years of the concurrent sentences on Counts 1 and 2. Given this circumstance, we must vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand the case so that the District Court may determine whether a discretionary reduction of the sentences on Counts 1 and 2 pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\">. The court nonetheless did find that after applying Amendment 750 and the three-level reduction of Player\u2019s offense level for acceptance of responsibility, Player's new offense level would be 17 and his Guidelines sentence range would be 60 to 63 months' imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
