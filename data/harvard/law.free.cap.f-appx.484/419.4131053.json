At sentencing, the District Court, based on the presentence investigation report prepared by the court\u2019s probation office,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> determined that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 provided a base offense level of 32 for Gibson\u2019s offense, since the offense involved at least 50 grams but less than 150 grams of crack.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gibson had at least two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or a controlled-substanee offense, so the court designated him a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 with a criminal history category of VI. The statutory maximum penalty for the offense was life imprisonment; the court consequently increased Gibson\u2019s base offense level to 37. That offense level was reduced by three levels to level 34 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 to reflect Gibson\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. The offense level of 34 and criminal history category of VI then yielded a sentence range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The Government moved the District Court for a downward departure from that range pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 to give Gibson credit for the substantial assistance he had provided the Government in several investigations. The court granted the motion and sentenced Gibson to prison for a term of 156 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In February 2008, Gibson moved the District Court to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), basing his motion on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced by two levels most of the base offense levels in the drug quantity table for offenses involving crack. The Government opposed the motion on motion on the ground that Amendment 706 did not apply because Gibson had been sentenced as a career offender and Amendment 706 did not lower his offense level since that level was controlled by the career offender guideline, \u00a7 4B1.1, not the offense guideline, \u00a7 2D1.1. The District Court agreed and denied the motion. Gibson appealed, and this court affirmed. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>No. 08-12293 (January 7, 2009) (not published). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), controlled our decision. As in <em>Moore, </em>\u201cGibson\u2019s guideline range was determined by application of the career offender guideline and the crack cocaine base offense level played no ultimate role in his sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">In December 2011, Gibson again moved the District Court for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He based his motion on the retroactive application of Amendment 750 to the Guidelines, which took effect on November 1, 2011. The Amendment altered the drug quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) by increasing the quantity of crack required to trigger each base offense level in order to conform the levels to the statutory changes to the mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment created by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 23272. The District Court denied the motion, holding, as it did in denying Gibson\u2019s previous motion for sentence reduction, that Gibson was not eligible for a sentence reduction because he was sentenced as a career offender. Gibson now appeals the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">We are bound by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Moore </em>\u201cunless and until it is overruled by this [C]ourt en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>342 F.3d 1245, 1246 (11th Cir.2003). Where a retroactively applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based, the District Court is not authorized to grant a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. This includes the situation in which a retroactive amendment to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) would result in a lower base offense level, but the defendant was sentenced as a career offender. <em>See id. </em>at 1326-30 (holding that a defendant whose original sentence was based upon the career-offender guideline, and not \u00a7 2D1.1, could not receive a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 because it did not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range). Furthermore, we held in <em>Moore </em>that a defendant\u2019s receipt of a sentence below the Guidelines sentence range pursuant to the Government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, as was the case here, did not mean that the defendant had not been sentenced based on his status as a career offender. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\">.
