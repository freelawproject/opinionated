Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s decision is \u201cconclusive unless manifestly contrary to law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The BIA\u2019s ruling will stand \u201cso long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 304 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">Martell-Garcia has not established that the BIA abused its discretion. His argument that the motion to reopen was timely rests on his assertion that he filed the motion in March 2010 while his pro se motion for reconsideration was pending. The BIA, however, determined that its records contained \u201cno indication\u201d that it received the motion at that time, and the record before us is devoid of evidence supporting Martell-Garcia\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">Moreover, even if Martell-Garcia had filed the motion to reopen in March 2010 as he alleged, it is still untimely. It was well beyond the 90-day window for filing a motion to reopen the BIA\u2019s October 14, 2009, decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). Though Martell-Gar-cia relies on <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448 (5th Cir.2001), to support his argument that the BIA should have construed the motion to reopen as an amendment to his pending motion to reconsider, that case is inapposite. There, we suggested that in certain circumstances, a subsequent motion to reopen may be construed as an amendment to a pending motion to reopen. <em>Wang, </em>260 F.3d at 452. However, a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider are distinct motions with different purposes and filing requirements. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B),(C), (7)(B), (C)(i); <em>Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219 n. 3 (5th Cir.2008). Indeed, where a motion to reconsider was pending and an alien filed a \u201csupplemental\u201d submission seeking to reopen proceedings raising a new claim for relief, we have determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in characterizing the supplement as a separate motion to reopen. <em>Lara v. Tromin-ski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 499 n. 13 (5th Cir.2000). Likewise, the BIA did not abuse its discretion here in declining to construe the motion to reopen, which sought to raise a new claim for relief, as an amendment to the pending motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Martell-Garcia also argues that the time for filing the motion to reopen should be equitably tolled on the basis that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance and that he is eligible for adjustment of status. These arguments amount to contentions that the BIA should have exercised its discretion to reopen the removal proceedings sua sponte. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla, </em>543 F.3d at 220. We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision to decline to do so. <em>See id. </em>at 219-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Accordingly, Martell-Garcia\u2019s petition for review is DENIED IN PART and DISMISSED IN PART for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b914-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
