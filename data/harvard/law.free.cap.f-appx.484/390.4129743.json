In his petition for review, Zam-brano Diaz argues that: (1) the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility determination was not supported by the weight of the evidence; (2) he demonstrated that he and Fabiola suffered persecution in Venezuela on account of their political opinions and that they feared that they would be persecuted in the future if they were removed from the United States; and (3) his showing of persecution also qualifies him for withholding of removal, and he has also shown that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be tortured at the hands of the Venezuelan government, he qualifies for CAT relief. After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-17\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, because the BIA issued its own decision but adopted much of the IJ\u2019s reasoning with respect to the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility determination, we review both opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>We review factual determinations, which include credibility determinations, under the substantial-evidence test. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2006). We must affirm such determinations if they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We will view \u201cthe record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1255 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">First, we are unpersuaded by Zambrano Diaz\u2019s claim that the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility determination was not supported by the weight of the evidence. An applicant for asylum must meet the INA\u2019s definition of a refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). The definition of \u201crefugee\u201d includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Thus, to meet the definition of a refugee, the applicant must, \u201cwith specific and credible evidence, demonstrate (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">An applicant\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain his burden of proof, without corroborating evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1255. Conversely, if the applicant relies solely on his testimony, an adverse-credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an application. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cIf, however, the applicant produces other evidence of persecution, whatever form it may take, the IJ must consider that evidence, and it is not sufficient for the IJ to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">When the IJ enters an adverse-credibility finding, the applicant must demonstrate that the decision was not supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255. If the IJ enumerates inconsistencies between the asylum application, hearing testimony, and documentary evidence, and the inconsistencies are supported by the record, we will not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ with respect to credibility findings. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">In this case, the IJ\u2019S and BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, including discrepancies regarding (1) the extent of the injuries Fabiola received at an anti-government protest in 2003 and the treatment she received for them, (2) the number and frequency of the threatening phone calls Zambrano Diaz received, and (3) the alleged kidnaping of Zambrano Diaz\u2019s father-in-law. Even if Zambrano Diaz\u2019s explanation of nervousness and the passage of time as the cause of the inconsistencies in the record was reasonable, this explanation does not compel a reversal of the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility finding. <em>See Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (stating that \u201cthe mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings\u201d). Where, as here, the IJ makes a detailed credibility determination based on enumerated inconsistencies that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>supported by the record, we \u201cwill not substitute our judgment\u201d and overturn the IJ\u2019s findings. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Next, we reject Zambrano Diaz\u2019s argument that he and Fabiola suffered persecution in Venezuela on account of their political opinions and that they feared that they would be persecuted in the future if they were removed from the United States. To establish asylum eligibility based on political opinion, an applicant carries the burden of proving, with credible evidence, either that he suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion, or that he has a well-founded fear that he will be persecuted in the future due to his political opinion. <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007). Persecution \u201cis an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations and alteration omitted). In determining whether an alien has suffered past persecution, the factfinder must consider the cumulative effect of any alleged incidents found to be credible. <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861 &amp; n. 5 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The applicant\u2019s fear of persecution must be \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. The subjective component is generally satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he genuinely fears persecution, and in most cases, the objective prong can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he has a good reason to fear future persecution. <em>Id. </em>The applicant must also show a nexus between a statutorily protected ground and the feared persecution, and he can do so by presenting specific facts showing a good reason to fear that he will be \u201csingled out\u201d on account of the statutorily protected factor. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction to consider Zambrano Diaz\u2019s claims regarding the likelihood of future persecution due to (1) the presence of the names of he and his wife on the \u201cTasc\u00f3n List,\u201d (2) the recent closure by President Hugo Chavez of the Venezuelan consulate, and (3) the birth of his U.S. citizen child. Zabrano Diaz failed to raise these arguments before the BIA, and, thus, they are unexhausted. <em>See Amayar-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that we lack jurisdiction to consider a claim not raised before the BIA, even when the BIA <em>sua sponte </em>considers the claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Moreover, contrary to Zambrano Diaz\u2019s argument, the IJ did explain why the October, 2004, kidnaping of Zambrano Diaz and Fabiola did not rise to the level of persecution, and the record does not compel a contrary determination. The IJ explicitly considered the fact that they were only detained for several hours, were not physically harmed, and were released when the kidnappers determined that they had no useful information related to the elections. Nor does the record compel the finding that this incident was \u201cextreme.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1171, 1174 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Ka-zemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1353 (11th Cir.2009). The IJ was not required to consider the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of all of the alleged incidents of persecution because the IJ specifically found these incidents to be unsupported by credible evidence. <em>Delgado, </em>487 F.3d at 861 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">In addition, Zambrano Diaz failed to demonstrate, with \u201cspecific and credible evidence,\u201d that he had a well-founded fear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>of future persecution. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257. The October, 2004, kidnaping of Zambrano Diaz and Fabiola coincided with the gubernatorial elections, and the kidnappers only sought information from Fa-biola about those elections. Zambrano Diaz and Fabiola left Venezuela shortly after this incident, and there was no indication that the government or the Bolivari-an Circles sought to persecute either of them once the election had concluded and the results were announced. Although Zambrano Diaz testified at the merits hearing that the political situation in Venezuela had worsened since he left in 2004, he did not point to any evidence in the record that supported this assertion. Nor did he or Fabiola testify that they had remained politically active in the time since they had left Venezuela, or that there was any reason why they would be specifically targeted for persecution in light of the length of time that had elapsed since they left the country. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286 (requiring an asylum applicant to demonstrate a probability that he will be \u201csingled out\u201d for persecution on account of a statutorily protected factor). Accordingly, he failed to demonstrate that he has a fear of persecution that is both \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable,\u201d and, therefore, failed to establish his statutory eligibility for asylum relief. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Finally, we find no merit to Zam-brano Diaz\u2019s claim that he qualifies for withholding of removal and CAT relief. To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must establish that his life or freedom would be threatened in his country of origin on account of a statutorily protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The applicant must demonstrate that he would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d be persecuted upon being returned to his country of origin. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. When an applicant fails to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, he necessarily fails to establish his eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4. To secure protection under the CAT, an applicant must show that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country, and this torture must be done with the consent or acquiescence of a public official. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(c), 1208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The Attorney General is required to withhold removal when an applicant meets the burden of showing that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in the applicant\u2019s country because of a protected ground. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). However, because Zam-brano Diaz could not prove his entitlement to asylum relief, he necessarily failed to demonstrate that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would be persecuted in Venezuela. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33. Further, aside from his conclusory assertions, Zambrano Diaz has not pointed to evidence in the record demonstrating that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be tortured if he is removed to Venezuela, and therefore, he has not demonstrated his eligibility for CAT relief. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c). Accordingly, we deny Zam-brano Diaz\u2019s petition for review as to his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
