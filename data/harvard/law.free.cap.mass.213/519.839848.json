The judge denied a motion of the plaintiff for a new trial and also denied a motion of the plaintiff to be allowed to file exceptions after the expiration of an extension by agreement of the time allowed for filing such exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-5\">There was a hearing on the petition before <em>Pierce, </em>J. The petitioner asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-6\">\u201c 1. Relief ought to be granted if judgment was rendered against the petitioner by reason of his failure to file his bill of exceptions within the time prescribed by law and his failure was due to a mis-' apprehension of law, and it also appears that his application is otherwise reasonable and just.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>The petitioner would not be guilty of loches by reason merely of delay in the filing of his bill of exceptions if his application for a writ of review is founded on sufficient reason, good faith and conscience.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-8\">\u201c3. Delay in the filing of the bill of exceptions and the entry of judgment against him would not constitute loches on the petitioner\u2019s part if the respondents fail to show' in consequence thereof any serious wrong or injury resulting necessarily to themselves therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-9\">\u201c4. On a petition for a writ of review relief ought to be granted if it appear that the rights of the petitioner on the trial of the merits were not properly protected or safeguarded and an error of law by the court appears, or if to dismiss the petition would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-10\">The judge refused to make any of the rulings requested, and ordered that the petition be dismissed. The petitioner alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-11\">Later the petitioner filed a petition for a new trial upon his petition for a writ of review, alleging that he should have been granted a writ of review because errors of law were disclosed by the record in the action of tort brought by the petitioner and also alleging the existence of newly discovered evidence to be presented in such action of tort. <em>Pierce, </em>J., denied the motion for a new trial upon the petition for a writ of review; and the petitioner alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>\n<em>W.

After a hearing before a judge of the Superior Court his petition was disallowed and dismissed. He has alleged exceptions to this dismissal and to the refusal of the judge to give four rulings requested by the petitioner at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">It is settled that the first exception cannot be sustained. It was for the judge who heard the petition to determine as a matter of sound judicial discretion whether a review should be granted. No exception lies to the exercise of this discretion. If in the course of the hearing any erroneous rulings were made, either in the admission or exclusion of evidence or in passing upon any other question of law that became material, these may be brought before us upon exceptions. But the exercise of his discretionary power to determine whether, in view of all the circumstances shown before him and the situation and position of the parties interested, it is just and equitable to review proceedings which have been concluded in a court of justice, is, if no specific errors have been committed, final. It is enough to cite two of the many decisions which have settled this rule. <em>Stillman </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>170 Mass. 360. <em>Parke </em>v. <em>Murdock, </em>177 Mass. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">The rulings asked for by the petitioner were rightly refused. The first and fourth of his requests went upon the ground that if certain facts were found which might have a bearing, some of them a strong bearing, upon his fight to a review, then he was entitled to have his petition granted, independently of all other considerations and independently of any exercise of discretion on the part of the presiding judge. This could not be so, for the reason already stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">The second and third of his requests dealt with only a part of the-evidence which was before the court, and asked for rulings upon only a detached portion of the case, which of course cannot be required. <em>Bourne </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>209 Mass. 155, 164. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>delay to file exceptions in a case before the expiration of the time which has been limited therefor may constitute loches, however good reason the party at fault may have for applying for a writ of review, and however little wrong or injury may have resulted to the party opposing the issue of such a writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The petitioner has excepted also to the denial of his petition for a new trial upon his application for a review. But this also is not a subject of exception. <em>Manzigian </em>v. <em>Boyajian, </em>183 Mass. 125. <em>Boston Bar Association </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>209 Mass. 200, 204. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Bergman, </em>210 Mass. 346. <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>210 Mass. 487, 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">All other matters which have been argued are covered by what has been said. It is not for us to weigh the merits or demerits of the petitioner\u2019s claims against the respondents, but only to consider whether any errors of law are shown by his exceptions. As we find no such errors, the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
