The judge at the close of the opening statement ordered a verdict for the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that the action of the judge was right, as there was no evidence offered tending to show that the intestate in the course of his employment had need to go into the room where he was killed or that his employer had sent him there, so that the defendant owed the intestate no duty to warn him in regard to the conditions in the room.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-11\">Tort for the conscious suffering and death of one Joseph H.

The plaintiff\u2019s intestate, an employee of the defendant, was seen going alone into some room beyond the \u201cfire room\u201d in the cellar of the defendant\u2019s sawmill. As he went into the fire room he \u201cwas heard to say, <em>\u2018I </em>have been looking for it and I can\u2019t find it\u2019 or <em>\u2018I </em>have been looking for it, but I will find it.\u2019\u201d In passing through the fire room \u201che was heard to say to the engineer, \u2018 Get out of my way; I am in a hurry.\u2019 Shortly afterwards the machinery of the mill stopped, and the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was found dead, caught on the shafting near the coupling, under circumstances showing that he had been caught by his trousers and had been thrown about the shafting until he was killed. There was a block or log on the floor near to the coupling over which the plaintiff\u2019s intestate might have stumbled in the darkness.\u201d It is stated in the bill of exceptions in addition to the above, that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was nineteen years of age and had no knowledge or experience with the machinery of the defendant. And, as we understand the bill of exceptions, the room in which the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was killed \u201cwas lighted by one window only, which at the time of the injury had been allowed to be covered with dirt and debris so that the room was so dark that it would be impossible to work in the same without the aid of lanterns.\u201d There was no suggestion that there had been any change in the condition of the premises since the plaintiff entered the defendant\u2019s employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">On this state of facts we see no evidence which would warrant a finding of negligence on the part of the defendant. The darkness of the room in which the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was killed, or the block or log near the coupling, or the two in combination are the only matters on which that could be based. Without considering other difficulties in the way of making out negligence on the defendant\u2019s part based on these matters, it is enough to say that there was no evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate had occasion to go into the room where he was killed in the course of his employment, or that he was sent there by the defendant on the occasion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>when he was killed. Consequently there was no duty on the defendant to give the intestate warning of the conditions there existing. <em>Ojala </em>v. <em>American Steel &amp; Wire Co., ante, </em>116.
