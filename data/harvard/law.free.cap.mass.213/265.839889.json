The rule of law that a traveller on a highway approaching a crossing of a steam railroad necessarily must look and listen in order to be in the exercise of due care does not apply to a traveller about to cross a single track of a street railway on a street of a town.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-10\">Tort for injuries to the person and property of the plaintiff alleged to have been caused by negligence of the servants of the defendant in operating one of its electric cars at an excessive rate of speed, by reason of which the car came in collision with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>hind wheel of the plaintiff\u2019s wagon when he was driving a pair of horses attached to the wagon and was turning from Pope Street into Centre Street in the town of l5anvers at a little after nine o\u2019clock on the evening of August 15,1908. Writ dated September 25, 1908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-3\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Ratigan, </em>J. The essential facts are stated briefly in the opinion. The defendant\u2019s track on which the car was running at the time of the accident was a single track laid at the side of Centre Street where that street was entered from Pope Street, so that a person driving from Pope Street necessarily would have to cross the track to get into Centre Street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-4\">At the close of the evidence the defendant admitted that there was evidence which would warrant the jury in finding that its servants were negligent in the operation of the car.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">At the request of the defendant, the judge ruled that the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care, and ordered a verdict for the defendant. The judge reported the case for determination by this court, with an agreement of the parties, that, if the question of the plaintiff\u2019s due care should have been submitted to the jury, the case was to be sent back to the Superior Court for a trial on the assessment of damages only; and that, if the ruling of the judge that the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care was correct, judgment was to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-6\"><em>W.

The question must be answered in the affirmative. He testified that as he approached Centre Street he listened for a car or an automobile, but heard no noise of an electric motor or the buzzing of a wire. He also looked, but saw no car until it was too late. Moreover, there was here only a single track, and on his testimony no car was due to pass at this place for nearly ten minutes. There was evidence that the defendant\u2019s car was going unreasonably fast. Under these circumstances the issue as to his due care was for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>jury. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Newton &amp; Boston Street Railway, </em>209 Mass. 100, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">If there was a discrepancy between the plaintiff\u2019s evidence given in chief and some of his answers under cross-examination, this raised only a question for the jury. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>208 Mass. 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The fact that the plaintiff\u2019s vision was obstructed by a tree at or near the corner of Centre Street is not decisive against him. The case of <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Wakefield &amp; Stoneham Street Railway, </em>175 Mass. 331, upon which the defendant relies, was explained when that case came again before the court in 179 Mass. 542. The rule laid down as to railroad crossings is of course not applicable here. See the cases collected in <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Newton &amp; Boston Street Railway, </em>209 Mass. 100, 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Upon the terms of the report and the agreement of the parties, the verdict for the defendant must be set aside, and the case must stand for the assessment of damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
