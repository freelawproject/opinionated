The oral testimony tended to show that the defendant\u2019s name was on the wagon, that the accident happened during the usual working hours of the day, and that the team previously had been on the street where the accident happened. The treasurer in answer to an interrogatory, whether a wagon controlled by the defendant caused injuries to the plaintiff at the time and place in question, stated, \u201cI do not believe that the plaintiff received any substantial injuries, and from the best information I can get, if the plaintiff ever did receive any injury, it was due to his own fault, or to that of his legal custodian.\u201d In answer to interrogatories asking in substance whether a report concerning the accident was made to the defendant by him or by any other official of the corporation and for a copy of the report, the treasurer answered merely, that, upon receiving a letter from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney \u201cclaiming that the plaintiff had been injured,\u201d an investigation and a report had been made, and that he \u201cas treasurer\u201d made no report. Replying to an interrogatory asking whether the person driving the team in question was in the employ of the defendant, the treasurer answered that \u201ca man in the general employment of the defendant was driving a team\u201d at the time and place of the accident. In reply to an interrogatory as to the duties of such driver, the treasurer answered, describing his duties, and stating that \u201cthe purpose of his being\u201d at the place in question at the time of the accident \u201c was in no way concerned with\u201d the duties so described. <em>Held, </em>that the oral testimony, taken in connection with the substance and character of the answers to the interrogatories, warranted a finding that the driver of a team was a servant of the defendant and was acting within the scope of his employment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b491-9\">When it is within the power of a party to an action to explain things apparently telling against him and he fails to make the explanation, the inference properly may be drawn that no truthful explanation will help him.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-10\">Tort, for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by the plaintiff, a boy twenty months old, being run over on Prince Street in Boston by a wagon owned by the defendant and in which an employee of the defendant was driving.

The only oral evidence as to the wagon was that it was \u201ca soap grease team\u201d and had upon it the name \u201cHinckley Rendering Company\u201d (which is the defendant\u2019s corporate name), and the number \u201c26.\u201d The only oral evidence as to the driver was that he was known to one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, she \u201chaving known him a number of years when he used to collect soap grease.\u201d If the evidence had stopped there, it might have been said that the plaintiff had not shown enough to entitle him to go to the jury. But the evidence did not stop there. The answers of the treasurer were singular, and are significant upon the question. The interrogatories directly pertinent to this inquiry and the answers thereto are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">\u201cInt. 10 \u2014 On September 23, 1910, did a horse and wagon operated or controlled by the Hinckley Rendering Company cause injuries to the plaintiff on Prince Street, Boston?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>\u201cAns. ... I do not believe that the plaintiff received any substantial injuries, and from the best information I can get, if the plaintiff ever did receive any injury, it was due to his own fault, or to that of his legal custodian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">\u201cInt. 11 \u2014 Was a report made to the Hinckley Rendering Company or any of its officials or agents, or servants, on September 23, 1910, or any time subsequent thereto concerning an accident or injuries to the plaintiff in this case, which occurred on September 23, 1910, on Prince Street in Boston?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201cAns. . . . Upon the receipt of a letter from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney claiming that the plaintiff had been injured, an investigation and a report were made, such letter being the first notice the defendant had of any alleged injury to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">\u201cInt. 12 \u2014 Did you as treasurer or as an official or employee of the defendant corporation, or did any one as official, agent, employee or servant of the defendant company, make a report of the accident which occurred on Prince Street, Boston, on September 23, 1910?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\u201cAns. ... As treasurer I made no report to the Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">\u201cInt. 13 \u2014 If your answer to the preceding interrogatory is yes, attach a copy of such report to your answer to this interrogatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">\u201cAns. . . . See answer to interrogatory No. 11.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">\u201cInt. 14 \u2014 Was the person driving the team which caused the injuries to the plaintiff in this action on September 23, 1910, on Prince Street, in Boston, in the employ .of the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">\u201cAns. ... A man in the general employment of the defendant was driving a team, on Prince Street, Boston, at some time on September 23, 1910.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">\u201c Int. 18 \u2014 What were the duties of the driver of the team which caused injuries to the plaintiff on September 23, 1910, on Prince Street, in Boston?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-14\">\u201cAns. . . . The duties of the man referred to in my answer to interrogatory No. 14 were to collect market waste, but said man collected no market waste in Prince Street, Boston, on September 23, 1910, and the purpose of his being on said Prince Street was in no way concerned with the collecting of market waste.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">It is thus seen that when asked (Int. 10) whether the team which caused the injuries to the plaintiff was operated or controlled by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the defendant the defendant\u2019s treasurer does not directly answer, but says in substance, from \u201cthe best information he can get,\u201d there were no substantial injuries and that at any rate the plaintiff, or his custodian, was at fault. The answer is almost in the nature of confession and avoidance. It indicates that he has been investigating the question of the liability of the defendant and has come to the conclusion that the best ground of defense is, not that the defendant is not answerable as the owner of the team, but that the plaintiff was not injured or, if he was injured, it was the fault of his custodian.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Again, when asked whether any report of the accident has been made by him or any one as official agent or servant of the defendant, and when requested to attach such report to his answer (Ints. 11, 12, 13), he says that upon receipt of a letter from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, that being the first notice the defendant had of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, an investigation and a report were made; and-that he \u201cas treasurer\u201d made no report to the defendant. It also appears (see answers to Ints. 14 and 18) that a man in the general employment of the defendant and whose duty was to \u201ccollect market waste\u201d was at some time during the day of the accident on the street where it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">And this is not all. We are not dealing with a case where at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony the presiding judge rules that there is no case for the plaintiff, or in other words that the defendant is not called upon to put in his evidence. In such a case there are no presumptions to be drawn against the defendant for his failure to explain whatever may be against him. The presiding judge in substance rules that there is no need of explanation on his part, and that is enough. In the present case the ruling was made at the close of the whole evidence. Possibly the judge, as is frequently the case, declined to rule until the defendant rested. At any rate the defendant did then rest. If there was anything in the evidence produced by the plaintiff which bore against the defendant, it was called upon to explain and it had the fullest opportunity to do so. Nor is this a case where the person who presumably would be the best witness on the subject, namely, the driver of the team, could have been called by the plaintiff as well as by the defendant. The plaintiff did not know his name. The plaintiff had interrogated the defendant as to his name and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>defendant had declined to give it. Under these circumstances the rule applies that when it is in the power of a party to an action to explain things apparently telling against him and he fails to make the explanation, it properly may be presumed that no truthful explanation will help him.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">It is to be further noted that the driver of the team had been at the time of the accident in the employ of the defendant six months; and it is fairly to be inferred from the record that the accident occurred during the usual working hours of the day. It is true that in his answer to the eighteenth interrogatory the treasurer, after stating that the duties of the driver of the team were to collect market waste, added that the man collected no market waste on that street that day, and that his purpose in being on that street was \u201cin no way concerned with the collecting of market waste.\u201d But it is to be observed that the treasurer does not say for what purpose the team was then and there on the street, or that the driver was not then acting upon some specific errand; nor does he state the circumstances so that the court may see whether the witness is right in his conclusion that the driver\u2019s errand had no connection with the collecting of market waste. It is unnecessary to go into the evidence more in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In view of the name upon the wagon, the time of the accident, occurring as it did in the usual working hours of outdoor daily labor, the oral testimony as to the acts of the driver when on the street, and that the wagon had been on this street before and was a \u201csoap grease team,\u201d the answer made by the defendant\u2019s treasurer and the inferences legitimately to be drawn from their evasive nature,\u2014 all taken and interpreted in connection with and in the light of the defendant\u2019s failure- to explain when the opportunity was presented,\u2014we think that the evidence would have warranted a conclusion on the part of the jury that at the time of the accident the driver of the team was a servant of the defendant and was acting within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In accordance with the terms of the report there must be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $240, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b492-9\"> The report stated as follows: \u201cThere was evidence offered by the plaintiff of his having received injuries by being run over by a wagon. There was evidence for the jury on the questions of the plaintiff\u2019s due care and the defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
