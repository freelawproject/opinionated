It appeared that the defendant in the first action insured the defendant in the second action under a policy of casualty insurance; that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, having been injured through negligence of the defendant in the second action, brought an action two days later against that defendant, and, eight or nine days later, went to the office of the defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the first action and had a conversation with one Linscott, its agent, as to which he afterwards testified in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-3\">\u201cMr. Linscott says to me, \u2018I will give you . . $200/ So I</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-4\">shook my head. I said, \u2018 That will never pay my bills for the time I am laid up\u2019 \u2014 in my own mind. He says, \u2018 I will give you three.\u2019 I says, \u2018I won\u2019t take it.\u2019 ... I went back anyway again. I says, \u2018Will you make it any more?\u2019 He says, \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I says, \u2018I won\u2019t take it.\u2019 \u2018Now,\u2019 he says, \u2018Brennan you are a poor man, and I will leave this open \u2014 this offer open for you for two weeks. . . . You come in. . . . But I won\u2019t be here; I am going away. I am going away and I will leave this offer open for you for two weeks.

You get a hundred a month; that is more than you can earn; that is eleven or twelve dollars a week.\u2019 I says, \u2018What if I am not able to go to work then at the end of six weeks? I want to, to maintain my family.\u2019 \u2018Well, now,\u2019 he says, \u2018if you are not all right, come back and see me, but I am sure you will have no occasion, I will make it right with you; I will make it right with you, but I am sure you will have no occasion.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-5\">Four days later the plaintiff\u2019s intestate returned to the office of the defendant in the first action, received $300, signed and delivered a release discharging the defendant in the second action \u201cfrom any and all claims, demands, actions and causes of action of every name and nature which I now have or might have upon or against said company, and especially from all claims arising out of any and all personal injuries, damages, expenses and any loss or damage whatsoever resulting or to result from \u201d the accident in question \u201cor which I may hereafter have from anything which has heretofore happened.\u201d That release was pleaded by the defendant in the action which already had been brought by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, the action was tried and a verdict was ordered for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-6\">Subsequently the plaintiff\u2019s intestate brought these two actions of contract; and, he having died, the administratrix of his estate was admitted to prosecute the actions in his stead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-7\">The trial judge limited the plaintiff to testimony tending to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>prove the contract declared on, and, at the close of the evidence, ruled in each case that the plaintiff could not recover, ordered verdicts for the respective defendants and reported the cases for determination by this court, judgments to be entered on the verdicts if the above ruling was right, and, if it was wrong, new trials to be ordered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-3\"><em>John Wentworth, </em>(J. <em>P.

The promise is not void on the ground that it is too indefinite. Juries are constantly solving such problems. The case for the plaintiff is much stronger than that in <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>210 Mass. 26. See also <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Joseph Burnett Co. </em>208 Mass. 75. Under the terms of the report there must be a new trial, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
