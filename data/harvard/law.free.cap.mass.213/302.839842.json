Writ' dated February 16, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-10\">In the Superior Court the case was heard before <em>Keating, </em>J. At the time of the accident the horses were being driven by one Bryant, who is mentioned in the opinion, where the evidence in regard to his duties is described. It appeared that the carriage had been ordered by the defendant\u2019s older daughter who, with a younger sister, was in the carriage at the time of the accident, and that they were being driven to the railroad station to meet a friend who was expected to arrive. At the close of the evidence the judge ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-11\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-12\"><em>R.

See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Armstrong Transfer Co. </em>167 Mass. 199, and cases cited; <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>189 Mass. 583, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>There was ample evidence that at the time of the accident Bryant was engaged in the business for which he was employed. The carriage and the horses belonged to the defendant. It appeared that Bryant had been in his employ as a hostler for thirteen months a.nd that a part of his duty was to take care of this team and drive it. And the jury might well have found upon the evidence that one of his ordinary duties under the contract of hiring was to take the wife or daughters out to drive whenever respectively required by them, without any further action on the part of- the defendant and without even his knowledge in any individual case. Indeed that is the most natural inference. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>211 Mass. 269. The case is plainly distinguishable from <em>Bourne </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>209 Mass. 155, 172, cited by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
