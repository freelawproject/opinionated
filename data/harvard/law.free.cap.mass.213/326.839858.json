Writ in the Third District Court of Eastern Middlesex, dated November 23, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-8\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was submitted to <em>Fessenden, </em>J., upon an agreed statement of facts, by which it appeared that the defendant at the time he indorsed the notes waived demand on the maker of the notes at maturity by writing above his signature the words: \u201cWaive demand,\u201d but that he did not either in writing or orally waive notice to him of the failure of the maker to pay the notes at maturity unless his waiver of demand was also a waiver of notice. It further was agreed that no seasonable notice was given to the defendant of the maker\u2019s failure to pay the notes at maturity, that the notes were not paid at maturity and that they still remained unpaid. It was agreed that, if the defendant by his waiver of demand waived notice, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiffs in the sum of $90 with interest from the date of the writ and costs; and that, if the defendant did not so waive notice, judgment was to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-9\">The judge ordered judgment for the defendant; and from the judgment entered in accordance with that order the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-10\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-11\"><em>J.

Plainly it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The liability of an indorser is conditional, the conditions being-first, that at the maturity of the note there shall be a demand upon the maker for payment, and second, that if the note be not then paid due notice thereof shall be given to the indorser. And these two conditions are distinct and independent of each other. Either can be waived and the other insisted upon. Neither upon principle nor by the great weight of authority is a waiver of one without more a waiver of the other as matter of law. <em>Berkshire Bank </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>6 Mass. 524. R.
