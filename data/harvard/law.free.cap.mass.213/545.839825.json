The plaintiff further averred her willingness to pay to the defendant any sum which might be due to him to entitle her to obtain the relief sought, and prayed that the defendant should be enjoined from assigning or disposing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>the mortgage from Ryback and that he should be ordered to assign such mortgage to the plaintiff; that the defendant should be ordered to account to the plaintiff for all rents, income and profits received by the defendant or his agent from the property in question and to pay to the plaintiff all moneys due upon such accounting; and for further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-5\">The case was referred to Charles Neal Barney, Esquire, as master. The master\u2019s report contained the following summary of his findings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-6\">\u201cIn view of the foregoing facts, I find on the whole case that the purchase at the foreclosure, by the defendant Lovett for himself, of the property which is the subject matter of this action was a violation of his fiduciary relation to the plaintiff and results in equity in such a constructive trust as entitles the plaintiff to an accounting for the profit that may have accrued to the defendant in the transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-7\">\u201cI find on such accounting that the defendant should be charged with $1,173.61 (being the amount received by him from the increase in the mortgage, from the gross rent receipts, and from the sale of the equity in January, 1910); and should be allowed $773.39 (being the purchase price of the equity and the disbursements on the property between June 1908 and February 1910 as herein-before set forth), together with $122 (being the amount found due him for his services in connection with the management thereof during said period). That is to say, I find upon the whole accounting that the defendant should pay to the plaintiff the sum of two hundred seventy-eight dollars and twenty-two cents ($278.22).\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-8\">The case was heard by <em>Dana, </em>J., upon the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the master\u2019s report. At the hearing the defendant asked the judge to make certain rulings. The judge overruled the exceptions to the master\u2019s report, and refused to make the rulings requested by the defendant. The defendant alleged exceptions, raising the questions which are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-9\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-10\"><em>N. D. A. Clarke, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-11\"><em>W. H. Niles, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b573-12\">Bbaley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJr\">The evidence not having been reported, the master\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive, and it follows that, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>defendant, an attorney at law, acquired the property which is the subject of this suit, the fiduciary relation of attorney and client existed between the parties. It further appears that his attendance at the sale was upon an understanding and arrangement that he should safeguard the plaintiff\u2019s interests, and bid off the property for her, and the master unhesitatingly finds that instead he took advantage of the opportunity to obtain the title for himself. A clear breach of the trust and confidence which she had reposed in him is shown by the report. The extent and nature of this relation and the scrupulous care which should be exercised by the court, when the validity of transactions where the attorney acquires the property of his client, or property which he has engaged to procure for his client, are under review, have been so recently pointed out that further discussion is unnecessary. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>191 Mass. 253. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Allin, </em>212 Mass. 327. <em>Manheim </em>v. <em>Woods, ante, </em>537.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">It is true that the plaintiff, although prepared to advance the purchase price, did not do so, and consequently there is no resulting trust. <em>Bourke </em>v. <em>Callanan, </em>160 Mass. 195. But, whenever an attorney at law, who is retained or employed to purchase, buys the property indirectly on his own account without the client\u2019s assent, as in the case at bar, a constructive trust arises, and he will be held to be a trustee at the election of his client, who is entitled to the benefit of the transaction. <em>Hawkes </em>v. <em>Lackey, </em>207 Mass. 424, where the cases are collected. <em>Manheim </em>v. <em>Woods, ante, </em>537.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The defense of loches, not having been pleaded, is not open. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Joyce, 201 </em>Mass. 301. But, if pleaded, we should hesitate long before holding that the delay of less than two years, where the plaintiff is shown to have been of foreign birth and unacquainted with our language, and during the time had implicit faith in the defendant\u2019s singleness of purpose and believed from his conduct and statements that he had acted in her behalf until he refused to recognize her rights and claimed the property as his own, when thereupon she <em>brought </em>suit, should bar relief in a court &lt;of conscience. <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>188 Mass. 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Nor did the master or the judge err in refusing to allow the defendant interest on the purchase price. It is to be presumed that he knew the law, and, having acted to the disadvantage of the plaintiff, he should not be permitted to receive compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>in the form of interest. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>136 Mass. 60. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>188 Mass. 510. <em>Milwaukee &amp; Minnesota Railroad </em>v. <em>Soutter, </em>13 Wall. 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The exception to the admission of evidence, not having been argued, calls for no comment, and, finding no error of law in the refusals to rule as requested or in the master\u2019s report, the exceptions are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
