The plea in abatement raised an issue of fact. The action of the Superior Court in overruling it presents no question of law. An appeal in an action at law brings before this court only errors of law apparent on the record. <em>Electric Welding Co. </em>v. <em>Prince, </em>200 Mass. 386, 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed with double costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
