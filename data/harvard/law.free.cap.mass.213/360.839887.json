Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated November 9,1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-5\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Hitciwocic, </em>J. The plaintiff contended that the defendant Pearl-stein was the real landlord of the premises, notwithstanding the lease to the defendant Geller, described in the opinion, and introduced evidence tending to show that, while the lease \u201c recited that Geller had to pay water rates,\u201d the receipts for their payment were \u201cin the name of Mr. and Mrs. Pearlstein,\u201d and that the defendant Pearlstein\u2019s husband, when spoken to by the plaintiff\u2019s physician as to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, asked the physician \u201cnot to be too hard on him as to the accident.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-6\">There was evidence tending to show that there was no noticeable defect in the ceiling in question when the plaintiff\u2019s husband hired a tenement from Geller. In cross-examination the plaintiff\u2019s husband stated that the ceiling was \u201call the time\u201d in as bad condition as it was when the plaintiff was injured. He was asked, \u201cWas the condition of the ceiling from where the plaster came any different on November 1 from the condition it was in when you first came there?\u201d and answered, \u201cWell, it was in the same condition it was the whole month.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-7\">The plaintiff testified that the day on which she and her husband moved into the tenement was dry, and that she then noticed that the ceiling, at the point from which later a piece fell upon her, was cracked and that \u201clittle pieces\u201d were hanging down. She and others described in detail the leaking of water at that point during rain storms, and a change then in the appearance of the ceiling, and there was evidence that Geller had been asked to repair the ceiling and had refused to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-8\">Other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-9\">At the close of the evidence the judge ordered verdicts for both defendants; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-10\">In this court the defendant Geller did not appear.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-11\"><em>L.

Sheldon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqQf\">The plaintiff put in evidence that the defendant Geller had taken from the defendant Pearlstein a lease of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>house which contained the tenement hired by the plaintiff\u2019s husband, and was in control thereof at the time of her injury. There was no dispute that her husband\u2019s hiring was from Geller. The rest of Geller\u2019s testimony might have created some suspicion as to Mrs. Pearlstein\u2019s motive in giving the lease to him, but did not tend to show that he had not in fact taken possession of the leasehold interest, or that he was not in control of the premises. If so, the motive of the lessor was not material. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>1 Allen, 215, 216. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Farrar, </em>10 Allen, 519. What Mrs. Pearlstein\u2019s husband said to Dr. Lazarus could not be evidence against her, nor was she bound by the way in which receipts for water rates were taken, unless in each case there had been further evidence to .connect her therewith. It follows that on the plaintiff\u2019s own showing the verdict in favor of Mrs. Pearlstein was rightly ordered. <em>Mellen </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>126 Mass. 545. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Boston University, </em>191 Mass. 30. <em>Coman </em>v. <em>Alles, </em>198 Mass. 99. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Loring, </em>201 Mass. 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">But, as to the defendant Geller, the case stands differently. In spite of some of the answers given by the plaintiff\u2019s husband on cross-examination, the jury could find that Geller had negligently failed to keep the ceiling of which a part fell upon the plaintiff in as good condition as it had appeared to be when her husband hired the tenement, and so the case is not governed by the decisions upon which the defendant relies. <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Naumkeag Steam Cotton Co. </em>134 Mass. 357, 361. <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Perham, </em>151 Mass. 162. <em>Moynihan </em>v. <em>Allyn, </em>162 Mass. 270. <em>Hannaford </em>v. <em>Kinne, </em>199 Mass. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">There was evidence that the ceiling was over a common passageway which he was bound to use due care to keep in as good condition as it appeared to be when he let the tenement, and the plaintiff could be found to have been in the exercise of due care. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Blouin, </em>210 Mass. 140. <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Dickson, </em>210 Mass. 510. Her rights were the same that those of her husband would have been under the same circumstances. <em>Domenicis </em>v. <em>Fleisher, </em>195 Mass. 281. <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>204 Mass. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">As to this defendant the exceptions must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
