L. c. 208, \u00a7 98, which in substance provides a penalty for administering or exposing poison with intent that it shall be taken or.swallowed by \u201cany horse, cattle or other beast of another person.\u201d</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-11\">Indictment, returned on August 17, 1910, in two counts, the first charging that the defendant \u201cdid wilfully and maliciously administer certain poison, to wit: \u2014 paris green to certain cattle belonging to Edward D. Leonard,\u201d and the second charging that the defendant \u201cdid wilfully and maliciously expose certain poison, to wit: \u2014 paris green, with intent that it should be taken or swallowed by cattle belonging to Edward D. Leonard.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-12\">R. L. c. 208, \u00a7 98, reads as follows: \u201cWhoever wilfully and maliciously kills, maims or disfigures any horse, cattle or other beast of another person, or wilfully and maliciously administers or exposes poison with intent that it shall be taken or swallowed by any such beast, shall be punished by imprisonment in the State prison for not more than five years or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars and imprisonment in jail for not more than one year.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>In the Superior Court the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the first count and guilty on the second count. The defendant moved in arrest of judgment on the ground, in substance, that the verdicts on the two counts were inconsistent, and \u201cthat there is not any offense set forth in the second count in the indictment known to the laws of this Commonwealth.\u201d The motion was overruled, and on October 31, 1910, the defendant was sentenced to not less than three nor more than four years in the State prison, with one day of solitary confinement, and was committed. On November 29, 1910, the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-5\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-6\"><em>J. 8. Richardson, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-7\"><em>J. A. Stiles, </em>District Attorney, <em>&amp; E. T. Esty, </em>Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b162-8\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVj\">If the defendant exposed poison with intent that it should be swallowed but it was not swallowed by the cattle in question, the jury had to find a verdict of guilty on the second count and a verdict of not guilty on the first. There is no inconsistency between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The other reason for arresting judgment was that \u201ccattle\u201d is not sufficiently definite. This was a cause existing before verdict not affecting the jurisdiction of the court and so not ground for arresting judgment. R. L. c. 219, \u00a7 38. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em>170 Mass. 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">It is not improper to add, however, that there is nothing in the objection. For while the word \u201c cattle\u201d may have been too indefinite under the black act, St. 9 Geo. I. c. 22, \u00a7 3, <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Chalkley, </em>Russ. &amp; Ry. 258) and at common law <em>(State </em>v. <em>Brookhouse, </em>10 Wash. 87), it is not too indefinite under our criminal practice act. That act provides that a detailed description is not necessary (R. L. c. 218, \u00a7 17) and gives the defendant a right to a bill of particulars if the charge would not be otherwise fully, plainly, substantially and formally set out. R. L. c. 218, \u00a7 39. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dill, </em>160 Mass. 536. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>207 Mass. 259. Under that statute it is sufficient to charge this act in the words of the statute creating the crime. R. L. c. 208, \u00a7 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
