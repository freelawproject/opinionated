Against the objection and under the exception of the defendant he was allowed to testify that in his opinion based upon an investigation of the premises made on the day of the fire there had been six separate fires in the three rooms occupied by the defendant on the ground floor of the building. The witness then testified to his reasons for this conclusion. His reasons were in substance that he found at six different places that the mop-board \u25a0or the sheathing or the partition or the floor had been charred or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>burned without any charring or burning between, and that in one instance debris between, consisting of \u201ccoverings to oranges and stuff of that character that comes out of a store \u2014 paper,\u201d had not been burned and \u201cwas intact.\u201d He also testified that in four different places holes had been burned through the floor although the floor appeared to be in a damp condition; also that there was water under the floor which came within six or seven inches of the floor, and that the water was clear so that the ground under the floor could be seen, and that there was \"no debris or anything\u201d in it. After the witness had given this description of what he found to be the condition of the premises, against the defendant\u2019s objection and under his exception the prosecuting attorney was allowed to ask this question: \"How do you draw any conclusion, Mr. Molt, from those holes in the floor, which you have described, as to the kind of fire which would produce that effect or would burn in that way?\u201d and the witness was allowed to testify: \"From what I saw there, the conditions underneath the floor, and the burning through, and small burning in this back room, something of a very intense nature must have been on these particular places to have set there and burned through this floor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-6\"><em>H.

Esty, </em>Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b95-8\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEv\">The testimony of the witness as to the conclusions drawn by him from what he saw was not admissible as the conclusions made by an ordinary witness from observation of things which cannot be reproduced and therefore although involving opinion admitted <em>ex necessitate, </em>as to which see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sturtivant, </em>117 Mass. 122, 133; <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>194 Mass. 450; <em>Partelow </em>v. <em>Newton &amp; Boston Street Railway, </em>196 Mass. 24; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>200 Mass. 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Doubtless there are cases where the effect of some kinds of fire upon some kinds of material substance is not a matter of ordinary experience or knowledge such as men in general understand and comprehend. But the kind of fire pr fires which char ordinary mop-boards, sheathing and partitions and burn holes through an ordinary wooden floor without any charring or burning between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>is not one of them. See in this connection <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>65 Maine, 74; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway, </em>40 Wis. 582; <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>107 Mass. 494; <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>State Mutual Fire Ins.
