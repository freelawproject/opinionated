From this decree the petitioner has appealed. The statute does not allow an appeal from a decision of a justice of this court in. a proceeding at law, that procedure being confined to decisions of the Superior Court. R.

The only way to bring before the full court for review any decision of a single justice of this court in an action at law is by exceptions, unless he reports the questions raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">If the matter be treated as properly before us, no error of law appears upon the face of the papers. The function of a writ of mandamus directed to a lower court is to compel it to exercise its judicial functions, not to direct what action shall be taken. <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Justices of the Superior Court, </em>208 Mass. 162.
