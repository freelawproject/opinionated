The plaintiff introduced in evidence interrogatories which he had propounded to the defendant and the answers thereto, from which it appeared that a seam blast generally was not called a heavy blast unless five or more kegs of powder were used, that for the blast which caused the injury only a keg and a half of powder was used, and that ample time was given for the workmen to protect themselves before the blast. There was no evidence controlling or contradicting the answers to the interrogatories, and none tending to show that the person in charge of giving the warning had reasonable ground to expect that many stones would be thrown out by the blast. <em>Held, </em>that the jury would not have been warranted in finding the defendant liable.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-13\">Tort by an employee in a quarry of the defendant to recover for personal injuries caused by being struck by a stone thrown from a pit by a blast.

These pits were separated by a granite wall, varying in height from one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet from the bottom of the old pit, and from twenty to sixty-five feet above the bottom of the new one. In the northwest corner of the new pit there was a stone about eight feet long, four and a half feet wide and sixteen feet deep, that had been entirely disconnected from the ledge. It was separated from the surrounding ledge by seams on its northern and western sides, and the rock had been entirely removed on the eastern and southern sides, except a \u201ctoe\u201d that lapped over the western end of the southerly side of the stone, but was free from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">This large stone had been moved some six or seven inches before the day of the accident, and the defendant\u2019s foreman, one Johnson, undertook to push it farther down the slanting bed of the pit. Powder to the amount of a keg and a half, or about thirty-seven pounds, was lowered into the seam on the western side of the stone, the blast was prepared and covered with earth in the usual manner; the steam whistle then was sounded three times, and after the lapse of a minute or more the charge was fired. The plaintiff had been working in the old pit, about thirty feet from its eastern wall, and when the warning whistle sounded he stopped his work and walked about twenty feet toward the centre of the pit. While he was looking up at the stones thrown by the blast that were coming through the air, he was struck by one of them and injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Blasts were made in one pit or the other a number of times every day, and there were three different kinds of warning used. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>In the case of very light blasts, where no stone was expected to fly, Johnson would warn the employees in the immediate vicinity to \u201clook out\u201d and they would move away. The second kind, which was given at the time of the accident, as explained by the plaintiff, was \u201cwhen they used powder in a place or seam where they think or believe some rocks will fly;\u201d then \u201cthey blow the whistle three times and tell the men to look out for themselves. . . . The men then look out for themselves. . . . They protect themselves by looking up and dodging stones that come down.\u201d The third method of warning was used in case of very heavy blasts, when \u201cthey think a great many stones will fly;\u201d then the whistle is blown and the men are ordered to come out of the pits. The alleged negligence relied on by the plaintiff was that of Johnson in failing to use the third method of warning and thereby order the men out of the pit at the time of the accident. Clearly there was not evidence to sustain any other of the many allegations in the declaration; and the obvious risks incident to this dangerous employment as ordinarily and properly conducted were assumed by the plaintiff, who was an experienced quarryman.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Upon the main question in controversy, whether at the time of this accident the third method of warning should have been given instead of the second, there was evidence introduced by the plaintiff that a seam blast was not generally considered a very heavy blast, such as to call for ordering the employees out of an adjoining pit, unless five or more kegs of powder were used; and that for the blast in question, where only a keg and a half were used, it was Johnson\u2019s duty to see that a warning whistle was blown, and that sufficient time was given for employees to protect themselves if they saw fit; and further that ample time was given for this at the time of the accident. It is true that this evidence came from answers filed by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s written interrogatories, but the plaintiff, with ample knowledge thereof, produced no witness who contradicted or controlled it. The only other testimony bearing upon the question whether the third method of warning should have been used was that of the plaintiff and some others to the effect that it was customarily given when they put the powder in a place from which they knew or thought a great many stones would fly. But no evidence was introduced to show that Johnson, when he fired the charge, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>reasonable grounds to expect that many stones would be thrown under the circumstances existing here, where a comparatively small amount of powder was placed in a seam blast for the purpose of pushing the stone down the sloping bed of the quarry. In fact when this same stone was moved a few days before and apparently by the same kind of blasting charge, it does not appear that any stones were thrown. And it may be added that the proximate cause of the injury was not the large number of stones, but a single stone which rebounded from the side of the quarry, \u2014 something which might occur in the case of any ordinary blast.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Without considering the issues of the plaintiff\u2019s due care and assumption of risk, we are of opinion that the trial court was right in ruling that the jury would not be warranted in finding the defendant liable upon the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
