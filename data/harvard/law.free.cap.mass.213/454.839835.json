Writ dated April 3, 1911.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-11\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Irwin, </em>J. The only.witness for the plaintiff on the question of liability was the plaintiff. He testified in direct examination, on the subject of warning of the approach of the car, as follows: \u201cQ. Whether or not you heard anything; whether or not you heard the car approaching, \u2014 the second car? A. No, sir. \u2014 Q. You did not? A. No, sir. \u2014 Q. Whether or not you heard the gong being sounded? A. No, sir. \u2014 Q. Whether or not you heard anybody shout to you? A. No, sir.\u201d A motorman in the employ of the defendant, not the motorman operating the car, testified that he was in the front vestibule of the car at the time of the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>cident, and that he had applied the emergency brakes, and \u201cthat the motorman had been ringing the gong.\u201d &gt; He also testified that the motorman who had operated the car had gone to Oklahoma shortly after the accident to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-3\">The other material facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-4\">At the close of the evidence the judge refused to rule that upon all the evidence the plaintiff could not recover, or that there was no evidence that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care, or that there was no evidence that the defendant was negligent. The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $500; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-5\"><em>F. M. Ives, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-6\"><em>H. A. Kenny, </em>for the plaintiff, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b481-7\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYx\">The jury upon conflicting evidence would have been warranted in finding that at the time of the accident the plaintiff, a boy some ten years of age, while a traveller in the street in which were the double tracks of the defendant\u2019s railway, had occasion to pass from one side to the other. Before leaving the curb he looked across, and, seeing only an inbound car which had stopped at the cross walk, started over the cross walk, following travellers who preceded him. Upon passing the stationary car he reached the outward track where he was struck and injured by an outbound car, the motorman of which gave no warning of its approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The degree of care called for was that of the ordinarily prudent boy of his age. <em>Berdos </em>v. <em>Tremont &amp; Suffolk Mills, </em>209 Mass. 489, 494. <em>Angelary </em>v. <em>Springfield Street Railway, </em>213 Mass. 110, and cases cited. And it has been decided that under substantially similar circumstances this question is for the jury. <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>184 Mass. 126. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>192 Mass. 37, 40. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>193 Mass. 63. <em>Purcell </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>211 Mass. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The question of the defendant\u2019s negligence also was rightly submitted to them. It must have been apparent to the motorman, that the inward car had stopped, and he knew, of course, that his car must pass over the crossing. In the concurrent use of the street the defendant was bound to take proper precautions to avoid injury to travellers, and a view of the oncoming car by those approaching from the direction of the inward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>track might have been so obstructed, as the jury could find, by the stationary car, that if the usual warning was not given travellers would be unaware of the danger until too late to escape injury. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>193 Mass. 63. <em>Horsman </em>v. <em>Brockton &amp; Plymouth Street Railway, </em>205 Mass. 519, 521. The only evidence that the gong was rung came from a witness for the defendant. But the jury were not bound to believe him, and, the order in which evidence is introduced being immaterial, they furthermore could say that it was not rung, because in answer to questions asked in his direct examination the plaintiff testified that he did not hear it. <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>203 Mass. 453, 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
