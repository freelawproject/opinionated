S. C.</author>\n<p id=\"AO\">Did the competent and credible evidence in this action adequately sustain the determination of facts and consequent judgment of the Hudson County Court concluding that the permanent disability of the plaintiff resulted from an accident arising out of and in the course of her employment? The Deputy Director of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation and the Hudson County Court both resolved that controversial issue in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">If their conclusions rest upon competent evidence, they ought not to be overthrown incautiously. <em>Mason v. Evans, </em>5 <em>N. J. Super. </em>338 (App. <em>Div. </em>1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">For some period of time prior to the alleged accident on November 20, 1947, the plaintiff was employed by the defendant to operate a slurring machine in .the teflon department at its Arlington plant. The machine may be generally described as a container into which the proportions of powder and water are imported and then agitated. It is imperative to close the aperture in the receptacle after the admission of the materials by the insertion of a rubber stopper weighing about one-half pound and to maintain it in its position during the churning period. It was pragmatical and expedient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>to seat the stopper firmly to prevent its dislodgment or ejectment by the operation of the apparatus.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">It was on November 20, 1947, in the pursuit of this occupation that the plaintiff, in her endeavor securely to install the btopper by means of the exertion of pressure with her right arm and shoulder, sensed an acute and painful \u201cclick\u201d or \u201ccrack\u201d in the area of her right shoulder and neck. Proof of the occurrence of the alleged mishap is reinforced by the testimony of the shop foreman who recalls that the plaintiff at once informed him of her anguish and that he forthwith issued to her a \u201cpass\u201d entitling her to treatment at the company hospital. Additional confirmation is available in the testimony of the attending nurse and in the contemporaneous records of the infirmary.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s injury is classified as a subluxation of the right sternoclavicular articulation. Dr. Visconti testified that the subluxation \u201cis an accidental condition\u201d and \u201cwould not come on with the ordinary occupational hazard.\u201d The X-rays did not reveal any bone disease in the region of the right sternoclavicular articulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The appellant more vigorously impugns the finding that a causal relationship between the alleged accident and the injury has been evidentially established. We recognize that the proof of that essential element of the plaintiff\u2019s case is somewhat frail, but from a comprehensive survey of all of the circumstances disclosed by the evidence and the permissible inferences drawn therefrom, we are of the opinion that there is competent evidence upon which the judgment for the plaintiff can be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The following excerpts from the testimony of the witness Mary Starzecky are noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">\u201cDid you see * * * the front part of the collarbone?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">\u201cYes, I seen it right after that happened; when she got hurt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2-\">\u201cAnd you saw her today also,\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">\u201cAnd I seen her today. It is the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">\u201cDid you see her before November 1947?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-12\">\u201cOh, yes * * <em>*\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-13\">\u201cAnd did she have that before that time?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-14\">\u201cNo * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>An. abnormality was observed at the hospital and catalogued as a \u201cswelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The examination of the plaintiff by the appellant\u2019s physician revealed \u201ca definite forwaiffi displacement of the medial end of the right clavicle.\u201d The testimony of Mary Starzecky generates the inference that the protrusion was discernible \u201cright after\u201d the accident, did not noticeably exist before, and is \u201cthe same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">It is insisted that the answer to the pertinent hypothetical question addressed to Dr. Visconti is valueless in that it embraced as a postulate the circumstance that there was an \u201cimmediate raising of the bone.\u201d <em>Bayonne v. Standard Oil Co., </em>81 <em>N. J. L. </em>717 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1910). The propriety of the hypothesis, however, must be estimated in the light of the testimony to which we have already referred. Some probative regard is accorded to the testimony of Dr. Visconti given in response to a question entirely disassociated in which he expressed the conviction that even though the plaintiff may have had symptomatic complaints referable to her shoulder antedating the accident, the occurrence of November 20, 1947, caused the subluxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The judgment under review is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b82-7\">Colie, J. A. D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYa\">dissenting. I am unable to agree with my colleagues for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">In order to establish a causal relationship between the incident of November 19th or 20th, 1947, and the permanent disability for which an award was made, the plaintiff called Dr. Joseph A. Visconti and he was asked the following hypothetical question: \u201c* * * Now, bearing in mind your findings and considering the history of an accident given by the petitioner, Mary Grace Giresi, to the effect that on November 20, 1947, while in the employ of the respondent, she-was pressing down on a rubber stopper, pushing with right arm, felt a click and pain in the right collar bone and an immediate raising of the bone, reported that to the company first-aid clinic and received treatment intermittently for about a year, would you say that the incidents I have, described and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>j'our findings would ^how any causal relationship ? A. In my opinion, there is causal relation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The nature of the injury was described by the doctor as \u201ca subluxation of the right sternoclavicular articulation.\u201d \u201cSubluxation\u201d is synonymous with \u201cdislocation.\u201d <em>Gould\u2019s Medical Dictionary, 2nd Edition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The burden of proof was upon the employee to establish a causal relation between the alleged \u201caccident\u201d and the injury, and the only evidence in this case of such causal relationship is to be found, if at all, in Dr. Visconti\u2019s answer to the hypothetical question above quoted. In the hypothetical question, the plaintiff included a hypothesis of an \u201cimmediate raising of the bone\u201d and this record will be searched in vain for testimony to that effect. It is settled law that a hypothetical question to an expert witness based on facts not in evidence is erroneous. <em>Bayonne v. Standard Oil Co., </em>81 N. <em>J. L. </em>717 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1910). <em>Cf. Schwartz v. Howard Savings Institution, </em>117 <em>N. J. L. </em>180 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">There being, in my opinion, no legal evidence in the case to support a finding of causal relationship, I would vote to reverse the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
