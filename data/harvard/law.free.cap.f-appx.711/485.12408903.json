Baldock, United States Circuit Judge</author> <p id=\"b511-23\" pgmap=\"511(21) 512(102)\">In November 2017, Plaintiff Ron Gate-wood, a pro se litigant, filed a Title VII complaint in the District of Colorado. Plaintiff named \u201cVA GOV. Compensation,\u201d Barbara Martinez, and \u201cField Offices\u201d as Defendants but did not allege any facts suggesting Plaintiff was or ever had been an employee of any of these Defendants. Magistrate Judge Gordon P. Gallagher determined this complaint failed to comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 8, as Plaintiff did not set forth a short and plain statement of the facts showing he was entitled to relief, and noted to Plaintiff that Title VII only applies in the employment context. Magistrate Judge Gallagher ordered Plaintiff to file an amendment complaint that satisfied Rule 8 within thirty days.</p> <p id=\"b512-4\" pgmap=\"512\">In December 2017, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint, this time naming \u201cVA-Gov-Compendsation [sic], et al.\u201d as Defendants. In this amended complaint, Plaintiff alleged his first 'claim of relief was \u201cFor The Comp-pension pension-ret-vet age 60 Sept 2018. Gatewood u.s, VA-Gov-Com-pendsation et. al. For the record the VA Gov. in violated a congressional fed circuit app. last ten years.\u201d His second claim of relief stated, \u201cWith unlawful employment practices. Under Title VII discrimination acts. Pro-se attah 8pages civil rights act 42 USC-&amp;2000. in violateion of V\u00c1-Gov-Com-pendsation claim. All final mandate for judgement award.\u201d On January 10, 2018, the district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice because it was \u201cunintelligible and fail[ed] to comply with the pleading requirements of Rule 8.\u201d The district court entered judgment, and Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.</p> <p id=\"b512-5\" pgmap=\"512\">\u201cA pro se litigant\u2019s pleadings are to be construed liberally and held to a less stringent standard than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991). At the same time, this Court \u201ccannot take on the responsibility of serving as the litigant\u2019s attorney in constructing arguments and searching the record.\u201d Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, 425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005) (citing Hall, 935 F.2d at 1110). We question whether Plaintiffs appellate brief adequately Complies with Fed. R. App. P. 28. See id. at 840-41. Nevertheless, we liberally construe Plaintiffs brief to argue the district court erred in dismissing his complaint because of his failure to comply with Rule 8.</p> <p id=\"b512-7\" pgmap=\"512\">Rule 8 requires, among other things, \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]\u201d As Plaintiffs amended complaint clearly fails to meet this standard, the district court appropriately dismissed the complaint. Where the district court accurately analyzes.an issue, we see no useful purpose in writing at length. We AFFIRM for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s order of dismissal. Plaintiffs motion to proceed in for-ma pauperis is DENIED.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b511-26\" pgmap=\"511(31) 512(12)\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1,</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
