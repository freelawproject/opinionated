HOLMES, Circuit Judge</author> <p id=\"b898-16\" pgmap=\"898\">A New Mexico statute makes it illegal to \u201cwillfully interfere with the educational process\u201d at a public school. N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-20-13(D). In 2009, an Albuquerque Police Officer assigned to a middle school as a School Resource Officer (\u201cSRO\u201d) relied on that statute to arrest a thirteen-year-old for skipping class. The main question before us is whether qualified immunity shields that officer from a civil suit arising from the arrest. We find that it does. We also conclude that the plaintiffs other two claims \u2014 for municipal liability and violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 \u2014 have no merit.</p> <p id=\"b898-17\" pgmap=\"898\">I</p> <p id=\"b898-18\" pgmap=\"898(18) 899(29)\">The relevant events happened in January 2009.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time, Quentin Scott<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was a thirteen-year-old seventh-grader at Grant Middle School in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Scott had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and oppositional defiant disorder. Both affected his behavior and concentration when he was in class.</p> <p id=\"b899-5\" pgmap=\"899\">Scott had a \u201c504 plan\u201d \u2014 a document acknowledging that a student has special needs \u2014 and an Individualized Education Program (\u201cIEP\u201d) that detailed how his disabilities might affect him in class. The IEP listed a few accommodations for Scott in the classroom. Specifically, teachers were told to let him choose where he sat, to minimize auditory and visual distractions, and to let him move around the classroom every so often. Scott also had permission to leave the classroom if he was anxious or distracted. See Aplt\u2019s App. at 217-22 (Individualized Education Program, dated Aug. 11, 2008) (advising teachers to give Scott \u201c[fjrequent breaks\u201d and to \u201cencourage [Scott] to ... get a drink\u201d in the hallway if he felt overwhelmed). Scott said that when he had those feelings, he was usually allowed \u201cto just kind of roam the halls\u201d and to \u201cg[e]t [his] mind off whatever was troubling [him].\u201d Id. at 84 (Dep. of Quentin Scott, dated June 8,2015).</p> <p id=\"b899-6\" pgmap=\"899\">Scott usually went to the janitor\u2019s office during these breaks. Id. He later testified that the office \u201cwas just kind of [his] safe haven\u201d and felt that the janitors seemed \u201cvery understanding with [him].\u201d Id. at 84, 86. Most of the time, he helped them sweep or mop the floors. If they were on a break when he arrived, Scott would sit down, read a magazine, and eat sunflower seeds with them. That is what he did on the morning of January 16,2009.</p> <p id=\"b899-8\" pgmap=\"899\">After getting frustrated in typing class, Scott told his teacher that he was taking a break. He left the classroom and sat down at a desk that his teacher had put in the hallway. He tried returning to class a few minutes later, but the lesson was too far ahead by that point, and he \u201cwas already at the point of just being done.\u201d Id. at 201. He signaled to the teacher that he was going for a walk, then headed down the hall to the janitor\u2019s office. See Aplt.\u2019s App. at 201, 209 (Test, of Charlotte Scott) (commenting that Scott was permitted to give \u201ca nonverbal signal\u201d to a teacher whenever he needed a break).</p> <p id=\"b899-9\" pgmap=\"899\">Scott was walking in the school hallway when Lupe Griego, the front desk secretary, noticed that he was out of class. Ms. Griego said something to Scott.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Scott did not hear her, so he continued walking to the janitor\u2019s office. Officer Damon Hensley, the SRO for Grant Middle School, heard Ms. Griego call out Scott\u2019s name. Officer Hensley later testified that, two days before the arrest, Scott had come into school \u201creally late.\u201d Id. at 70. That instance of tardiness, along with the fact that Scott had run away from school once before, led Officer Hensley to think that Scott might be skipping class again. Officer Hensley asked Nancy Wiggins, Scott\u2019s teacher, whether Scott had permission to be in the hallway; Ms. Wiggins told Officer Hensley that she thought that Scott was skipping class.</p> <p id=\"b899-10\" pgmap=\"899(38) 900(40)\">Officer Hensley looked down the hallway towards the janitor\u2019s office. He saw Scott standing \u201clike he was halfway in the door and halfway out the door.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s App. at 72. He walked to the office and asked Scott if he had permission to be there; Scott told Officer Hensley that he did. But Ms. Wiggins, who was standing next to Officer Hensley, disagreed, telling Officer Hensley that Scott was \u201cnot supposed to be\u201d out of class. Id.</p> <p id=\"b900-4\" pgmap=\"900\">Officer Hensley \u201cgrabbed [Scott\u2019s] arm,\u201d \u201cstood [him] up,\u201d and put him in handcuffs. Id. at 203. He took Scott out of the office, walking behind Scott and holding the links that connected the two cuffs. As they walked through the hallway, Scott stopped abruptly a few times because he was \u201cpissed\u201d by Officer Hensley\u2019s physical contact with his person and the physical force he was applying; more specifically, Scott \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be touched.\u201d Id. at 202. When Scott stopped, Officer Hensley would \u201cwrench[ ]\u201d the links to force Scott forward. Id.</p> <p id=\"b900-5\" pgmap=\"900\">They were in the hallway when the class bell rang. Crowds of students rushed out of nearby classrooms. Scott, still handcuffed, was suddenly surrounded by his peers and classmates. Officer Hensley continued to walk behind Scott and shove him forward by the handcuffs. Scott felt that this was deliberate. It seemed as though Officer Hensley \u201cwanted other kids to see [him] being dragged around\u201d and to \u201cset it in [Scott\u2019s] head that [he] was a piece of shit,\u201d Id. at 198.</p> <p id=\"b900-6\" pgmap=\"900\">They reached Officer Hensley\u2019s office a few minutes later. He ordered Scott to sit. According to Scott\u2019s testimony, Officer Hensley began \u201cinterrogating\u201d and mocking Scott, who had started crying out of fear. After about twenty minutes, Ms. Wiggins and two other school administrators came into Officer Hensley\u2019s office to meet with Scott.</p> <p id=\"b900-11\" pgmap=\"900\">That meeting lasted for about an hour. Scott was handcuffed the entire time. Scott repeatedly complained to the administrators during the meeting about the pain that he was experiencing because of the handcuffs. Eventually, they noticed that Scott was in so much pain that he could not lift his arms to wipe away his tears, so Ms. Wiggins managed to loosen the handcuffs. Still, even after the cuffs were loosened, Scott felt pain in his arms and wrists. According to his testimony, his wrists \u201cwere bruised and swollen\u201d for \u201cat least a week afterwards.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id. at 204.</p> <p id=\"b900-12\" pgmap=\"900\">The meeting ended. Officer Hensley then took Scott \u2014 still in handcuffs \u2014 to the Juvenile Detention Center in Albuquerque (\u201cJDC\u201d). Id. at 69, 225 (Officer Hensley testifying that, pursuant to department policy, he \u201c[p]robably\u201d always handcuffs children when taking them to the Juvenile Detention Center). There, Scott was booked and charged with violating New Mexico Statute section 30-20-13(D), which provides that \u201c[n]o person shall willfully interfere with the educational process of any public or private school by\u201d doing anything that \u201cwould ... interfere with or obstruct the lawful mission, processes, procedures or functions of a public or private school.\u201d N.M. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 30-20-13(D).</p> <p id=\"b900-13\" pgmap=\"900(64) 901(13)\">Scott filed a lawsuit against Officer Hensley, Chief of Police Ray Schultz, and the City of Albuquerque (\u201cCity\u201d). In his complaint, Scott brought claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983: specifically, invoking the Fourth Amendment, Scott alleged that his arrest was unlawful and that Officer Hensley used unconstitutionally excessive force in effecting the arrest. The complaint also alleged that the arrest violated the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, and included a municipal-liability claim against the City.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b901-5\" pgmap=\"901\">Scott moved for partial summary judgment on his Fourth Amendment claims. The defendants then moved for summary judgment on all of Scott\u2019s claims. The district court denied Scott\u2019s motion and granted the defendants\u2019 motion.</p> <p id=\"b901-7\" pgmap=\"901\">In its order, the district court found that Officer Hensley was entitled to qualified immunity on Scott\u2019s Fourth Amendment unlawful-arrest and excessive-force claims. Scott argues that the court erred in reaching that conclusion.</p> <p id=\"b901-8\" pgmap=\"901\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. See Water Pik, Inc. v. Med-Sys., Inc., 726 F.3d 1136, 1143 (10th Cir. 2013). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Crv. P. 56(a). We view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor. See, e.g., Talavera ex rel. Gonzalez v. Wiley, 725 F.3d 1262, 1267 (10th Cir. 2013).</p> <p id=\"b901-9\" pgmap=\"901\">Qualified immunity protects governmental officials from liability for civil damages for conduct that does not violate dearly-established statutory or constitutional rights. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (per curiam). We review qualified-immunity summary-judgment decisions differently from other summary-judgment decisions. See Cortez v. McCauley, 478 F.3d 1108, 1114 (10th Cir. 2007) (en banc). When a defendant asserts a qualified-im-rnunity defense, the plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant violated a federal constitutional or statutory right, and (2) that the right was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct. See Quinn v. Young, 780 F.3d 998, 1004 (10th Cir. 2015). If a plaintiff fails to establish either prong, the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity. See Cox v. Glanz, 800 F.3d 1231, 1245 (10th Cir. 2015).</p> <p id=\"b901-11\" pgmap=\"901\">A</p> <p id=\"b901-12\" pgmap=\"901\">Scott argues that Officer Hensley is not shielded by qualified immunity on the unlawful-arrest claim. Specifically, he contends that (1) the arrest was unconstitutional, since Officer Hensley lacked probable cause; and (2) Officer Hensley should have been on notice that the arrest was unlawful because the Fourth Amendment right that he violated was clearly established at the time.</p> <p id=\"b901-13\" pgmap=\"901\">Scott is half right. The arrest was unconstitutional, but Scott\u2019s right was not clearly established in January 2009. The district court correctly determined that Officer Hensley is entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.</p> <p id=\"b901-14\" pgmap=\"901\">1</p> <p id=\"b901-15\" pgmap=\"901\"> A warrantless arrest violates the Fourth Amendment unless the arresting officer had probable cause to make the arrest. E.g., Keylon v. City of Albuquerque, 535 F.3d 1210, 1216 (10th Cir. 2008). An officer has probable cause whenever he knows of reasonably trustworthy facts that would lead a prudent person to believe that the arrestee is committing \u2014 or has committed \u2014 a crime. Id.</p> <p id=\"b902-3\" pgmap=\"902\">More specifically, the question here is whether Officer Hensley had an objectively reasonable belief that Scott had violated section 30-20-13(D). The district court found that he did. It pointed out that \u201cOfficer Hensley knew Mr. Scott\u2019s absence from health class had involved the time and attention of three school officials\u201d and that it had \u201cdisrupt[ed] Ms. Wiggins\u2019 preparation for her next class and the class itself.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s App. at 314. Based on that information, the court reasoned, \u201ca reasonable officer could have believed that [there was] probable cause\u201d to arrest Scott for violating section 30-20-13(D). Id.</p> <p id=\"b902-4\" pgmap=\"902\">We disagree. Our qualified-immunity inquiry focuses on whether Scott\u2019s federal constitutional rights were violated. See., e.g., Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 146, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979) (\u201cSection 1983 imposes liability for violations of rights protected by the Constitution.... \u201d). But Scott\u2019s unlawful-arrest claim asks us to determine if Officer Hensley had probable cause under a state statute. So, because this is a case in which the federal constitutional question \u201cdepends on the contours of a state\u2019s substantive criminal law,\u201d we rely on New Mexico state courts\u2019 interpretations of that law. Kaufman v. Higgs, 697 F.3d 1297, 1300-01 (10th Cir. 2012). The New Mexico Supreme Court is the ultimate authority on that question. Id. at 1301. \u201cWhen a state Supreme Court has not spoken on the question at issue, we assume (without deciding) that a reasonable officer would seek guidance regarding the scope of proper conduct at least in part from any on-point decisions of the state\u2019s intermediate court of appeals.\u201d A.M. v. Holmes, 830 F.3d 1123, 1140-41 (10th Cir. 2016), cert. denied sub nom. A.M. ex rel. F.M. v. Acosta, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 2151, 198 L.Ed.2d 221 (2017).</p> <p id=\"b902-7\" pgmap=\"902\">Section 30-20-13(D) prohibits anybody from \u201cwillfully interfering] with the educational process.\u201d N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-20-13(D) (emphasis added). The word \u201cwillfully\u201d suggests that a violation occurs only when a person acts with the conscious objective of \u201cinterfering] with the educational process.\u201d Id. In other words, it is not enough that a person simply \u201ccommit[s] an[ ] act\u201d that \u201cdisrupts] ... [the] functions of\u2019 a school; to violate section 30-2043(D), that person must act with the conscious purpose of \u201cinterfering] with the educational process.\u201d \u00a7 30-20-13(D).</p> <p id=\"b902-9\" pgmap=\"902\">New Mexico\u2019s courts have adopted this understanding of \u201cwillfulness.\u201d In Rio Grande Gas Co. v. Gilbert, 83 N.M. 274, 491 P.2d 162 (1971), the New Mexico Supreme Court faced the question of whether a party\u2019s discovery violations had been \u201cwillful.\u201d Id. at 164. In holding that the violations were, in fact, willful, the court noted that \u201ca willful violation of a provision of a statute or regulation is any conscious or intentional failure to comply therewith, as distinguished from accidental or involuntary noncompliance.\u201d Id. at 166 (quoting Brookdale Mill v. Rowley, 218 F.2d 728, 729 (6th Cir. 1954)).</p> <p id=\"b902-10\" pgmap=\"902(131) 903(26)\">The New Mexico Court of Appeals came to a similar conclusion in Holguin v. Sally Beauty Supply Inc., 150 N.M. 636, 264 P.3d 732, 736-37 (Ct. App. 2011). There, the court was asked to construe a state statute that provided merchants with a conditional privilege to detain a customer when the merchant had probable cause to believe that the customer \u201cwillfully concealed]\u201d merchandise. Id. at 736-37. The court found that \u201c[t]he term \u2018willfully\u2019 ... indicates an intent which requires more than merely putting merchandise out of sight.\u201d Id. at 736. Instead, the court held that probable cause for the conditional privilege exists only when the facts show \u201cthat the purpose of the concealment is adverse to the store owner\u2019s right to be paid for the merchandise.\u201d Id. at 737 (emphasis added). In other words, probable cause for \u201cwillful\u201d concealment required a reasonable belief that the customer hid something for the purpose of stealing it. Id.</p> <p id=\"b903-4\" pgmap=\"903\">This understanding of the term \u201cwillful\u201d is consonant with the common understanding of the term. Specifically, \u201cwillful\u201d means \u201cintentional\u201d or \u201cdeliberate.\u201d The New Oxford American Dictionary 1922 (2d ed. 2005). And, in legal usage, a \u201cwillful\u201d act is a \u201cvoluntary and intentional\u201d one, \u201cinvolv[ing] conscious wrong or evil purpose on the part of the actor.\u201d Willful, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2009) [hereinafter Black\u2019s]; see also Rollin M. Perkins &amp; Ronald N. Boyce, Criminal Law, 875-76 (3d ed. 1982) (\u201c[T]he require-ment added by [the word \u2018willful\u2019] is not satisfied unless there is a bad purpose or evil intent.\u201d). Or, put another way, \u201c \u2018willfulness\u2019 involves the voluntary, intentional violation or disregard of a known legal duty.\u201d Willfulness, BLACK\u2019S, supra (emphasis added).</p> <p id=\"b903-8\" pgmap=\"903\">We read the term \u201cwillfully\u201d in section 30-20-13(D) in this manner. More specifically, we conclude that New Mexico legislature sought to bar conduct that was designed to \u201cinterfere with the educational process,\u201d rather than conduct that merely happened to have that effect. In our view, the statute is not \u201cgenuinely ambiguous,\u201d and we are able to reach this conclusion without \u201chard interpretive work.\u201d Heien v. North Carolina, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 530, 541, 190 L.Ed.2d 475 (2014) (Kagan, J., concurring).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b904-3\" pgmap=\"904\">Based on the facts of this case, nothing would have given Officer Hensley the reasonable belief that Scott was \u201cwillfully\u201d trying to interfere with the educational process at Grant Middle School. True, Scott\u2019s absence eventually led to somebody pulling Ms. Wiggins from her classroom and Ms. Griego from her desk. Aplt.\u2019s App. at 72 (Officer Hensley testifying that he \u201cgot Ms. Wiggins\u201d and \u201ctook her out of class\u201d). But no reasonable officer would have believed that Scott went to the janitor\u2019s office with the intent of distracting school employees from other tasks. Indeed, Scott gave every indication that he was not trying to cause a disruption or break a rule. He made no disturbance as he left his classroom, and told Officer Hensley and Ms. Wiggins that he believed that he had permission to be outside the classroom at the time. If anything, Scott left the classroom to avoid disrupting his class: he left because he knew that when \u201c[he] would get too antsy or frustrated, ... it would just be bad if [he] kept on\u201d trying to work through the typing lesson. Id. at 200. That, after all, was the purpose of his IEP accommodations in the first place. See id. at 208 (Test. of Charlotte Scott) (commenting that the IEP accommodations were in place because \u201cth[e teachers and administrators] didn\u2019t want [Scott] to explode in the classroom\u201d).</p> <p id=\"aer-dedup-0\" pgmap=\"904\">None of this would suggest that Scott \u201cwillfully interfered] with the educational process\u201d by going to, and sitting in, the janitor\u2019s office. Cf. G.M. ex rel. B.M. v. Casalduc, 982 F.Supp.2d 1235, 1243 (D.N.M. 2013) (\u201cB.M.\u2019s conduct does not clearly fall outside the conduct prohibited by the plain language of the statute [i.e., section 30-20-13(D)]. B.M. ignored numerous requests to stop texting during class in violation of HMS policy. Unable to continue instruction, her teacher stopped class and eventually summoned Dean O\u2019Gawa. After being removed from class, B.M. continued refusing to hand over her cell phone as required by school procedure,\u201d). We conclude, therefore, that Officer Hensley had no probable cause to arrest Scott under section 30-20-13(D). And since a war-rantless arrest-without probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment, Keylon, 535 F.3d at 1216, Scott has shown that Officer Hensley violated Scott\u2019s right to be. free from unlawful arrest.</p> <p id=\"b904-7\" pgmap=\"904\">2.</p> <p id=\"b904-8\" pgmap=\"904\"> The next question is whether that right was clearly established in January 2009. A plaintiff ordinarily may show that a particular right was clearly established by pointing to an on-point decision from the U.S. Supreme Court or the Tenth Circuit. See, e.g., Quinn, 780 F.3d at 1005. But, as previously noted, we often look to state-court decisions when we are asked to decide a question that \u201cdepends on the contours of a state\u2019s substantive criminal law.\u201d Kaufman, 697 F.3d at 1300-01; see also A.M., 830 F.3d at 1140-41 (noting that state intermediate appellate courts can provide guidance in a clearly-established-law inquiry that involves construing state criminal law).</p> <p id=\"b905-4\" pgmap=\"905\">In AM., where an officer arrested a student under section 30-20-13(D) for \u201crepeatedly fake-burping, laughing, and (later) leaning into the classroom,\u201d 830 F.3d at 1148, we held in analyzing the clearly-established-law question that there were \u201cno Supreme Court or published Tenth Circuit decisions\u201d that squarely addressed 30-20-13(D)\u2019s probable-cause requirements in 2011, id. at 1140. The same necessarily must be true for Officer Hensley\u2019s violation, which occurred almost two years before the challenged conduct in AM.</p> <p id=\"b905-5\" pgmap=\"905\">Without any on-point federal cases, Scott relies instead on State v. Silva, 86 N.M. 543, 525 P.2d 903, 903 (Ct. App. 1974), a 1974 case from the New Mexico Court of Appeals. \u201cSilva involved a distant statutory predecessor of N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-20-13.\u201d A.M., 830 F.3d at 1143. Under that provision, students who staged a sit-in inside a university president\u2019s office were charged with interfering with the \u201cmission, processes, procedures or functions\u201d of a university. Id. at 905 (quoting N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 40A-20-10(C) (1974)). Scott contends that Silva constitutes clearly-established law that defined the contours of probable cause for his arrest.

Scott argues that \u201cthe force Officer Hensley used \u2014 in parading [Scott] through the school\u2019s halls in handcuffs and transporting him to the JDC \u2014 [was] excessive.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Opening Br. at 25. He notes that the arrest took place in front of his peers and other students, and that the tight handcuffs left his wrists bruised and swollen for a week after the arrest. The district court ruled that Scott had not demonstrated a constitutional violation. We agree, and conclude that Officer Hensley is entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.</p> <p id=\"b906-4\" pgmap=\"906\">\u201cUnder well-settled Supreme Court precedent, a law-enforcement officer\u2019s \u2018right to make an arrest ... necessarily carries with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion ... to effect it.\u201d A.M., 830 F.3d at 1151 (quoting Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)).

See, e.g., Graham, 490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865 (\u201cThe \u2018reasonableness\u2019 of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d); Weigel v. Broad, 544 F.3d 1143, 1151 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201cThe \u2018inquiry in an excessive force case is an objective one: the question is whether the officers\u2019 actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to underlying intent or motivation.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Graham, 490 U.S. at 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865)); see also Lundstrom v.

See, e.g., Thomson, 584 F.3d at 1313 (noting that \u201cReasonableness is evaluated under a totality of the circumstances approach\u201d); accord Estate of Larsen ex rel. Sturdivan v. Murr, 511 F.3d 1255, 1260 (10th Cir. 2008). This involves (but is not limited to) examining \u201cthe severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d Graham, 490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865.</p> <p id=\"b906-7\" pgmap=\"906\">Critically, however, \u201cour precedent requires a showing in a handcuffing case of an actual, non-de minimis physical, emotional, or dignitary injury to succeed on a claim.\u201d Fisher v. City of Las Cruces, 584 F.3d 888, 899 (10th Cir. 2009); accord A.M., 830 F.3d at 1151-52; see also Cortez v. McCauley, 478 F.3d 1108, 1129 (10th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (\u201cWe believe that a claim of excessive force requires some actual injury that is not de minimis, be it physical or emotional.\u201d). \u201cThis is because \u2018[hjandcuffing claims, in essence, concern the manner or course in which a petitioner is handcuffed,\u2019 and \u2018[bjecause handcuffing itself is not necessarily an excessive use of force in connection with an arrest.\u2019 \u201d A.M., 830 F.3d at 1152 (alterations in original) (quoting Fisher, 584 F.3d at 897); cf. United States v.

Like the district court, we conclude that Scott\u2019s excessive-force claim fails to satisfy this non-de minimis-injury standard. Quite apart from whether one or more of the Graham factors noted above (e.g., severity of the crime) favors him, this failure is determinative.</p> <p id=\"b907-4\" pgmap=\"907\">Scott alleges that the cuffs were \u201cuncomfortably tight\u201d when Officer Hensley put them on. Aplt.\u2019s App. at 203. Ms. Wiggins loosened the cuffs after about twenty minutes, but Scott testified that he was in pain for the week after the arrest. Unduly tight handcuffs can, in some cases, amount to excessive force. See Cortez, 478 F.3d at 1128-29 (\u201cIn some circumstances, unduly tight handcuffing can constitute excessive force where a plaintiff alleges some actual injury from the handcuffing and alleges that an officer ignored a plaintiffs timely complaints (or was otherwise made aware) that the handcuffs were too tight.\u201d (emphasis added)). But a plaintiff still must make a showing that the handcuffs caused \u201csome actual injury that is not de minimis\u201d before we can find a constitutional violation. Id. at 1129. Scott fails to make this showing.</p> <p id=\"b907-5\" pgmap=\"907\">Scott testified that his wrists \u201cwere bruised and swollen\u201d for \u201cabout a week\u201d after the arrest, and that \u201canything [he] did [that involved] moving [his] wrists hurt.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s App. at 131, 204. He also alleged that the cuffs left \u201credness, soreness and indentations\u201d on his wrists. Id. at 115 (Pls\u2019 Interrog. No. 17). Yet, he concedes that he never got any medical treatment for his injuries and that the injuries were gone after about a week.</p> <p id=\"b907-6\" pgmap=\"907\">This is not enough to show a constitutional violation. We have rejected minor, temporary injuries \u2014 like pain, numbness, or swelling \u2014 as de minimis in handcuff-related excessive-force cases. For example, in Koch v. City of Del City, 660 F.3d 1228, 1247-48 (10th Cir. 2011), we concluded that a plaintiff had failed to show \u201c \u2018actual injury\u2019 \u201d when she alleged superficial abrasions and lingering nerve pain in her wrists. Id. Similarly, in Segura v. Jones, 259 Fed.Appx. 95, 103-04 (10th Cir. 2007) (unpublished), a panel of our court found no more than a de minimis injury stemming from tight handcuffs. Id.; cf. Vondrak v. City of Las Cruces, 535 F.3d 1198, 1209-10 (10th Cir. 2008) (concluding that a plaintiff established a constitutional violation when tightened handcuffs caused permanent nerve damage in plaintiffs wrist).</p> <p id=\"b907-9\" pgmap=\"907\">Scott\u2019s injuries are no different. Even though he was in pain for hours while wearing the handcuffs, that pain did not last long. And the handcuffs left no permanent injury: the swelling went down after about a week, and the bruises faded around the same time. See Aplt.\u2019s App. at 204 (Scott testifying that he had no \u201cproblems with [his] wrists\u201d on the day he was deposed). Simply put, Scott\u2019s injuries were not severe enough to render Officer Hensley\u2019s force excessive.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b907-10\" pgmap=\"907(94) 908(91)\">The same is true for Scott\u2019s emotional injuries. Scott said that he was humiliated when Officer Hensley walked him through the school hallways in handcuffs during a break between classes. Scott felt that Officer Hensley had \u201cmade it his mission to embarrass [him] and set it in [Scott\u2019s] head that [he] was a piece of shit.\u201d Aplt\u2019s App. at 198. However, Officer Hensley\u2019s intent cannot factor into our analysis. See Graham, 490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865 (noting that the excessive-force analysis should be \u201cwithout regard to ... underlying intent or motivation\u201d); accord Weigel v. Broad, 544 F.3d at 1151. To be sure, we have recognized that, in some cases, an excessive-force claim may stand on an emotional injury like humiliation. See, e.g., Fisher, 584 F.3d at 903. But, in the context of an arrest, the alleged humiliation must be more harmful than that which accompanies the typical custodial arrest. See Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 354, 121 S.Ct. 1536, 149 L.Ed.2d 549 (2001); Petersen v. Farnsworth, 371 F.3d 1219, 1223 (10th Cir. 2004).</p> <p id=\"b908-4\" pgmap=\"908\">Scott\u2019s arrest does not fit that description. Though Scott was surely humiliated when his peers saw him walking through the hallways in handcuffs, a public arrest does not violate the Fourth Amendment simply because it is embarrassing. See Atwater, 532 U.S. at 354-55, 121 S.Ct. 1536; Cortez, 478 F.3d at 1128. In short, Officer Hensley\u2019s use of force fell short of being \u201cexcessive,\u201d as the law defines that term. Scott has therefore failed to show a constitutional violation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b908-7\" pgmap=\"908\">Ill</p> <p id=\"acn-dedup-1\" pgmap=\"908\"> Scott also argues that the City employed a \u201cde facto policy\u201d of (1) failing to train SROs \u201cbefore placement in a school which serves special education students,\u201d and (2) giving SROs \u201cunbridled discretion to arrest students with special needs.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 37, 39. These policies, Scott argues, effectively \u201crequire[d] the arrest\u201d of Scott for -skipping class on. January 16, 2009.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id. at 37.</p> <p id=\"b909-4\" pgmap=\"909\">To establish municipal liability, a plaintiff must show (1) the \u201cexistence of a municipal custom or policy\u201d and (2) a \u201cdirect causal link between the custom or policy and the violation alleged.\u201d Jenkins v. Wood, 81 F.3d 988, 993 (10th Cir. 1996). \u201cTo establish the causation element, the challenged policy or practice must be \u2018closely related to the violation of the plaintiffs federally protected right.\u2019 \u201d Schneider v. City of Grand Junction Police Dep\u2019t, 717 F.3d 760, 770 (10th Cir. 2013) (quoting Martin A. Schwartz, SECTION 1983 LITIGATION CLAIMS &amp; DEFENSES, \u00a7 7.12[B] (2013)); accord Cacioppo v. Town of Vail, Colo., 528 Fed.Appx. 929, 932 (10th Cir. 2013) (unpublished). In this regard, a \u201cmunicipality is not liable solely because its employees caused an injury,\u201d but rather, because the municipality, \u201c[t]hrough its [own] deliberate conduct, ... [was] the \u2018moving force\u2019 behind the injury.\u201d Mocek v. City of Albuquerque, 813 F.3d 912, 933 (10th Cir. 2015).</p> <p id=\"b909-5\" pgmap=\"909\">Scott fails to meet this standard. Specifically, he has not demonstrated that the alleged policies that he has identified\u2014 failing to train SROs placed in special-education school settings and giving them free rein in arresting special-needs children \u2014 are directly relevant to the constitutional violation \u2014 i.e., arresting a student without probable cause that the student willfully interfered with the educational process at a school \u2014 much less that the policies were the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the violation. Mocek, 813 F.3d at 933. For exaipple, Scott does not specify what training the officers should have possessed and how the lack of that training was a moving force behind his unlawful arrest. Furthermore, his assertion that the City, as a matter of de facto policy, granted its officers \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d to arrest special-needs students is wholly conclusory. And, even if Scott were able to demonstrate that the City\u2019s SROs repeatedly arrested special-needs students under section 30-20-13(D) for willful interference with the educational process, one could not reasonably infer from this proof \u2014 -without more \u2014 that such conduct was the product of an unconstitutional de facto policy. Special-needs students are not immune from arrest under this statute, and section 30-2043(D) may well reach in certain instances willful conduct committed by such students that amounts to (in Scott\u2019s words) no more than \u201cchildhood misbehavior.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 41. Accordingly, these two policies cannot sustain Scott\u2019s municipal-liability claim.</p> <p id=\"b909-8\" pgmap=\"909(57) 910(44)\">\u25a0 Scott tries again in his reply brief. There, he shifts the focus away from special-needs students and simply avers that there was \u201ca pattern of Albuquerque police officers enforcing [section 30-20-13(D) ] in an over broad manner.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Reply Br. at 7. But that argument also fails to establish municipal liability. First, the argument was never raised in his opening brief, so we consider it waived. United States v. Wayne, 591 F.3d 1326, 1332 n.4 (10th Cir. 2010) (\u201cBecause [the appellant] raised this argument for the first time in her reply brief, she has waived it on appeal.\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b910-4\" pgmap=\"910\">And second, even if we did consider the argument, it still fails to show municipal liability. The policy articulated in Scott\u2019s reply brief concerns officers\u2019 practice of arresting students for \u201cdisruptions that were' not the result of \u2018physical intrusions.\u2019 \u201d Apli\u2019s Reply Br. at 6-7. Scott\u2019s argument on this point seems derived from his reading of Silva, 525 P.2d at 907, in which the New Mexico Court of Appeals found that the statute at issue required a \u201cmore physical invasion\u201d than a simple disturbance of the peace. But we rejected this analogy in A.M., 830 F.3d at 1144-48 (declining to use Silva to guide our construction of section 30-20-13(D)). Simply put, an officer may arrest a student under section 30-20-13(D), even when the student\u2019s conduct does not involve a physical intrusion. Thus, even if the City had a policy that authorized officers to make such non-physical-intrusion arrests when supported by probable cause, that policy would not run afoul of the Constitution. Accordingly, it ineluctably follows that such a policy could not have directly caused (i.e., been the moving force behind) the constitutional violation here.</p> <p id=\"b910-5\" pgmap=\"910\">In sum, for the foregoing reasons, Scott\u2019s municipal-liability claim is without merit.</p> <p id=\"b910-6\" pgmap=\"910\">IV</p> <p id=\"b910-7\" pgmap=\"910\"> Finally, Scott argues that the district court erred in granting' summary judgment to the defendants on his ADA claim. We disagree.</p> <p id=\"b910-8\" pgmap=\"910\">Title II of the ADA states that \u201cno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subject to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. To make out his ADA claim, Scott has to show that he (1) has a disability; (2) was discriminated against by a public entity; and (3) the discrimination was \u201cby reason of [his] disability.\u201d Gohier v. Enright, 186 F.3d 1216, 1219 (10th Cir. 1999).</p> <p id=\"b910-10\" pgmap=\"910\">Scott argues that \u201c[i]f [he] had not been disabled, he would have had no need to leave class.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 33. When \u201cOfficer Hensley handcuffed, arrested, transported and charged Scott,\u201d he continues, Officer Hensley did so \u201cbecause [Scott] was disabled.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).</p> <p id=\"b910-11\" pgmap=\"910\">Not so. In some cases, a plaintiffs \u201cdisability might cause the police to incorrectly suspect that an individual committed a crime.\u201d J.H. ex rel. J.P. v. Bernalillo Cty., 806 F.3d 1255, 1260 (10th Cir. 2015). But Scott is not arguing that Officer Hensley mistook his disability itself for illegal conduct. Instead, he argues that Officer Hensley arrested Scott because of the manifestations of his disability. See Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 21 (\u201cOfficer Hensley violated the ADA by arresting [Scott] for a manifestation of his disability.\u201d)</p> <p id=\"b910-12\" pgmap=\"910(105) 911(63)\">And we have repeatedly rejected such arguments. For instance, J.H. ex rel. J.P. v. Bernalillo Cty., 806 F.3d at 1260, we held that an SRO did not arrest a student \u201cbecause of [his] disability\u201d when the student kicked a teacher; we expressly held that an arrest based on the manifestation of a student\u2019s disability was not equivalent to an arrest became of that disability. And, in J.V. v. Albuquerque Public Schools, 813 F.3d 1289, 1296 (10th Cir. 2016), we held that a SRO did not arrest a student \u201cby reason of disability\u201d when the student was disruptive for two hours. Id. In doing so, we noted that there was \u201cno authority suggesting [that] a school may not regulate a student\u2019s conduct if that conduct is a manifestation of a disability.\u201d Id. This case is no different from J.H. or J.V. Officer Hensley did not arrest Scott because Scott was disabled; he arrested Scott because he thought that Scott was \u201cinterfer[ing] with the educational process.\u201d \u00a7 30-20-13(D).</p> <p id=\"b911-5\" pgmap=\"911\">Scott also argues that the City, through Officer Hensley, failed to provide reasonable accommodations to Scott during the arrest. Specifically, he alleges that \u201cthe City established no meaningful policies to accommodate disabled children\u201d and \u201crequire[d] that all children ... be transported by an officer [while] handcuffed,\u201d regardless of \u201cthe child\u2019s age or health status.\u201d Id. at 36. Scott contends that this policy violated his rights under the ADA.</p> <p id=\"b911-6\" pgmap=\"911\">We have never adopted a failure-to-train claim of discrimination under the ADA in the context of an arrest. See, e.g., J.V., 813 F.3d at 1297 (\u201cThis circuit has not recognized a failure-to-train claim of discrimination under the ADA, but we have not foreclosed the possibility.\u201d); Gohier, 186 F.3d at 1221. But, even assuming arguen-do this was the law here, Scott\u2019s claim would still fail.</p> <p id=\"b911-7\" pgmap=\"911\">Crucially, Scott never points to any evidence of (1) a request for an accommodation; or (2) a reason that Officer Hensley should have known that he needed an accommodation, Instead, he points only to the fact that Officer Hensley knew about Scott\u2019s diagnosis of bipolar disorder. (The record bears this out. In his deposition, Officer Hensley was asked if Scott had been \u201cdiagnosed with bipolar disorder!.]\u201d Aplt.\u2019s App. at 67. He replied that Scott\u2019s \u201cparents had told [Officer Hensley] that\u201d during a meeting with Officer Hensley. Id. That meeting was \u201cprobably the week pri- or to [Scott\u2019s] arrest.\u201d Id.)</p> <p id=\"Ap50\" pgmap=\"911\">But knowledge of that diagnosis, without more, would not necessarily make Officer Hensley aware that Scott needed an accommodation. See J.V., 813 F.3d at 1299 (\u201c[A]n ADA plaintiff must show an obvious need for an accommodation.\u201d); J.H., 806 F.3d at 1261 (concluding that it would \u201cconflate[ ] a disability with a need for an accommodation\u201d to expect an accommodation whenever an official is aware of a diagnosis).</p> <p id=\"b911-9\" pgmap=\"911\">And though Scott argues that the City\u2019s failure to train amounted to a failure to accommodate his disability, he never explains why. His claim fails without that explanation. See, e.g., J.V., 813 F.3d at 1300 n.8 (\u201cWhile plaintiff attempts to pose training in dealing with those with mental health problems a an \u2018accommodation,\u2019 it is well-settled that the failure to train must have caused some violation of law for an action against a municipality to lie.\u201d (quoting Waller ex. rel.

Though Officer Hensley does not cite Heien or contend that he committed a mistake of law in arresting (i.e., seizing) Scott, assuming ar-guendo that Heien\u2019s principles apply with full force to Fourth Amendment seizures resulting in arrests, and not just traffic stops, we believe two observations may clarify the course of our analysis.</p> <p id=\"b903-6\" pgmap=\"903\">First, the Heien majority stressed that \u201c[t]he Fourth Amendment tolerates only reasonable mistakes,\u201d id. at 539, and Justice Kagan helpfully elaborated in concurrence that the laws that might be amenable to such mistakes of law are \u201cgenuinely ambiguous\u201d and \u201cpose[] a quite difficult question of interpretation\u201d that involves \u201chard interpretive work,\u201d id. at 541 (Kagan, J., concurring); see also United States v. Diaz, 854 F.3d 197, 204 n.12 (2d Cir. 2017) (noting that \"it is only when the legal question is unsettled that an officer\u2019s erroneous assessment of the law can be objectively reasonable\u201d). A panel of our court has similarly viewed Heien as laying down restrictive \"ground rules\u201d governing its applicability. United States v. Cunningham, 630 Fed.Appx. 873, 876 (10th Cir. 2015) (unpublished). Given our assessment of the unambiguous nature of section 30-20-13(D)/ even if Officer Hensley had claimed a mistake of law, he could not avail himself of Heien\u2019s holding. Cf. Heien, 135 S.Ct. at 540 (discussing the ambiguities of the North Carolina statute at issue that permitted a reasonable mistake of law); Cunningham, 630 Fed.Appx. at 878 &amp; n.6 (conducting a similar analysis of the ambiguities of a Colorado statute). That is, we would still conclude that his arrest of Scott violated the Fourth Amendment.</p> <p id=\"a0t-dedup-0\" pgmap=\"903(101) 904(123)\">And, second, our conclusion that Officer Hensley could not claim a reasonable mistake of law does not mean that he cannot demonstrate that he satisfies the qualified-immunity standard on the clearly-established-law element, and indeed we conclude infra that he has. In this regard, Heien stressed that \"qualified immunity ... depends on an inquiry distinct from whether an officer has committed a constitutional violation\u201d and that \"the [constitutional-violation] inquiry is not as forgiving as the one employed in the distinct context of deciding whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity for a constitutional or statute-ry violation.\u201d Heien, 135 S.Ct. at 537, 539 (emphasis added); see also Corrigan v. District of Columbia, 841 F.3d 1022, 1046 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (Brown, J., dissenting) (\"What \u2018every reasonable\u2019 official would have understood to be \u2018clearly established\u2019 in case law is not the same question as what is \u2018objectively reasonable' for purposes of determining a Fourth Amendment violation.\u2019\u2019). Therefore, under the less stringent qualified-immunity inquiry, we may conclude (as we do) that Officer Hensley is entitled to qualified immunity because his \"conclusions rest[ed] on an objectively reasonable, even if mistaken, belief that probable cause exist[ed].\u2019\u2019 Stonecipher v. Valles, 759 F.3d 1134, 1141 (10th Cir. 2014); see A.M., 830 F.3d at 1140 (collecting cases regarding the concept of \u201carguable probable cause\u201d).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"7\"> <p id=\"b905-6\" pgmap=\"905\">. We recognize that pre-2009 Supreme Court authority in New Mexico had established a general understanding of the term \"willful,\u201d Gilbert, 491 P.2d at 164, 166, and (as demonstrated supra) the illegality of Officer Hensley's arrest of Scott turns at least in substantial part on that understanding. In contrast, this was arguably not true in the analogous case of AM. See e.g., 830 F.3d at 1148 (arresting student for \"repeatedly fake-burping, laughing, and (later) leaning into the classroom\u201d). However, as AM. indicates, no controlling federal or New Mexico caselaw had clearly established the requirements for probable cause under section 30-20-13(D) in January 2009 \u2014 including regarding the \"willfulness\u201d requirement. More specifically, no New Mexico appellate court had applied the general understanding of \"willfulness\u201d to a prosecution under section 30-20-13(D). In our view, in the circumstances of this case, that forecloses the possibility of finding clearly- . established law. \"As th[e] [Supreme] Court explained decades ago, the clearly established law must be 'particularized' to the facts of the case.\u201d White v. Pauly, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 548, 552, 196 L.Ed.2d 463 (2017) (per curiam) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)); see Mullenix v. Luna, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 305, 308, 193 L.Ed.2d 255 (2015) (\"The dispositive question is 'whether the vio-lative nature of particular conduct is clearly established.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 742, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011))), Here, Scott has not demonstrated that it was clearly-established law in January 2009 that the general understanding of \"willfulness\u201d was controlling in the section 30-20-13(D) context \u2014 by. \u201ciden-tiffing] a case where an officer acting under similar circumstances as Officer [Hensley] was held to have violated the Fourth Amendment,\u201d White, 137 S.Ct. at 552, or otherwise. In particular, we conclude that the settled general understanding among New Mexico courts regarding the meaning of \"willful\u201dwould not have put the unlawfulness of Officer Hensley\u2019s conduct under section 30-20-13(D) \"beyond debate\u201d in January 2009. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 741, 131 S.Ct. 2074; accord Mullenix, 136 S.Ct. at 308.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"8\"> <p id=\"b907-7\" pgmap=\"907\">. Though the inadequacy of Scott's injuries do not make the following point material to our analysis, we note that Scott\u2019s injuries may in part stem from his own conduct rather than any physical aggression of Officer Hensley. By Scott\u2019s own admission, he would abruptly stop while being led through the hallway in handcuffs by Officer Hensley because he was \u201cpissed\u201d and did not anyone to \"touch\u201d him. Aplt.\u2019s App. at 202. Even accepting Scott\u2019s own version of the facts then, we may reasonably infer that, insofar as Scott\u2019s injuries were caused by the friction between the handcuffs and his wrists, his abrupt stops contributed to or exacerbated that friction.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"9\"> <p id=\"b908-5\" pgmap=\"908\">, We are not blind to the obvious facts: At the time of the arrest, Scott was thirteen years old. The psychological effects of an arrest on somebody that young are bound to be more severe than they would be for an adult. See Hedgepeth v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit, 284 F.Supp.2d 145, 160 (D.D.C. 2003), aff\u2019d sub nom. Hedgepeth ex rel. Hedgepeth v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 386 F.3d 1148 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (noting that, though a child\u2019s arrest was constitutional under the applicable legal standard, \"the Court can hardly overlook the humiliating and demeaning impact of the arrest\u201d on that child); cf. A.M., 830 F.3d at 1150 n.15 (\"We are neither oblivious nor unsympathetic to 'the potential future consequences to [a] child,' such as F.M., of an arrest or other law-enforcement sanction for seemingly non-egregious classroom misconduct; such a law-enforcement response could potentially have a 'far-reaching impact\u2019 on a child's ability to lead a productive life.\u201d (quoting Hawker v. Sandy City Corp., 774 F.3d 1243, 1244 (10th Cir. 2014) (Lucero, J., concurring))). However, we have held that there is \" \u2018no case law ... applying a different standard when the victim of the alleged excessive force is a minor.\u2019 \u201d A.M., 830 F.3d at 1155 (quoting Hawker v. Sandy City Corp., 591 Fed.Appx. 669, 674 n.8 (10th Cir. 2014) (unpublished) (emphasis omitted)). And we are bound to apply the law of excessive force as it is \u2014 not as we might wish it to be \u2014 even when, as here, the results might seem troubling. See, e.g., A.M., 830 F.3d at 1169 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting); Hawker, 774 F.3d at 1243-46 (Lucero, J., concurring).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"10\"> <p id=\"Aj6L\" pgmap=\"908\">. Insofar as Scott's municipal-liability arguments are predicated on Officer Hensley\u2019s claimed use of excessive force, they fail at the outset.. Without an underlying constitutional violation, a municipal-liability claim is fatally infirm. See Hinton v. City of Elwood, Kan., 997 F.2d 774, 782 (10th Cir. 1993) (\"A municipality may not be held liable where there was no underlying constitutional violation by any of its officers.\u201d); see also Wilson v. Meeks, 98 F.3d 1247, 1255 (10th Cir. 1996) (\"The district court correctly concluded no municipal liability could be found in this case because there was no constitutional violation committed by any of the individual defendants.\u201d). Furthermore, Scott\u2019s briefing seemingly challenged the district court\u2019s judgment regarding his supervisory-liability claim against Albuquerque\u2019s chief of police, Ray Schultz. See Aplt's Opening Br. at 40 (\"Scott\u2019s supervisory liability claim against Chief Schultz is also viable assuming that the Court finds a violation of Scott\u2019s rights.\u201d). However, during oral argument, Scott's counsel expressly and unequivocally indicated that actually Scott does not pursue a supervisory-liability claim against Chief Schultz on appeal \u2014 viz., he does not challenge the district court's judgment as to this claim. Therefore, that matter is not before us,</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"11\"> <p id=\"b909-6\" pgmap=\"909\">. As evidentiary support for his municipal-liability claim, Scott directs us to the testimony of a Juvenile Probation Officer and to a summary of City police reports prepared by Scott\u2019s counsel. Even assuming that all of this is properly admissible evidence, it is woefully insufficient to establish that the two policies Scott identifies in his opening brief were the moving force in his unlawful arrest. First, though this evidence purports to show that young children were repeatedly arrested by the City\u2019s police for violations of section 30- \u25a0 20-13(D), it is silent regarding whether these children had special needs. Second, many (if not most) of the arrests that Scott\u2019s counsel identifies in his summaries involved, at least arguably, willful misconduct, which would place them on the question of intent within the ambit of section 30-20-13(D). See Aplt.\u2019s App. at 235-40 (describing arrests for, among other things, \"knocking over a chair and throwing a pen,\u201d \"throwing a stick when told not to,\u201d \"blowing up a condom in class,\u201d and \"[sjtepping toward a teacher in an aggressive manner\u201d).</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
