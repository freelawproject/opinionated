See Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G).

Matheson, Jr., Circuit Judge</author> <p id=\"ayi-dedup-0\" pgmap=\"513\">Jesus Rodriguez pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). The district court enhanced his sentence to 15 years in prison under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), finding that he had been convicted of three prior violent felony offenses that qualified him for the enhancement.</p> <p id=\"b513-9\" pgmap=\"513\">Mr. Rodriquez challenges his sentence on appeal, arguing that two of the prior offenses, both for violating N.M.S.A. \u00a7 30-346(C) \u2014 \u201caggravated battery against a household member inflicting great bodily harm\u201d \u2014 are not violent felonies under the ACCA. We have appellate jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p> <p id=\"b513-10\" pgmap=\"513\">In United States v. Ontiveros, 875 F.3d 533 (10th Cir. 2017), this court held that a Colorado statute which required serious bodily injury could not be violated without the use of physical force and therefore a conviction under the statute qualifies as a crime of violence under United State Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id. at 538-39. This court denied a petition for rehearing en banc in this case on January 2, 2018, and the mandate issued on January 10, 2018.</p> <p id=\"b513-13\" pgmap=\"513\">On appeal, Mr. Rodriguez concedes that, based on Ontiveros, his convictions under the comparable New Mexico statute qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA and his sentence must stand. Aplt. Br. at 6-7. He contends Ontiveros was wrongly decided and raises the issue to preserve it for further review. Id.</p> <p id=\"b513-14\" pgmap=\"513\">\u201c[Ajbsent en banc consideration or an intervening Supreme Court decision that is contrary to or invalidates our previous analysis,\u201d United States v. White, 782 F.3d 1118, 1126-27 (10th Cir. 2015)(quotations omitted), this court\u2019s decision in Ontiveros binds this panel. We therefore affirm Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s sentence.</p> <footnote label=\"**\"> <p id=\"aze-dedup-0\" pgmap=\"513\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b513-16\" pgmap=\"513\">.
