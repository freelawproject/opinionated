VILARDO, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The petitioner, Joseph E. Hechavarria, has been detained by the United States Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"DHS\") since July 11, 2013-for five-and-a-half years-pending a final determination regarding his removal. On November 2, 2018, this Court ordered the respondents to \"release Hechavarria from detention unless a neutral [decisionmaker] conducts an individualized hearing to determine whether his continued detention is justified.\" Docket Item 38 at 20. More specifically, this Court found that given the extent of Hechavarria's unreasonably prolonged detention, due process required the government to bear \"the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that [his] continued detention is necessary to serve a compelling regulatory purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, this Court found that the determination of whether detention was \"necessary to serve a compelling regulatory purpose\" necessarily required the decisionmaker to consider whether \"a less restrictive alternative to detention\" would suffice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 n. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Now before the Court is Hechavarria's motion, Docket Item 43, to enforce this Court's order and judgment, Docket Items 38, 40. Because the respondents failed to comply with this Court's November 2, 2018 order, the respondents are ordered to release Hechavarria under conditions of supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The factual and procedural background leading to this Court's order of November 2, 2018, is generally set forth in that order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Item 38 at 2-6,\n   <em>\n    Hechavarria v.

On November 16, 2018, Hechavarria filed a status report, which stated that a bond hearing had been held in Immigration Court at Batavia, New York on November 6, 2018. Docket Item 41 at 1. The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), Philip J. Montante, Jr., issued a written decision on November 14, 2018, denying Hechavarria's request for bond.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517107\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/49/#p51\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. THE HEARING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 6, 2018, IJ Montante conducted Hechavarria's bond hearing. Docket Item 43-2 at 10. Before the evidentiary hearing began, Hechavarria's counsel raised an issue regarding the statutory authority of the IJ to hold the bond hearing in the first place.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. IJ Montante took that issue under advisement, explaining \"that will be thoroughly examined in the final [written] analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   IJ Montante allowed the government to proceed first because the government had the burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The government noted that Hechavarria \"pled guilty to assaulting another person by cutting that person, his alleged girlfriend, with a knife.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. The government said that Hechavarria \"was accused by his on-again off-again girlfriend of having sexual intercourse with her without her consent, in\n   addition to cutting her on the neck with a steak knife.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16. The government argued that \"this shows a history of engaging in very dangerous behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The government also addressed news articles reporting that Hechavarria once went to New York City after he became aware that there were allegations pending against him in Cheektowaga, New York.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This was \"something for this court to consider, if it were to consider flight.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The government argued that \"as long as the government has established to this court and this court's mind that this respondent presents a clear and convincing evidence of danger or such a risk of flight ... no bond is warranted, then [the government] ha[s] met the requirements of the district court's ruling.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Counsel for Hechavarria responded that the government had not met its burden. He noted that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   the government has to show by clear and convincing evidence that detention is necessary. Not simply that it's, would be effective. But that detention is necessary to serve a compelling governmental interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Counsel for Hechavarria then offered the IJ a less restrictive alternative to detention: \"electronic monitoring.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Counsel for Hechavarria presented evidence-that is, a request for permission to travel to New York City, which had been granted-to show that the news article upon which the government relied did not suggest any risk of flight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 More specifically, counsel argued that this \"supports [their] argument that Mr. Hechavarria does not present a flight risk\" because \"request[ing] permission to go to New York City\" before traveling there is \"not the conduct[ ] of somebody who is seeking to abscond.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Counsel for Hechavarria also observed that \"every single piece of evidence that the government has submitted ... does not go past 2011.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He argued that \"the government needs to demonstrate ... that nothing has changed since 2011,\" and he noted that \"the government has submitted nothing to show that nothing has changed since 2011.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Counsel submitted risk assessments from the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision finding that Hechavarria's \"risk of felony violence,\" \"arrest risk,\" and \"abscond risk\" all are low; the assessments also showed that his \"prison misconduct\" and \"history of violence\" were minimal as well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Counsel also introduced evidence that Hechavarria participated positively in available programming while incarcerated and had a clean disciplinary record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hechavarria's attorney also submitted evidence of Hechavarria's medical condition, arguing that because of his medical issues, Hechavarria would not and could not abscond if released.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24. He also submitted e-mails from Hechavarria's family members-including Ronald Hechavarria, the petitioner's brother, and Germaine Hechavarria, the petitioner's son-to demonstrate his family ties, and he argued that those family ties would decrease the likelihood that Hechavarria might return to abusing drugs if released.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25. Based on all that, Hechavarria's counsel expressly asked \"the [IJ] to release Mr. Hechavarria on ... stringent monitoring, electronic monitoring, ... and stringent conditions of supervision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Counsel for the government replied by arguing that \"[p]ast actions are often a predictor for future actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He said that because Hechavarria had been in custody for years and therefore had limited opportunities to return to drug use, \"we don't know how he will act when he is\n   released.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27. \"We don't know if he will return to using drugs, which, according to ... the documents I've submitted ... he's had drug issues since 1988.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. \"And we don't know what he's going to do if he's released from custody.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"It's been a long time since he's been [out of] custody.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"[I]mportantly,\" the government argued, \"what's he going to do when he is finally released? And the bottom line is, none of us know.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Turning to the standard of proof, government counsel said that the IJ \"can weigh [Hechavarria's] history to determine whether or not he will engage in [drug-related] risky, dangerous behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, he argued, \"in immigration court if [the IJ] feel[s] there is a potential that this respondent is a danger, then no bond is appropriate, no, no stringent monitoring is appropriate, because if you feel the need for stringent monitoring, because you fear that this respondent might engage in some sort of act, then the proper recourse is no bond then in that case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Because he is a danger, and if he is a danger then no bond enough is sufficient to protect the citizens of the United States and those around it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ asked the parties whether they wished to put on testimonial evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. When both sides declined, the IJ specifically asked whether either side would call Hechavarria to testify.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The parties responded in the negative; there were some additional exchanges regarding scheduling; and the hearing ended.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. THE IJ'S DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After listing the exhibits that were introduced at the hearing, IJ Montante noted that \"[t]raditionally, it is the Respondent's burden to establish eligibility for bond by proving that his 'release would not pose a danger to property or persons, and that he is likely to appear for any future proceeding,'\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201236.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1236.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(8).\" Docket Item 41 at 5-7.

As noted above, the clear and convincing standard requires the evidence to demonstrate that a factual contention is \"highly probable.\" And under no fair reading of the IJ's opinion could it be said that the IJ determined that it was \"highly probable\" that detention was necessary to serve the government's compelling interest in minimizing danger to the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In IJ Montante's words, it posed \"far too great a risk to release [Hechavarria] to the public given\" the nature of his 2011 conviction.

Even if, as the IJ says, the record included only \"the hefty weight of the persuasive and credible evidence submitted by the DHS,\" Docket Item 43-2 at 143, that is not enough when the \"hefty weight\" of the evidence is sufficient only to conclude that Hechavarria might possibly pose a risk of danger. In other words, if the IJ was \"forced to speculate\" about whether Hechavarria was a danger, then there was not clear and convincing evidence that Hechavarria's continued detention was necessary to serve the government's interest in minimizing danger to the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The government observes that the IJ \"explicitly acknowledged that the 'government has the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that Petitioner's continued detention is necessary to serve a compelling regulatory purpose.\" Docket Item 47 at 6 (quoting Docket Item 43-2 at 141). And the IJ did note that this Court's prior order required that burden of proof.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the mere utterance of the correct standard of proof early in the IJ's decision is insufficient to demonstrate that it was applied when the rest of that decision demonstrates otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Enoh v.

Consideration of Less Restrictive Alternatives to Detention\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Whether or not the IJ applied the correct burden of proof is ultimately irrelevant, however, because there is absolutely no doubt that he failed to consider any plausible, less restrictive alternative to continued detention as required by this Court's prior order. In that order, this Court explained that \"[w]hether detention is necessary to serve a compelling regulatory purpose\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   consideration of whether a less restrictive alternative to detention ... would also address those purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Hechavarria v.

Without a doubt, that did not happen here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   At the hearing, counsel for Hechavarria offered a plausible, less restrictive alternative to detention: He asked the IJ to \"release Mr. Hechavarria on ... stringent monitoring, electronic monitoring, ... and stringent conditions of supervision.\" Docket Item 43-2 at 26. But the IJ did not consider Hechavarria's proffered alternative-or any alternative, for that matter. Instead, the IJ simply decided that \"[b]ecause [Hechavarria] failed to sufficiently present evidence and critical testimony in contravention of DHS's evidence, the Court finds that the DHS met its burden of proving that [he] poses a risk of danger to the community.\" Docket Item 43-2 at 143. The IJ never explained why the government's evidence made it highly probable that neither \"electronic monitoring,\" nor \"stringent monitoring,\" nor \"stringent conditions of supervision\" would effectively serve the government's interest. In fact, the IJ said not one word about any alternative to detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   What is more, the government's brief to this Court argues not that this was an oversight by the IJ, but rather that \"[a]s a matter of law, Immigration Judges should only set a bond or consider alternative conditions of supervision if an alien has first established that he is not a danger to persons or property.\" Docket Item 47 at 20 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Matter of Urena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20140\">\n    25 I &amp; N Dec. 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 141 (BIA 2009) ). The government argued that \"alternatives are only considered when someone is deemed not to be a danger to the community.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That argument seems to be based on the \"typical\" \u00a7 1226(a) bond hearing, where the alien has the burden of proving that he is not a danger and the IJ considers alternatives to detention only when that burden has been met. But the hearing here was not one of those hearings; it was a due process hearing where the government bore the burden of proof and where the IJ was required to consider alternatives before resorting to detention. And the IJ never considered such alternatives. Indeed, the government admits as much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   At the very least, the IJ was required to consider possible alternatives to detention, including the plausible alternative offered by Hechavarria at the hearing. And at the very least, the IJ was required to determine whether the government's evidence demonstrated that any and all proffered alternatives to detention would not protect the public. The IJ did not do that. And Hechavarria therefore was not given the hearing to which he was entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Party Bearing the Burden of Proof at Hechavarria's Bond Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, Hechavarria argues that the government did not comply with this Court's order because the IJ shifted the burden of proof to Hechavarria, requiring him to disprove his dangerousness. Docket Item 43-1 at 18-21. That argument has some appeal, especially because the IJ explained that he reached his decision \"[b]ecause [Hechavarria] failed to testify.\" Docket Item 43-2 at 143. At the same time, however, this Court recognizes that when one party bears the burden of proof, testimony by the other party may rebut the showing made by the party bearing the burden. In explaining that Hechavarria could have, but did not, testify, the IJ simply may have been referring to Hechavarria's opportunity to rebut the government's case against him-an opportunity that Hechavarria did not take advantage\n   of.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, this Court need not determine whether the IJ improperly shifted the burden because there is no doubt that the IJ failed to conduct a hearing in accordance with this Court's prior order for the other reasons noted above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. RELIEF\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   This Court recognizes that it should consider whether the government has established \"that there is a risk that [Hechavarria] will pose a danger to the public if released, [and] take that factor into consideration\" in deciding whether to release him as the habeas remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hilton v.

This Court has done just that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Like the government and IJ Montante, this Court recognizes that no one can predict whether Hechavarria will resort to drug abuse or engage in violence once released.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket Item 41 at 9 (IJ Montante was \"forced to speculate as to how the Respondent would conduct himself if released into the community\"); Docket Item 43-2 at 26-27 (counsel for the government arguing that \"we don't know how he will act when he is released\"). And there always is some risk that a detained or incarcerated person who is released will engage in conduct demonstrating that his release was a mistake. But that risk alone cannot justify keeping someone detained forever; otherwise, no one who could be detained would ever be released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Releasing Hechavarria-even on stringent monitoring conditions-is a risk. But the government has not demonstrated to anyone that it is highly probable that no condition or combination of conditions of release would suffice to serve its interest in minimizing danger to the community. Therefore, the due process to which Hechavarria is entitled necessitates taking the risk associated with his release after five-and-one-half years of immigration detention; long after he completed serving his criminal sentence for his prior acts of violence; and years after successful rehabilitative efforts and assessments placed his risk of violence at the low end.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court therefore orders his release on conditions that will reduce-not eliminate-the risk his release poses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Hechavarria's motion to enforce this Court's order dated November 2, 2018, is GRANTED.
