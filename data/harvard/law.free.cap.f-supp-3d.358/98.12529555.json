Waak, two defendants in the multiple defendant TelexFree multi-district securities litigation move to dismiss all counts against them in the Second Consolidated Amended Complaints (SCAC) (Docket 141) pursuant Fed.R. Civ. P. 12 (b)(6). TelexFree, Inc., (TelexFree) was a pyramid scheme that operated from February 2012 to April 2014, and involved approximately two million participants worldwide, nearly one million of whom suffered a net financial loss. Several Plaintiffs filed actions in federal district courts across the United States seeking to recover their losses against dozens of defendants, including attorneys who represented the principals of the pyramid scheme. Because the actions involve common questions of fact, the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation joined the actions into a multi-district litigation and ordered a transfer of actions to the District of Massachusetts for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Plaintiffs' complaint seeks relief against the Defendants in the following Counts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   \u2022 First Claim for Relief: General Laws Chapter 93, \u00a7 12 and 69.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \u2022 Second Claim for Relief: General Laws Chapter 93A, \u00a7 2 and 11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 Third Claim for Relief: Aiding and Abetting General Laws Chapter 93, \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 69 and Chapter 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Fourth Claim for Relief: Unjust enrichment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Fifth Claim for Relief: Civil Conspiracy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Sixth Claim for Relief: Professional negligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Seventh Claim for Relief: Negligent misrepresentation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Eight Claim for Relief: Securities Fraud.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Ninth Claim for Relief: Fraud.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Tenth Claim for Relief: Tortious aiding and abetting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Defendants, are attorneys licensed to practice law in the State of Michigan and are sued in their individual capacity,\n   and as partners in the Nehra and Waak Law Firm. The Defendants and their law firm provided legal services to TelexFree in connection with TelexFree's multi-level marketing scheme. The Defendants advertised that they were experts in representing multi-level marketing and direct sales clients and that TelexFree used the attorneys to hide their pyramid scheme activity with \"obfuscating phraseology.\" The complaint further alleges that in July of 2013, the Defendants represented to the Plaintiffs and the putative class members in July 2013, that they had \"vetted\" and \"blessed\" TelexFree's business model. (SCAC \u00b6 416). Further, Attorney Nehra was present at a \"Super Weekend\" promotion on behalf of TelexFree and he assured the attendees of the legitimacy of the TelexFree operation in the United States, and that \"TelexFree's operation had been 'vetted by the Nehra and Waak Law Firm' and that it is legally designed ... you are on very solid legal ground.\" (SCAC \u00b6 423). The complaint alleges that these statements were made by Attorney Nehra with full knowledge that the TelexFree Brazilian operations had been shut down by the Brazilian Government and that all assets had been frozen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    First Claim for Relief: General Laws Chapter 93, \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 69\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Plaintiffs First Claim of Relief alleges that the Plaintiffs violated Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93, \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 69. Specifically, that the two defendants acted as \"agents, servants, authorized representatives, co-conspirators, or employees of TelexFree\" (SCAC \u00b6 43). The Defendants argue that, \u00a7 69 of Chapter 93 does not create liability for such a broad class of what are secondary actors, because \u00a7 69(d) states: \"No multi-level distribution company or\n   <em>\n    participant\n   </em>\n   in its marketing program shall ...\" The Defendants argue that they were not \"participants\" within the meaning of \u00a7 69(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties agree that there is no statutory definition of the term \"participant.\" The Plaintiff suggests guidance can be found by looking at \u00a7 69A of M.G.L. C. 93 which describes the activities that \"participants\" may perform, such as participating in the distribution chain for goods or services offered by the company, recruiting new participants, and paying or receiving commissions, bonuses, or finder's fees. The SCAC alleges that Nehra and Waak recruited new participants and received compensation based on the recruitment. Further, the complaint alleges that the Defendants drew direct financial benefit by making public statements at TelexFree conferences communicating with the press regarding the legality of TelexFree, which crossed the line from legal advice to promotional activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   These allegations are sufficient to survive Defendants' 12(b)(6) Motion on the First Claim for Relief as to the Defendant Nehra and the law firm. Since there are virtually no allegations involving the Defendant Waak, the Motion is granted as to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Second Claim for Relief: General Laws Chapter 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Defendants argue that in order to be held liable under M.G.L. Chapter 93A there needs to have been an attorney-client relationship between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiffs allege that an attorney or law firm may incur Chapter 93A liability to a non-client, or to\n   an adversary of its client, if it joins in marketplace communications rather than merely relaying its clients positions and that those communications knowingly or carelessly are false, misleading, or harmful. See\n   <em>\n    Coggins v. Mooney,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20156998\">\n    1998 WL 156998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , @ *5 (Mass. Sup. Ct. April 3, 1998). The theory in these cases is that the attorney has crossed the line from traditional representation into active participation in trade in commerce. The Plaintiffs point to Nehra and Waak's public appearances at Super Weekend events as well as communicating through the press that they had examined TelexFree's business model and determined it to be legal, and that TelexFree \"pays ONLY on the sale of its VOIP long-distance product\" (SCAC \u00b6 146, 393, 416, and 423). Further, the complaint alleges that Defendant Nehra repeatedly assured attendees of the legitimacy of the TelexFree operation at the TelexFree Super Weekend, and that the operation had been \"vetted by the Nehra and Waak Law Firm.\" SCAC \u00b6 423. I, therefore grant the Motion as the Defendant Waak and deny as to Nehra and the law firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Third Claim for Relief: Aiding and Abetting G.L.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   did not devote much discussion to the theory of an aiding and abetting claim under C. 93A, but spoke at length of a statutory aiding and abetting claim under M.G.L.

Similarly, the\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   court was not deciding whether a party could aid and abet a Chapter 93A claim, but whether a party could aid and abet statutory violations of M.G.L.

That court held one could not aid and abet Chapter 149 and 151B violations because the legislature \"could have specifically provided for aiding and abetting liability in G.L.

The Defendants\n   further argue that even if the Plaintiffs have sufficiently plead actual knowledge, the pleading are deficient in failing to establish that they actively participated, or substantially assisted in the fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Plaintiffs' allegations in the SCAC are sufficient to withstand the Defendant's motion on the knowledge requirement. Nehra's made repeated public assurances to potential investors about the legality of the scheme which serves, for the purposes of Rule 12(b)(6), to establish the knowledge requirement and the substantial assistance requirement for the Fifth and Tenth Claim for Relief. The Court will allow these counts to move into discovery.

The Plaintiffs suggest that, under the facts of this case, the Defendant attorneys owed a duty to the Plaintiffs based upon an implied attorney-client relationship.

That statute provides a private right of action for the fraudulent offer and sale of securities, and imposes liability on those who offer or sell\n   the security. That statute also imposes liability on certain categories of persons otherwise involved with a fraudulent sale, and extends to those \"occupying a similar status or performing similar functions,\" to partners, officers, and directors of a seller, employees, who materially aid in the sale, and broker, dealers, and agents who materially aid in the sale. M.G.L. C. 110A and 410(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Defendants claim that they cannot be held liable for simply acting as outside counsel to TelexFree, and that they provided legal advice of a limited nature for a brief period of time. The Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act defines an agent as \"any individual other than a broker dealer who represents a broker dealer or issuer in affecting or attempting to affect purchases or sales of securities.\" M.G.L. C. 110A, \u00a7 401(b). Again, the Plaintiffs point to Nehra's activities in travelling to Newport Beach for the July 2013 TelexFree \"Super Weekend Event\" and his communications of the purported legitimacy of the pyramid scheme to promoters. Nehra's representation at the event crosses the line from legal advice to sales commentary and these clearly go beyond the provision of legal advice as outside counsel and arguably provided a substantial component to the TelexFree marketing campaign. Accordingly, the Defendants Eighth Claim for Relief is denied, as to Nehra and the law firm and granted as to Waak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Ninth Claim for Relief: Fraud\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In order to state a claim for fraud the Plaintiff must allege:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (1) that the Defendant made a false representation of a material fact;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (2) the Defendant had actual knowledge that the misrepresentation was false;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (3) the Defendant made the false representation with intent to deceive the Plaintiff and to induce him or her to thereon;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (4) the Plaintiff reasonably relied on the false representation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (5) the Plaintiff suffered harm as a result of the reliance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Masingill v EMC Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3816970\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/532/\">\n    449 Mass. 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=870%20N.E.2d%2081\">\n    870 N.E.2d 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mass. 2007).\n   <em>\n    Doyle v.

The complaint alleges that the Defendants, Nehra, Waak, and the law firm were self-proclaimed multi-level marketing and direct marketing attorneys, (SCAC \u00b6 405) and that they \"can discern between the legitimate and lawful MLM and direct sales ventures and legitimate and unlawful pyramid or Ponzi scheme ventures (SCAC \u00b6 407). Paragraph 1083 of the SCAC alleges the specifics of the fraudulent misrepresentations as; providing false and misleading information on the nature of TelexFree's business operation, misrepresenting financial statements, providing false and misleading information on the value of the ad central package, providing false and misleading information on the method and source of income, providing false and misleading information on the legality of TelexFree's business model, providing false and misleading information on the sustainability of promoter returns, providing false and misleading information regarding the investigation in Brazil and the subsequent closure of TelexFree's Brazilain operations, knowingly participating in false and deceptive information televised over the internet and other media, failing to comply with federal and state laws, and within setting up TelexFree's computer servers in a foreign country with the intent to avoid prosecution and legal process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Since the Plaintiffs ninth claim for relief sounds directly in fraud it must be\n   plead with particular clarity pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). The SCAC cites specific examples of Defendant Nehras' allegedly false representations, specifically that during the July 2013 Super Weekend he publically gave his legal \"blessing\" to TelexFree and guaranteeing that it was a lawful enterprise. SCAC \u00b6 146. Also, that he told the recruits that TelexFree was \"legally designed, you are on very solid legal ground\" and that the operation had been vetted by Nehra and Waak Law Firm (SCAC \u00b6 423). He also made \"unambiguously false public statements\" including a written press release that TelexFree pays \"only on the sale of its VOIP long distance product\" SCAC \u00b6 393. Nehra falsely assured members that TelexFree's program complied with all federal and state laws, (SCAC \u00b6 554) and advised members that the Brazil shut down would have no effect on TelexFree's U.S. operation (SCAC \u00b6 422). And, in an internet posting in August of 2013 he falsely stated that \"the special ingredient is that you have a real product.\" SCAC \u00b6 556. Accordingly the Defendant Nehra and Nehra and Waak's Motion to Dismiss the Ninth Claim for Relief is denied. With respect to Defendant Waak, there are no allegations that give rise to a cause of action vs. the Defendant Waak, accordingly his Motion to Dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Defendant Waak's Motion is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     granted\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   as to all claims against him. This Motion is also\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     granted\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   as to the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Claims for Relief against all Defendants. The Motion is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     denied\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   as to all other Claims for Relief.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The Defendants acknowledge that a violation of C. 93, \u00a7 69 is a\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    violation of C 93A. Their argument with respect to the Second Claim for Relief is only insofar as it is a \"stand alone\" violation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
