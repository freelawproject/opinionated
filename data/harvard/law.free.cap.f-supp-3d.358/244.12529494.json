Sargent, Ph.D. (\"Dr. Sargent\"), alleging negligence resulting in \"permanent or long-standing emotional harm.\" (Dkt. 1). Specifically, Plaintiff claims that Dr. Sargent, Plaintiff's psychotherapist at the Veterans Administration (\"VA\") Hospital in Buffalo, New York (\"Buffalo VAMC\"), mismanaged Plaintiff's emotional dependence on her, engaged in a sexual, intimate relationship with Plaintiff, and then terminated the relationship \"in an abrupt manner,\" causing Plaintiff to suffer \"severe and debilitating depression.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7-12). Plaintiff asserts two causes of action against Defendant: (1) a claim for vicarious liability based on Dr. Sargent's negligence, and (2) a claim for negligent supervision and/or retention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court is the motion to dismiss brought by Defendant pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 56. (Dkt. 37). Defendant seeks dismissal of the claims asserted by Plaintiff for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1; Dkt. 39 at 10, 16). Defendant also seeks summary judgment as to Plaintiff's second cause of action alleging negligent supervision. (Dkt. 37 at 1; Dkt. 39 at 19). For the following reasons, Defendant's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Defendant's Rule 56 Statement of Undisputed Facts (Dkt. 40) (\"Defendant's Statement\"), Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Facts (Dkt. 42-3) (\"Plaintiff's Statement\"), and their supporting documents. The Court has noted where factual disputes exist and views all such disputes in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as required on a motion such as this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff is a veteran who receives disability benefits through the Social Security Administration and the VA as a result of his diagnosis with major depression, dysthymia, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Dkt. 40 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-9). Plaintiff has received continuous mental health treatment from the Buffalo VAMC since the late 1980s. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16). From 1987 until August 2011, Plaintiff's therapist at the Buffalo VAMC was a clinical psychologist named Eddie Venzor, Ph.D. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19). After Dr. Venzor's retirement, Plaintiff was transferred to Dr. Sargent, another psychologist at the Buffalo VAMC, for his mental health care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20, 26). For several months, Plaintiff was treated by a psychology intern Dr. Sargent supervised (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-23), and Dr. Sargent began personally\n   counseling Plaintiff in December 2011 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Psychologists at the Buffalo VAMC \"function as independent practitioners\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27), and the VA does not require clinical supervision of its psychologists (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31). However, psychologists employed at the Buffalo VAMC are supposed to complete an Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation (\"OPPE\") every six months where a psychologist's chart timeliness, continuing education documentation, and case presentation are evaluated by the lead psychologist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34; Dkt. 42-3 at 34). Additionally, Dr. Sargent's administrative supervisor, Thomas Brent (\"Brent\"), had staff meetings with psychologists every other week to discuss their cases and would sometimes talk to Dr. Sargent one-on-one about treatment methods for cases with which she struggled. (Dkt. 40 at \u00b6\u00b6 42-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Veteran's Health Administration Handbook requires patient health records to \"be timely, relevant, necessary, complete, and authenticated.\" (Dkt. 42-2 at 27). Each VA facility is required to establish policies that \"specify time standards for content, authentication, and completion\" of patient records and \"describe procedures for ongoing monitoring and reporting of individual delinquent records, responsible clinicians, and re-occurring delinquency patterns.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At the Buffalo VAMC, therapists were required to enter notes within five days of the sessions. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Throughout 2012 and 2013, Dr. Sargent failed to complete the notes taken during her counseling sessions with many of her patients, including those with Plaintiff. (Dkt. 40 at \u00b6\u00b6 123-25). Dr. Sargent received a disciplinary warning on April 19, 2012, for failing to enter her notes in a timely manner, and Brent was supposed to monitor her note entry. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 29). In November 2012, Dr. Sargent still had few substantive notes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). No notes of any kind exist for Plaintiff's final 15 therapy sessions with Dr. Sargent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The record does not show that Brent discussed this deficiency with Dr. Sargent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201346\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201346\">\n    at \u00b6 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On or before January 2013, Plaintiff began expressing affection to Dr. Sargent in their therapy sessions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46; Dkt. 42-3 at \u00b6 46). A patient becoming infatuated with a therapist is a common occurrence in therapeutic settings and is referred to as the transference phenomenon. (Dkt. 40 at \u00b6\u00b6 48-50). Patients experiencing transference have feelings towards their therapist that are not necessarily based in reality, but occur because the therapist may be one of the few people who sits and listens to the patient and \"who cares in an organized and thoughtful and attentive way.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Sargent had successfully handled transference situations twice previously in her career (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64), and prior to 2013, she had never engaged in a sexual or romantic relationship with a patient (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Between January and March 2013, Plaintiff started expressing his affection for Dr. Sargent more vehemently by writing her letters and cards and by leaving her voicemails until her inbox was full. (Dkt. 42-2 at 152). Plaintiff gave several gifts to Dr. Sargent, including crystal sculptures (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 157) and a three-and-a-half-foot tall flower arrangement that Dr. Sargent placed in the reception area (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 218). The hospital staff noticed that Plaintiff brought these gifts to Dr. Sargent (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 223), and on at least one occasion, a hospital staff member admonished Plaintiff for doing so (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 165). Additionally, Plaintiff referred to Dr. Sargent as \"hot Dr. Sargent\" in front of Buffalo VAMC staff members throughout this time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 223).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In March or April 2013, Dr. Sargent claims she met with Brent to ask for guidance about how to handle Plaintiff's affection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 40 at \u00b6 55). She also met twice with one of her peers, Dr. Elizabeth Wahlig (\"Dr. Wahlig\"). (Dkt. 42-2 at 272). During these meetings, Dr. Sargent told Brent and Dr. Wahlig that she \"was in distress over [Plaintiff] pushing the boundaries and pursuing me in a romantic way. And that I did not know anything further that I could do to set the boundaries and to keep him from doing more.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 222-23). Both Brent and Dr. Wahlig encouraged Dr. Sargent to reinforce appropriate therapeutic boundaries with Plaintiff. (Dkt. 40 at \u00b6 59). During Dr. Sargent's second meeting with Dr. Wahlig, Dr. Wahlig noted that she felt \"concerned that [Plaintiff] had not backed down gracefully nor respected the limits that [Dr. Sargent] was trying to enforce but had, in fact, become more insistent.\" (Dkt. 42-2 at 340). Dr. Wahlig concluded Dr. Sargent should transfer Plaintiff to another therapist, but never advised Dr. Sargent to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 341). Brent also testified that, as a general matter, if a therapist he supervised came to him with concerns about a patient's attraction or an exchange of gifts, he would talk to them about next steps, one of which would be transferring the patient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 251). Brent did not speak with Dr. Sargent about transferring Plaintiff to another therapist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 223).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Sometime between when these meetings occurred and May 11, 2013, Dr. Sargent met with Plaintiff for the first time in a personal way on the grounds of the Buffalo VAMC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153, 223). She encouraged him to ride by an outside picnic area on his Harley motorcycle with his dogs, and at least one of the other hospital employees saw this happen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Also during this time, Dr. Sargent left some of the cards Plaintiff had written to her on her office desk, removing them only after Plaintiff expressed surprise that she would display them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152-53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 11, 2013, Dr. Sargent, wearing a hat and trench coat, met with Plaintiff off hospital grounds at a coffee shop. (Dkt. 40 at \u00b6\u00b6 71-72). From there they drove separately to a nearby park, and Dr. Sargent then got into Plaintiff's car where they kissed for an hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 74-75). A day or two later, Plaintiff states that he had a therapy session with Dr. Sargent where they \"[w]ent through the formality of what would ordinarily be a mental health appointment\" before hugging and kissing in Dr. Sargent's office. (Dkt. 42-2 at 155).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Several days later, Plaintiff took Dr. Sargent for a ride on his motorcycle to a different park and kissed her under a tree. (Dkt. 40 at \u00b6\u00b6 76-77). Plaintiff purchased a $ 1,000 motorcycle jacket and helmet for Dr. Sargent, along with a dark visor so she could hide her face. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 97-98).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 18, 2013, Dr. Sargent met Plaintiff at his home, where they had sex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78). Dr. Sargent spent the night with Plaintiff at his house, and several hours the next day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 79-80). She returned to Plaintiff's home on or about May 22, 2013, and met his adult daughter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 81; Dkt. 42-3 at \u00b6 81). Plaintiff told his daughter that he and Dr. Sargent had been seeing each other and that they loved each other. (Dkt. 40 at \u00b6 83; Dkt. 42-2 at 133, 169). He asked his daughter to promise to not say anything \"because there was so much at stake,\" telling her that Dr. Sargent could lose her job. (Dkt. 40 at\n   \u00b6 84). Dr. Sargent showed Plaintiff's daughter pictures of her own two girls, and then told the daughter that she planned to transfer Plaintiff to another therapist eventually, but that \"these things take time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During the period that they were seeing each other, Plaintiff gave Dr. Sargent a key to his home, and Dr. Sargent left at least five romantic voicemails on Plaintiff's phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 90, 100). She visited him at his house on the evening of May 24, 2013, and spent the next day with him, attempting to disguise herself with a trench coat and hat when she came and went. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 87-89). Dr. Sargent told Plaintiff that \"she wanted to spend the rest of her life with [him]\" and came up with a plan to transfer him to a different colleague so that, after two or so years of him not being her patient, they could be together. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 92-93). She bought Plaintiff a plane ticket to Montana so that he could meet her parents and brother, and she also introduced her daughters to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 94-96). Plaintiff contends that Dr. Sargent told Plaintiff as \"the relationship was consummated, that she would be there as my doctor. She would always be there.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 42-2 at 152). Throughout this time, Dr. Sargent and Plaintiff engaged in sexual relations three times, all at Plaintiff's home. (Dkt. 40 at \u00b6 99).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On May 26, 2013, Dr. Sargent spent part of the day with Plaintiff before telling him that she \"wanted a day apart from him to settle [her] emotions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101). She visited Plaintiff again at his home on May 27, 2013, and he became very aggressive and started screaming at her, causing Dr. Sargent to fear for her own safety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 102). She told Plaintiff that they needed to end the relationship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 103).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff disclosed the affair to Brent and the head psychologist, Dr. Frohm, on May 28, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 110). Prior to this disclosure, no one at the Buffalo VAMC knew about the affair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 111). That day, the Buffalo VAMC arranged for Plaintiff to be transferred to another psychologist (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118), and over the next few days, Plaintiff had several counseling sessions (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 120-21). The VA currently pays for Plaintiff's mental health care outside the VA system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 122).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dr. Sargent was removed from patient care on May 29, 2013, and placed on administrative leave on May 31, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 112-13). She resigned from her position on June 10, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 114). The VA reported Dr. Sargent's misconduct to the New York State Office of Professions on August 8, 2015, and to the National Practitioner Data Bank on May 20, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 116-17; Dkt. 42-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 116-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On July 15, 2014, Plaintiff submitted a claim to the Department of Veterans Affairs (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 14), which was subsequently rejected on May 6, 2015 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15). Plaintiff commenced this action on June 4, 2015. (Dkt. 1). On August 13, 2015, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. (Dkt. 5). The Court denied the motion but noted that Defendant's argument as to the subject matter jurisdiction claim was \"subject to renewal\n   after the completion of discovery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant filed the instant motion on July 11, 2018. (Dkt. 37). Plaintiff submitted his response in opposition on August 1, 2018 (Dkt. 42), and Defendant replied on August 8, 2018 (Dkt. 43). Oral argument was held before the undersigned on December 19, 2018, at which time the Court reserved decision. (Dkt. 44). Defendant submitted a supplemental letter to the Court on December 20, 2018, over Plaintiff's objections.

However,\n   looking at the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable trier of fact could find that Dr. Sargent was negligent in her handling of the transference phenomenon before the sexual relationship began. The record shows that after Dr. Sargent became uncomfortable with Plaintiff's expressions of affection towards her, she did not ask to transfer Plaintiff for reasons related to his psychological treatment-she was concerned that \"a sudden ending\" of their patient-therapist relationship would \"adversely affect\" Plaintiff.

Additionally, it is undisputed that Dr. Sargent was an employee of the Buffalo VAMC (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20), and that therapists commonly handle the transference phenomenon with patients (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50). Looking at the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Dr. Sargent's initial mishandling of Plaintiff's transference,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , her decision to not ask for Plaintiff's reassignment, did not depart from the normal methods of performance for therapists at the Buffalo VAMC because reassigning patients at the Buffalo VAMC \"was generally discouraged.\" (Dkt. 42-2 at 218).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Moreover, the record before the Court shows that Dr. Sargent's mishandling of the transference is something that the Buffalo VAMC could have reasonably anticipated. Looking at the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Dr. Sargent told Dr. Wahlig and Brent that she \"was in distress over [Plaintiff] pushing the boundaries and pursuing me in a romantic way. And that I did not know anything further that I could do to set the boundaries and to keep him from doing more.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 223). Both Dr. Wahlig and Brent stated they would normally advise someone in Dr. Sargent's situation to transfer the patient, presumably in part to prevent or stymie a therapist's mishandling of the transference phenomenon, but that neither of them did so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 251, 341).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Additionally, staff members at the hospital knew that Plaintiff called Dr. Sargent \"hot Dr. Sargent\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 223), and they knew that Plaintiff was giving Dr. Sargent increasingly extravagant gifts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   such as a three-and-a-half-foot tall flower arrangement (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 165) and crystal sculptures (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 157). On one occasion, a staff member admonished Plaintiff for bringing these gifts to Dr. Sargent (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 165), demonstrating that there was an awareness at the Buffalo VAMC that such behavior was not only ongoing but inappropriate. Moreover, at least one of the staff members witnessed the incident where Defendant rode by the Buffalo VAMC on his motorcycle at Dr. Sargent's request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153, 223). A reasonable trier of fact could find such incidents could and did raise red flags for hospital staff members and that, accordingly, Defendant could reasonably have anticipated that Dr. Sargent was mishandling Plaintiff's transference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In light of the New York case law discussed earlier regarding doctor and therapist sexual misconduct, a reasonable trier of fact could find that Dr. Sargent, at some point, began acting outside her scope of employment. However, determining exactly when that happened requires resolution of material issues of fact and line-drawing inappropriate for a summary judgment motion. Accordingly, the Court determines that, looking at the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable trier of fact could find that at least some of Dr. Sargent's actions fell within the scope of her employment and that Defendant is vicariously liable. As a result, Defendant's motion to dismiss the first cause of action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Negligent Supervision Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Discretionary Function Exception to Sovereign Immunity Waiver\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff's negligent supervision claim is barred by the discretionary function exception to the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity, and that Plaintiff's claim should therefore be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). (Dkt. 39 at 16-19). For the reasons that follow, the Court declines to dismiss the negligent supervision claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The FTCA provides that the waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity for negligent acts of its employees \"shall not apply to ...

(Dkt. 39 at 18-19). Plaintiff asserts that the decisions made by Dr. Sargent's supervisors were a result of abdication of their responsibilities, not of policy decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court finds a reasonable trier of fact could determine that the VA Hospital's decision to not supervise Dr. Sargent resulted from a dereliction of duties as opposed to any policy decision-and thus, the discretionary function exception does not apply. Looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Dr. Sargent met twice with Dr. Wahlig\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and once with supervisor Brent, telling them that she \"was in distress over [Plaintiff] pushing the boundaries and pursuing me in a romantic way.

The record viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff shows that during Dr. Sargent's second meeting with Dr. Wahlig, Dr. Wahlig \"was concerned that [Plaintiff] had not backed down gracefully nor respected the limits that [Dr. Sargent] was trying to enforce but had, in fact, become more insistent\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 340), and that Dr. Wahlig concluded Dr. Sargent should transfer Plaintiff to another therapist, but never advised Dr. Sargent to do so (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 341).

However, there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendant\n   <em>\n    should have\n   </em>\n   known that Dr. Sargent was unsuited to continue serving as Plaintiff's therapist because she had the propensity to enter into a relationship with Plaintiff or to have a sexual encounter with him. Dr. Sargent expressed to Dr. Wahlig and Brent that she \"didn't know what else to do\" and that she was looking for suggestions about how to manage the situation with plaintiff better \"because [she] had exhausted [her] approaches for setting boundaries,\" and she\n   \"did not know anything further that I could do to set the boundaries and to keep him from doing more.\" (Dkt. 42-2 at 223). As discussed earlier in this Decision and Order, the record before the court viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff shows that both Dr. Wahlig and Brent acknowledged that under the circumstances Plaintiff should have been transferred to a different therapist, but that both of them failed to communicate that sentiment to Dr. Sargent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 251, 341).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Additionally, as previously discussed, it was well-known by staff members at the hospital that Plaintiff called Dr. Sargent \"hot Dr. Sargent\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 223), and that Plaintiff was giving Dr. Sargent extravagant gifts (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 165). Moreover, at least one of the staff members witnessed the incident where Defendant rode by the Buffalo VAMC on his motorcycle at Dr. Sargent's request (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 153, 223), and Plaintiff contends he and Dr. Sargent kissed in her office during a therapy session (Dkt. 42-2 at 155). A reasonable trier of fact could find that, in light of these incidents, Dr. Sargent's allegedly tortious behavior was committed, at least partially, on the premises of the Buffalo VAMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, the Buffalo VAMC was aware that Dr. Sargent frequently failed to take notes of her patients' therapy sessions or enter them in a timely manner. (Dkt. 42-1 at \u00b6 29). The record shows that Brent was supposed to monitor Dr. Sargent's note entry after April 19, 2012, but that she still had few substantive notes by November 2012 and no notes at all for Plaintiff's final 15 therapy sessions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 29). Looking at the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable trier of fact could find that the Buffalo VAMC's failure to ensure that Dr. Sargent kept notes of her therapy sessions allowed her to conceal her affair with Plaintiff. Accordingly, the Court denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's negligent supervision claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's motion to dismiss (Dkt. 37) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Defendant notes there is a factual dispute as to whether this meeting actually occurred, but concedes that it did for the purposes of the instant motion.

(Dkt. 43 at 5). The Court does not find the content of the statements dispositive. In other words, Dr. Sargent could have planned to transfer Plaintiff to facially comport with the ethical rules of her profession while still unofficially serving as Plaintiff's therapist.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Defendant argues that Plaintiff concedes the entire affair took place off VA property because Plaintiff admitted to paragraph 109 of Defendant's Statement, which states, \"Dr. Sargent's inappropriate behaviors with plaintiff 'were outside [her] role as his therapist,' 'occurred off federal property,' and 'outside [her] tour of duty.' \" (Dkt. 40 at \u00b6 109 (alterations in original) ). However, Plaintiff only stated that \"Dr. Sargent so testified at her deposition.\" (Dkt. 42-3 at \u00b6 109).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Other courts have found that under New York law a therapist's sexual relationship with a patient is relevant to psychiatric treatment.

However, Dr. Sargent contends that, at the time of those conversations, she \"did not want\" a relationship with Plaintiff, and that she\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    felt like she wanted to have a romantic relationship with Plaintiff. (Dkt. 42-2 at 215, 223). Dr. Sargent's motives and feelings are disputed issues of material fact, and their resolution is not appropriate on a summary judgment motion. Instead, as is required on a motion for summary judgment, the Court views these facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Defendant posits that Plaintiff giving gifts to Dr. Sargent \"was not a red flag of an imminent romantic relationship between patient and therapist because it's a very frequent occurrence that a patient will give a gift to a therapist.\" (Dkt. 40 at \u00b6\u00b6 52-53). While Defendant's expert did testify that gift-giving was a frequent occurrence, he also stated it \"would be an event that would raise questions,\" and did not specifically address the number and type of gifts hospital staff members saw Plaintiff give Dr. Sargent in this case. (Dkt. 42-2 at 307).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Plaintiff also argues that Defendant waived this argument when it did not include it in the Answer because sovereign immunity is an affirmative defense, and a defendant waives affirmative defenses if they are not pleaded in the answer. (Dkt. 42 at 19-20 n.2). However, the discretionary function exception is a sovereign immunity issue and therefore a question of subject matter jurisdiction, so it may be raised at any time regardless of whether it was included in Defendant's Answer.\n    <em>\n     Dockery v.

Dr. Karl Frohme, the lead psychologist at the Buffalo VAMC, testified that if someone in Dr. Wahlig's role received a communication from a colleague that implicated ethical breaches, \"her next step would be to disclose that to a manager or to the lead psychologist.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 284, 317).

However, Plaintiff may pursue alternative theories of liability with his pleading, Fed. R. Civ.

Indeed, there may be some aspects of Dr. Sargent's conduct that fall within the scope of her employment-giving rise to vicarious liability-and other aspects that occurred outside the scope of her employment-on which a negligent supervision claim could be based.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
