On September 28, 2016, the ALJ issued an unfavorable decision, finding Plaintiff was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. A.R. 21-34.

First Reason.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   With respect to his first reason, the ALJ stated that physical examinations revealed negative Tinel's and Phalen's tests on the left hand, a negative Spurling's test on the left, and normal ulnar and radial sensation on the left. A.R. 32. The ALJ cited one exhibit for this proposition, which includes medical records from two visits at the same treatment facility. A.R. 1018-24. The first visit was on September 23, 2015 with Dr. Kearney. A.R. 1021-24. Plaintiff reported a pain level of 9 in both hands, and Dr. Kearney noted numbness, tingling, joint swelling, and stiffness. A.R. 1021. Dr. Kearney diagnosed Plaintiff with radiculopathy in the cervicothoracic region and assessed left carpal tunnel syndrome, and stated that Plaintiff \"still clearly seem[ed]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   to be symptomatic from a component of recalcitrant carpal tunnel syndrome.\" Dr. Kearney wanted Plaintiff to follow up regarding hand surgery. A.R. 1023. The second visit was a month later on November 4, 2015. Plaintiff reported a pain level of 5 in his left hand and that his pain was dull, aching, and worsening. A.R. 1018-19. Without further explanation, the notes state, \"LUE: + Durkan's, - Tinel's at wrist, - Phalen's, + Tinel's at elbow, + elbow flexion test, - Spurling's, decreased sensation in median/ulnar/radial distributions.\" A.R. 1019. The assessment also states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Because of conflicting evidence, it is not clear if ... symptoms are due to nerve problems originating at the wrist and elbow or in the neck.

Doc. 14 at 21. Plaintiff cites Dr. Kearney's September conclusion that he remained symptomatic and the November examination showing a positive Durkan's test at Plaintiff's left upper extremity, positive Tinel's sign at the elbow, and decreased sensation in the median, ulnar, and radial distributions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7652421\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/821/#p830\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 21-22 (citing A.R. 1019-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The ALJ failed to explain why the cited examination results contradicted Dr. Kearney's assessment, even though one of the examinations was conducted by Dr. Kearney and consistent with his opinions about Plaintiff's limitations, and the second was only a month later at the same facility and remained consistent with Plaintiff's reported pain and symptoms. It is true that the November examination only pertained to Plaintiff's right hand and showed negative Tinel's, Phalen's, and Spurling's results. A.R. 1019. But the examination also yielded positive Durkan's, Tinel's at the elbow, elbow flexion, and showed decreased sensation in Plaintiff's left median, ulnar, and radial distributions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7652421\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/821/#p830\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ cited no evidence explaining the significance of these findings. And he failed to state his interpretation of the mixed results, why his interpretation was correct and Dr. Kearney's incorrect, and why his interpretation rendered Dr. Kearney's assessment unsupported. Although the ALJ set out a thorough discussion of the record (A.R. 27-33), he failed to make specific findings about evidence supporting or contradicting Dr. Kearney's opinion and his interpretation of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Magallanes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11290716\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/881/747/#p755\">\n    881 F.2d at 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Board certification was not required for Dr. Kearney to offer an opinion on Plaintiff's condition, and the ALJ could not discredit Dr. Kearney's opinion for this reason alone, with no discussion of the examinations and tests on which Dr. Kearney relied.\n   <em>\n    Sprague v.

A.R. 899-900. He opined that Plaintiff could sit for six hours; stand and walk for two hours; lift and carry less than ten pounds; continuously use his feet, bend, reach, stoop; and frequently use his hands. Dr. Amrani opined that it was medically necessary for Plaintiff to alternate between sitting, standing, and walking, and to rest 1-4 minutes between position changes. A.R. 899. He further opined that Plaintiff had moderate pain which would cause him to be off task 11-15% of an eight-hour day and miss 2-3 days of work each month. A.R. 900.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The ALJ gave three reasons for discrediting Dr. Amrani's opinion: (1) Plaintiff's \"relatively normal findings\" after his cervical fusion surgery did not support it; (2) Dr. Amrani reported \"relatively benign findings\" and referred Plaintiff to pain management; and (3) Plaintiff used marijuana as a method of pain relief and testified inconsistently about whether it was medical marijuana.

First Reason.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As to his first reason, the ALJ specifically stated that \"[a]though physical examinations revealed tenderness of the cervical and lumbosacral spine, [Plaintiff] had full range of motion, no tenderness of the occipital protuberance, a negative straight leg raising test, normal gait and normal reflexes.\" A.R. 33 (citing A.R. 983-1013). Plaintiff argues that his physical examinations consistently revealed positive objective findings after his failed cervical surgery. Doc. 14 at 22. Plaintiff cites examinations that show limited and painful cervical and lumbar motion; tenderness on palpation of the cervical and lumbar spine; tenderness to the occipitals; abnormal and decreased sensation in Plaintiff's bilateral hands; positive bilateral straight leg raise testing; and a limp.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7652421\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/821/#p830\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing A.R. 843-44, 850-51, 854, 869, 882-82, 985, 993, 1000, 1012-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Medical evidence in the record is mixed. The results of a June 2012 lumbar spine MRI reveal mild to moderate disc bulges at L1-2, L2-3, and L4-5, and mild and moderate stenosis at L2-3, L3-4, and L4-5. A.R. 558-59. November 2013 treatment notes indicate that physical therapy did not change Plaintiff's neck and back pain; normal spine inspection; mild limitations in range of motion; some pain in maneuvering; but no abnormal neurological findings; normal gait; ability to heel-and toe-walk; severe disc degeneration at L1-2; and no significant areas of stenosis. The treatment notes state that \"as always [Plaintiff] ask[ed] for escalation [of pain medication].\" A.R. 586-88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In 2014, Plaintiff underwent four spinal branch blocks (A.R. 735, 740, 808-09, 811-12, 798-99), four ablation procedures (A.R. 798-99, 795-96, 788-89, 781-82), and three nerve block procedures (A.R. 778, 780, 776).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 14 at 9-10. March 2015 treatment notes reflect ongoing cervical disc displacement and bulging and lumbar spinal stenosis ; herniated discs at C4-6 and\n   C5-6; and decreased sensation, but also no lumbar spine tenderness to palpation; normal gait and no limp; and 5/5 strength for lower extremities. A.R. 978-80. After Plaintiff's pain continued, Dr. Amrani performed spinal fusion surgery on Plaintiff in April 2015. A.R. 834.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   May 2015 treatment notes reflect that Plaintiff continued to complain of neck and back pain and note limited and painful range of cervical spinal motion, but the examinations also showed negative and nonpainful results for maneuvering tests; full scores on neurological exam strength testing; and normal inspection of the cervical and lumbar lordosis. A.R. 835, 843-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   July 2015 treatment notes reflect full cervical spine range of motion; full lumbosacral spine range of motion; negative straight-leg raising test; normal gait; but also tenderness on palpation of the cervical and lumbosacral spine. A.R. 850-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A July 2015 MRI of the cervical spine revealed mild to moderate degenerative joint disease at C1-C2; a 1-mm broad disc bulge at C3-C4 and no stenosis; a 3-mm broad disc bulge at C4-C5 with mild stenosis; a 2-mm broad disc bulge at C5-C6 and mild stenosis; a 3-mm broad disc bulge at C6-C7 with mild and moderate stenosis; and a 3-mm bilobed disc bulge at C7-T1. A.R. 871-72. The findings were stable and unchanged from previous examinations. A.R. 872. August 2015 treatment notes continue to reflect mixed results and Plaintiff's ongoing reported pain. A.R. 875-84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In January 2016, Plaintiff had a spinal cord stimulator trial device removed due to lack of effectiveness in relieving his pain. A.R. 991-94. March 2016 treatment reflect full range of motion in cervical and lumbosacral spine; negative straight-leg raising test; normal gait and stance; normal deep tendon reflexes; no lower extremity weakness; occipital protuberance was tender on palpation but no cervical spine tenderness; lumbosacral spine tenderness on palpation at L2-5; and Plaintiff received a trigger point injection for pain. A.R. 983-86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The ALJ generally concluded that the record did not support Dr. Amrani's opinion. He also agreed with two of the ME's specific conclusions. The ME found that Plaintiff's cervical fusion was unlikely to produce an improved outcome because Plaintiff had no neurologic deficits prior to the surgery. This is not a specific and legitimate reason for discrediting Dr. Amrani. Whether the ME agreed with Dr. Amrani's method of treatment is irrelevant to the ALJ's weighing and interpretation of the evidence. The ALJ also agreed with the ME's conclusion that the record did not support Dr. Amrani's opinion that Plaintiff could only stand and walk for two hours. A.R. 119; 31-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Although the ALJ discussed much of the evidence in the record, he impermissibly isolated only one finding out of Plaintiff's nearly four-year medical history as discrediting Dr. Amrani's opinion.

The ALJ's cited exhibit contains treatment notes from September 2015 through March 2016. But as discussed above, that period includes mixed results about Plaintiff's conditions, about which the ALJ made no specific interpretations. Given Plaintiff's four-year history of reported pain, MRI testing, examinations, nerve blocks, nerve ablations, spinal injections, a spinal fusion, and referrals to pain management specialists, the ALJ failed to provide specific and legitimate reasons for discounting Dr. Amrani's treating opinion and crediting the opinion of the non-examining ME. The ALJ's general assertion that objective evidence did not support Dr. Amrani's opinion is insufficient.\n   <em>\n    Embrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12029586\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/849/418/#p422\">\n    849 F.2d at 421-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   What is more, the ME diagnosed Plaintiff with chronic cervical pain and chronic low back pain, finding Plaintiff could sit for an unlimited period of time with breaks; walk and stand for 6-8 hours; and lift and carry 50 pounds occasionally and 25 frequently. A.R. 30, 902-904. Based on the same record, Dr. Amrani concluded that Plaintiff could only sit for six hours; stand and walk for two hours; and lift and carry less than ten pounds. The ALJ's only stated reason for crediting the ME over Dr. Amrani was the \"decreased findings with regard to [Plaintiff's] spine following cervical fusion surgery.\" A.R. 31.

Hand and Wrist Pain.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Citing Plaintiff's September and November 2015 examinations, the ALJ stated that Plaintiff's \"recent medical records support a finding of only mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome in the left upper extremity.\" A.R. 26. The Court finds that these two examinations out of Plaintiff's four-year medical history are insufficient to provide a clear and convincing reason to discredit his symptom testimony,\n   especially given that neither examination tested Plaintiff's right hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Neck and Back Pain.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Regarding Plaintiff's symptom testimony about his neck and back pain, the ALJ stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   The claimant's recent medical records document some positive objective findings regarding the claimant's spine following cervical spinal fusion surgery in April 2015. Although physical examinations revealed tenderness of the cervical and lumbosacral spine, the claimant had full range of motion, and no tenderness of the occipital protuberance. He had a negative straight leg raising test, normal gait and normal reflexes. (Ex. B26F).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   A.R. 26. The ALJ cited one set of medical records in this paragraph - Ex. B26F - without identifying specific pages, and concluded that these findings were inconsistent with Plaintiff's testimony that he had to lay down for two hours a day, could not stand or walk for more than 20 minutes at a time, could not lift more than ten pounds, and could not perform chores for more than ten minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The ALJ again appears to have isolated limited evidence to support his finding that Plaintiff's pain testimony is not credible. The single set of medical records cited by the ALJ includes a report by Plaintiff that his pain level is 8 on a scale of 10 when he takes medication and level 10 when he does not. A.R. 985. He reported that his pain is worse when walking, standing, and sitting, and is relieved by rest. A.R. 983. Plaintiff reported that he had completed a spinal cord stimulator trial for his cervical pain, which did not provide adequate relief. A.R. 984. Plaintiff received trigger point injections during the office visit. A.R. 986. Given this record, and Plaintiff's four-year history of reported pain, MRI testing, examinations, nerve blocks, nerve ablations, spinal injections, a spinal fusion, and referrals to pain management specialists, the Court cannot conclude that the ALJ provided specific, clear, and convincing reasons to discounting Plaintiff's pain testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The ALJ's error was not harmless. The VE testified that Plaintiff's claimed symptoms and limitations, if true, would preclude the performance of his past work or other work. A.R. 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Scope of Remand.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The ALJ erred in discrediting the opinions of Drs. Kearney and Armani and Plaintiff's symptom testimony. Plaintiff contends that, crediting this evidence as true, the Court must remand for an award of benefits. Doc. 14 at 30. Defendant counters that the appropriate remedy is a remand for further proceedings. Doc. 18 at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \"When the ALJ denies benefits and the court finds error, the court ordinarily must remand to the agency for further proceedings before directing an award of benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Leon v.

Under a \"rare exception\" to this rule, the Court may remand for an immediate award of benefits after conducting a three-part inquiry:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   The three-part analysis ... is known as the \"credit-as-true\" rule. First, we ask whether the ALJ failed to provide legally sufficient reasons for rejecting evidence, whether claimant testimony or medical opinion. Next, we determine whether there are outstanding issues that must be resolved before a disability determination can be made, and whether further administrative proceedings would be useful. When these first two conditions are satisfied, we then credit the discredited testimony as true for the\n   purpose of determining whether, on the record taken as a whole, there is no doubt as to disability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266571\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1041/#p1045\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   emphasized that the Court has discretion to remand for further proceedings even if it reaches the third step in the process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266571\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1041/#p1045\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Where an ALJ makes a legal error, but the record is uncertain and ambiguous, the proper approach is to remand the case to the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266571\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1041/#p1045\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Hand and Wrist Conditions.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   With respect to Plaintiff's hand and wrist condition, the Court finds reason to doubt whether Plaintiff is disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Dr. Kearney opined that Plaintiff could use his hands never, less than 20% of the time, or less than occasionally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 27-33. The ME testified that Dr. Kearney's opinion implied Plaintiff had severe carpal tunnel syndrome. A.R. 107-10. But the ME disagreed with Dr. Kearney's assessment because no electrodiagnostic studies in the record confirmed the severity; no hand examination showed severe numbness of Plaintiff's hands; the persistent symptoms in Plaintiff's left hand after it had been released in 2012 were unusual and suspect; and a November 2015 examination showed ulnar nerve issues, not carpal tunnel syndrome. A.R. 108-12. The ME concluded that the record supported mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome in Plaintiff's left hand but contained no evidence of right carpal tunnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   After Plaintiff's left carpal tunnel release surgery in November 2012, treatment notes from January 2013 indicate that sensation and swelling were improving in his left fingers and elbow. A.R. 638-41. His right-hand exam revealed no tenderness, full composite flexion, and nearly all normal and negative findings. A.R. 640. An April 2013 examination revealed all normal and negative findings for both hands, including full composite flexion, normal sensation and stability, improved left carpal tunnel syndrome, and unchanged assessed right carpal tunnel syndrome. A.R. 622-23. Plaintiff was instructed to resume normal activity and full weight bearing. A.R. 623. In May 2015, Dr. Kearney's examination revealed normal inspection of both hands; no swelling, tenderness, or deformity in either hand; normal range of motion and stability in both hands; full scores on all neurological strength tests; nonpainful facet loadings maneuvers; and negative Spurling's and Tinnel's in both hands. A.R. 844-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   A September 2015 examination revealed abnormal sensation in Plaintiff's left hand, but also normal results for range of motion, stability, strength; full composite flexion; no tenderness; negative Thenar wasting, abductor pollicis, weakness, and hypothenar wasting; negative Tinnel's at carpal tunnel and Tinnel's at Guyon's canal; negative Dupuytren's cord and APB weakness. A.R. 1022-23. The examination included no findings about Plaintiff's right hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The record could support a finding that Plaintiff's left carpal tunnel syndrome largely improved after surgery on his left hand, with only mild to moderate symptoms remaining. And the record supports the ALJ's finding that no evidence shows carpal tunnel syndrome in Plaintiff's right hand to the extent to which Dr. Kearney opined. A single diagnosis does not require a finding of the severity of limitations in Dr. Kearney's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Thus, the record raises significant doubt regarding the severity of Plaintiff's hand and wrist condition. Were this the only basis for disability, a remand for further proceedings clearly would be warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Neck and Back Conditions.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As to Plaintiff's neck and back conditions, Dr. Amrani opined that Plaintiff could sit for six hours; stand and walk for two hours; and lift and carry less than ten pounds. Dr. Amrani also opined that it was medically necessary for Plaintiff to alternate between sitting, standing, and walking, and to rest 1-4 minutes between position changes. Plaintiff testified that he experiences constant pain and pressure in his neck and back, which is exacerbated by being on his feet or moving his head. A.R. 49-53. He also testified that he lays down more than once a day to get relief from his pain. A.R. 52-53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   At the hearing on October 7, 2015, the VE and Plaintiff's counsel had the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Q In an eight hour day if an individual could sit for six hours, stand or walk for more than two, but less than three hours, would that be consistent with the range of sedentary work?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Q If we were to assume the Claimant's testimony, including the need to lay down during the day, would that preclude the performance of Claimant's past work or other work?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   A Yes, it would.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   A.R. 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   With respect to Plaintiff's neck and back conditions, the Court finds no outstanding issues that must be resolved before a disability determination can be made, and no serious doubt that Plaintiff is disabled. As explained above, the medical record reflects a four-year history of reported pain, MRI testing, examinations, nerve blocks, nerve ablations, spinal injections, a spinal fusion, and referrals to pain management specialists. And if Dr. Amrani's opinion and Plaintiff's symptom testimony are credited as true, the VE's testimony establishes that Plaintiff can perform no work. The Court concludes that this is one of the rare cases where remand for an award of benefits is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security is\n   <strong>\n    vacated\n   </strong>\n   , and this case is\n   <strong>\n    remanded for an award of benefits\n   </strong>\n   .
