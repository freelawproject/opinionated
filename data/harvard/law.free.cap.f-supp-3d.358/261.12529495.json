Defendant UBS has moved (1) to dismiss this action on grounds of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens, see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18, and (2) in the alternative, to dismiss Bloomberg's first, second, and fourth causes of action under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 21.

(\"Bloomberg\") is a Delaware limited partnership with its principal place of business in New York City. Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6 12. Bloomberg uses proprietary methods and processes to aggregate, organize, and curate market and reference data for over fifty million financial instruments across a range of asset classes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. Defendant UBS AG (\"UBS\") is a Swiss joint-stock company with its principal place of business in Switzerland.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. UBS operates a federally regulated Federal Branch in New York City.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Bloomberg offers its data via \"Bloomberg Terminal\" subscriptions to individual consumers and via data licenses that allow institutional consumers to access and use the data within the institution's own internal applications and systems. Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6 3. In 1998, Bloomberg and UBS entered into two such data-license agreements, one permitting UBS to use Bloomberg's market data on a fee-per-request basis and the other permitting UBS to download entire Bloomberg data sets in exchange for a monthly recurring fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 19-22, 24-27;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   ex. 1 (Per-Security License), ex. 2 (Bulk-Data License). Because the text of the two agreements is identical in every way relevant to resolving UBS's motions to dismiss, this opinion refers to them collectively as the \"Global Agreements\" and cites to them collectively. Each Agreement contains identical restrictions on UBS's use of the licensed data, including a prohibition on redistribution of that data to third parties.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ex. 1 (Per-Security License) \u00a7\u00a7 4, 6, ex. 2 (Bulk-Data License) \u00a7\u00a7 4, 6. The Agreements also contain provisions specifying that the Agreements were \"made and entered into in the State of New York\"; that they shall be governed by \"the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the conflicts-of-law provisions thereof\"; and that the parties \"consent\n   to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York with respect to any legal proceedings that may result from a dispute as to the interpretation or breach of any of the [Agreements'] terms and conditions....\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . ex. 1 \u00a7 15, ex. 2 \u00a7 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2005, in an agreement referred to as the \"2005 Addendum,\" the parties amended the 1998 Global Agreements to grant UBS limited use of a specified subset of the licensed data \"within\" certain applications that UBS had developed that would be made available to third-party UBS clients-most relevant here, a risk and portfolio-management system called \"UBS Delta.\" Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6\u00b6 35-37;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ex. 3 (2005 Addendum). In exchange for this additional usage right, UBS agreed to pay Bloomberg an annual fee of $ 300,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. The provisions of this Addendum are recited in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In April 2017, StatPro, an English company that provides cloud-based portfolio-management and analytics services, announced that UBS had agreed to sell its UBS Delta application to StatPro. Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6 40. According to a StatPro press release and representations by UBS to Bloomberg, the transaction was scheduled to occur over a period of three to five years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Concerned (1) that as part of the sale transaction, UBS Delta personnel with UBS-purchased Bloomberg Terminal subscriptions would become employees of StatPro in violation of the Terminal subscription agreements, and (2) that because of StatPro's acquisition of UBS Delta, StatPro-a competitor of Bloomberg-would get access to proprietary data Bloomberg had provided to UBS solely for use within UBS Delta, Bloomberg contacted UBS to determine the deal's implications for Bloomberg's data. Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6 41-43. Over the next several months, UBS confirmed, as relevant here, (1) that former UBS Delta employees who had become StatPro employees because of the acquisition were still using Bloomberg Terminal accounts licensed by UBS,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44; (2) that although UBS Delta clients \"cannot download the datasets associated with the [risk] calculations per se (i.e., the inputs),\" UBS Delta enabled them \"to extract their portfolio information on the screen, via pdf or excel\" and to \"see ... the end result which is a blend of data from various Market data suppliers and UBS data sets (including Bloomberg-for example pricing data for a bond comes from Reuters and reference data such as the Coupon comes from Bloomberg),\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52-53 (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In February 2018, Bloomberg notified UBS that Bloomberg was terminating the ten Bloomberg Terminal subscriptions UBS had obtained for its former UBS Delta employees. Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6 56. Bloomberg also demanded that UBS \"cease and desist using Bloomberg data within UBS Delta or any other application made available to UBS customers or other third parties\"; \"cease and desist sharing, making available, and/or allowing access to current and historical data by any third party\"; and \"ensure that all such parties delete and purge any such Bloomberg data.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Between February and June 2018, Bloomberg exercised its right under the Global Agreements to audit UBS's use of its data. Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6\u00b6 60-73;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   ex. 1 \u00a7 8, ex. 2 \u00a7 8. In March 2018, Bloomberg's auditors attended a demonstration of UBS Delta performed by UBS and StatPro at UBS's offices in London.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. This demonstration confirmed that UBS Delta allowed UBS clients to access and download the entire universe of proprietary Bloomberg data made available to UBS under the 2005 Addendum, regardless of whether those clients had\n   Bloomberg data licenses that covered the data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-68. UBS confirmed this state of affairs in writing in May 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In July 2018, UBS notified Bloomberg that it was replacing Bloomberg as a source of data for UBS Delta and expected that the transition to a new data provider would be completed by August 2018. Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6\u00b6 10, 74. According to its complaint, Bloomberg does not contest UBS's right to replace Bloomberg as a source of market data for UBS Delta but contends that without appropriate safeguards, the process of migrating the application from Bloomberg to another data provider poses a substantial risk of exposing Bloomberg's data to a competitor who may, in turn, use that data to \"validate\" or otherwise improve its own data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-81. Despite Bloomberg's requests, UBS has refused to confirm that it will \"delete and purge all Bloomberg data from customer-facing instances of UBS Delta\" and ensure that unauthorized third-party recipients of redistributed Bloomberg data also delete and purge all such data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Bloomberg filed this action on July 12, 2018, asserting four counts of breach of contract and seeking both money damages and injunctive relief to prevent further such damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 (Compl.). On August 13, 2018, UBS made two motions to dismiss: one to dismiss the entire case on grounds of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   ; the other to dismiss Counts I, II, and IV of pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 18-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. UBS's Motion to Dismiss Based on\n    <em>\n     Forum Non Conveniens\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court denies UBS's motion to dismiss this case on grounds of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n   In exercising its discretion to determine whether UBS's motion ought to be granted, the Court proceeds in three steps. First, the Court must determine the degree of deference owed to Bloomberg's choice of forum.\n   <em>\n    Norex Petroleum Ltd. v. Access Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936057\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/416/146/#p153\">\n    416 F.3d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 153 (2d Cir. 2005). Second, the Court must consider whether UBS's proposed alternative forum-the United Kingdom-is adequate to adjudicate the parties' dispute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936057\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/416/146/#p153\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And third, if the proposed alternative forum is indeed adequate, the Court must \"balance[ ] the private and public interests implicated in the choice of forum.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936057\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/416/146/#p153\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court addresses each of these steps in turn. In doing so, the Court considers both the pleadings and the parties' affidavits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Constellation Energy Commodities Grp. Inc. v. Transfield ER Cape Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157162\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/801/211/#p218\">\n    801 F.Supp.2d 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 218 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A. The Degree of Deference Owed to Bloomberg's Choice of Forum\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because Bloomberg has its principal place of business in New York City, its choice to file suit in this Court is owed great deference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iragorri v. United Techs.

As far as the Court can tell, Bloomberg sued UBS in the Southern District of New York because it is Bloomberg's home district; because UBS is amenable to suit here; and because the suit seeks to vindicate contractual rights entered into in the State of New York and governed by New York law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6 12 (alleging that Bloomberg's principal place of business is in New York City); Dkt. 19 (FNC Mot.) at 2 n.5 (conceding that the relevant agreements are governed by New York law);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 (Compl.) ex. 1 \u00a7 15, ex. 2 \u00a7 15 (section of Global Agreements providing that Agreements are \"made and entered into in the State of New York and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York\"). UBS offers no persuasive reason to believe otherwise. Contrary to UBS's argument, the fact that Bloomberg chose its home forum, where\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   employees and documents are located (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6 12), over a different forum, where\n   <em>\n    UBS's\n   </em>\n   employees and documents are located, is not itself evidence of illegitimate forum shopping.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union Fire Ins.

May 20, 2003) (Lynch, J.) (\"[T]he fact that plaintiffs unquestionably chose a time and place of filing that was to their liking and elected to file in the United States rather than to join the litigation in the United Kingdom does not demonstrate any improper motivation.\"). A contrary holding would practically nullify the principle that \"the greatest deference is afforded a plaintiff's choice of its home forum,\"\n   <em>\n    Norex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936057\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/416/146/#p153\">\n    416 F.3d at 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in the broad swath of cases in which the defendant is not headquartered or substantially present in the plaintiff's home forum. The Court refuses to endorse such an approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court also rejects UBS's argument that the Court owes less deference to Bloomberg's choice of forum because it \"has not filed suit in the venue provided in the parties' agreements, which refer to 'the courts of the State of New York,' not this federal court.\" Dkt. 19 (FNC Mot.) at 3 &amp; nn. 7-8. If anything, the fact that the parties agreed to litigate in\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   court in New York State is further proof that Bloomberg's choice to sue UBS here rather than in the United Kingdom was motivated by convenience rather than illegitimate strategic or tactical considerations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reliance Ins.

Dkt. 1 (Compl.) ex. 3 \u00b6 8. Like the parties' original Global Agreements, however, this addendum provides that UBS \"may not use or disseminate such Data in any way which could, as determined in [Bloomberg's] sole good faith discretion, either (i) cause the information so used or distributed to be used as a source of or substitute for the Data otherwise\" obtainable only through a Bloomberg subscription or \"(ii) compete with the business of\" Bloomberg or its affiliates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070496\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/64/#p70\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Paragraph 10 of the Addendum specifies that UBS is permitted to insert hyperlinks into UBS Delta that, if clicked, will bring UBS Delta users who subscribe to Bloomberg to the Exhibit C data on Bloomberg's own subscription service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The first count of Bloomberg's complaint plausibly asserts that UBS has breached these provisions. Bloomberg's complaint alleges that UBS personnel acknowledged that UBS Delta clients \"are able to extract [their UBS Delta] portfolio information on the screen, via pdf or excel,\" and that, although clients \"cannot download the datasets associated with the calculations per se (i.e., the inputs),\" they can see \"the end result which is a blend of data from various Market data suppliers and UBS data sets (including Bloomberg-for example pricing data for a bond comes from Reuters and reference data such as the Coupon comes from Bloomberg).\" Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As Bloomberg's complaint explains, Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6 54, if that \"reference data\" includes information that Bloomberg provided to UBS pursuant to Exhibit C of the 2005 Addendum, then UBS's creation of an application permitting UBS clients to \"extract\" \"a blend of data\" containing that reference data would be a three-fold breach of the parties' Agreements. First, it\n   would run afoul of the prohibition in Section 4 of the Global Agreements on UBS using or disseminating Bloomberg's data \"in any way which could cause the information so used or disseminated ... to be a source of or substitute for the Data otherwise\" obtainable only through a Bloomberg subscription.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 1 (Compl.) ex. 1 \u00a7 4, ex. 2 \u00a7 4;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   ex. 3 \u00b6 8. Second, it would trigger the Global Agreements' provision \"that the dissemination or distribution by [UBS] of information identical or similar to [Bloomberg's] Data and from which dissemination or distribution [UBS] derives or may derive commercial revenue shall be deemed a breach\" of Section 4.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ex. 1 \u00a7 6, ex. 2 \u00a7 6. And third, it would contravene another clause of Section 4 of the Global Agreements barring UBS from \"stor[ing] all or any part of [Bloomberg's] Data in databases for access by any third party or to distribute any database services containing all or part of such Data....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   According to the complaint, Bloomberg's audit confirmed that UBS Delta does, in fact, enable UBS clients to download Bloomberg data in violation of the above provisions. A UBS demonstration of the application confirmed that \"the UBS Delta service did in fact allow UBS clients to access and export proprietary Bloomberg data,\n   <em>\n    regardless of whether the UBS client itself had a Bloomberg data license covering the data in question\n   </em>\n   ,\" and that \"UBS Delta clients could access and download Bloomberg reference data associated not just with those users' actual portfolio holdings, but with the\n   <em>\n    entire universe\n   </em>\n   of Bloomberg reference data made available to UBS under Section 8 of the 2005 Addendum.\" Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6 67-68 (first emphasis added). Taking these specific allegations as true, Bloomberg's first count plausibly pleads a breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   UBS's primary counterargument is that the 2005 Second Addendum specifically permitted UBS to allow its clients to extract Bloomberg's proprietary reference data. Dkt. 22 (Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss Counts I, II, and IV) (hereafter, \"12(b) Mot.\") at 8-13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 37 (UBS Reply) at 5 (\"[T]he very terms of the Agreements ...\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     expressly permit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   access to and distribution of Bloomberg data.\"). In support of its argument, UBS points to Paragraph 8 of the 2005 Addendum, which provides that UBS \"may use the Data elements set forth on Exhibit C within certain [UBS]-developed applications\"-including UBS Delta-\"whereas such ... Applications are designed to facilitate transactions with\" UBS. Dkt. 22 (12(b) Mot.) at 9-10 (citing Dkt. 1 (Compl.) ex. 3 \u00b6 8). It is unclear, however, how that language authorized UBS to deliver Bloomberg's proprietary data to UBS's clients in a format in which those clients could download or otherwise extract the data at will, as Bloomberg specifically alleges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6\u00b6 52-53, 67-68. Indeed, Paragraph 8's text cuts exactly the other way, authorizing UBS to use the Exhibit C data \"within\" UBS Delta and not in a way that would either (1) obviate the need for UBS Delta clients to subscribe to Bloomberg directly or (2) cause UBS Delta to compete with Bloomberg's data-subscription business. Dkt. 1 (Compl.) ex. 3 \u00b6 8. Authorizing UBS Delta clients to download Bloomberg's data-including not only \"reference\n   data associated ... with those users' actual portfolio holdings,\" but also \"the\n   <em>\n    entire universe\n   </em>\n   of Bloomberg reference data made available to UBS under Section 8 of the 2005 Addendum,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68-goes well beyond using the data \"within\" UBS Delta to facilitate transactions with UBS, as Paragraph 8 of the 2005 Addendum permits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   UBS also points to Paragraphs 10 and 11 of the 2005 Addendum in support of its argument that the 2005 Addendum authorized the alleged data redistribution on which Count I is premised. Paragraph 11 requires UBS to \"obtain and maintain all necessary approvals, consents and authorizations required for the use, distribution, and dissemination of the Licensee Applications and the Data from Exhibit C as contemplated by this Second Addendum, including, but not limited to, any necessary licenses from any third parties for third party data.\" Dkt. 1 (Compl.) ex. 3 \u00b6 11. Paragraph 10 authorizes UBS to \"insert hyperlinks to the Bloomberg Professional\u00ae Service\" \"within\" UBS Delta.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. UBS asserts that these provisions would be superfluous \"if it was not intended by the parties that the Exhibit C Data would be visible and potentially distributed to external clients of UBS Delta.\" Dkt. 22 (12(b) Mot.) at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court disagrees. Paragraph 11's phrase \"as contemplated by this Second Addendum\" suggests that it was not an affirmative grant of data-distribution rights but instead simply a common-sense obligation imposed on UBS to maintain necessary approvals to protect Bloomberg (and UBS, for that matter) from third-party claims relating to UBS's distribution of the UBS Delta application and, as used within that application, Bloomberg's proprietary reference data. It would make little sense for the parties to have further commented on UBS's new rights under the 2005 Addendum in Paragraph 11 when they had already laid out the scope of those rights in detail in Section 4 of the Global Agreements, as amended by Paragraph 8 of the 2005 Addendum.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blackmon v.

If Paragraph 8 of the Addendum authorized UBS to hand out Bloomberg's reference data to UBS customers willy-nilly, as Bloomberg alleges UBS has done, then it would make little sense for the parties to provide for hyperlinks to the same data through Bloomberg's paywalled subscription service: UBS's clients would have little reason, if any, to ever use the hyperlinks and a great deal of financial incentive\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to use them.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Two Guys From Harrison-N.Y., Inc. v.

UBS's Challenge to Count II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Count II also states a plausible claim for breach of contract based on UBS's alleged unauthorized use of Bloomberg's proprietary data to compete with Bloomberg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As a refresher, although Section 4 of the Global Agreements authorizes UBS to \"use and disseminate to its customers and prospective customers a limited amount of Data directly related to the type and extent of the customer relationship,\" that section also expressly prohibits UBS from using, transferring, distributing or disposing of the Data or Resultant Data \"in any manner that could compete\" with Bloomberg's business. Dkt. 1 (Compl.) ex. 1 \u00a7 4, ex. 2 \u00a7 4. Paragraph 8 of the 2005 Addendum-which modified Section 4 to permit UBS to use Exhibit C data \"within\" UBS Delta-similarly specifies that UBS \"may not use or disseminate such Data in any way which could, as determined in [Bloomberg's] sole good faith discretion, ... compete with the business of\" Bloomberg or its affiliates. Dkt. 1 (Compl.) ex. 3 \u00b6 8. Bloomberg's second cause of action asserts that \"[b]y charging UBS customers to access a system that allows the downloading of proprietary Bloomberg data, UBS has effectively competed with Bloomberg's\n   data licensing business\" in violation of these non-compete provisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95-97. This theory is quite plausible: as noted,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   n.3, drawing all inferences in Bloomberg's favor, a UBS client who can download \"the entire universe of Bloomberg reference data made available to UBS under Section 8 of the 2005 Addendum,\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68 (emphasis added), has little reason to pay for a separate subscription to receive that data directly from Bloomberg. If that is not competition, then it is unclear what is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   UBS argues that Bloomberg has not alleged \"that customers of UBS Delta have been accessing and downloading the limited Exhibit C Data in such a manner as to render their Bloomberg subscriptions (if any) obsolete.\" Dkt. 22 (12(b) Mot.) at 12. This counterargument misses the point: the text of both the Global Agreements and the 2005 Addendum prohibits any use or distribution of Bloomberg's data that\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   compete with Bloomberg's business, not just use or distribution that is proven to have caused successful competition. Drawing all inferences in Bloomberg's favor, it is plausible that permitting UBS Delta users to download Bloomberg's proprietary data at will creates the risk that those users will opt not to subscribe directly to Bloomberg, thereby undermining Bloomberg's data-subscription service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   UBS also challenges a second theory of breach underlying Count II: that UBS Delta competes with Bloomberg's \"PORT+\" product in violation of the parties' agreements because UBS Delta uses Bloomberg's proprietary data to \"allow[ ] users to analyze various risk metrics and generate organizational-level reports\"-functionalities that Bloomberg's PORT+ application also provides. Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6\u00b6 98-100. UBS argues,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22 (12(b) Mot.) at 13, that this theory of breach must be rejected as a matter of law because the Global Agreements permit UBS to compete with Bloomberg in a business \"in which [Bloomberg] was not engaged on the initial date of [the] Agreement[s]\" and in which UBS \"was engaged on the initial date of [the] Agreement[s],\" Dkt. 1 (Compl.) ex. 1 \u00a7 4, ex. 2 \u00a7 4. A factual question, however, precludes the Court from dismissing Count II's PORT+ theory on this basis: Bloomberg's complaint does not allege when either party began operating their PORT+ and UBS Delta applications, details essential to assessing whether the safe-harbor provision UBS cites is applicable to UBS Delta. And, in any event, UBS's interpretation of that provision leaves out a key limitation on any right UBS may have had to compete with PORT+: even if Bloomberg was not operating PORT+ on September 28, 1998, when the Global Agreements were first ratified, and even if UBS was operating UBS Delta (or a predecessor product) on that date, as UBS contends, the safe-harbor provision authorized UBS to compete with Bloomberg's PORT+ application only \"for the remaining term of [the] Agreement[s],\" \"not including renewals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ex. 1 \u00a7 4, ex. 2 \u00a7 4. Under Section 2 of the Agreements, the Agreements' first term\n   expired on September 28, 2000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2. Any competition after that date, therefore, was not within the safe harbor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Therefore, the Court rejects UBS's assertion that the text of the parties' Agreements precludes Count II of Bloomberg's complaint as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   B. Count IV Adequately Alleges Standing and States a Claim for Breach of Contract\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Count IV of Bloomberg's complaint adequately alleges Article III standing and plausibly pleads a claim for breach of contract premised on UBS's alleged unauthorized exposure of Bloomberg's data to competing data vendors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In considering a facial motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), the Court must \"determine whether the [complaint] alleges facts that affirmatively and plausibly suggest that the plaintiff has standing to sue.\"\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

Dkt. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6\u00b6 114-16. Bloomberg further alleges that absent appropriate safeguards, like the purging of Bloomberg's data from UBS Delta, the process of migrating UBS Delta to another data provider will likely expose its data to use by that new data provider, thereby violating Section 4 of the Global Agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-83, 113-21;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   ex. 1 \u00a7 4, ex. 2 \u00a7 4 (\"In no event will [UBS] permit the Data to be used in any way not specifically authorized by [Bloomberg] or distributed, published, copied, broadcasted, reproduced, ported, or otherwise routed to any third party in any way not authorized herein.\").

Even if UBS's argument may ultimately prove to be correct, it does not entitle it to dismissal of Count I at this stage of the litigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Quoting from the parties' agreements, UBS suggests that because neither it nor its UBS Delta product \"is a 'source of or substitute for' Bloomberg,\" Dkt. 22 (12(b) Mot.) at 12-13 (quoting Dkt. 1 (Compl.) ex. 1 \u00a7 4, ex. 2 \u00a7 4, ex. 3 \u00b6 8), \"UBS's use of the limited Exhibit C Data within its UBS Delta application, including to the extent such data is visible to or distributed to UBS Delta clients, cannot be a breach of the Global Agreements,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 13;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 37 (UBS Reply) at 7-8 (\"[T]he mere ability to export data from the UBS Delta product, even to the extent it includes incidental reference data from Bloomberg and/or other data providers, does not transform UBS or UBS Delta into a market data provider in competition with Bloomberg.\"). This is a red herring. The clause UBS cites does not prohibit UBS or UBS Delta from becoming a substitute for Bloomberg itself; it prohibits UBS from using or distributing Bloomberg's data in a way that could cause UBS Delta or UBS's other products and services to displace a UBS client's need to subscribe to Bloomberg's data services directly. Bloomberg no doubt agrees that UBS and its products are no substitute for Bloomberg. But one way Bloomberg can prevent a licensee and its products from ever becoming such a substitute is to tightly limit the licensee's authority to redistribute Bloomberg's data. Bloomberg's complaint offers specific, factual allegations that, if true, show that UBS has exceeded exactly those sorts of limitations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    At trial, Bloomberg will, of course, need to offer proof of damages to succeed on Count II.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rex Med.

Feb. 11, 2016) (citations and alterations omitted). Given the value of Bloomberg's proprietary data and the cost of a Bloomberg subscription, it is more than reasonable to infer that UBS's alleged redistribution of Bloomberg's data through UBS Delta in violation of the parties' agreements caused damage to Bloomberg in the form of at least some lost subscription fees.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Like Bloomberg, the Court is uncertain why UBS interprets Count II as \"tak[ing] issue with UBS's use and distribution of 'Resultant Data' \" specifically, as opposed to Bloomberg's data more generally.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 22 (12(b) Mot.) at 13. Count II alleges that \"[b]y charging UBS customers to access a system that allows the downloading of proprietary Bloomberg\n    <em>\n     data\n    </em>\n    , UBS has effectively competed with Bloomberg's data licensing business in violation of\" the Global Agreements and the 2005 Addendum.

It furthermore alleges that \"[b]y using the\n    <em>\n     data\n    </em>\n    licensed under the Global Agreements in UBS Delta, UBS has ... used that data in a manner that competes with [Bloomberg's] business ..., in violation of the Global Agreements as amended by the 2005 Addendum.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 100 (emphasis added). UBS's argument appears to misinterpret Bloomberg's complaint, so the Court rejects it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    In its reply, UBS asserts that it \"focuses on the contract provisions relating to Resultant Data because that is the focus of Bloomberg's allegations with regard to PORT+,\" citing paragraph ninety-nine of the complaint. Dkt. 37 (UBS Reply) at 8. UBS does not justify its assertion, however, that the kinds of data to which Bloomberg refers in that paragraph are \"Resultant Data\" that are not subject to the agreements' general prohibitions on using Bloomberg's data in ways that could compete with Bloomberg. UBS's argument therefore is not persuasive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    UBS paid Bloomberg $ 300,000 annually just for a limited right to use the data set forth in Exhibit C to the 2005 Addendum.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 1 (Compl.) ex. 3 \u00b6 8.

Dkt. 32 (Mem. in Opp. to UBS Mots.) at 25 n.21. Because the Court holds that Count IV adequately pleads standing by itself, consideration of Bloomberg's proposed declaration is unnecessary. Bloomberg remains free, of course, to submit evidence of the facts contained in its declaration at later stages of this litigation. Because Bloomberg's evidentiary burden will increase at each stage, it may be advisable for it to do so.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lujan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     504 U.S. at 561\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     112 S.Ct. 2130\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"In response to a summary judgment motion ... the plaintiff can no longer rest on ... mere allegations, but must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts ... which for purposes of the summary judgment motion will be taken to be true.

Because UBS's challenge to Count IV is a \"facial\" one-that is, \"based solely on the allegations of the complaint or the complaint and exhibits attached to it\"-Bloomberg \"has no evidentiary burden\" at this stage, and the Court must \"determine whether the [Complaint alone] alleges facts that affirmatively and plausibly suggest that [Bloomberg] has standing to sue.\"\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055671\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/47/#p56\">\n     822 F.3d at 56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citations and alterations omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
