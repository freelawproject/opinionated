By adding the word \"plausibility\" to the requirements for stating a claim for relief, the Court retired the more lenient \"notice\" pleading standard that governed the adequacy of complaints since\n   <em>\n    Conley v. Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161830\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/41/\">\n    355 U.S. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161830\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/41/\">\n    78 S.Ct. 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161830\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/41/\">\n    2 L.Ed.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1957). But the Court has never said whether\n   <em>\n    Twiqbal\n   </em>\n   's plausibility requirement extended to all types of pleadings, including pleading affirmative defenses in an answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case presents a resulting question-one that's divided federal district courts for the better part of a decade. Should the stricter plausibility requirement set forth in\n   <em>\n    Twiqbal\n   </em>\n   apply equally to pleading affirmative defenses in an answer? The short answer is plainly \"no.\" The text of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, the principles underlying the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Twiqbal\n   </em>\n   , and the practicalities of pretrial litigation all weigh against extending the plausibility requirement to affirmative defenses. This Court now concludes, as settled precedent suggests, that affirmative defenses may be stated in \"general terms\" and need only provide the plaintiff with \"fair notice\" of their nature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kohler v.

Defendant Durham School Services, L.P. (\"DSS\") may file an amended answer within\n   <strong>\n    21 days\n   </strong>\n   of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1. PRELIMINARY MATTERS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before reviewing Nguyen's motion, the Court addresses two preliminary issues raised by the parties' briefing. DSS argues Nguyen's motion is untimely under the Federal Rules, and that Nguyen failed to comply with the meet and confer requirement of Local Rule 7-3. (Opp'n, Dkt. No. 15 at 2-3.) Moving forward, the Court expects the parties to comply with the\n   spirit and letter of the Federal Rules and this Court's Local Rules. For now, in the interest of justice, the Court reviews the pending motion on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    2. BRIEF BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A brief review of the facts is helpful. Nguyen worked as a maintenance mechanic for DSS. (Compl., Dkt. No. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 15, 20.) Nguyen alleges DSS engaged in a variety of misconduct. Specifically, Nguyen claims DSS discriminated against Nguyen because of his age, retaliated against Nguyen because of his union involvement, and deprived Nguyen of legally mandated meal and rest breaks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 26, 28, 30, 31.) Nguyen was eventually terminated by DSS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.) Nguyen then brought this case asserting nine different state law claims concerning Nguyen's employment with DSS. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nguyen chose to file this case involving state law claims in Orange County state court, but DSS removed it to this Court under 28 U.S.C. Sections 1332(a)(1) and 1441(a) - (b). (Notice of Removal, Dkt. No. 1 at 1.) After DSS removed, DSS filed an answer to Nguyen's complaint stating twenty-one affirmative defenses. (Answer, Dkt. No. 12 at 12-17.) DSS also included an \"other additional defenses\" allegation in its answer purporting to preserve DSS's \"right to allege other additional defenses as they may become known during discovery or otherwise\". (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A few weeks later, Nguyen moved to strike eleven of DSS's twenty-one defenses, and DSS's \"other additional defenses\" allegation. (Mot., Dkt. No. 14 at 2.) Nguyen argues that the affirmative defenses at issue are \"not affirmative defenses at all\", are insufficiently pled, and are \"immaterial or impertinent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) DSS responds that its affirmative defenses are appropriate and adequately alleged, and further argues that, in any event, Nguyen isn't prejudiced by DSS's answer. (Opp'n at 4-5.) The Court questions whether asserting twenty-one affirmative defenses and attacking fifteen of them proportionally pursues justice in this case.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b). But the Court plows ahead with these procedural perturbations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    3. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[T]he court may order stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). At issue here, of course, are the pleading requirements of Rule 8. A motion to strike under Rule 12(f) is designed to \"avoid the expenditure of time and money that must arise from litigating spurious issues by dispensing with those issues prior to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Whittlestone, Inc. v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Since Nguyen argues DSS's affirmative defenses are, among other things, insufficiently pled, the Court must first determine what pleading standard under Rule 8 governs affirmative defenses.

Under Rule 8(a), the party stating a claim for relief-usually the plaintiff-must provide \"a short and plain statement of the claim\n   <em>\n    showing\n   </em>\n   that the pleader is entitled to relief\". Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) (emphasis added). But Rules 8(b) and 8(c) require less of the party responding to a claim for relief-usually the defendant. Rule 8(b) only requires responsive pleadings to, among other things,\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   in \"short and plain terms\" any defenses. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(1). Likewise, Rule 8(c) only requires that an affirmative defense be \"affirmatively\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    d\n   </em>\n   ]\". Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c) (emphasis added). The important textual distinction here is between the words \"show\" and \"state\". When pleading claims in a complaint, Rule 8(a) requires a plaintiff to\n   <em>\n    show\n   </em>\n   it's entitled to relief. But when a defendant asserts affirmative defenses in an answer, Rules 8(b) and 8(c) only require that those defenses be\n   <em>\n    stated.\n   </em>\n   Showing something, rather than simply stating it in plain terms, is a more difficult task.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pavelic &amp; LeFlore v.

If this is true, then the logic grounding the Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Twiqbal\n   </em>\n   shouldn't apply to pleading affirmative defenses in an answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    4.2.3 Practical Distinctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   There are also practical distinctions between a plaintiff's complaint and a defendant's answer that weigh against extending\n   <em>\n    Twiqbal\n   </em>\n   to affirmative defenses. The most obvious of these distinctions is the amount of time each party has to compose their respective pleading. Plaintiffs can decide when to file a complaint within the relevant statute of limitations, giving plaintiffs ample opportunity to develop factual support for their claims and draft their complaints accordingly. But defendants only have twenty-one days after being served with a summons and complaint to draft their response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a). And, within this twenty-one-day window, defendants must also find a lawyer and investigate the facts of the case. This \"asymmetry of information and time\" highlights a \"fundamental difference between the function of pleading for plaintiffs and defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pysno,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 1656\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Odyssey Imaging, LLC v.

Va. 2010) ). Because of this distinction, it's \"reasonable to impose stricter pleading requirements on a plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Kohler v. Staples the Office Superstore, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258229\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/291/464/#p469\">\n    291 F.R.D. 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 469 (S.D. Cal. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This practical distinction concerning timing ties into the looming threat of waiver. Defendants risk permanently waiving any affirmative defenses not raised in their initial response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kern Oil &amp; Refining Co. v. Tenneco Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546590\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/840/730/#p735\">\n    840 F.2d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735 (9th Cir. 1988). And if\n   <em>\n    Twiqbal\n   </em>\n   's plausibility requirement was extended to affirmative defenses, waiver is much more likely. Indeed, defendants would be forced to waive any defenses that couldn't be adequately supported in the three short weeks they have to draft their answers. And although defendants could avoid waiver by amending their answers under Rule 15, \"this indirect solution transforms the amendment process into a corrective mechanism never envisioned by the Rulemakers.\" Justin Rand,\n   <em>\n    Tightening Twiqbal: Why Plausibility Must Be Confined to the Complaint\n   </em>\n   , 9 Fed. Cts. L. Rev. 79, 99 (2016). The heightened risk of waiver and the affect this risk may have on the amendment process further justifies holding defendants to a more lenient pleading standard than plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Further, attacks on answers usually occur, as here, through a motion to strike under Rule 12(f). Such motions have long been \"disfavored.\"\n   <em>\n    Petrie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152065\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/959/#p965\">\n    761 F.3d at 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But applying\n   <em>\n    Twiqbal\n   </em>\n   's plausibility requirement to affirmative defenses would encourage litigants to file more 12(f) motions, thus undercutting the longstanding principle that Rule 12(f) motions are a drastic remedy and should rarely be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stanbury Law Firm, P.A. v. IRS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11246307\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/1059/#p1063\">\n    221 F.3d 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1063 (8th Cir. 2000) (\"[S]triking a party's pleadings is an extreme measure, and, as a result, ... motions to strike ... are viewed with disfavor and are infrequently granted.\" (internal quotations omitted) ). And in any event, the easier pleading standard is more suitable for defeating a \"disfavored\" motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   There's one final practical distinction bearing mention, and it's a simple one: the plaintiff is the party who initiates the lawsuit. It makes sense, then, to ask more of the plaintiff at the outset of the case. After all, a defendant doesn't come to court by choice-the plaintiff forces them to appear. And it's the plaintiff who invokes the court's jurisdiction in the first instance. The Supreme Court touched on this in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   , explaining that a heightened pleading standard was necessary to prevent plaintiffs from \"tak[ing] up the time of a number of other people\" with \"largely groundless claim[s]\".\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations and citations omitted). But affirmative defenses don't impose these same burdens. Affirmative defenses only come into play after the game has already started and the players have already taken the field. Affirmative defenses don't initiate a lawsuit, nor do they invoke the court's jurisdiction. It's therefore more important to screen complaints for adequate factual support early on in a lawsuit than affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Put simply, the heightened pleading requirement of\n   <em>\n    Twiqbal\n   </em>\n   doesn't apply to affirmative defenses because of the textual distinctions in the plain language of Rule 8, the working principles underlying the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Twiqbal\n   </em>\n   , and the practicalities of pretrial litigation. Instead, affirmative defenses need only be stated in \"general terms\" and provide \"fair notice\" of their nature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kohler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011371\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/1016/#p1019\">\n    779 F.3d at 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    4.3 The Present Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Having concluded affirmative defenses are governed by a fair notice standard, the Court turns back to the case at hand. Nguyen moves to strike fifteen of DSS's twenty-one affirmative defenses and DSS's \"other additional defenses\" allegation from DSS's answer. (Mot. at 2.) Nguyen argues these defenses should be stricken for various reasons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These issues were thoroughly reviewed with the parties leading up to the hearing. Thus, it's sufficient here to address these issues broadly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   To the extent Nguyen argues some of DSS's defenses should be stricken for not being affirmative defenses at all, the Court mostly agrees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zivkovic v.

Cal. Jan. 31, 2014) (\"A defense that reserves the right to assert defenses later is not a defense.\") With the exception of DSS's first defense, these defenses are more appropriately characterized as specific denials to certain allegations in Nguyen's complaint. But because DSS already makes these denials elsewhere in its answer, the Court finds that these defenses should be stricken as redundant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). And when a defendant oddly chooses to include these defenses, the burden of proof potentially shifts from the plaintiff to the defendant, which should be avoided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   But the Court disagrees with Nguyen's arguments about the factual sufficiency of DSS's defenses. Nguyen claims many of DSS's affirmative defenses fail because they consist of \"bare-bones, conclusory allegation[s]\". (Mot. at 7.) Not so. As discussed previously, fair notice is a less demanding standard than what\n   <em>\n    Twiqbal\n   </em>\n   requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kohler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011371\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/1016/#p1019\">\n    779 F.3d at 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that fair notice only requires \"describing [an affirmative] defense in 'general terms' \");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   5 C.

And DSS has provided fair notice here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Nor is the Court convinced that DSS's defenses are immaterial or impertinent, as Nguyen suggests. (Mot. at 9-10.) At this early stage, it can't be said that these defenses bear \"no essential or important relationship\" to Nguyen's claims, or that these defenses aren't otherwise necessary to the issues in question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519091\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/984/1524/#p1527\">\n    984 F.2d 1524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1527 (9th Cir. 1993),\n   <em>\n    rev'd on other grounds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230153\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/517/\">\n    510 U.S. 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230153\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/517/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230153\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/517/\">\n    127 L.Ed.2d 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   So, in light of all this, the Court makes the following rulings. The Court GRANTS Nguyen's motion to strike DSS's fifteenth and seventeenth affirmative defenses and DSS's \"other additional defenses\" allegation. The Court DENIES Nguyen's motion to strike DSS's other thirteen affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    4.4 Whether Leave to Amend Should Be Granted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   DSS asks the court for leave to amend any defenses that are stricken. (Opp'n at 11.) \"Unless it would prejudice the opposing party, courts freely grant leave to amend stricken pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Kohler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280472\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/280/560/#p564\">\n    280 F.R.D. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   564 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wyshak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1431785\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/607/824/\">\n    607 F.2d at 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In the absence of prejudice to the opposing party, leave to amend should be freely given.\"). Nguyen gives no\n   reason why granting leave to amend here would result in prejudice. The Court therefore GRANTS DSS leave to amend its answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    5. DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For these reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Nguyen's motion to strike WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. DSS may file an amended answer within\n   <strong>\n    21 days\n   </strong>\n   of this Order.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
