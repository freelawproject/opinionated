First, plaintiffs' state court action is not brought against the Legislative Defendants \"for refusing to do\" anything.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201443\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). Rather, plaintiffs challenge an action already completed, in the form of the 2017 Plans, as \"unconstitutional and invalid.\" (Am. Compl. p. 75). Legislative Defendants are \"necessary parties\" in any such suit where \"the validity or constitutionality of an act of the General Assembly or a provision of the Constitution of North Carolina is the subject of an action.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20120-32.6\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 120-32.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.C. R. Civ. P. 19(d). Plaintiffs' prayer for injunctive relief further reinforces this point, where they seek to enjoin defendants from \"administering, preparing for, or moving forward with the 2020 primary and general elections ...\n   <em>\n    using\n   </em>\n   the 2017 plans,\" which not a legislative activity. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 75). Finally, they do not seek an injunction compelling the Legislative Defendants to act, but rather call upon the state court to establish new plans \"\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the North Carolina General Assembly fails to\" do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added). In such circumstances, as this court already has observed, \"it is not entirely clear what the defendants refuse to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Stephenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9449945\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/180/779/\">\n    180 F.Supp.2d at 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Second, plaintiffs' action is not removable by the Legislative Defendants because they have only a legislative role, rather than a law enforcement role. The Supreme Court, the Fourth Circuit en banc, and other federal courts have recognized that the \"refusal\" clause of \u00a7 1443 was intended to apply to \"state officers who refused\n   <em>\n    to enforce\n   </em>\n   \" state laws.\n   <em>\n    Baines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"836070\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/357/756/#p759\">\n    357 F.2d at 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peacock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047816\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/808/\">\n    384 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   824 n.22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12047816\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/808/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting clause was \"intended to enable State officers.... refusing to enforce\" state laws in reference to federal equal protection laws).

This distinction is important in the instant context, where it is doubtful there has been a refusal to act within the application of this removal provision on the part of the Legislative Defendants.

In such circumstances, the court adheres to its earlier analysis in\n   <em>\n    Stephenson\n   </em>\n   , finding the purported conflict uncertain and speculative.

(Leg. Defs' Opp. (DE 42) at 14). For purposes of the present jurisdictional determination, however, under which doubts must be resolved in favor of remand, and where it is already doubtful that \u00a7 1443(2) applies at all to Legislative Defendants, it suffices that it is uncertain and speculative whether the ultimate relief sought in plaintiffs' complaint in the form of new plans \"comporting with the North Carolina Constitution\" would conflict with federal law.
