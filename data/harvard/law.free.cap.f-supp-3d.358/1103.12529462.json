After all, inmates have no choice but to rely on prison authorities to treat their medical needs, and \"if the authorities fail to do so, those needs will not be met.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Prison authorities thus treat inmates with all manner of routine medical conditions - broken bones are set; diabetic inmates receive insulin ; inmates with cancer receive chemotherapy; and so on. This constitutional\n   duty also applies to far less routine, and even controversial, procedures - if necessary to address a serious medical need. And so it is here. Plaintiff Adree Edmo alleges that prison authorities violated her Eighth Amendment rights by refusing to provide her with gender confirmation surgery. For the reasons explained below, the Court agrees and will order defendants to provide her with this procedure, a surgery which is considered medically necessary under generally accepted standards of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court will explain its reasoning below but will first pause to place this decision in a broader context. The Rule of Law, which is the bedrock of our legal system, promises that all individuals will be afforded the full protection of our legal system and the rights guaranteed by our Constitution. This is so whether the individual seeking that protection is black, white, male, female, gay, straight, or, as in this case, transgender. This decision requires the Court to confront the full breadth and meaning of that promise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Adree Edmo is a male-to-female transgender prisoner in the custody of the Idaho Department of Correction (\"IDOC\"). She has been incarcerated since April 2012. In June 2012, soon after being incarcerated, an IDOC psychiatrist diagnosed Ms. Edmo with gender dysphoria. An IDOC psychologist confirmed that diagnosis a month later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Gender dysphoria is a medical condition experienced by transgender individuals in which the incongruity between their assigned gender and their actual gender identity is so severe that it impairs the individual's ability to function. The treatment for gender dysphoria depends upon the severity of the condition. Many transgender individuals are comfortable living with their gender identity, role, and expression without surgery. For others, however, gender confirmation surgery, also known as gender or sex reassignment surgery (\"SRS\"), is the only effective treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To treat Ms. Edmo's gender dysphoria, medical staff at the prison appropriately began by providing Ms. Edmo with hormone therapy. This continued until she was hormonally confirmed - meaning she had the same circulating sex hormones and secondary sex characteristics as a typical adult female. Ms. Edmo thus achieved the maximum physical changes associated with hormone treatment. But, Ms. Edmo continued to experience such extreme gender dysphoria that she twice attempted self-castration. For her second attempt, Ms. Edmo prepared for weeks by studying the anatomy of the scrotum and took steps to diminish the chance of infection by boiling a razor blade and scrubbing her hands with soap. She was successful in opening the scrotum and exposing a testicle. But because there was too much blood, Ms. Edmo abandoned her second self-castration attempt and sought medical assistance. She was transported to a hospital where her testicle was repaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As already noted, an inmate has no choice but to rely on prison authorities to treat their medical needs. For this reason, the United States Supreme Court has held that deliberate indifference to a prisoner's serious medical needs constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estelle v. Gamble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p103\">\n    429 U.S. 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 103,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p103\">\n    97 S.Ct. 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p103\">\n    50 L.Ed.2d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). To show such deliberate indifference, Ms. Edmo must establish two things. First, she must show a \"serious medical need\" by demonstrating that failure to treat a medical condition could result in significant further injury or the \"unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\" Second, she must show that the\n   prison officials were aware of and failed to respond to her pain and medical needs, and that she suffered some harm because of that failure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Edmo's case satisfies both elements of the deliberate indifference test. She has presented extensive evidence that, despite years of hormone therapy, she continues to experience gender dysphoria so significant that she cuts herself to relieve emotional pain. She also continues to experience thoughts of self-castration and is at serious risk of acting on that impulse. With full awareness of Ms. Edmo's circumstances, IDOC and its medical provider Corizon refuse to provide Ms. Edmo with gender confirmation surgery. In refusing to provide that surgery, IDOC and Corizon have ignored generally accepted medical standards for the treatment of gender dysphoria. This constitutes deliberate indifference to Ms. Edmo's serious medical needs and violates her rights under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Accordingly, for the reasons explained in detail below, IDOC and Corizon will be ordered to provide Ms. Edmo with gender confirmation surgery. Thus, the Court will grant in part Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In so ruling, the Court notes that its decision is based upon, and limited to, the unique facts and circumstances presented by Ms. Edmo's case. This decision is not intended, and should not be construed, as a general finding that all inmates suffering from gender dysphoria are entitled to gender confirmation surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Transgender and Gender Dysphoria\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   1. Transgender is an umbrella term for a person whose gender identity is not congruent with their assigned gender. Tr. 50:5-11. A transgender person suffers from gender dysphoria when that incongruity is so severe that it impairs the individual's ability to function. Tr. 50:12-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   2. The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\"DSM-5\") sets forth specific criteria which must exist before a diagnosis of gender dysphoria is appropriate. Specifically, two conditions are required:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   a. First, there must be marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, of at least six month's duration, as manifested by at least two of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   i. A marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ii. A strong desire to be rid of one's primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one's experienced/expressed gender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-25\">\n   iii. A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    iv. A strong desire to be of the other gender.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    v. A strong desire to be treated as the other gender.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    vi. A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    b. Second, the individual's condition must be associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Exh. 1001 at 3-4.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    3. \"Clinically significant distress\" means that the distress impairs or severely limits the person's ability to function in\n    a meaningful way and has reached a threshold that requires either medical or surgical interventions, or both. Tr. 51:3-8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    4. Not every person who identifies as transgender has gender dysphoria. Tr. 50:5-11.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <strong>\n     II.\n     <em>\n      WPATH\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    5. The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (\"WPATH\") Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People were first promulgated in 1979 and are the internationally recognized guidelines for the treatment of individuals with gender dysphoria. Tr. 42:6-20; Exh. 15. WPATH Standards of Care are \"flexible clinical guidelines.\" Tr. 118:16-24, 119:1-7, 8-25, 288:7-23, and \"are intended to be flexible in order to meet the diverse health care needs of transsexual, transgender, and gender nonconforming people.\" Exh. 15 at 8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    6. The WPATH Standards of Care have provided treatment guidelines for incarcerated individuals since 1998. Tr. 54:11-21; Exh. 15 at 73. The current WPATH Standards of Care apply equally to all individuals \"irrespective of their housing situation\" and explicitly state that health care for transgender people \"living in an institutional environment should mirror that which would be available to them if they were living in a non-institutional setting within the same community.\" Tr. 54:11-21; Exh. 15 at 73. The next update to the WPATH Standards of Care will also apply to an individual regardless of where that person is housed, including in a prison setting. Tr. 54:25-55:12.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    7. The WPATH Standards of Care indicate that options for psychological and medical treatment of gender dysphoria include:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    a. changes in gender expression and role,\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    b. hormone therapy to feminize or masculinize the body,\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    c. surgical changes of primary or secondary sex characteristics, and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    d. psychotherapy. Exh. 15 at 15-16.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    8. The WPATH Standards of Care suggest options for social support and changes in gender expression, including:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n    a. offline and online peer support resources, groups, or community organizations that provide avenues for social support and advocacy;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    b. offline and online support resources for families and friends;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    c. voice and communication therapy to help individuals develop verbal and non-verbal communication skills that facilitate comfort with their gender identity;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    d. hair removal through electrolysis, laser treatment, or waxing;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    e. breast binding or padding, genital tucking or penile prostheses, padding of hips or buttocks; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    f. changes in name and gender marker on identity documents. Exh. 15 at 16.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    9. The WPATH Standards of Care provide that the purposes of psychotherapy include \"exploring gender identity, role, and expression; addressing the negative impact of gender dysphoria and stigma on mental health; alleviating internalized transphobia; enhancing social and peer support; improving body image; or promoting resilience.\" Exh. 15 at 16.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    10. Cross-sex hormone therapy results in development of secondary sex characteristics of the other sex and provides\n    an increase in the overall level of well-being of a person with gender dysphoria. Tr. 60:8-22. For a transgender woman, hormone treatment has physical effects such as breast growth, thinning of facial hair, redistribution of fat and muscle, and shrinkage of the testicles. Tr. 246:7-20. The maximum physical effects of hormone therapy will typically be achieved within two to three years. Exh. 15 at 42; Tr. 60:23-61:5, 246:7-247:1.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    11. Surgery - particularly genital surgery - is often the last and the most considered step in the treatment process for gender dysphoria. Exh. 15 at 60.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    12. Many transgender individuals find comfort with their gender identity, role, and expression without surgery. Exh. 15 at 60. For many others, however, surgery is essential and medically necessary to alleviate their gender dysphoria. Exh. 15 at 60. For the latter group, relief from gender dysphoria cannot be achieved without modification of their primary or secondary sex characteristics to establish greater congruence with their gender identity. Exh. 15 at 60.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    13. For individuals with severe gender dysphoria, where hormone therapy is insufficient, gender confirmation surgery is the only effective treatment and is medically necessary. Tr. 168:23-169:15;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Ettner Decl. \u00b6 51.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    14. The WPATH criteria for genital reconstruction surgery in male-to-female patients include the following:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    a. Persistent, well documented gender dysphoria ;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    b. Capacity to make a fully informed decision and to consent for treatment;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n    c. Age of majority in a given country;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    d. If significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be well controlled;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    e. 12 continuous months of hormone therapy as appropriate to the patient's gender goals; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    f. 12 continuous months of living in a gender role that is congruent with their gender identity. Exh. 15 at 66.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    15. Regarding the first criterion, \"persistent, well documented gender dysphoria\" is deemed to exist when the person has a well-established diagnosis of gender dysphoria that has persisted beyond six months. Tr. 55:21-56:3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    16. Regarding the fourth criterion, the WPATH Standards of Care make clear that the presence of co-existing mental health concerns does not necessarily preclude possible changes in gender role or access to feminizing/masculinizing hormones or surgery. Exh. 15 at 31. But these concerns need to be optimally managed prior to, or concurrent with, treatment of gender dysphoria. Exh. 15 at 31.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    a. It is often difficult to determine whether coexisting mental health concerns are a result of gender dysphoria or are unrelated to that medical condition. Tr. 171:1-14, 24-25, 172:1-5; 387:20-25, 388:1, 398:2-18, 601:11-602:2; Campbell Decl., Dkt. 101-4, \u00b6\u00b6 30-33. Co-existing mental health issues directly tied to an individual's gender dysphoria should not be considered in assessing whether an individual meets the fourth WPATH criterion that significant medical or mental health concerns must be well controlled. Tr. 387:6 to 388:6.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    17. Regarding the sixth criterion - a twelve-month experience of living in an identity-congruent role - the WPATH Standards of Care provide that this is intended to ensure that the individual has had the opportunity to experience the full range of different life experiences and events that may occur throughout the year (e.g., family events, holidays, vacations, season-specific work or school experiences). During this time, patients should present consistently, on a day-to-day basis and across all settings of life, in their desired gender role. This includes coming out to partners, family, friends, and community members (e.g., at school, work, and in other settings). Exh. 15 at 67.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    18. An individual in prison can satisfy the criterion of living in a gender role congruent with their gender identity.

In June 2012, soon after being incarcerated, Ms. Edmo was diagnosed with gender identity disorder by Corizon psychiatrist Dr. Eliason. Exh. 1\n    at 321. In July 2012, Corizon psychologist Claudia Lake confirmed Ms. Edmo's diagnosis of gender identity disorder. Exh. 1 at 323-27. There is no dispute that Ms. Edmo suffers from gender dysphoria.

Ms. Edmo has consistently presented as feminine throughout her incarceration by wearing her hair in traditionally feminine hairstyles when able to do so, wearing makeup when able to do so, and acting in a feminine demeanor. Tr. 194:24-195:5, 411:1-7, 463:11-464:21.

Ms. Edmo testified that hormone therapy helped treat her gender dysphoria to some extent. Tr. 223:9-14. The hormones \"cleared her mind,\" and resulted in breast growth, body fat redistribution, and changes in her skin consistency. Tr. 196:15-25. As a result of hormone therapy, Ms. Edmo is hormonally confirmed, which means she has the same circulating sex hormones and secondary sex characteristics as a typical adult female. Tr. 72:14-21; Ettner Decl. \u00b6 59.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    41. Ms. Edmo has achieved the maximum physical changes associated with hormone treatment. Tr. 602:1-603:4. However, Ms. Edmo continues to experience distress related to gender incongruence, which is mostly focused on her male genitalia. She testified she feels \"depressed, embarrassed, and disgusted\" by her male genitalia and that this is an \"everyday reoccurring thought.\" Tr. 197:7-24.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    42. Ms. Edmo first attempted self-castration to remove her testicles in September 2015 using a disposable razor blade. She wrote a note to let the officers know she was not trying to commit suicide and was only trying to help herself. She attempted to cut her testicle sac open but was unsuccessful.

Ms. Stewart testified that none of the interventions she identified for Ms. Edmo at that visit would alleviate her gender dysphoria or desire to self-castrate. Stewart Dep. 58:15-59:16; Exh. 1 at 584-85.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    45. Ms. Edmo attempted self-castration a second time in December 2016. She prepared for weeks by studying the\n    anatomy of the scrotum and took steps to diminish the chance of infection by boiling the razor blade and scrubbing her hands with soap. Ms. Edmo made more surgical headway on this attempt and was able to cut open the testicle sac and remove the testicle. Gorton Decl. \u00b6 74. Because there was too much blood, Ms. Edmo abandoned her attempt and sought medical assistance. Tr. 198:9-16. She was transported to a hospital where her testicle was repaired. Tr. 198:25-199:13.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    46. Ms. Edmo was receiving hormone therapy both times she attempted to self-castrate. Tr. 228:20-25.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    47. After the procedure, Ms. Edmo felt disappointed in herself because she felt she had come so close to removing her testicle but had not succeeded. Tr. 199:17-23. Ms. Edmo continues to actively experience thoughts of self-castration. Tr. 197:21-24. In an effort to avoid acting on them, when she has experienced extreme episodes of gender dysphoria in the past year, Ms. Edmo \"self-medicat[es]\" by using a razor to cut her arm. The physical pain she feels from cutting helps her release the emotional torment and mental anguish she feels at the time. Tr. 199:24-200:15.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    48. Ms. Edmo will likely be released from prison sometime in 2021.

On April 20, 2016, Dr. Eliason evaluated Ms. Edmo for sex reassignment surgery. Jt. Exh. 1 at 538. Dr. Eliason noted that Ms. Edmo reported she was \"doing alright,\" that she was eligible for parole, but it had not been granted because of multiple Disciplinary Offense Reports (\"DORs\"). Jt. Exh. 1 at 538. The DORS were related to her use of makeup and feminine appearance. Jt. Exh. 1 at 538.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    50. Dr. Eliason noted that Ms. Edmo had been on hormone replacement for the last year and a half, but that she felt she needed more. Jt. Exh. 1 at 538. Dr. Eliason specifically noted that Ms. Edmo stated an improvement in gender dysphoria on hormone replacement but had ongoing frustrations stemming from her current anatomy. Jt. Exh. 1 at 538. He also recognized Ms. Edmo's multiple attempts to \"mutilate her genitalia\" because of the severity of her distress. Jt. Exh. 1 at 538. He also noted that he spoke to prison staff about Ms. Edmo's behavior, \"which is notable for animated affect and no observed distress.\" Jt. Exh. 1 at 538. Dr. Eliason then stated that he also personally observed Ms. Edmo in these settings and did not observe significant dysphoria. Jt. Exh. 1 at 538.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    51. Nevertheless, Dr. Eliason noted that Ms. Edmo appeared feminine in demeanor and interaction style. Jt. Exh. 1 at 538. He concluded that Ms. Edmo had Gender Dysphoria, Alcohol Use disorder, and Depression, Jt. Exh. 1 at 538, but his ultimate conclusion was that Ms. Edmo \"[d]oes not meet criteria for medical necessity for sex reassignment surgery.\" Jt. Exh. 1 at 538.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    52. In assessing Ms. Edmo's need for gender confirmation surgery, Dr. Eliason indicated that he staffed her case with Dr. Jeremy Stoddart, Dr. Murray Young, and Jeremy Clark LCPC (clinical supervisor and WPATH member). Each of these individuals agreed with his assessment. Jt. Exh. 1 at 538.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    53. Dr. Eliason indicated he would continue to monitor and assess Ms. Edmo for the medical necessity of gender confirmation surgery. Jt. Exh. 1 at 538. He further determined that the combination of hormonal treatment and supportive counseling is sufficient for Ms. Edmo's gender dysphoria for the time being.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    54. To justify his conclusion, Dr. Eliason noted that while medical necessity for gender confirmation surgery is not very well defined and is constantly shifting, the following situations could constitute medical necessity for the surgery:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n    a. Congenital malformations or ambiguous genitalia;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n    b. Severe and devastating dysphoria that is primarily due to genitals; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n    c. Some type of medical problem in which endogenous sexual hormones were causing severe physiological damage. Jt. Exh. 1 at 538.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    55. He also explained that there may also be other situations where gender confirmation surgery is medically necessary as more information becomes available. Jt. Exh. 1 at 538.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    56. Although not noted in his April 20, 2016 progress notes, Dr. Eliason testified that Ms. Edmo's mental health concerns were not \"fully in adequate control.\" Tr. 430:22-431:2. He testified that not all of Ms. Edmo's mental health issues, such as her major depression and alcohol use disorders, stemmed from her gender dysphoria. His testimony, however, is contradicted by his April 20, 2016 clinician notes. Tr. 451:1-12.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    57. Ms. Edmo has received mental health treatment from a psychiatrist and mental health nurse practitioner since she began her incarceration in 2012. Tr. 225:8-227:2. However, she has not consistently attended therapy to help her work through serious underlying mental health issues and a pre-incarceration history of trauma, abuse, and suicide attempts. Tr. 134:8-25, 135:1-23, 218:21-25, 219:1-14, 220:17-20; 221:16-19; Campbell Decl.

Dr. Eliason testified that there were two primary reasons why sex reassignment surgery was not medically necessary at the time:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n    a. Ms. Edmo had not satisfied the 12-month period of living in her identified gender role under WPATH standards. Tr. 430: 25-431:2; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n    b. \"[I]t was not doing Ms. Edmo any service to rush through getting gender reassignment surgery in that current social situation.\" Tr. 431:3-6.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    59. Dr. Eliason's evaluation was the only time IDOC and Corizon evaluated Ms. Edmo for gender confirmation surgery prior to this lawsuit. Exh. 1 at 538; Tr. 419:1-10.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    60. In concluding that surgery was not medically necessary for Ms. Edmo, Dr. Eliason did not review her prior criminal record, disciplinary history, or her presentence investigation reports. Tr. 468:4-18. The only information Dr. Eliason relied upon was Ms. Edmo's medical record, staff observations, and her therapist's notes. Tr. 469:16-25. Dr. Eliason testified that when he assessed her for surgery, he was aware of Ms. Edmo's prior self-surgery attempt. He believed Ms. Edmo's gender dysphoria had risen to another level, but he made no change to her treatment plan. Tr. 471:7-22.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    <strong>\n     VIII.\n     <em>\n      Ms. Edmo's Medical Necessity for Gender Confirmation Surgery\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    61. Plaintiff's and Defendants' experts disagree on whether Ms. Edmo meets all the WPATH standards criteria for gender confirmation surgery. Specifically, Defendants' experts believe that Ms. Edmo does not meet the fourth and sixth criteria - that any significant mental health concerns be well controlled and that she live twelve months in a fully gender-congruent role. Tr. 75:9-78:3; 252:13-254:11; 607:2-10, 639:14-640:25.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    62. Notably, however, Dr. Eliason did not rely upon any finding that Ms. Edmo did not meet the WPATH criteria in concluding in his April 2016 assessment that she did not meet the criteria for gender confirmation surgery. Tr. 462:3-463:10.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    63. With regard to the fourth criterion, Ms. Edmo has been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, and Gender Dysphoria.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Exh. 1 at 538. These diagnoses were generally confirmed by each of the experts, with observation that any substance use disorder has been in remission while Ms. Edmo has been incarcerated. Tr. 67:16-18, 253:3-9, 518:16-219:6, 603:22-604:5.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n    a. Plaintiff's experts testified that Ms. Edmo's depression and anxiety are as controlled as they can be and do not impair her ability to undergo surgery. Tr. 76:13-25, 123:14-124:11, 253:3-9; Exh. 15 at 30. In their view, the clinical significance of Ms. Edmo's self-surgery attempts and recent cutting of her arm is that she has severe genital-focused gender dysphoria and is not getting medically necessary treatment to alleviate it. Tr. 254:15-19, 98:11-22. Ms. Edmo's self-surgery attempts are not acts of mutilation or self-harm, but are instead attempts to remove her target organ that produces testosterone, which is the cure for gender dysphoria. Tr. 80:3-13. Ms. Edmo's gender dysphoria, not her depression and anxiety, is the driving force behind her self-surgery attempts. Tr. 254:20-255:8.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n    b. Thus, Ms. Edmo's self-surgery attempts and cutting do not indicate she has mental health concerns that are not well controlled. Tr. 98:11-22. Rather, Ms. Edmo's recent cutting is attention-reduction behavior that she uses to prevent herself from cutting her genitals. Tr. 98:16-22. Her self-surgery attempts indicate a need for treatment for gender dysphoria. Tr. 98:11-15.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n    c. In the more than six years she has spent in IDOC custody, no Corizon or IDOC provider has ever diagnosed Ms. Edmo with borderline personality disorder. Tr. 361:18-362:3, 470:4-6. Defense expert Dr. Andrade is the first person to ever diagnose Ms. Edmo with borderline personality disorder, and he was unable to identify his criteria for this diagnosis of Ms. Edmo during his testimony. Tr. 652:21-24, 638:16-22. None of the other experts, including Defense expert Dr. Garvey, diagnosed Ms. Edmo with borderline personality disorder. Tr. 131:24-132:3, 139:19-24.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n    d. One of the primary concerns underlying the fourth criterion is that the individual be able to properly participate in postsurgical care. Ms. Edmo has demonstrated the capacity to follow through with the postsurgical care she would require. Tr. 99:3-8, 169:23-170:25.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n    e. Although it is troubling that Ms. Edmo has declined to fully participate in the mental health treatment and counseling sessions recommended by Dr. Eliason and others, Dr. Ettner made clear that, \"Psychotherapy is neither a precondition for treatment or a condition -- a precondition for surgery.\" Tr. 98:23-99:2.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n    f. Dr. Ettner concludes that Ms. Edmo meets the fourth criterion, since she has no unresolved mental health issues that would prevent her from receiving gender confirmation surgery. Tr. 98:3-10.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    64. With respect to the sixth criterion, both Plaintiff's experts testified that Ms. Edmo meets and exceeds the condition of social role transition by living as a woman to the best of her ability in a male prison.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n    a. For the six-plus years she has lived in prison, Ms. Edmo has consistently sought to present as feminine, despite living in an environment hostile to her efforts, and despite the disciplinary consequences she faces. Tr. 77:9-78:3, 254:4-11.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    65. Dr. Ettner testified that gender confirmation surgery would eliminate Ms. Edmo's gender dysphoria and significantly attenuate much of the attendant depression and symptoms she is experiencing. Tr. 104:24-105:9. She testified that gender confirmation surgery is the cure for gender dysphoria and will therefore result in therapeutic and beneficial effects for Ms. Edmo. Tr. 81:13-19.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    66. Dr. Gorton testified that it is highly unlikely that Ms. Edmo's severe gender dysphoria will improve without gender confirmation surgery. Tr. 267:19-22.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    67. The risks of not providing gender confirmation surgery to Ms. Edmo include surgical self-treatment, emotional decompensation, and risk of suicide given her high degree of suicide ideation. Tr. 80:24:81:8, 264:13-22. If she is not provided with surgery, Ms. Edmo has indicated that she will try self-surgery again to deal with her extreme episodes of gender dysphoria. Tr. 199:24-200:5. Given that Ms. Edmo made increasing progress on her first two self-surgery attempts, it is likely that Ms. Edmo will be successful if she attempts self-surgery again. Tr. 264:13-22.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    68. Scientific studies indicate that the regret rate for individuals who have had gender confirmation surgery is very low and generally in the range of one percent of patients. Tr. 103:25-12, 165:16-166:4. Ms. Edmo does not have any of the risk factors that make her likely to regret undergoing gender confirmation surgery.

To make this showing, the plaintiff must establish: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a likelihood of irreparable harm to the moving party in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in favor of the moving party; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    3.

Defendants' experts appear to misrepresent the WPATH Standards of Care by concluding that Ms. Edmo, despite presenting as female since her incarceration in 2012, cannot satisfy the WPATH criteria because she has not presented as female outside of the prison setting.

Indeed, Plaintiff's experts opine that Ms. Edmo exceeds this criterion because she has not only presented as female for far longer than twelve months, but has done so in an environment arguably more hostile to these efforts than the non-custodial community, and despite the disciplinary consequences of doing so. The WPATH Standards of Care explicitly provide that they apply \"in their entirety ... to all transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people, irrespective of their housing situation,\" and \"including institutional environments such as prisons.\" Exh. 15 at 73. The Standards of Care make clear that \"[d]enial of needed changes in gender role or access to treatments, including sex reassignment surgery, on the basis of residence in an institution are not reasonable accommodations.\" Exh. 15 at 74.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    27. Defendants' evidence to the contrary is unconvincing and suggests a decided bias against approving gender confirmation surgery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    28. In 2016, Dr. Eliason contacted Dr. Steven Levine to lead a training for IDOC and Corizon providers on medical necessity for gender confirmation surgery. Tr. 433:23-434:24. Dr. Levine's training presentation was titled \"Medical Necessity of Transgender Inmates: In Search of Clarity When Paradox, Complexity, and Uncertainty Abound.\" Exh. 17 at 1. Dr. Levine trained Corizon and IDOC staff that gender confirmation surgery is \"not conceived as lifesaving as is repairing a potentially leaking aortic aneurysm but as life enhancing as is providing augmentation for women distressed about their small breasts.\" Exh. 17 at 43; Exh. 16.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    29. Dr. Levine is considered an outlier in the field of gender dysphoria and does not ascribe to the WPATH Standards of Care. Tr. 176:14-21. His\n    training materials do not reflect opinions that are generally accepted in the field of gender dysphoria. Tr. 176:22-179:1.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    30. Dr. Levine's training includes additional criteria proposed by Cynthia Osborne and Anne Lawrence that incarcerated individuals must meet in order to receive gender confirmation surgery. Exh. 17 at 39-41, 51; Exh. 19. These requirements are not part of the WPATH criteria and are in opposition to the WPATH Standards of Care. Tr. 101:15-22, 103:14-20. There are no scientific studies that support these additional requirements, and no professional associations or organizations have endorsed Osborne and Lawrence's proposed requirements for prisoners. Tr. 103:4-13. The NCCHC has not adopted Osborne and Lawrence's additional requirements. Tr. 480:12-16. Like Dr. Levine, Osborne and Lawrence are considered outliers in the field of gender dysphoria treatment, are not WPATH members, and do not ascribe to the WPATH Standards of Care. Tr. 101:2-14.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    31. A decision of the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California,\n    <em>\n     Norsworthy v. Beard\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306169\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/1164/\">\n     87 F.Supp.3d 1164\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (N.D. Cal. 2015), is noteworthy here. Dr. Levine was retained as a defense expert by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in a suit filed by a transgender plaintiff in that case. In ordering the prison to provide the plaintiff gender confirmation surgery, the\n    <em>\n     Norsworthy\n    </em>\n    court afforded Dr. Levine's opinions \"very little weight,\" stating: \"To the extent that Levine's apparent opinion that no inmate should ever receive SRS predetermined his conclusion with respect to Norsworthy, his conclusions are unhelpful in assessing whether she has established a serious medical need for SRS.\"\n    <em>\n     Norsworthy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306169\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/1164/\">\n     87 F.Supp.3d at 1188\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court also determined that Dr. Levine's opinion was not credible because of illogical inferences, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies,\" including misrepresentations of the WPATH Standards of Care, overwhelming \"generalizations about gender dysphoric prisoners\" and Dr. Levine's fabrication of a prisoner anecdote.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306169\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/1164/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    32. Under these circumstances, the Court gives virtually no weight to the opinions of Defendants' experts that Ms. Edmo does not meet the fourth and sixth WPATH criteria for gender confirmation surgery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Deliberate Indifference\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    33. Defendants misapplied the recognized standards of care for treating Ms. Edmo's gender dysphoria.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    34. Defendants insufficiently trained their staff with materials that discourage referrals for surgery and represent the opinions of a single person who rejects the WPATH Standards of Care.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    35. Defendants' sole evaluation of Ms. Edmo for surgery prior to this lawsuit failed to accurately apply the WPATH Standards of Care. Specifically, Dr. Eliason's assessment that Ms. Edmo did not meet medical necessity for surgery did not apply the WPATH criteria.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    36. Defendants have been deliberately indifferent to Ms. Edmo's medical needs by failing to provide her with available treatment that is generally accepted in the field as safe and effective, despite her actual harm and ongoing risk of future harm including\n    self-castration attempts, cutting, and suicidal ideation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    37. Evidence also suggests that Ms. Edmo has not been provided gender confirmation surgery because Corizon and IDOC have a\n    <em>\n     de facto\n    </em>\n    policy or practice of refusing this treatment for gender dysphoria to prisoners.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    38. In\n    <em>\n     Norsworthy\n    </em>\n    , the court found that the prison had a blanket policy barring surgery in light of evidence that the prison's \"guidelines for treating transgender inmates, which do not mention SRS as a treatment option, and the 2012 training provided to CDCR staff by Levine, which indicated that SRS should never be provided to incarcerated patients.\"\n    <em>\n     Norsworthy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306169\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/1164/\">\n     87 F.Supp.3d at 1191\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    39. Here, the only guidelines Corizon issued to assist its providers in treating gender dysphoria likewise do not include surgery as a treatment option. Moreover, Dr. Levine's training provided to Corizon and IDOC staff, and incorporated into further Corizon and IDOC training, discourages providing surgery to incarcerated persons with gender dysphoria.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    40. Significantly, no Corizon or IDOC provider has ever recommended that gender confirmation surgery is medically necessary for a patient in IDOC custody. In fact, Corizon has never provided this surgery at any of its facilities in the United States.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-203\">\n    41. As was the case in\n    <em>\n     Norsworthy\n    </em>\n    , \"[t]he weight of the evidence demonstrates that for [Ms. Edmo], the only adequate medical treatment for her gender dysphoria is [gender confirmation surgery], that the decision not to address her persistent symptoms was medically unacceptable under the circumstances, and that [Defendants] denied her the necessary treatment for reasons unrelated to her medical need.\"\n    <em>\n     Norsworthy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306169\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/1164/\">\n     87 F.Supp.3d at 1192\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    42. Accordingly, Ms. Edmo is likely to succeed on the merits of her Eighth Amendment claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Likelihood of Irreparable Harm\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    43. The Ninth Circuit has repeatedly held that serious psychological harm, in addition to physical harm and suffering, constitutes irreparable injury.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Chalk v.

Ms. Edmo's gender dysphoria results in clinically significant distress or impairment of functioning.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    45. Both Plaintiff's and Defendants' experts agree that Ms. Edmo is properly diagnosed with gender dysphoria and continues to experience serious distress from this condition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    46. Ms. Edmo has received hormone treatment and achieved the maximum feminizing effects years ago.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-210\">\n    47. Other district courts have recognized that the significant emotional pain, suffering, anxiety, and depression caused by prison officials' failure to provide adequate treatment for gender dysphoria constitute irreparable harm warranting a preliminary injunction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hicklin v.

The Court is persuaded by Plaintiff's experts that, without surgery, Ms. Edmo is at serious risk of life-threatening self-harm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    50. Thus, Ms. Edmo has satisfied the irreparable harm prong by showing that she will suffer serious psychological harm and will be at high risk of self-castration and suicide in the absence of gender confirmation surgery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-215\">\n    <strong>\n     C.

Wash. 2012).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    57. Accordingly, a mandatory preliminary injunction should issue because both the facts and the law clearly favor Ms. Edmo and extreme or very serious damage will result if it is not issued.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Marlyn Nutraceuticals\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870916\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/873/#p879\">\n     571 F.3d at 879\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    <strong>\n     III.\n     <em>\n      FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT AND ACA CLAIMS\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    58.

As explained above, to make this showing for preliminary injunction, the plaintiff must establish: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a likelihood of irreparable harm to the moving party in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in favor of the moving party; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.\n    <em>\n     Winter\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n     555 U.S. at 22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n     129 S.Ct. 365\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-227\">\n    60. While Ms. Edmo may ultimately prevail on her Fourteenth Amendment and Affordable Care Act claims, she is unable to show that she is entitled\n    to injunctive relief at this time. Given the Court's ruling on her Eighth Amendment claim, there is no likelihood of irreparable harm to Ms. Edmo in the absence of injunctive relief on these two claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-228\">\n    61. Moreover, the balance of equities tips in favor of Defendants because a more developed record on Defendants' treatment of transgender inmates is necessary before making a broader ruling based upon the Fourteenth Amendment or the Affordable Care Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    62. Likewise, a more developed record is necessary to assess the public's interest in granting such injunctive relief.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-230\">\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-231\">\n    <strong>\n     IT IS ORDERED:\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-232\">\n    1.

Defendants are ordered to provide Plaintiff with adequate medical care, including gender confirmation surgery. Defendants shall take all actions reasonably necessary to provide Ms. Edmo gender confirmation surgery as promptly as possible and no later than six months from the date of this order. However, given IDOC's implementation of an updated gender dysphoria policy on October 5, 2018 that appears to provide Plaintiff's requested injunctive relief related to accessing gender-appropriate underwear, clothing, and commissary items, the Court will not address that relief at this time. This is without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to raise the issue in the future, should IDOC revoke the new policy or if the implementation of the policy results in ongoing violations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-233\">\n    2. The Court's Deputy, Jamie Bracke, is directed to set a telephonic status conference in this case no later than two weeks after this decision issues.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-236\">\n     In discussions with counsel before the evidentiary hearing, the Court expressed the concern that the nature of the relief requested in this case, coupled with the extensive evidence presented by the parties over a 3-day evidentiary hearing, effectively converted these proceedings into a final trial on the merits of the plaintiff's request for permanent injunctive relief. Neither party addressed the Court's concern, and both parties appear to have treated the evidentiary hearing as a final trial of Ms. Edmo's claims.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-237\">\n     In an abundance of caution, the Court has considered the standard for the issuance of a permanent injunction, which would have required the plaintiff to show (1) she has suffered an irreparable injury, (2) monetary damages would not compensate her for that injury, (3) after balancing the hardships between the parties, a remedy of equity is warranted, and (4) the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\n     <em>\n      See,\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      eBay Inc. v.
