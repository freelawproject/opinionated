(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 5.) She also caught the attention-and provoked the ire-of J.

(\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At Hoover's direction, the FBI collected extensive information regarding Mrs. Roosevelt during the later years of her life (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6); in 2015, more than five decades after her death, plaintiff Christopher Brick submitted a request to the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , seeking disclosure of certain records from the FBI's Eleanor Roosevelt file (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The FBI released hundreds of pages of documents in response to Brick's FOIA request, but the agency redacted some of the responsive documents on the grounds that the information was exempted from disclosure under the FOIA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) At issue in the instant lawsuit is a subset of 12 pages of records that the FBI produced to Brick, with respect to which the agency invoked FOIA Exemptions 3 and 7(E), among other provisions, to withhold certain information. In his complaint, Brick maintains that the FBI has \"no legal basis for refusing to disclose these twelve pages in full.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before this Court at present are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Renewed Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Def.'s Renewed Mot.\"), ECF No. 26; Pl.'s Renewed Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Renewed Mot.\"), ECF No. 28.) The parties' arguments specifically pertain to the redactions in 12 pages of records \"that appear to provide information on Mrs. Roosevelt's travel to the Soviet Union and participation in events and activities where she was likely to encounter Soviet United Nations personnel[.]\" (Pl.'s Renewed Mot. at 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   DOJ argues that Exemptions 3 and 7(E) authorize the FBI to withhold the information at issue, and also that the agency has adequately justified those withholdings in the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   , classified declaration the agency submitted with its motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Renewed Mot. at 8-11.) Brick insists that DOJ's public filings provide no justification for the FBI's assertion of Exemption 3 or 7(E), and asserts that the FOIA requires DOJ to articulate publicly an explanation \"that is adequate to support the claimed exemptions without revealing the information that the exemptions are\n   designed to protect.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Renewed Mot. at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As discussed fully below, the Court has reviewed the relevant documents\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , and it finds that DOJ has established in its\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   filing that the FBI properly invoked Exemptions 3 and 7(E) to redact the information at issue in this case. This Court further finds that, under the circumstances of this case, it was appropriate for the government to explain the bases for its withholdings in a classified,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   declaration. As such, DOJ's renewed motion for summary judgment must be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Brick's renewed cross-motion must be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Christopher Brick is the Project Director and Editor for the Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project (\"Project\"), which describes itself as \"a research center that aims to make the vast record of Eleanor Roosevelt's written, spoken, and audio-visual legacy accessible to scholars, students, teachers, and the general public.\" (Decl. of Christopher Brick, ECF No. 14-1, \u00b6 2.) The Project accomplishes this mission by publishing Eleanor Roosevelt's papers, among other things, and it has published two volumes of her records to date. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As noted above, at the behest of its former director J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI maintained an extensive individual file on former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 5.) In 1982, the FBI released to the public many, but not all, of the records from this file. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ans., ECF No. 9, \u00b6 6.) Brick submitted a FOIA request to DOJ on June 25, 2015, seeking certain records from the FBI's file that had not been included in the 1982 release. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Stmt. of Material Facts as to Which There Is No Genuine Dispute, ECF No. 28 at 12-13, \u00b6 1.) In response to Brick's request, the FBI released 338 pages of redacted records, and invoked FOIA Exemptions 6, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E) to justify the withholdings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Brick appealed the redactions on 12 of these pages (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and on February 9, 2015, DOJ's Office of Information Policy affirmed the FBI's withholdings on the grounds that the agency had properly redacted information pursuant to Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(E) (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 3, 2015, Brick filed a four-page complaint in this Court, \"to challenge the decision of the Department of Justice ('DOJ') to redact certain records in Eleanor Roosevelt's Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') file[.]\" (Compl. \u00b6 1.) At issue in Brick's complaint are \"the withheld portions of ... twelve pages\" that, according to Brick, \"defendants have no legal basis for refusing to disclose[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 17, 2015, DOJ filed a motion for summary judgment that argued that the redactions in those 12 pages were proper under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(E). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. For Summ. J, ECF No. 12.) DOJ also filed a supporting declaration from FBI declarant David M. Hardy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of David M. Hardy, ECF No. 12-1.) Brick filed a cross-motion for summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 14), and in response, DOJ filed an additional declaration from Hardy further explaining its withholdings (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Second Decl. of David M. Hardy, ECF No. 18-2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 9, 2017, this Court found that Hardy's declarations were not \"sufficiently detailed to permit the Court to conduct a meaningful review\" of the FBI's assertion of the FOIA exemptions, and thus, denied both cross-motions without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Brick v. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523730\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/293/9/#p10\">\n    293 F.Supp.3d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10, 13 (D.D.C. 2017). DOJ filed a renewed motion for summary judgment, along with an unclassified declaration from Hardy, on February 1, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Renewed Mot.; Fourth Decl. of David. M. Hardy, ECF No. 26-1.) DOJ also lodged with the Classified Information Security Officer a classified declaration from Hardy, as well as unredacted copies of the 12 pages at issue in the instant case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Lodging Classified Decl. &amp; Unredacted Documents with the Classified Info. Sec. Officer, ECF No. 27; Classified Hardy Decl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its papers, DOJ explains that the FBI has reprocessed the 12 pages of records, and it subsequently released additional information to Brick after dropping its reliance on Exemptions 6 and 7(C). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts, ECF No. 26 at 2-3, \u00b6 7.) DOJ asserts that the FBI is entitled to summary judgment with respect to the remaining redactions, because the agency properly invoked FOIA Exemption 3-which permits an agency to withhold records that are \"specifically exempted from disclosure by [a] statute [that] ... establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) -and FOIA Exemption 7(E)-which permits an agency to withhold certain records \"compiled for law enforcement purposes[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(E). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Renewed Mot. at 9-11.) In particular, DOJ maintains that the FBI properly redacted information regarding United States intelligence sources and methods that is exempt from disclosure under Section 102A(i)(1) of the National Security Act of 1947,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), as well as information that was \"compiled for law enforcement purposes\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9) and that, if disclosed, would reveal \"FBI investigative techniques and procedures\" and \"risk circumvention of the law\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11). Finally, DOJ argues that it has released all non-exempt, reasonably segregable portions of records that are responsive to Brick's FOIA request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    at 11-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For his part, Brick has filed a renewed cross-motion for summary judgment, in which he maintains that DOJ's \"public filings offer no support for its claimed exemptions [and therefore] they cannot carry [Defendant's] burden of establishing that the records fall within the exemptions[.]\" (Pl.'s Renewed Mot. at 6.) Brick further contends that it is improper for the FBI to justify its invocation of Exemptions 3 and 7(E) only in sealed,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   filings; instead, according to Brick, the agency should have provided in its public papers a general description of the law enforcement and intelligence techniques at issue.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Renewed Mot. at 7-11.) Notably, the explanations for the agency's withholdings are contained in a classified declaration that the FBI has submitted to the Court\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ; from Brick's perspective, because the\n   <em>\n    public\n   </em>\n   declarations are insufficient to support the claimed exemptions, the agency has simply \"refus[ed] to provide support for its exemption claims.\" (Pl.'s Renewed Mot. at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864954,3555526\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/54/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The government's public filings offer not even the most general account of how the records would reveal intelligence sources and methods, provide no inkling of the basis for the assertion that the records were compiled for law enforcement purposes, and offer no explanation of how they would reveal investigative techniques and methods and create a risk of circumvention of the law.\").) As explained below, this Court finds that the government's reliance on an\n   <em>\n    ex parte,\n   </em>\n   classified declaration to justify its withholdings is permissible under the circumstances of this case; moreover, upon consideration of that declaration and all of the parties' filings in this case, the Court concludes that the material that the FBI has withheld falls within the protective scope of Exemptions 3 and 7(E), such that the agency is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Renewed Mot. at 4 (lamenting that \"[t]he government's failure to justify [publicly] its exemptions makes a mockery of FOIA, the adversary process, and this Court's order that it present [its] justifications\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (insisting that \"it is obviously not possible ... to demonstrate the legal or factual inadequacy of the agency's arguments: The agency has made none\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Nevertheless, the D.C.

Having reviewed the classified declaration and the unredacted materials at issue in the instant case, this Court concludes that such is the case here. In particular, the Court rejects Brick's vigorous contention that the FBI could have done more to explain itself on the public record-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that its public declaration could have provided\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   information \"describing the intelligence sources and methods or law enforcement techniques the records here would supposedly reveal,\" or\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   statement \"substantiating that the records relate to foreign intelligence or were compiled for law enforcement,\" or\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   explanation of \"how their disclosure would lead to circumvention of the law\" (Pl.'s Renewed Reply at 5)-\"without disclosing the information the government claims is protected\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In this regard, Brick insists that \"it is possible at least for [the FBI] to 'describe the general nature of the technique while withholding the full details' \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Boyd v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Renewed Mot. at 10 (asserting that \"the government's utilization of that method is already revealed by the very existence of the memoranda, regardless of the redactions\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ); Pl.'s Renewed Reply at 6-7 (arguing that Defendant has \"effectively conced[ed]\" the nature of the method at issue).) Brick further maintains that \"[n]othing the government has yet said publicly in the course of this litigation provides any basis for concluding that the documents provide any 'detailed ... description of ... Hoover-era methods,' let alone that disclosing them would reveal unknown intelligence or law enforcement methods, or risk damage to national security or circumvention of the laws.\" (Pl.'s Renewed Mot. at 10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Campbell v.

But the Court will say that it has given full consideration to Brick's contentions about the government's ability to provide more details regarding the general nature of the methods and techniques at issue and the underlying law enforcement purposes, as well as Brick's deductions about the nature of the redacted information, and the Court finds based on its\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the classified declaration and the unredacted records that the government's concerns about potentially harmful disclosure are justified.

Accordingly, and as set forth in the accompanying Order, Brick's motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and DOJ's motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The FBI is a component of the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\" or \"Defendant\"), the named defendant in this matter.
