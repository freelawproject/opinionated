Nonetheless, the Second Circuit has observed, in\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   , that while \"[o]n its face, \u00a7 1782 does not limit its discovery power to documents located in the United States ... there is reason to think that Congress intended to reach only evidence located within the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Application of Sarrio, S.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199924\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/143/#p147\">\n    119 F.3d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147 (2d Cir. 1997). In a later decision, the Second Circuit seemed to assume, without holding, that section 1782 could not reach documents stored abroad, by reasoning that if discovery of a law firm's documents which were subject to a confidentiality order were allowed, \"[i]n order to avoid potential disclosure issues under Section 1782, U.S. law firms with foreign clients may be forced to store documents and servers abroad, which would result in excessive costs to law firms and clients.\"\n   <em>\n    Kiobel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517604\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/238/#p243\">\n    895 F.3d at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Notwithstanding this\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   , this Court finds the reasoning of those courts that have found that section 1782 does have extraterritorial application to be more persuasive, and better aligned with the Supreme Court's precedent on extraterritoriality generally. In particular, this Court finds the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Sergeeva v.

In that decision, the Eleventh Circuit cited with approval the district court's finding that section 1782\"plainly says that discovery is to be produced pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure unless otherwise limited by court order,\" and that \"the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize extraterritorial document productions.\"\n   <em>\n    Sergeeva\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055854\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/1194/\">\n    834 F.3d at 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). This reasoning is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Nabisco\n   </em>\n   .

One type of document, which we will call Type 1 documents, are those that were generated at the time of White &amp; Case's representation of Yukos in the 1998-2004 time period and that have remained in White &amp; Case's continual custody since that time because of that representation. The other type of document, which we will call Type 2 documents, are those documents that came into White &amp; Case's possession because of their later representation of the Russian Federation in certain arbitration and other proceedings involving Yukos (though not the Dutch arbitration and litigation). This representation arose from the Russian Federation's actions against Yukos beginning in 2003, including the ensuing arbitrations. This latter representation appears to have begun in 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Meijer Decl. \u00b6 9. While petitioners contend that White &amp; Case has access to such documents (including documents supplied to Russia in 2007), White &amp; Case has affirmed that it has \"established a screen that prevents personnel working on [the current representation of the Russian Federation] from accessing information of its former clients relating to Yukos and its affiliates.\" Resp.

Petitioners state that they are seeking these documents from White &amp; Case, rather than from Russia, because Russia has historically refused to hand them over to petitioners, asserting that they are privileged because they are part of what petitioners believe to be a sham criminal investigation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Second Leijten Decl. \u00b6 54; Second Cotlick Decl. \u00b6 40; because petitioners believe Russia would continue to make this argument if petitioners again requested the documents in the Dutch Courts, and the Dutch Courts might accept the argument, Second Leijten Decl. \u00b6 55; and because, even if Russia were ordered to hand documents over by a Dutch court, Russia would likely disobey the order,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Petitioners suggest that under\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   the \"relevant inquiry\" should end upon determining that White &amp; Case itself is not a party to the Dutch Litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. Reply at 10-11. But this argument ignores the fact that the Type 2 documents were given to White &amp; Case by Russia after Russia became its client and are currently in White &amp; Case's hands because of the attorney-client relationship between Russia and White &amp; Case. Russia, of course, is a party to the Dutch Proceeding. Thus, as to these documents, the request is in essence an effort to obtain the documents from Russia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Certainly we recognize that the transfer of the documents by Russia to White &amp; Case in connection with its current representation does not by itself operate to make them privileged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet.

Specifically, they allege that in its November 28, 2017, \"Statement of Defence\" submitted to the Dutch Appellate Court, for \"the\n   <em>\n    first time\n   </em>\n   ... the Russian Federation accused\n   <em>\n    Petitioners\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    themselves\n   </em>\n   of using the Tempo Agreements to\n   <em>\n    bribe\n   </em>\n   Russian public officials ... in exchange for their alleged help in obtaining shares of Yukos during the privatization [of Yukos] (the \"Bribery Allegation\").\" Second Leijten Decl. \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In the November 28, 2017, Statement of Defence, Russia argued that between 1996 and 2003, \"YUL [Yukos Universal Limited], one of the appellants in these proceedings, played a pivotal role in making\" a series of payments from the \"Russian Oligarchs\" - a group of individuals that Russia claims control petitioners,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Final Arbitration Award at xv - to the \"Red Directors,\" which is Russia's term for a group public officials who were tasked with overseeing Yukos' privatization,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Statement of Defence (annexed as Ex. 4 to Leijten Decl.)

In particular, the Russian Federation alleged that \"[t]he Russian Oligarchs used YUL's bank accounts to pay at least USD 613.5 million to the Red Directors over the years 1996 until 2003.\" Statement of Defence \u00b6 535. These payments were allegedly made to compensate the Red Directors for their assistance in unlawfully rigging the auction of Yukos' shares in the mid-1990s to favor the Oligarchs; that is, \"sham\" contracts were allegedly used to facilitate payment from the Oligarchs to the Red Directors for assistance in helping the Oligarchs acquire their Yukos shares,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 517-38, which Russia alleges were ultimately transferred to petitioners,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6546. As petitioners explain, \"[t]wo of these supposed 'sham' contracts were entered into by GML (the parent company of petitioners Hulley and YUL), the aforementioned 'public officials,' and a company called Tempo Finance Limited in 2002.\" Pet. Mem. at 12. In addition, in its 2017 Statement of Defence, the Russian Federation argues that \"the Russian Oligarchs' own advisors thought the 'agreements'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   lacked any basic economic rationale.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 536. The documents cited by Russia in support of this contention show that the \"advisors\" include the law firms of Akin Gump, Cleary Gottlieb, and Clifford Chance, as well as the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Dmitry Gololobov, dated July 26, 2016 (annexed as Ex. 9 to Second Leijten Decl.)

There is no mention of White &amp; Case, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Before even considering the issue of delay, we repeat that White &amp; Case has affirmed that \"there are no client matters for or referencing Tempo Finance\" and that \"billing records do not reflect work performed with respect to Tempo Finance or with respect to any agreement involving Tempo Finance.\" Paradise Decl. \u00b6 11. That the Russian Federations' documents reference the opinions of other law firms regarding the Tempo Agreements, but not White &amp; Case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gololobov Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 48-49; First Pieth Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 75-79, corroborate this affirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In any case, a review of the Russian Federation's arbitration and district court submissions show that the \"Bribery Allegation\" is not new. It is undisputed that the Russian Federation raised the issue of petitioners' \"unclean hands\" throughout the arbitration process, as early as 2005.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Arbitration Award \u00b6\u00b6 1273-90 (describing Russia's \"unclean hands\" allegations and noting that the Tribunal first addressed them in an interim decision in 2006); Meijer Decl. \u00b6 12(I) (stating that Russia's initial pleading submitted on October 15, 2005, expressly raised the \"unclean hands\" defense). The Russian Federation first raised the issue of \"sham contracts\" in 2011 in its \"Counter-Memorial\" submitted to the Dutch Tribunal. Meijer Decl. \u00b6 12(iii)(b). In this submission Russia cited the Tempo Agreements as \"highly damning proof that Menatep [GML] had conspired with pre-existing Yukos management to facilitate the unlawful acquisition of Yukos by the Oligarchs.\" Russian Federation Counter Memorial (annexed as Ex. RSM-9 to Meijer Decl.) (\"Counter-Memorial\"), \u00b6 36. The Counter-Memorial noted that the agreement was between \"Yukos Universal\" and the individuals the Russian Federation later termed the \"Red Directors,\" though the Counter-Memorial refers to them by their names.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Meijer Decl. \u00b6 12(iii)(b) (listing the names of the \"Red Directors\"). The Counter-Memorial alleged that in 2002, Yukos' auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers became suspicious of the agreement, \"suspecting that it was a 'kickback' that had been previously promised to [the 'Red Directors'] for helping Menatep acquire Yukos\" during the mid-1990s privatization auction. Counter-Memorial \u00b6 36. In 2014, the Arbitral Tribunal took note of this allegation, including it in a list of alleged \"illegal and bad faith conduct\" that the Russian Federation alleged against petitioners under the heading of \"Claimant's Alleged Unclean Hands.\" Final Arbitration Award, \u00b6 1283(v). The Russian Federation then re-iterated this allegation in its 2015 \"Statement of Reply\" filed in the Dutch District Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Statement of Reply, In the Matter of the Russian Federation versus Veteran Petroleum Limited et al., dated Sept. 16, 2015 (annexed as Ex. 1 to Second Paradise Decl.), \u00b6 28(a)(v) &amp; n.8. Accordingly, all of the key elements of the \"Bribery Allegation,\" including the use of Yukos Universal Limited to make payments, were made as early as 2001 and in any case years\n   before the filing of the 2017 Statement of Defence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Petitioners make several arguments in support of their contention that the \"Bribery Allegation\" was newly raised on appeal. They argue that the Bribery Allegation \"is made in connection with an\n   <em>\n    entirely\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ground\n   </em>\n   for setting aside the Arbitral Awards\": namely, the argument that upholding the arbitral awards would violate Dutch public policy. Second Leijten Decl. \u00b6 5. Petitioners point to an \"Interim Judgment,\" issued on December 18, 2018, in which the Dutch Appellate Court noted that \"[i]t is not in dispute that in the defence on appeal the Russian Federation put forward the unclean hands argument for the first time in support of its reliance on Article 1065(1)(3)(e) DCCP (public policy).\" Judgment, the Hague Court of Appeal, dated Dec. 18, 2018 (annexed as Ex. A to Pet. Not. Supp. Authority), \u00b6 2.6. The Dutch Appellate Court noted that this argument was not addressed in the Russian Federation's statement of appeal, and that \"the Russian Federation submitted a large number of exhibits and brought and argued its case considerably more broadly than in the first instance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Dutch Appellate Court ruled that petitioners shall have \"the opportunity to respond by deed\" to the passages of the Russian Federation's appeal that relate to the unclean hands argument, and \"within the framework of that response, to present exhibits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Respondents note - and we agree - that this decision conveys only that the unclean hands argument was first invoked in support of the \"public policy\" defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Holwell Letter. It says nothing about whether the unclean hands argument was offered in support of other defenses. As just discussed, the unclean hands argument, including what is now characterized as the \"Bribery Allegation,\" was made during the arbitral proceedings in 2011 and was raised again before the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Petitioners argue that the \"Bribery Allegation\" is supported by newly-submitted evidence, consisting of two new witness statements and three new expert reports from two experts. Second Leijten Decl. \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Leijtan Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. In particular, petitioners point out that some of these witness statements suggest that in 2002 and 2003, Yukos' external advisors were suspicious of or objected to the Tempo Agreements and the manner in which Yukos had been privatized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Leijten Decl. \u00b6 7 (referring to Gololobov Decl. \u00b6 48); Leijten Decl. \u00b6 24 (citing First Pieth Decl.), \u00b6\u00b6 75-79). We do not find this point persuasive, however, because these newly submitted statements and declarations do not mention White &amp; Case among the objecting external advisors, and so their recent submission does not give justification for seeking discovery from White &amp; Case at this stage in the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Petitioners next argue that during the arbitrations, the Russian Federation never made a \"Bribery Allegation\" against petitioners, but rather made bribery allegations against third parties, and took issue only with petitioners' conduct after they acquired their Yukos shares. Second Leijten Decl. \u00b6 12. As already discussed, however, the Russian Federation argued in 2011 that petitioner Yukos Universal Limited was used by the \"Oligarchs\" to pay a \"kickback\" or \"bribe\" to the \"Red Directors\" in 2002. Counter-Memorial \u00b6 36. The newly-submitted Statement of Defence does not articulate a more active role for petitioners. In addition, while petitioners maintain that the \"Russian Oligarchs,\" as well as officials at Bank Menatep are separate and distinct from themselves - a view the Tribunal indeed agreed with,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Final Arbitration Award \u00b6 1370 - what matters, as was made clear in the 2014 arbitration decision, is that the Russian Federation had alleged that wrongful conduct by the \"Oligarchs\" should be attributed to petitioners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Final Arbitration Award \u00b6 1281 (listing the Russian Federation's allegations of \"28 instances of 'illegal and bad faith conduct' by Claimants or '\n   <em>\n    attributable\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   ' Claimants involving a variety of actors and spanning over ten years\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, while petitioners acknowledge that the Tempo Agreements were \"mentioned during the arbitrations,\" they contend that \"they were not the basis for ... any allegation that Petitioners paid bribes in connection with obtaining their investments in Yukos,\" but were \"[i]nstead ... raised as a collateral issue in the course of the parties' dispute over whether Yukos was guilty of 'tax evasion.' \" Second Leijten Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. However, the Tribunal's Final Arbitration Award in 2014 makes clear that allegations of impropriety related to the Tempo Agreements were \"related to the acquisition of Yukos by Bank Menatep; and the so-called 'Oligarchs' and their subsequent consolidation and control and ownership over Yukos and its subsidiaries.\" Final Arbitration Award \u00b6 1283.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Accordingly, it is clear that the \"new\" Bribery Allegation is essentially the same allegation regarding the use of Yukos Universal Limited to pay a \"kickback\" that the Russian Federation first brought in 2011, as was verified by the 2014 arbitration decision. Yet no action was taken to obtain evidence from White &amp; Case until 2017. While delay is not specifically listed as an\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   factor, the Second Circuit has made clear that a request for assistance under section 1782 that is \"inexcusably untimely\" would not provide an \"efficient means of assistance to the foreign proceedings,\" which is one of the twin aims of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Nascimento v.

The longer the delay in seeking documents,\n   the greater burden is imposed on parties expected to respond to the document requests, who now must attempt to reconstruct events from the distant past - in this case, more than 16 years ago.

But there are other considerations here, which partially come under the rubric of the fourth\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   factor, that more strongly counsel against granting the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The documents sought are documents that arose from White and Case's representation of Yukos and related entities. As\n   <em>\n    Kiobel\n   </em>\n   notes, \"[a] law firm's representation of a foreign client is a factor worth considering\" as a discretionary factor.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517604\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/238/#p243\">\n    895 F.3d at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties appear to agree that any privilege applicable to the Type 1 documents arises under Russian law. Indeed, the parties have each submitted affidavits of experts on Russian law on the question of whether Russian law permits White &amp; Case to disclose the materials sought by the subpoena. White &amp; Case's expert maintains that the materials generated as a result of White &amp; Case's representation are protected by two separate doctrines - essentially, a representative-client privilege and a contractual obligation to maintain secrecy. Schwarts Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-12, 19-21. Petitioners' expert vehemently disagrees with the conclusion of White &amp; Case's expert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rachkov Decl.; Second Rachkov Decl. We have read these expert declarations carefully. Both experts have excellent credentials and each side makes cogent arguments in favor of its interpretation of Russian law. Neither side cites a rule or case that accounts for all the factual circumstances present here. The treatment of the documents sought by the subpoena appears to be an unsettled question under Russian law. Notably, even under the view of petitioners' own expert, documents may potentially be disclosed only by means of an order that complies with Russian law, including certain procedural requirements such as a \"closed hearing.\" Second Rachkov Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-28. Additionally, it is not clear what substantive standards would govern the issuance of a disclosure order that complies with Russian law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In our view, this lack of clarity favors denying the section 1782 application. We\n   believe it to be \"unduly intrusive or burdensome,\" to quote the fourth\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   factor, to require an American law firm with an office in a foreign country to potentially be directed to act in contravention of that foreign country's law. Additionally, in light of the lack of clarity in Russian law, we are trouble by the prospect of issuing an order that potentially results in treating an American law firm with a presence in a foreign country differently from how a law firm in that country with no American office would have been treated by a Russian court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Petitioners argue that any lack of clarity as to Russian law must be viewed as supporting their application, asserting that the Second Circuit requires \"authoritative proof\" of foreign privilege to justify denial of a section 1782 application.

Here, we have not been provided authoritative proof that the Dutch Appellate Court would reject the evidence sought by the petition and thus this doctrine does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   A second consideration operates here. If American courts entertain applications to obtain client documents and attorney depositions from American law firms with foreign offices, it will discourage foreign clients from engaging the foreign office of an American law firm for fear that American courts would order production of documents and depositions of attorneys that not might not be ordered by the country where the client is located. This would have a chilling effect on the ability of American law firms with foreign offices to provide representation to foreign clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Examining the \"twin aims\" of section 1782 - that is, \"providing efficient means of assistance to participants in international litigation and encouraging foreign countries by example to provide similar assistance to our courts,\"\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p247\">\n    542 U.S. at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p247\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - we find that granting the instant application would do little to further these purposes. To consider this question, we posit an applicant seeking to obtain documents that arose from a representation by the American law office of a Russian law firm. The representation at issue by the American law office is of an American client and is governed by American law, about which American lawyers disagree. The documents are alleged to have been generated for the American office and to be located largely in America. It could not reasonably be viewed as \"efficient\" for a Russian court to entertain a proceeding in Russia in which the applicant seeks to have a Russian court apply American law to determine whether the documents must be produced. We would also not view a Russian court declining to entertain such an application as inappropriately denying assistance. We thus do not believe that a denial of the instant application would discourage other countries in the future from supplying appropriate assistance to courts in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   We note that the instant application is an unusual one because most section 1782 applications seek documents that are exclusively subject to United States legal doctrines. Here, by contrast, the documents originated pursuant to a representation in Russia and the parties do not dispute that Russian law governs their disclosure. Given the uncertainty as to how Russian law would treat the documents at issue and whether White &amp; Case's disclosure of the documents would comply with Russian law, and given the\n   policy considerations just discussed, we do not believe this case warrants an exercise of discretion to require White &amp; Case to produce even the Type 1 documents or witnesses for depositions as to the representation that generated those documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Petitioners argue that it would be \"perverse\" to allow White &amp; Case to invoke any privilege over the documents because such an invocation would help the very entity that destroyed Yukos to \"escape from the justice sought by Yukos' former majority shareholders.\" Pet. Mem. at 22. This argument might have some force if petitioners made it in a proceeding to which Russia was a party. Russia is not a party to this proceeding, however, and White &amp; Case is not responsible for its conduct. In this case, it is White &amp; Case, not Russia, that is being put into the position of potentially not complying with Russian law. Notably, petitioners make no argument that Russian law regarding the disclosure of documents would take into consideration the purpose for which the documents would ultimately be used. Thus, we do not see why the ultimate use to which the disclosures would be used, and the benefits that would inure to particular parties from non-disclosure, are relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   For the above reasons, we conclude that, in combination with the other factors and considerations we have mentioned, we will deny the petitioners' application not only as to the Type 2 documents and depositions but as to all documents and depositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   VII.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For the reasons stated above, petitioners motion pursuant to section 1782 (Docket # 7) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    <em>\n     Ex\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Parte\n    </em>\n    Application by Hulley Enterprises, Ltd., Yukos Universal Ltd., and Veteran Petroleum Ltd. for an Order Pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201782\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782\n    </extracted-citation>\n    to Conduct Discovery for Use in a Foreign Proceeding and Statement in Support Thereof, filed Sept. 17, 2018 (Docket # 1) (\"\n    <em>\n     Ex\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Parte\n    </em>\n    Application\"); Memorandum of Law in Support of\n    <em>\n     Ex\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Parte\n    </em>\n    Application by Hulley Enterprises, Ltd., Yukos Universal Ltd., and Veteran Petroleum Ltd. for an Order Pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201782\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782\n    </extracted-citation>\n    to Conduct Discovery for Use in a Foreign Proceeding, filed Sept. 17, 2018 (Docket # 2) (\"Pet.
