(both defendants hereinafter \"Merck\") and McKesson Corp. for personal injuries arising from their inoculation with Merck's drug Zostavax for the prevention of shingles. Both actions, in which plaintiffs are represented by the same attorney, were originally filed in the Circuit Court of the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit for Hillsborough County, Florida and timely removed based on diversity of citizenship to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. Merck has now moved to dismiss these actions under Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of personal jurisdiction. McKesson has not filed such a motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to Stanton's First Amended Complaint, she was at all times relevant a resident of The Villages, Florida. In or about July 2012, she was inoculated with the Zostavax vaccine at Island Health Care in Edgartown, Massachusetts. Some four years later, on or about July 5, 2016, she was diagnosed with shingles by her physician in her hometown in Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As set forth in her amended complaint, Morris was at all times relevant a resident of Marathon, Florida. In or about July 2011, she was inoculated with the Zostavax vaccine by Valerie Linzey, N.P.C. in Norwalk, Connecticut for routine adult health maintenance and for the long-term prevention of adult shingles. In or about July 2011, Linzey diagnosed Morris with shingles in Connecticut. Plaintiffs further allege in their amended complaints that the defendants continuously have sold and distributed Zostavax in Florida during all relevant times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The attorney for Stanton and Morris has also filed a declaration in which she states that Stanton \"at all relevant times to this action\" was a resident of the Villages, Florida.\" The declarant further affirms \"Ms. Stanton suffered her injuries in which damages are claimed in Florida.\" The statement about Stanton's residence is not contested. However, we will not consider the statement of her attorney about the place where Stanton suffered injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Merck correctly challenges this statement as inadmissible hearsay.\n   <em>\n    United Technologies Corp. v.

It reiterates her amended complaint that at all times relevant Morris has resided in Marathon, Florida. It further states that Morris has advised the law firm that \"she spends her time in Connecticut during the 'summer' and otherwise resides at her home in Florida.\" According to the declaration, Morris confirmed to the law firm that \"she received Zostavax in Connecticut and was first diagnosed with shingles in Connecticut as alleged in the complaint.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Merck &amp; Co., Inc. and Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp. are incorporated in and have their principal places of business in New Jersey. McKesson Corp., a marketer and distributor of Zostavax, is incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in California. In support of the motions to dismiss, Merck has filed two declarations. Merck does not own or lease any property in Florida. It does own and lease property in New Jersey and Pennsylvania where it employs over 14,000 people. The research and development of Zostavax occurred in Pennsylvania, while decisions concerning warnings accompanying Zostavax as well as clinical study strategy, labeling, marketing, sales strategies, and regulatory approvals took place in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Zostavax is currently manufactured in Pennsylvania and shipped for use from Merck's facility in North Carolina. Merck has never manufactured Zostavax in Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When a defendant contests the court's personal jurisdiction over it, the burden rests with the plaintiff to establish personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    D'Jamoos v.

For present purposes, Merck does not dispute any jurisdictional facts asserted by the plaintiffs through their attorney's declaration or otherwise except for the part of the attorney's declaration noted above which states that Stanton's place of injury was Florida. The court will disregard this hearsay. For their part, plaintiffs do not challenge Merck's declarations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To establish that a court may exercise personal jurisdiction, the plaintiffs must overcome two hurdles.

The term \"arising from\" means that the place of injury be within Florida.\n   <em>\n    Hinkle v.

The statute also allows a court to exercise personal jurisdiction under \u00a7 48.193(1) (a) (6) (a) and (b) where actions or acts committed outside the state directly cause injury within the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Horizon Aggressive Growth LP v.

Giarmarco &amp; Bill, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7626199\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/74/253/\">\n    74 F.3d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 1996) in support of their argument that personal jurisdiction exists under the Florida long-arm statute. In that case, defendants resided and were licensed to practice law in Michigan. They provided estate planning services to an individual when he resided in Michigan and continued to do so after he moved to Florida. After his death, his estate sued defendants in Florida for negligence and breach of contract as a result of what it deemed to be an excessive estate tax liability. The Court of Appeals upheld personal jurisdiction since the negligence of defendants caused damage to the estate in Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   does not help plaintiffs. In contrast to\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   where the defendants' out-of-state acts caused direct harm in Florida, the out-of-state acts of Merck caused injury to plaintiffs out-of-state and not in Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Hinkle\n   </em>\n   , on the other hand, directly supports Merck's position that personal jurisdiction over it is lacking under the Florida long-arm statute. In\n   <em>\n    Hinkle\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs had sustained personal injuries when a small aircraft in which they were flying crashed in South Carolina after having departed from an airport in Florida. The pilot, Robert Hinkle, had purchased the aircraft from a Minnesota corporation through a Virginia salesperson and had it delivered in Minnesota. While Hinkle had ordered the aircraft, it was delivered to a company he owned. The lawsuit, based on diversity of citizenship, was filed by Hinkle and others, all residents of Florida, against a number of defendants in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. None of the defendants was a citizen of Florida, and none conducted sufficiently substantial business there. The court held that personal jurisdiction did not exist under the Florida long-arm statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Here the plaintiffs, Florida residents, state in their amended complaints that the tortious acts, that is the injections of the faulty Zostavax vaccine, occurred in Massachusetts and Connecticut respectively. As noted above, plaintiffs do not rely on\n   Merck's general business activity in Florida. Consequently, as in\n   <em>\n    Hinkle\n   </em>\n   , the Florida long-arm statute does not provide a basis for the court to exercise personal jurisdiction over the claims of the plaintiffs since Merck did not cause any injury to them in Florida, either from without or from within the state. The circumstances here and in\n   <em>\n    Hinkle\n   </em>\n   are materially different from those in the cases upholding personal jurisdiction over a defendant where defendant's telephonic or written communications from out of state directly caused harm within the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7626199\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/74/253/\">\n    74 F.3d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wendt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11458839\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/822/1252/\">\n    822 So.2d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Even if the requirements of the Florida long-arm statute were met, plaintiffs must overcome a second hurdle. They must establish that personal jurisdiction is proper under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

That decision involved motions before the MDL panel to reconsider an order that conditionally remanded certain actions to their respective transferor courts. The motions for reconsideration, by agreement of the parties, sought to have the MDL panel transfer the cases to other courts where the venue was purportedly proper. The MDL panel held that under \u00a7 1407 it must remand to the transferor courts and that it has no ability under \u00a7 1407 to redirect the remand to other courts. Instead, it would be up to the transferor courts on remand to decide the issue of transfer. While\n   <em>\n    Biomet\n   </em>\n   deals with the power of the MDL panel, its analysis logically precludes transferee courts from transferring cases to other districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Even if this court has the power to transfer an action under \u00a7 1631, neither plaintiff identifies or suggests a proper forum where her action could or should be transferred \"in the interest of justice.\" The court has determined that personal jurisdiction is lacking as to only two of the three defendants. McKesson has not filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2). Moreover, the Merck defendants have a different home state than McKesson so that there does not appear to be any one forum where general jurisdiction could be exercised over all defendants. As to specific jurisdiction, there is nothing in the record pointing to any ties between causation of plaintiffs' injuries in Massachusetts and Connecticut and any activity of McKesson in those states. In sum, the court is not able to determine, without a suggestion of the plaintiffs and the presentation of the appropriate jurisdictional facts, in what district or districts, if any, either of these actions could have been brought at the time they were filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Accordingly, these actions insofar as they are against Merck will be dismissed without prejudice for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    PRETRIAL ORDER NO. 53\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   AND NOW, this 7th day of January, 2019, for the reasons set forth in the foregoing memorandum, it is hereby ORDERED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (1) The motions of defendants Merck &amp; Co.
