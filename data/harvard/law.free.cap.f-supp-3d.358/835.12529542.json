In the six years since this accident, Decker has tried, unsuccessfully, to recover insurance money from the insurer of his trailer, Great West Casualty Company. Throughout this time, Great West has steadfastly maintained that Decker is not entitled to insurance benefits under the plain language of his policy. The dueling summary judgment motions at issue here, which cover a variety of claims and counterclaims, are the culmination of this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After carefully reviewing the record and applicable case law, the Court grants Great West's summary judgment motion in full, and dismisses Decker's counterclaim with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff and Counterclaim Defendant Great West Casualty Company (hereinafter \"Great West\") is an insurance company with its principal place of business in Nebraska. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [Doc. No. 1] \u00b6 1; An. [Doc. No. 5] \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant and Counterclaim Plaintiff Ruben Decker (hereinafter \"Decker\") lives in Tea, South Dakota and was, at the time of the accident giving rise to this litigation, a commercial truck driver for KW Trucking, a Minnesota company. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 2; An. \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Finally, Michael Selle (hereinafter \"Selle\") lives in Fortuna, North Dakota and, at the time of the accident, ran a small loading center out of his family farm\n   for hay being shipped from Canada to the United States. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. C [Doc. No. 115-1] (\"Selle Deposition\").) In short, Selle would unload hay from Canadian trucks, and then re-load said hay onto American trucks for further distribution. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 58.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Selle is not a named party, he figures prominently in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Insurance Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2012, the KW Trucking fleet (and, by extension, Decker and his vehicle) was insured by a Great West commercial auto coverage policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 1 [Doc. No. 107-1] (\"Policy\").) Most importantly, the Policy provided no-fault (or \"personal injury protection\") coverage up to $40,000 and liability coverage up to $1,000,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   With respect to no-fault coverage, Great West agreed to pay, \"in accordance with the Minnesota No-Fault Act,\" certain medical and work-loss benefits \"incurred with respect to 'bodily injury' sustained by an 'insured' caused by an 'accident' arising out of the maintenance or use of a 'motor vehicle' as a vehicle.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Personal Injury Protection \u00a7 A.) However, in accordance with Minnesota law, Great West specifically excluded coverage for any injuries \"aris[ing] out of conduct in the course of loading or unloading any 'motor vehicle' unless the conduct occur[ed] while such person [was] 'occupying' such motor vehicle.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 C.7;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 65B.43, subd. 3(2).) \"Occupying,\" in this case, meant \"in or upon, entering into, or alighting from.\" (Policy Personal Injury Protection \u00a7 F.4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With respect to liability coverage, Great West agreed to pay \"all sums an 'insured' legally must pay because of 'bodily injury' ... caused by an 'accident' or resulting from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a covered 'auto.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Liability Coverage \u00a7 II.A.) The Policy further stated that Great West had a \"right and duty to defend any 'insured' against a 'suit' asking for such damages.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As relevant here, an \"insured\" included \"anyone else while using with your permission a covered 'auto' you own, hire, or borrow\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   ,\" in the context of \"moving property to or from a covered 'auto,' \" \"\n   <em>\n    anyone other than\n   </em>\n   your 'employees,' partners, members, a lessee or borrower of a covered 'auto' or any of their employees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 II.A.1.b(4).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The December 21, 2012 Accident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 21, 2012, Decker drove his semi-truck (and attached flatbed trailer) to Selle's farm in Fortuna, North Dakota. (See Def.'s Ex. B at 34 [Doc. No. 115-1] (\"Decker Deposition\").) Decker intended to pick up a load of hay and then deliver it to Rock Valley, Iowa. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. H [Doc. No. 115-4] (\"Spot Contract\").) When Decker arrived at Selle's farm, he parked and exited his vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decker Dep. at 117-18.) Selle then began to load 1,800-pound bales of hay onto Decker's trailer with his tractor, while Decker stood and watched. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 3 at 78 [Doc. No. 107-1] (\"Selle Deposition II\"); Decker Dep. at 142.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, after Selle loaded a stack of hay bales onto Decker's trailer, Decker would secure the load by throwing a strap over the top of the bales. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 65-68.) Because of a device called a \"cheater bar,\" Decker could perform this task without stepping onto the trailer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65-66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The day took a tragic turn, when, for unclear reasons, at least two hay bales fell off Decker's trailer (from a height of eight to ten feet) and onto Decker, while Decker was preparing to secure a load. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 72, 143.) According to Decker, at the time of the accident, he was \"bending underneath the trailer,\" and \"reaching [down] to hook the strap to the trailer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 4 (\"Dec. 27, 2012 Internal Great West Notes\") (stating that, in Decker's initial conversation with the Great West adjuster, he told the adjuster that, at the time of the accident, he was \"ready to throw another strap\" over the hay bales, and \"had his back to the trailer\").) However, by Decker's own admission, his hand's contact with the underside of the trailer constituted his \"only physical contact\" with his vehicle during the entire loading process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Selle Dep. II at 89 (affirming that Decker was \"out of his truck\" \"the entire time\" Selle was loading Decker's trailer).) Decker suffered serious injuries to his ribs and femur as a result of this accident, and had to be airlifted to a hospital in Minot, North Dakota, where he was held for three days. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 4 [Doc. No. 107-1] (\"Dec. 27, 2012 Claim Notes\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 28 at 4 [Doc. No. 107-3] (\"Def.'s Answers to Interrogatories\") (asserting that Decker has incurred at least $65,000 in medical expenses).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Importantly, however, neither Selle's tractor nor premises were insured in December 2012. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Selle Dep. II at 108, 162.) In fact, about one month before the accident, Selle had cancelled the \"general liability insurance and insurance that covered [his] equipment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 162.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Subsequent Dispute Over Insurance Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Decker contacted Great West about possible no-fault insurance coverage. However, on January 2, 2013, Great West advised Decker by letter that it would not provide no-fault benefits because Decker's \"injuries did not arise out of an accident that occurred while he was occupying his motor vehicle,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Decker was \"standing on the ground\" when the hay bales hit him. (Pl.'s Ex. 5 [Doc. No. 107-1] (\"Jan. 2, 2013 Denial Letter\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 838 (describing the \"loading and unloading\" exception to no-fault coverage).) Several months later, on September 20, 2013, Decker's counsel, Brent Schafer, advised Great West that, denial letter notwithstanding, Decker would be pursuing the $1 million liability policy limit (presumably on the theory that KW Trucking, a named insured on the Policy, was negligent), along with \"other coverage.\" (Pl.'s Ex. 8 [Doc. No. 107-2] (\"Sept. 20, 2013 Schafer Letter\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A few months later, Schafer advised Great West that Decker would not pursue a negligence claim against KW Trucking under the Policy's liability provision because \"further investigation\" revealed \"no identifiable acts of negligence on behalf of KW Trucking.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 10 [Doc. No. 107-2] (\"Nov. 27, 2013 Schafer Letter\").) Instead, Decker, through Schafer, re-asserted his no-fault claim, on grounds that Decker was, in fact, \"occupying\" his trailer at the time of the accident (because he was \"in contact with the vehicle when the hay bale fell\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 11 [Doc. No. 107-2] (\"Feb. 27, 2014 Schafer Letter\").) Decker also informed Great West that he would bring suit if Great West did not promptly pay this claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, on March 25, 2014, Great West again denied Decker's claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 14 [Doc. No. 107-2] (\"Mar. 25, 2014 Denial Letter\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The North Dakota Litigation and Further Developments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Almost a year later, on February 27, 2015, Decker added Great West as a defendant\n   to his ongoing lawsuit against Selle in North Dakota state court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 16 [Doc. No. 107-2] (\"Decker First Am. North Dakota Compl.\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For unclear reasons, in this complaint Decker only sought uninsured motorist benefits from Great West. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prayer for Relief.) Great West moved for summary judgment, but, before this motion could be decided, Decker agreed to dismiss Great West from the North Dakota suit with prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Exs. 19-20 [Doc. No. 107-2].) Accordingly, on March 1, 2016, Judge Sjue of the North Dakota district court dismissed Great West from the suit with prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This did not end the matter. Sometime in 2016, Decker appeared to obtain another counsel, Gregory Johnson. Johnson contacted Great West in August and September of 2016 and, not only demanded (once again) that Great West pay Decker $40,000 in no-fault benefits, but also suggested that Great West had a duty to defend and indemnify\n   <em>\n    Selle\n   </em>\n   from Decker's North Dakota negligence claim, on grounds that, as a \"permissive user\" of Decker's vehicle at the time of the accident, Selle was an \"insured\" under the Policy. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. P-Q [Doc. No. 115-4] (correspondence between Johnson and Great West's counsel);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 838 (defining \"insured\" under the liability portion of the Policy).) Perhaps not coincidently, shortly after this correspondence Selle's counsel in the North Dakota litigation contacted Great West and requested that Great West \"defend the Selles and indemnify them.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 21 [Doc. No. 107-2] (\"Sept. 9, 2016 Selle Letter\").) Great West denied this request, citing the \"moving property exclusion\" to liability coverage delineated above. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 22 [Doc. No. 107-2] (\"Oct. 17, 2016 Selle Denial Letter\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Faced with this disagreement, on September 14, 2016 Great West filed the instant declaratory judgment action to determine its rights, obligations, and liability under the Policy. Decker filed an answer and counterclaim (which he later supplemented), in which he asserted Minnesota\n   Consumer Fraud Act, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing counterclaims, along with his own request for declaratory relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   An. &amp; Counterclaim at 35; Supp. Counterclaim at 32.) Following a lengthy discovery period, in which the parties briefed and argued numerous discovery motions before Magistrate Judge Bowbeer, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment in August 2018. The parties simultaneously filed motions and opposition motions, and the Court heard oral argument on September 28, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. in Support of Summ. J. [Doc. No. 106] (\"Pl.'s Br.\") ); Def.'s Mem. in Support of Summ. J. [Doc. No. 113] (\"Def.'s Br.\"); Pl.'s Mem. in Opp. to Def.'s Summ. J. Mot. [Doc.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Summary judgment is proper if there are no disputed issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Stat. \u00a7 65B.44, subd. 1(a). However, the law allows insurers to deny coverage for injuries arising out of \"conduct in the course of loading and unloading the vehicle\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   the conduct occurs while [the insured was] occupying, entering into or alighting from [the vehicle].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901040\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/697/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 65B.43, subd. 3(2) (emphasis added).

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, Decker's injury plainly \"a[rose] out of conduct in the course of loading\" goods into a covered motor vehicle. (Policy Personal Injury Protection \u00a7 C.7.) Thus, the salient question is whether, at the time the hay bales struck Decker, Decker was \"occupying\" a covered vehicle, as the term is defined in his Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 F.4 (defining \"occupying\" as \"in or upon, entering into, or alighting from\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Decker, the record shows that, at the time of the accident, Decker was bent over beside the trailer, with, at most, one hand on the underside of the\n   trailer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 838-39. Further, Decker's deposition testimony confirms that, during his entire time at the Selle farm, Decker neither stood atop his trailer, nor engaged in substantial physical contact with the trailer bed. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Decker Dep. at 117-18 (\"Q: Other than your hand touching the trailer to try and tie the strap down, was that the only physical contact between you and the trailer? A: Yeah, I just - yes.\" \"Q: And once you parked the semi [truck] and trailer, did you ever get on the trailer itself? A: Not that I recall.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On these undisputed facts, the Court finds that Decker was not \"occupying\" his trailer at the time of the accident. First, because Decker's physical contact with his trailer at the time of the accident was\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   and fleeting, Decker was not injured while \"upon\" his trailer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1999) (defining \"upon\" as \"on,\" and in turn defining \"on\" as, first and foremost, \"a function word to indicate position in contact with and supported by the top surface of,\"\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"the book is lying on the table\"). Moreover, Decker was plainly not injured while \"in,\" \"entering into,\" or \"alighting from\" his truck or trailer.\n   <em>\n    Compare with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galle v. Excalibur Ins.

Decker first points to numerous non-Minnesota cases adopting the broader understanding of \"to occupy\" mentioned above. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 53-55 (\n   <em>\n    citing, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v.

Although Decker is correct that a majority of state courts have adopted a broader, non-literal definition of \"to occupy,\" that is of no moment because the Minnesota Supreme Court is not one of those courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Fidelity and Guar. Co. v. Goudeau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8216037\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/272/603/#p607\">\n    272 S.W.3d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 607 (Tex. 2008) (detailing the various definitions of \"to occupy\" used by state courts across the country, deeming Minnesota a \"plain-and-ordinary-meaning\" state, and adopting that standard, too).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Perhaps because of this, in Decker's opposition brief he reverses course and cites a handful of Minnesota cases in which the Court of Appeals found that a claimant was \"entering\" their car because their body was in their trunk, or in the process of entering their trunk, at the moment of injury.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Marvin,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9008588\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/707/747/#p751\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Jorgensen by Jorgensen v.

App. 1985) (holding that claimant injured by gas explosion in car trunk was \"occupying\" his father's vehicle because he \"was entering the trunk of the car to remove the jumper cables\" at the time of injury). Decker contends he was similarly injured while \"entering into\" the \"underside\" of his trailer,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , he was \"penetrating the trailer's outer boundaries\" when the hay bales struck him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp. Br. at 28.) However, the facts of the cited cases are readily distinguishable, in that the claimant was literally \"in\" or \"entering\" their vehicle at the moment of injury. Suffice it to say, \"penetrating\" the \"outer boundaries\" of a flatbed trailer with one's hand is not the same as \"entering into\" a vehicle, as that term is commonly understood. (Policy Personal Injury Protection \u00a7 F.4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, Decker argues that, were the Court to find that Decker was not \"occupying\" his vehicle, it would prevent passing \"pedestrian[s], bystander[s], bicyclist[s], or\n   motorist[s]\" injured by falling cargo during a loading/unloading situation from recovering no-fault benefits, a purportedly absurd result. (Def.'s Opp. Br. at 27.) But, far from being an absurd result, limiting the no-fault liability of\n   <em>\n    automobile\n   </em>\n   insurers during loading/unloading situations to only those persons who literally \"occupy\" the insured vehicle is the point of the No-Fault Act's exclusion. During these situations, in which a vehicle is parked and utilized for arguably non-transportation purposes, the risk of injury (sensibly) shifts from the car insurer to either the person observing the loading, outside the confines of the vehicle, or to other forms of liability insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Himle\n   </em>\n   , 445 N.W.2d at 591 (noting that \"the loading and unloading clause of the Minnesota No-Fault Act is 'consistent with the philosophy of [the] Act, to compensate losses resulting directly from motoring accidents and to leave to other forms of insurance and compensation systems those losses which are tangential to motorists' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Krupenny v.

Although it is unfortunate that other forms of insurance do not appear to exist in this case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 839, that does not mean Great West must provide Decker no-fault benefits that neither his Policy nor Minnesota law entitle him to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For these reasons, Great West's summary judgment motion as to no-fault benefits is granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Further, because Decker's no-fault breach of contract counterclaim (Counterclaim Count III) and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing counterclaim (Counterclaim Count II) hinge on whether Great West wrongfully denied Decker no-fault benefits, and because the Court has found that Great West did not wrongfully deny Decker such benefits, Great West's summary judgment motion as to Counts II and III of Decker's Counterclaim is granted as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Food Mkt.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As best the Court can tell, Decker's CFA claim is as follows: (1) Great West sells commercial trucking insurance policies in Minnesota, (2) in these policies, Great West assures policyholders that it will provide the minimum no-fault coverage required by Minnesota law, including for out-of-state accidents, (3) however, contrary to these assurances, and in violation of Minnesota law, Great West systematically underpays (or denies coverage to) insureds injured in out-of-state accidents, (4) Great West does so by relying on the (purportedly less generous) no-fault coverage liability limits in those states, rather than on the (purportedly more generous) Minnesota no-fault liability limits, and (5) Great West then intentionally fails to disclose this scheme to commercial truck drivers purchasing Great West insurance policies (like Decker), in hopes that it will induce them to buy \"functionally worthless and illusory no-fault coverage.\" (Supp. Countercl. \u00b6 95.) This scheme is purportedly ongoing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp. Br. at 41;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Supp. Countercl. \u00b6 96 (requesting an injunction that would stop Great West from continuing this scheme).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As evidence, Decker primarily relies on his own interactions with Great West, in which Great West repeatedly (and, by its own admission, incorrectly) cited North Dakota law and its $30,000 coverage limit in denying his no-fault claim, rather than Minnesota law and its $40,000 coverage limit.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Sept. 28, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 22 (conceding that Great West \"probably\" should have relied on Minnesota no-fault law in denying Decker's claim). Decker also points to two other instances in which Great West referenced out-of-state law to Minnesota policyholders when denying no-fault claims for out-of-state accidents, and suggests that yet-to-be-disclosed evidence might show that Great West is underpaying those to whom it does pay benefits. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp. Br. at 39-40, and n.40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In response, Great West notes that its internal records (which it produced in discovery) plainly show that Great West is\n   not running a scheme to underpay or deny coverage for out-of-state accidents. In fact, of the 100 out-of-state, no-fault claims Great West received from Minnesota policyholders in 2011 and 2012, Great West paid benefits on 37 of those claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 18-19 (citing Pl.'s Exs. 25-27 [Doc. No. 107-2 - 107-3] (\"Great West 2011-12 Claim Data\").) What is more, 29 of those claims were paid to policyholders injured in states that do not even require no-fault coverage, thus belying any suggestion that Great West fraudulently eliminates Minnesota no-fault coverage based on the law of the state where the accident occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, of the 63 instances in which Great West denied an out-of-state, no-fault claim, Great West's denial letters only referenced foreign law in three instances (one of which was Decker's case).

In other words, the premiums Decker paid Great West were not for \"functionally worthless and illusory nofault coverage.\" (Supp. Countercl. \u00b6 95.)What is more, there is no indication that, had Great West denied Decker's no-fault claim explicitly under Minnesota law back in 2013, Decker would have (or could have) done anything different in response.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D.A.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11890095\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/570/168/#p173\">\n    570 N.W.2d at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that one can show damages under the CFA by demonstrating that one would have taken another course of action, absent the alleged fraud).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Decker's only argument to the contrary is that \"a private litigant incurs an 'injury' when forced to defend against fraudulent conduct that violates the CFA.\" (Def.'s Opp. Br. at 35-36 (citing\n   <em>\n    Love v.

In making this argument, Decker notes that Great West sued him for declaratory relief in federal court (allegedly as part of its \"fraudulent scheme\"), and thus injured him by forcing him to incur attorney's fees. However, the case Decker cites for this proposition,\n   <em>\n    Love v. Amsler\n   </em>\n   , is inapposite.

The Court takes Decker's point that, as a conceptual matter, a large insurance company could defraud the public by promising to provide policyholders the maximum nofault coverage available under the law of the policy state, and then deny such coverage for out-of-state accidents. Indeed, if the insurance company included misrepresentations in its generally-applicable policy documents, allegations concerning such a scheme may suffice to show a public benefit at the pleading stage.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Here, the parties dispute whether Great West must defend and indemnify Selle from Decker's negligence suit in North Dakota state court, on grounds that Selle was a \"permissive user\" of Decker's trailer at the time of the accident, and,\n   hence, an \"insured\" subject to the Policy's liability provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   At first glance, the Policy appears to resolve this dispute. Under the plain language of the Policy's \"moving property exclusion,\" Selle was not an \"insured\" because (a) Selle was \"using\" Decker's trailer while \"moving property to\" the trailer, and (b) Selle was not an \"employee, partner, [or] member\" of KW Trucking, nor was he \"leasing\" or \"borrowing\" Decker's truck/trailer (or any other covered auto) from KW Trucking or Decker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 838 (citing Policy Liability Coverage \u00a7 II.A.1.b(4) ). Ergo, it seems, Great West has no obligation to defend and indemnify Selle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   However, Decker asserts that Great West's \"moving property exclusion\" is \"void and unenforceable\" against public policy. (Def.'s Br. at 41.) This is so because, in Decker's view, Minnesota law requires auto insurers to provide liability coverage to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   permissive user of a motor vehicle, through so-called \"omnibus\" coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Great West, by contrast, argues that Minnesota law contains no such requirement, and that its \"moving property exclusion\" is therefore enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Upon careful consideration, the Court finds that neither the No-Fault Act nor Minnesota case law preclude Great West from limiting its liability coverage to certain permissive users in the \"moving property\" context. Consequently, the Court will not strike down Great West's \"moving property exclusion\" as void against public policy, and will not require Great West to defend and indemnify Selle. The Court reaches this conclusion for four reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     First\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , on its face, the No-Fault Act does not contain an \"omnibus\" coverage requirement for permissive users. The section of the Act detailing the requirements for \"residual liability coverage\" states that the insurer \"shall be liable to pay, on behalf of the insured, sums which the insured is legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury and property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of any motor vehicle,\n   <em>\n    including a motor vehicle permissively operated by an insured as that term is defined in [the statute]\n   </em>\n   .\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 65B.49, subd. 3(1) (emphasis added). An \"insured\" is a \"named insured,\" or that named insured's spouse, minor-in-custody, or resident relative, so long as the person is not a named insured on a different insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 65B.43, subd. 5. As such, by its plain text, the No-Fault Act only specifically requires that an insurer provide omnibus coverage for a certain class of permissive users,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"insureds\" as defined by the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McClain v.

It is not clear why that was the case, as Great West corporate policy (not to mention well-established Minnesota insurance law) required the more generous Minnesota policy limits to govern a Minnesota insurance policy like this one.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Minn.
