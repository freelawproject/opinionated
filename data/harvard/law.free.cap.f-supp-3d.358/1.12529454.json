COOPER, United States District Judge\n   This case concerns the Bureau of Land Management's (\"BLM\") approval of permits for Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. (\"Slawson\"), to drill horizontal oil and gas wells underneath Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota. The well pad is located 600 feet from the lake on privately-owned \"fee\" land within the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, which is where Plaintiff Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation (\"MHA Nation\" or \"Tribe\") resides. The Tribe brought this lawsuit against the U.S. Department of the Interior and its now-former Secretary Ryan Zinke (\"federal defendants\") to challenge the issuance of the drilling permits. It says the BLM's decision to approve the permits violated a tribal law requiring that all well sites be at least 1,000 feet from the lake. Slawson, as it did in the administrative proceedings, intervened as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Slawson, joined by the federal defendants, has moved to transfer the case to the District of North Dakota-where the land in question and the relevant BLM decisionmakers are located-arguing that the case presents an entirely local dispute with no meaningful connection to the District of Columbia. The Tribe opposes the motion. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the motion and transfer the case to the District of North Dakota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1953, the federal government completed construction of the Garrison Dam along the Missouri River in central North Dakota. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 19. The erection of the dam created Lake Sakakawea, a 180-mile long reservoir that runs through the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The reservation is home to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, a federally-recognized tribe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   BLM, an agency of the Department of the Interior, administers federal oil and gas leases. In 2011, Slawson applied to the BLM's North Dakota Field Office for permits to drill multiple horizontal wells underneath Lake Sakakawea.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.

(Fee land is property that is individually owned rather than held by the federal government in trust for Indian tribes.) According to Slawson, the well bores will penetrate mineral beds held either by the federal government, the State of North Dakota, or private entities. They will not reach minerals held by, or in trust for, the Tribe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Slawson's Motion to Transfer (\"MTT\"), Exhibit A (Environmental Assessment), ECF No. 18-2, at 1; MTT, Exhibit B (Decl. of Eric Sundberg), ECF No. 18-3, \u00b6 4.

The Tribe counters that venue is proper here and that Slawson cannot overcome the strong presumption favoring a plaintiff's choice of forum, especially because this lawsuit presents legal questions of national importance for all tribes.

Opp'n at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court need address plaintiff's first and second reasons only briefly. First, while the Missouri River is undoubtedly a national waterway, this case concerns only Lake Sakakawea and its immediate environs. And the Tribe fails to explain how a spill resulting from drilling operations in the lake would likely affect sections of the Missouri River beyond those environs, let alone in states other than North Dakota.

In its view, this case involves \"the routine administrative application of a decades-old standard-originally announced in\n   <em>\n    Montana v.

And though the Tribe argues that\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   does not speak to the\n   <em>\n    federal government's\n   </em>\n   authority to condition permits on compliance with tribal laws, Slawson correctly points out that the Tribe would still \"need the authority to pass that law in the first instance to trigger such an obligation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   So a threshold question in this case will be whether the Tribe had the authority to pass its 1000-foot setback law in the first place. Both before this Court and throughout the administrative proceedings, the Tribe has identified two sources of authority for the setback law: its inherent sovereign powers to protect the health and welfare of its members, and its federally-approved 1936 constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 71;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mot. for TRO, Exhibit 6 (The MHA Nation's Pet. for Stay in Appeal to IBLA),\n   <em>\n    Slawson Exploration Co., Inc. v.

The scope of the first asserted source of authority is squarely controlled by\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   . That case presented \"the question of the power of [a] Tribe to regulate non-Indian fishing and hunting on reservation land owned in fee by nonmembers of the Tribe.\"\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n    450 U.S. at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court explained the \"general proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n    at 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court then identified two exceptions to this general rule when \"Indian tribes [\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   ] retain inherent sovereign power to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians on their reservations, even on non-Indian fee lands\": (1) when nonmembers \"enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements\" and (2) when nonmembers' conduct on fee lands within the reservation \"threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n    at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). The Tribe contends, as it did in the administrative proceedings, that it had the authority to pass the 1000-foot setback law pursuant to the second\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   exception because that law is intended to protect the health and welfare of its members by protecting the lake from a catastrophic oil spill. Compl. \u00b6 71. The Court need not take a position on the merits of the Tribe's argument. It suffices here that the issue involves a straightforward application of Supreme Court precedent to specific facts concerning the health and safety risks of Slawson's drilling operations. That is not a matter of generalized national concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Tribe advances a more colorable argument with respect to its second cited\n   source of authority for the setback law: its federally-approved constitution. The Tribe argues that, separate from its inherent sovereign authority, Article I of its constitution expressly defines the Tribe's civil jurisdiction as extending \"to all persons and all lands,\n   <em>\n    including lands held in fee\n   </em>\n   , within the exterior boundaries of the Fort Berthold Reservation.\" Compl. \u00b6 15 (emphasis in original). In isolation, this blanket assertion of jurisdiction over fee lands plainly sweeps more broadly than what\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   permits. But the Tribe counters that the Secretary of Interior approved the constitution in 1936 pursuant to an act of Congress-the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20461\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   -and, as a result, that approval reflects an express delegation of congressional authority to the Tribe to regulate fee land. By this reasoning, the Tribe says,\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   does not curtail its power to enact the setback law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Again, the Court need not opine on the merits of the Tribe's argument. Conceptually, the issue could implicate other tribes, although the Tribe cites no case in the almost forty years since\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   pitting its jurisdictional rule against broader assertions of jurisdiction in a federally-approved tribal constitution. This absence of caselaw might suggest that this case presents less of an issue of general application than the Tribe asserts. In any event, the Court concludes that potential national implications of this case do not outweigh the significant local interests of North Dakota and its residents, which includes the Tribe. Moreover, courts in the District of North Dakota are perfectly capable of addressing any broader issues that arise. \"As the D.C. Circuit has articulated, there is no 'blanket rule that national policy cases should be brought [in the District of Columbia].' \"\n   <em>\n    City of W. Palm Beach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525867\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/150/#p153\">\n    317 F.Supp.3d at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Starnes v.

Cir. 1974) ). Thus, because this case focuses on land in North Dakota and an administrative decision made in North Dakota, and because federal courts in North Dakota are more than capable of handling cases involving national issues, the Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Here, the District of North Dakota is already familiar with the parties and the facts in this case and, contrary to the Tribe's assertion, has already considered many of the Tribe's substantive arguments. Although the District of North Dakota considered an interim administrative stay order rather than the final denial of the Tribe's appeal as here, the court necessarily had to determine whether the Tribe or Slawson was likely to succeed on the merits of the administrative appeal when deciding whether to issue the TRO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTT Exhibit J (D.N.D. TRO\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Decision), at 8-10.
