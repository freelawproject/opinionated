(Doc. 32). Also before the Court is State Farm's Motion To Strike. (Doc. 50). The parties have completed briefing these motions, and they are ripe for review. (Docs. 48, 49, 55, 56). State Farm has requested oral argument, but the Court is able to decide these motions on the briefs, and the request is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . For the reasons stated in this opinion, the motions are due to be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and otherwise\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Brown and his wife, Virginia Brown (the \"Browns\"), have continuously lived in their home for approximately twelve years. Mr. Brown's home has a concrete block foundation in the basement, with wood paneling covering it. On October 2, 2014, lightning struck a tree owned by Mr. Brown's neighbor-the tree was seventeen feet and six inches from Mr. Brown's home. At the time of the October 2nd storm (the \"First Storm\"), John Brown's home was insured by State Farm under Homeowner's Policy Number 01-GR-9065-23 (the \"Policy\"). Approximately one week after the First Storm, another rain storm (the \"Second Storm\") produced approximately one and one-half inches of rain. Approximately three days after the Second Storm, Mr. Brown found water leaking from under a closet in the basement. Approximately one and one-half to two weeks after the First Storm (and thus about one-half week to one week after the Second Storm), Mr. Brown examined the closet and found that the weight of his wife's clothing had pulled the closet away from the wall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Brown then pulled the paneling away from the wall and discovered that the concrete block foundation had begun to collapse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Brown contacted his State Farm Agent to report the concrete block falling into the basement, and the loss was reported to State Farm on Mr. Brown's behalf. On October 22, 2014, State Farm received notice of Mr. Brown's claim, and Claims Representative Amy King contacted Mr. Brown to set up an appointment for his inspection. During the phone call with Ms. King, Mr. Brown stated that the damage to his home was caused by lightning (during the First Storm) that struck a neighbor's tree, followed the roots of the tree, and hit the side of his house, resulting in damage to the brick and an interior wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 27, 2014, Ms. King inspected Mr. Brown's home with Mr. Brown and a trainer, Mike Milner, present. After the inspection, Ms. King explained to Mr. Brown that a structural engineer was needed to inspect the home to determine the cause of the damage. State Farm retained Hal Cain, an Alabama-licensed structural engineer from Cain &amp; Associates, to determine cause of the damage to Mr. Brown's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Cain indicated that the damage to the home was caused by external soil\n   forces-hydrostatic pressure-and that lightning to the tree did not have any effect on the wall. Mr. Cain cites Mr. Brown's statement that there was one inch of water in his basement in the expert report. (Doc. 32-4 at 22-23). Mr. Cain also reported that \"[a]n exterior basement wall should be designed to resist the outside forces produced by the soil and water,\" but Mr. Brown's concrete foundation wall lacked concrete or reinforcing steel inside of the blocks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Based on State Farm's investigation and Mr. Cain's report, State Farm sent a denial letter to Mr. Brown on November 21, 2014, explaining that the loss was not covered by the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the denial, Mr. Brown hired his own structural engineer, David Carlysle, to inspect his home. Mr. Carlysle concluded, in his original report, that \"[g]iven the recent work in the right portion of the basement, the significant distress that has developed in the right foundation wall since the wall was covered by 2 x 4s and paneling, and the timing of the lightning strike, we find it likely that the wall has been damaged by the lightning strike.\" Mr. Carlysle's report states that \"[i]t is our opinion that the lightning itself did not damage the house, but the shock wave from the lightning strike caused damage to the foundation wall.\" (Doc. 32-10 at 84). Mr. Carlysle's original report stated that the \"shock wave from the strike can be similar to that created by a blast.\" Mr. Carlysle did not find evidence of blasting or impact on the foundational wall. Mr. Carlysle contended that the foundation wall was built 35 years prior, when non-reinforced hollow concrete block foundation walls were the accepted method of construction. In spite of water leaking into Mr. Cain's basement, Mr. Carlysle also contended, based on a review of weather data, that the soil was not saturated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   State Farm submitted Mr. Carlysle's report to Mr. Cain for review. Mr. Cain drafted a supplemental report, where he noted that Mr. Carlysle failed to provide scientific proof to otherwise prove that the lightning strike caused the foundation wall to fail. Citing the lack of \"of evidence of lightning damage near the bottom of the tree,\" lack of broken windows, lack of roof damage, and lack of damage to neighboring homes, Mr. Cain posits that \"[t]here was no evidence of shock wave damage anywhere.\" (Doc. 32-4 at 112-13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He reiterated that the foundation wall was not properly designed and noted that just because non-reinforced concrete walls were an accepted design does not mean the walls are now structurally sound. Mr. Cain also pointed out that he observed the lightning-struck tree during his inspection, whereas Mr. Carlysle did not see the lightning-struck tree (the tree had been removed prior to Mr. Carlyle's investigation). Based on Mr. Brown's own statement about the depth of the water on the basement flooring and amount of water he personally removed, Mr. Cain's supplemental report also reiterated that the rainfall was higher than stated in the weather data relied on by Mr. Carlysle. Based on Mr. Cain's supplemental report and the Policy language, State Farm maintained its denial and sent a letter indicating that to Mr. Brown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After this lawsuit was filed, Mr. Brown disclosed Mr. Carlysle as an expert. Mr. Carlysle submitted revised reports and was deposed. During his deposition, Mr. Carlysle expressed his opinion that the\n   lightning strike caused damage to Mr. Brown's underground foundation because it caused the ground to shake. Mr. Carlysle reiterated that \"the sudden movement of the right foundation wall was caused by seismic ground movement created by the pressure wave/thunder from the lightning strike approximately seventeen feet six inches from the right front corner of the house.\" Mr. Carlysle opined that thunder created seismic movement in the soil. Mr. Carlysle's opinion is that the pressure wave, or seismic movement, ultimately caused the ground to move.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified that it is his opinion that lightning caused the thunder, which caused the movement of the soil, which caused the foundational wall to fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Policy expressly excludes damages from earth movement, regardless of the cause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    SECTION I-LOSSES NOT INSURED\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2.

Water comes in the basement when it rains, and black mold has begun to accumulate in Mr. Brown's basement underneath the flooring. Despite the damage in their basement, Mr. Brown and his wife continue to live in their home, have never moved out, and continue to have friends over to their home. Mr. Brown understands that the Policy does not cover earth movement, water damage resulting from earth movement, or mold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The policy provides broad coverage for losses-limited by the specific exclusions under the policy.

State Farm argues that Mr. Brown has not shown he is within the policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 49 at 3). However, this argument appears to be based on a failure to recognize the broad coverage /all-risk nature of the policy. State Farm has to prove its own affirmative defense, not Mr. Brown. Under the standard enumerated above, State Farm has to prove that one of the exclusions applies because, under Alabama law, the exclusion is an affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State Farm Cannot Prove the Defective Construction and Water Damage Exclusion at Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   State Farm's first argument is that their expert witness, Mr. Cain, shows that \"Mr. Brown's loss was cause by external soil forces/hydrostatic pressure and improper construction.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 32 at 18). According to State Farm, this incident falls under one of the Policy exclusions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19).

According to Mr. Brown, he told Mr. Cain that there were \"water spots\" on the floor, and never said that there was about an inch of water covering the floor. (Doc. 48 at 11-12); (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   John Brown Depo. at 266-67). Since the underpinning of Mr. Cain's report is partially based on this piece of information, Mr. Brown argues that the report is not credible. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Brown further argues that \"Mr. Cain's conclusions are directly refuted by Mr. Carlysle\" and suggests there was not enough rainfall for the wall to fail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13). Mr. Brown points to evidence indicating that the wall was in good condition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and witnesses who are able to testify to what they observed at the home. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14). Mr. Carlysle, Mr. Brown's expert, indicates that it is highly unlikely that hydrostatic pressure could have collapsed without some prior distress in the wall. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14); (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Carlysle Depo. at 95:3-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   At summary judgment, this Court must take the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Here, Mr. Brown claims that he never said that one inch of water covered his basement floor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   A.

State Farm counters by arguing that Mr. Cain's opinion is \"based on ... far more than his conversation with Mr. Brown.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 49 at 11). While there is more to Mr. Cain's report than the alleged conversation between him and Mr. Brown, the alleged one inch of water comment is a keystone of the report. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 32-4 at 22) (\"The fact that Mr. Brown stated that there was approximately one (1) inch of water on the basement floor during the storm indicates that the soil outside the wall was saturated.

Here, Mr. Brown can testify that he never said there was standing water in the basement, and so Mr. Cain's opinion is suspect. If Mr. Cain's report is based on a statement that was never uttered, then a jury could find that Mr. Cain's report is not worth the paper it is written on. Further, Mr. Brown's expert, Mr. Carlysle, casts significant doubt on Mr. Cain's report. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 32-10 at 84-85) (discussing the problems with Mr. Cain's opinion).

In support, State Farm relies heavily on the\n   <em>\n    Slade\n   </em>\n   decision. (Doc. 32 at 24-26) (citing\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v.

The earth-movement exclusion is not reasonably susceptible to two or more constructions. The language of the policy specifically states that a covered loss, such as a loss resulting from lightning, is excluded from coverage if the loss would not have occurred without earth movement. According to the policy, earth movement means the \"shifting of ... earth.\" The Slades' second theory of liability under the contract is that lightning caused the soil to shift or settle and that the shifting or settling resulted in the cracking in their home. According to the unambiguous terms of the contract, the Slades could not use this theory as a basis for contractual liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11500073\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/747/293/#p303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It appears that the policy provision in\n   <em>\n    Slade\n   </em>\n   is strikingly similar, or even the same, as the policy provision currently before this Court. The policy at issue excludes coverage for \"earth movement.\" (Doc. 32-2 at 32). It states that earth movement is the \"sinking, rising, shifting,\n   <em>\n    expanding or contracting of earth\n   </em>\n   , all whether combined with water or not.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11500073\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/747/293/#p303\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added). The policy clearly states that State Farm \"[does] not insure for such loss regardless of: (a) the cause of the excluded event; or (b) other causes of the loss; or (c)\n   <em>\n    whether other causes acted concurrently or in any sequence with the excluded event to produce the loss\n   </em>\n   ; or (d)\n   <em>\n    whether the event occurs suddenly\n   </em>\n   or gradually, involves isolated or widespread damage,\n   <em>\n    arises from natural or external forces\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11500073\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/747/293/#p303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Mr. Brown's response on this point does not address\n   <em>\n    Slade\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 48 at 25). Mr. Brown argues that the Court should not \"pare down and dissect the movements that occur instantaneously within a single jagged lightning bolt\" because that is not what the policy necessitates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11500073\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/747/293/#p303\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). He argues that it would be an \"unreasonably broad interpretation of [the] policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11500073\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/747/293/#p303\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). State Farm notes that Mr. Brown alludes to the dispute between himself and his expert over how exactly the lightning caused the home damage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 49 at 4 n. 2) (citing Doc. 48 at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Ultimately, the Court does not have to reach the question of whether Mr. Carlysle's theory excludes coverage under the policy because a jury does not have to accept Mr. Carlysle's opinion. State Farm proffered an expert who put holes in Mr. Carlysle's theory. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 32-4 at 43-59) (discussing the problems with Mr. Carlysle's opinion). State Farm then claims that it wins under Mr. Carlysle's theory. However, the jury may well believe Mr. Cain when he says that Mr. Carlysle's theory is not credible. Accordingly, State Farm is not entitled to summary judgment based on Mr. Carlysle's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court recognizes that this is an unusual case. However, there is a narrow path where, if a jury does not accept\n   either Mr. Cain's or Mr. Carlysle's testimony, then State Farm will not have met its burden to prove the applicability of any exclusion. The Policy grants coverage for a loss until State Farm proves the applicability of an exclusion. If a jury does not accept either expert opinion, accepting only the portions of each report that discredits the other, then State Farm will not have proven its affirmative defense. \"A jury is not required to accept 'all or none' of a witness's testimony; rather, a jury may accept those portions of a witness's testimony which it considers credible and reject other portions which it finds to be improbable.\"\n   <em>\n    Rixey v.

While Coverage B for personal property enumerates certain perils that an insured would necessarily have to show occurred to be within the policy, Coverage A for the dwelling covers all \"accidental direct physical loss to the property\"\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   there is an exclusion. (Doc. 32-2 at 29). State Farm has to prove the applicability of its exclusion. A jury must decide whether to believe either of the experts, and to what extent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mold Damage Is Excluded Under the Policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Next, State Farm argues that \"any mold damage resulting from water damage in Mr. Brown's basement is specifically excluded under the policy.\" (Doc. 32 at 26-28) (emphasis and capitalization omitted). In response, Mr. Brown argues that \"[t]he mold damage was a foreseeable result of the lightning strike ... and the resulting collapse of the foundation wall.\" (Doc. 48 at 26). Further, Mr. Brown argues that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   The water damage to [his] basement floor was directly caused by the lightning strike, a covered peril. The policy does not exclude coverage for remediation or repair for damages caused by mold if that damage resulted from a covered peril. (Doc. 32-5 p. 16-62).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27). Mr. Brown again cites no authority supporting his position, but merely distinguishes the two cases State Farm relies on. (Doc. 48 at 26-27). The Court need not reach the applicability of those two cases because here the policy terms are unambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The policy defines \"fungus\" as \"mold.\" (Doc. 32-2 at 6). The policy clearly excludes fungus. (Doc. 32-2 at 9-10, 32) (\"We also do not cover ... any remediation of fungus.\") (emphasis omitted). This is so \"regardless of ... the cause of the excluded event ... other causes of the loss ... whether other causes acted concurrently or in any sequence with the excluded event ... [and] whether the event occurs suddenly or gradually.\" (Doc. 32-2 at 32). Mr. Brown argues that \"[i]t was reasonably foreseeable that [he] would suffer mold damage unless State Farm timely performed under the contract.\" (Doc. 48 at 27). However, mold is excluded under the policy. Accordingly, Mr. Brown's claim for mold damage fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mr. Brown Can Recover Mental Anguish Damages\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Finally, State Farm argues that Mr. Brown cannot recover any damages for mental anguish under the breach of contract claim because \"the alleged breach ... did not involve a contract for repair or construction, and any alleged breach did not 'affect the habitability' of Mr. Brown's home.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 32 at 28). State Farm notes that \"Mr. Brown continues to live in the home even today, and even continues to invite others to his home.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29).

This case is even stronger because this is Mr. Brown's primary home, the damage is more significant, and he cannot use part of his home.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    \"John is home most of the day and he enjoyed his downstairs-let's just call it a man cave.
