MERRYDAY, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Employed in Arizona as a \"regional marketing representative\" for Florida Pharmacy Solutions, relator Brady McFarland purportedly uncovered through means not explained in the complaint a nationwide scheme by the seventy defendants to bilk Tricare for hundreds of million of dollars. Florida Pharmacy Solutions and six other defendant pharmacies \"compound,\" or mix, ingredients to fill prescriptions for medicine not manufactured by pharmaceutical companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The pharmacies allegedly \"employed,\" \"partnered,\" or \"contracted\" with marketing companies. Each marketing company allegedly cold-called a Tricare beneficiary; if the beneficiary expressed interest in a pain cream, scar cream, or multi-vitamin, the marketing company \"connected\" the beneficiary to a physician or nurse practitioner. After speaking briefly on the phone with a beneficiary, the physician or nurse practitioner prescribed a pain cream, scar cream, or multi-vitamin. The complaint includes no explanation how the physician transmitted the prescription to a particular pharmacy, but Florida Pharmacy Solutions and the other pharmacies allegedly filled each prescription. Florida Pharmacy Solutions purportedly requested that a physician submit two types of \"blanket authorizations.\" The first authorization allegedly permitted Florida Pharmacy Solutions to add and substitute ingredients at will, a tactic that enabled Florida Pharmacy Solutions to add several expensive but dubious ingredients. The second authorization permitted Florida Pharmacy Solutions to re-fill a patient's prescription without consulting either the prescribing physician or the patient. Under these authorizations, Florida Pharmacy Solutions allegedly included unnecessary ingredients in a prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In addition to alleging medically unnecessary ingredients, McFarland alleges the submission of \"legally false\" claims. According to McFarland, the physicians and nurse practitioners, the marketing companies, and the pharmacies violated the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits the \"knowing[ ] and willful[ ]\" solicitation, receipt, offering, or paying of a \"remuneration\" in exchange for a referral to a provider who may submit to Tricare (or another federal health care program) a claim for payment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7(b)(1)(A). Also, the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits a remuneration for \"purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, or ordering\" a good or service for which Tricare might pay. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7(b)(1)(B). The pharmacies allegedly paid a kickback to the marketing companies for each prescription filled, and in turn the marketing companies allegedly paid a kickback to the prescribing physicians and nurse practitioners for each prescription. Additionally, McFarland alleges that the pharmacies waived co-pays required by Tricare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In a fifty-three page complaint, McFarland sues (Doc. 12) seven pharmacies, eleven marketing companies, fifty-one physicians and nurse practitioners, and a \"related defendant.\" The complaint groups together the pharmacies (which the complaint designates the \"Compounding Pharmacy Defendants\"), groups together the marketing companies (which the complaint designates the \"Marketing Defendants\"), and groups together the physicians and nurse practitioners (which the complaint designates the \"Prescribing Teledoctor Defendants\").

Count IV alleges that the \"Prescribing Teledoctor Defendants\" violated Section 3729(a)(1)(A) by submitting or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for the telephonic consultations. Finally, count V alleges a conspiracy by all seventy defendants to violate the False Claims Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thirty-two defendants move severally to dismiss the complaint or the action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Four defendants cite the False Claims Act's public-disclosure bar and move to dismiss the action under either Rules 12(b)(1) or (6), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ; three move under Rule 12(b)(2) to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction; and twenty-nine move under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss the complaint for violating Rules 8(a) and 9(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without leave, more than a dozen defendants attempt to \"join\" or \"adopt\" the motion of another defendant.

Two years before the relator sued, a General Accountability Office report described \"widespread MSP fraud\" and named \"other insurance companies,\" but the GAO report never mentioned BCBS of Florida.\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   holds that a public disclosure which exposes widespread fraud but which fails to specifically identify the defendant cannot trigger the public-disclosure bar.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10508862\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/562/\">\n    19 F.3d at 566-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Doc. 204 at 10-12) Even if the public disclosure of widespread fraud that might include a particular defendant constitutes \"substantially the same allegation\" as the unambiguous identification of a particular defendant's fraud,\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   's reasoning compels the conclusion that McFarland qualifies as an original source under the amended public-disclosure bar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Section 3730(e)(4)(B)(2), an \"original source\" means a person with knowledge \"that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations.\" Rao argues that the news media and the government reports exposed the ubiquity of the pharmacies' fraud scheme and that the government could \"readily identify ... additional [d]efendants\" by mining Tricare records. (Doc. 204 at 12) According to Rao and 1st Care, McFarland's identification of the particular doctors and pharmacies that purportedly violated the False Claims Act fails to \"materially add to the public disclosures.\" (Doc. 204 at 12 and Doc. 291 at 13) But the identification of a particular \"wrongdoer[ ] is precisely where the government needs the help of [a relator].\"\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10508862\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/562/\">\n    19 F.3d at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government \"often knows on a general level that fraud is taking place ...

The identification of a person who allegedly defrauded a program as large as Tricare, which lacks the time and resources to investigate each claim, adds materially to the public disclosure of widespread but not universal fraud against the program.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

McFarland states that he voluntarily informed the government about the fraud allegations before\n   suing, and none of the defendants rebuts McFarland's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Section 3732(a) of the False Claims Act authorizes nationwide service. (\"A summons as required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall be issued by the appropriate district court and served at any place within or outside the United States.\"). Because the False Claims Act authorizes nationwide service, Florida's long-arm statute is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   If the plaintiff serves a summons under Rule 4(k)(1)(A), the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state.\n   <em>\n    Int'l Shoe Co. v.

If the plaintiff serves the summons under Rule 4(k)(1)(C), the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment limits the exercise of personal jurisdiction. Consequently, when a federal court attempts to exercise personal jurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(1)(C), the \"court must ... examine a defendant's aggregate contacts with the nation as a whole rather than his contacts with the forum state.\"\n   <em>\n    Republic of Panama v.

Motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Claims for telephonic consultations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to McFarland, each telephonic consultation is false both as a matter of fact and law. A consultation claim is allegedly factually false because each consultation is a sham. (E.g., Doc. 12 at \u00b6 149) And a consultation claim is legally false because a kickback allegedly taints each consultation. (E.g., Doc. 12 at \u00b6 239) McFarland's allegations about the \"consultation\n   claims\" fail to comply with Rules 8(a) and 9(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Both factual and legal falsity require the submission of a false claim. As several physicians correctly observe (e.g., Doc. 212 at 15), no facts support the conclusion that a physician or nurse practitioner \"actually submitted\" a claim for a consultation. In\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Clausen v. Lab. Corp. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9436836\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/1301/\">\n    290 F.3d 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2002), the relator alleged that the defendant submitted false claims to the government, and the district court dismissed the complaint for failing to \"identify a single claim that was actually submitted.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"530181\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/198/560/#p563\">\n    198 F.R.D. 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563 (N.D. Ga. 2000). Affirming the dismissal,\n   <em>\n    Clausen\n   </em>\n   holds that a relator must allege the amount and date of a false claim or another item of particular information that shows the \"actual submission\" of a false claim.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9436836\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/1301/\">\n    290 F.3d at 1309-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this action, McFarland fails to allege any fact that suggests the submission by a physician or nurse practitioner of a fraudulent consultation claim. The complaint identifies neither the amount nor the date of a consultation claim and attaches to the complaint neither a bill nor a receipt for a consultation claim. No specific allegation of fact supports the conclusion (Doc. 12 at \u00b6 245) that the \"Prescribing Teledoctor Defendants\" submitted a fraudulent claim for a consultation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Also, insufficient facts support the allegation of factual falsity, that is, the conclusion that each consultation is a sham. McFarland alleges that each consultation involved a new patient and that the physician consulted by phone with the patient (Doc. 12 at \u00b6 5), but the complaint includes no description of what the physician and patient discussed during the consultation or any other information that suggests a sham. Excluding conclusory allegations, the complaint suggests no more than the \"mere possibility of misconduct,\" that is, the possibility that a brief telephone consultation with a new patient might amount to a sham.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v. Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678-79,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (explaining that an allegation \"merely consistent with\" liability fails to state a claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Additionally, McFarland fails to specifically identify a physician who consulted by telephone. Rather, the complaint groups together fifty-one physicians and nurse practitioners and alleges that the physicians and nurse practitioners \"often\" consult by telephone. (Doc. 12 at \u00b6 149) Fifty-two paragraphs in the complaint formulaically allege that a physician in a particular city prescribed a treatment for a patient in another city. (Doc. 12 at \u00b6\u00b6 151-202) In some instances, the two live in different states. (E.g., Doc. 12 at \u00b6 156) McFarland appears to rely on an inference of remoteness-that a physician and a patient must have consulted telephonically because the two reside in different states. In other instances, the patient and the physician live in the same state and often in adjoining cities. (E.g., Doc. 12 at \u00b6\u00b6 152, 194) Absent facts that support the inference, McFarland cannot reasonably infer a telephonic consultation between a patient and a physician who reside nearby. In any event, Rule 9(b) requires McFarland to allege each physician's telephonic consultation with a Tricare beneficiary and the subsequent submission to Tricare of a claim for the consultation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Kickbacks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   McFarland alleges kickbacks from the pharmacies to the marketing companies, from the marketing companies to the prescribing physicians and nurse practitioners, and from one pharmacy to another. Also, McFarland alleges that the pharmacies unlawfully waived co-payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because the payment or receipt of a kickback constitutes a basis for the fraud, Rule 9(b) requires pleading with specificity the details of the kickback scheme.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Keeler v. Eisai, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=568%20Fed.%20Appx.%20783\">\n    568 Fed.Appx. 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 798-800 (11th Cir. 2014) (affirming the dismissal of a False Claims Act claim for failure to plead with specificity a kickback). As several defendants observe, McFarland's complaint includes no specific allegations of fact about any kickback, for example, the amount and date of the kickback, the person who sent or received the kickback,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   or the bank account from which the kickback was sent or received. McFarland repeatedly alleges \"[o]n information and belief\" that a prescribing physician accepted a kickback from a marketing company (Doc. 12 at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 215-16), but a relator cannot base a fraud claim on \"information and belief.\"\n   <em>\n    Clausen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9436836\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/1301/\">\n    290 F.3d at 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation omitted).

McFarland alleges two types of kickbacks: first, the exchange of money between the defendants in this action, and second, the waiver of co-pays required by the applicable Tricare regulations. The exchange of money to induce a patient's filling a prescription unquestionably constitutes \"remuneration\" under the Anti-Kickback Statute.

Several defendants argue that each prescription addressed a medical concern, and McFarland responds that the determination of medical necessity \"cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss.\" (Doc. 298 at 33) Although an order resolving a motion to dismiss must accept the truth of a well-pleaded allegation of fact, the order can (and must) dismiss a complaint that alleges insufficient facts to support a fraud claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

(same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   According to McFarland, the pharmacies billed Tricare for unnecessary ingredients added \"solely\" to extract more money from Tricare. But several allegations in McFarland's complaint appear to belie the conclusion that no medical need motivated the prescriptions. For example, McFarland alleges not that the multi-vitamin alleviates no medical need but rather that the efficacy of the multi-vitamin is \"highly doubtful.\" (Doc. 12 at \u00b6 115) And McFarland alleges that the pain cream is \"likely\" ineffective. (Doc. 12 at \u00b6 110) If a prescription sometimes serves a medical need, McFarland's allegation of falsity apparently relies on a patient's particular circumstances. Except for three examples in which a patient declines a prescription (Doc. 12 at \u00b6\u00b6 137-39), which examples permit an inference that defendants Anjum Qureshi, Jason Beck, and Lorraine De Blanche prescribed a medication that fulfilled no medical need for the particular patient, insufficient facts support the conclusion that each physician prescribed an unnecessary medication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Also, as several physicians and nurse practitioners observe, the complaint contains several conclusions masquerading as facts. For example, McFarland alleges that \"it is impossible that a mere telephone call ... could suffice to determine the medication needed to\" treat a scar (Doc. 12 at \u00b6 149), but the relator fails to allege why a doctor categorically cannot prescribe a scar cream after a telephone consultation. And the complaint conspicuously omits an allegation that a telephone consultation categorically precludes gathering sufficient information to prescribe a multi-vitamin or a pain cream. In short, McFarland appears to rely on a global and unreasonable inference that telemedicine amounts to a sham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Additionally, Physician Specialty Pharmacy argues (Doc. 241) that McFarland fails to identify a specific claim submitted by Physician Specialty Pharmacy. In response, McFarland argues that he\n   \"provided example[ ] after[ ]example of medically unnecessary prescriptions submitted by Defendants.\" (Doc. 298 at 23) McFarland identifies by amount, date, and prescription number fifty-one claims submitted by Florida Pharmacy Solutions and paid by Tricare. (Doc. 12 at \u00b6\u00b6 152-202) The allegations might state a claim against Florida Pharmacy Solutions, but no facts allege with particularity a false claim \"actually submitted\" by another pharmacy. In an action with more than one defendant, the complaint must \"inform each defendant of the nature of his alleged participation in the fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Ambrosia Coal &amp; Const. Co. v.

First, Rule 9(b) imposes on every fraud claim a particularity requirement and permits no \"relaxation\" for an insider. Although a person outside a billing department might \"have ... to work hard[er]\" than an insider to learn specific details about a fraud scheme, \"neither the Federal Rules [of Civil Procedure] nor the [False Claims] Act offer[s] any special leniency\" to a person who lacks access to specific information about the submission of fraudulent claims.\n   <em>\n    Clausen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9436836\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/1301/\">\n    290 F.3d at 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second,\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   purported to \"relax\" the pleading standard partly because the relator, who worked in the defendant's billing department, directly witnessed the submission of false claims. In contrast, McFarland works as a \"regional marketing representative\" for one of the seventy defendants in this action. Nothing in McFarland's complaint suggests personal knowledge, either inside or outside, that any defendant other than Florida Pharmacy Solutions actually submitted a false claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corsello v.

Rather than a specific intent to defraud the government, a showing of \"actual knowledge, deliberate ignorance, or reckless disregard\" satisfies the False Claims Act's scienter requirement.\n   <em>\n    Urquilla-Diaz v.

Several physicians and nurse practitioners argue that the complaint fails to allege adequately the \"knowing\" submission of a false claim. (E.g., Doc. 223 at 9) Although Rule 9(b) excludes scienter from the heightened pleading standard, Rule 8(a) remains applicable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    OmegaGenesis Corp. v.

As explained elsewhere, the practice of \"telemedicine\" by itself cannot establish a \"reckless disregard\" for the truth or falsity of a claim for reimbursement based on the telephonic consultation. Third, the complaint contains no mention of \"pre-filled\" scripts. Fourth and fifth, a physician's signing a blanket authorization to add an ingredient or to re-fill a prescription without the patient's or the physician's consent might amount to reckless disregard, but the complaint fails to identify a physician that signed an authorization. Rather, the complaint alleges that one defendant pharmacy, Florida Pharmacy Solutions, \"urges\" physicians to sign an authorization. (Doc. 12 at \u00b6 9) \"Urging\" a defendant to sign a document is not \"signing a document.\" McFarland declines to mention by name any physician or nurse practitioner who signed an authorization. In this circumstance, insufficient facts support each basis for knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Additionally, several defendants argue that the complaint fails to allege adequately a \"willful\" violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. For example, defendants Randy Mahon and Jeffrey Durgin argue that McFarland \"does not even bother to assert that the 'purpose' of either [ ] Defendant[ ] was to improperly induce referrals or services in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.\" (Doc. 288 at 7-8) To violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, a defendant must \"act with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The arguments by Ankle and Foot Centers of Georgia, De Novo Investing, Virtural Healthcare, Complete Health Care Concierge, and 1st Care MD about the public-disclosure bar and the lack of personal jurisdiction fail, but the complaint contains insufficient facts to satisfy either Rules 8(a), 9(b), or both.

Although Rule 9(b) requires a relator to allege specific facts about a kickback, for example, the amount and the day of the kickback, the complaint includes no details about the kickbacks. Also, the complaint lacks sufficient information about several defendants'\n   <em>\n    mens rea.\n   </em>\n   The claim in count III is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   against the movants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The allegations in McFarland's complaint and the statements in McFarland's opposition reveal that McFarland lacks both specific knowledge about the submission of a consultation claim and access to information about a physician's submission of a consultation claim. For example, McFarland admits \"no control over the Prescribing Telephone Defendants and no access to the record in the possession of the Prescribing Telephone Defendants.\" (Doc. 12 at \u00b6 246) Because McFarland's words evidence the futility of amending Count IV, McFarland may not amend the count.

Rule 9(b) imposed from the first day of the action to the present a particularity requirement, and McFarland undoubtedly recognizes the difficulty of alleging with particularity facts that evidence fraud by the seventy defendants. McFarland could have moved for leave to amend the complaint to allege specific facts about each defendant's purported fraud but declined to include more facts. Instead, McFarland's first amendment promiscuously added more defendants to an already tangled web. If the second amended complaint fails to state a claim against a defendant, a further order will not permit McFarland to amend the complaint a third time absent extraordinary circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   ORDERED in Tampa, Florida, on July 24, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Docs. 195, 204, 212, 215, 216, 223-27, 229-35, 239, 241-43, 248, 253, 266, 268, 275, 282, 288, and 291.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Ghassan Mosen, M.D., includes Rule 12(b)(5) in the caption of a motion (Doc. 215) to dismiss, but the motion contains no argument about insufficient service of process.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Correctly recognizing that a litigant's adopting the argument in another motion often sensibly reduces the volume of papers, Timothy Kwiatowski moves (Doc. 268 at 1) for leave to join Docs. 104 and 204.
