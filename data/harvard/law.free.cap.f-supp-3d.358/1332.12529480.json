DALTON JR., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case concerns horrific facts: the sexual assault of an eight-year-old boy by his fourteen-year-old male babysitter. (Doc. 2, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15, 20; Doc. 53-2, p. 49:6-10.) Defendant Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (\"\n   <strong>\n    MAA\n   </strong>\n   \") operates the apartment complex where the assault took place and where both minors resided with their families. (Doc. 2, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11-20.) Plaintiffs are the victim's parents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) At issue is whether MAA, as Plaintiffs' landlord, can be held liable for the assault because it knew that the babysitter sexually assaulted another minor tenant on the premises six months before and did nothing in response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-19, 31-37.) MAA moves for summary judgment against Plaintiffs, contending no duty to warn arose from the prior assault; and that even if a duty existed, Plaintiffs cannot establish causation. (Doc. 53, pp. 10-18 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Motion\n   </strong>\n   \").) Plaintiffs maintain that MAA had a duty to protect Plaintiffs from reasonably foreseeable criminal activity and disputed material facts remain that render summary judgment inappropriate. (Doc. 56, pp. 7-16.) On review, the Court finds that the Motion cannot be granted on this record, so the matter will proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Corbet and Kimberly Truog have been married since August 12, 2006. (Doc. 56-1, p. 7:19-25.) They have one son, B.T., born in 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:1-15.) In late 2013, Plaintiffs moved to Lake Mary, Florida - it was more convenient for Mr. Truog's commute to work and had a reputation of being very safe and great for families. (Doc. 53-1, p. 12:15-23.) They toured apartment complexes and one stood out: Colonial Grand at Heathrow (\"\n   <strong>\n    Colonial Grand\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:24-13:1.) As Mrs. Truog put it, \"it had a very homey nature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When taking a tour, they noticed children outside, which \"seemed better for B.T. to have friends as opposed other communities that [they] looked at that didn't look as kid-friendly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:1-6.) So they signed a lease at Colonial Grand on November 8, 2013 and moved in shortly after. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:1-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a community, Colonial Grand had a lot of children who would play together in the common areas and ride the bus to school - over thirty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:15-22; Doc. 56-1, p. 21:11-16.) Through these encounters, B.T. met A.O., his eventual assailant. (Doc. 56-1, pp. 21:20-22:1; Doc. 53-1, p. 15:15-25.) B.T. was around five or six at the time; A.O. was maybe twelve. (Doc. 56-1, pp. 22:2-4, 20-22.) Despite the age difference, they played together, growing \"fond of one another\" (Doc. 53-1, p. 16:7-19.) According to Mrs. Truog, A.O. was \"very respectful,\" leading her to be \"really impressed by [his] behavior\" and \"how pleasant he was.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:8, 18:24-19:9.) All in all, the Truogs \"just thought he was a normal kid.\" (Doc. 56-1, p. 23:23-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After A.O. got to know B.T., he asked Mrs. Truog if he could babysit B.T. (Doc. 53-1, p. 21:8-13.) She said no, based on his young age, but he kept asking her at least once a month for about a year to a year and a half. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:15-22:9; Doc. 56-1, p. 26:3-12.) Then, she relented. (Doc. 53-1, p. 22:10-17.) A.O. was fourteen; B.T. was eight. (Doc. 53-2, p. 25:5-13; 53-3, p. 20:16-17.) At that point, Mrs. Truog:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   had never seen anything from him that would make [her] feel that [her] son would be in danger. And so [she] thought, Kim, why are you giving him such a hard time, you know. He's definitely of age to be able to babysit. It's just one child; it's not multiple children, you've known him for ... a long time. Met his dad, you know, his sister, been neighbors for a long time, and he's always been very respectful and responsible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:7-17.) So she suggested to her husband they \"just go out for a brief evening alone, and that [A.O.] can earn some money.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:18-22.) They settled on dinner and a movie, close by if anything came up, the evening of January 23, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:23-33:4; Doc. 56-1, pp. 25:23-26:1.) Mrs. Truog made sure A.O. had his cell phone with him when he arrived, left a number for A.O. to reach her, and got pizza for the boys. (Doc. 53-1, pp. 33:8-20.) They left and heard nothing from A.O. until Mrs. Truog checked in after the movie. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:24-37:1, 39:11-13.) She texted him at 10:48 p.m. to say the movie was over and ask how everything was going. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:7-8.) He wrote back immediately, \"Good.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:9.) The Truogs arrived home shortly after. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:24-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On arriving home, Mrs. Truog found B.T. in his room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:24-41:10.) His face was red, and she could tell he had been crying. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:10.) A.O. was in the bathroom, either showering or having just showered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:2-6.) Immediately, Mrs. Truog knew something was off. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:6.) She and her husband asked B.T. what happened, but he \"seemed very hesitant to disclose what transpired because A.O. was still there.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:12-15.) A.O. then came out of the bathroom, and the Truogs asked him what happened. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:11-12.) A.O \"was very nervous,\" \"shaking,\" and \"knocked over\" a liter of soda. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:23-25.) They all began cleaning up the mess with towels, but Mrs. Truog sent A.O. home so they could talk to B.T. - at that point, the \"hair on the back of [her] neck was standing up, like something [was] really wrong.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:3-8.) She paid A.O., and he left. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mrs. Truog then immediately asked B.T. what happened. (Doc. 56-1, p. 34:10-19.) He told them: while he was taking a shower,\n   A.O. got in. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:20-21.) B.T. told A.O to get out. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:22.) A.O. got out; they got dressed and played a game of basketball in B.T.'s room - on A.O.'s suggestion, if someone missed a shot, he had to take off a piece of clothing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:22-25.) \"So they ended up naked again together.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:2.) From there, A.O. performed oral sex on B.T. and made B.T. reciprocate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:15-18.) A.O. then attempted anal sex on B.T. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:19-36:5.) B.T. vomited in his room and cried. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:6-12.) A.O. told B.T. that if he told anyone, A.O. would punch him in the face. (Doc. 53-1, pp. 42:20-43:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On hearing this, Mrs. Truog texted A.O. at 11:09 p.m., \"B.T. said you took a shower here.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:24-25.) He responded at 11:11 p.m., \"Yeah, I just had to rinse the gel out of my hair. It was making me itch.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39:3-5.) At 11:12 p.m. he said, \"Thanks for having me over.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39:5-6.) Mr. Truog then called A.O. and asked him to come back to their apartment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43:11-44:2.) A.O. said, \"Okay\" and came back within minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:4-6.) Mrs. Truog told A.O. that B.T. told her what \"physically had transpired\" and that she would take B.T. to the hospital \"to check to see if something like that transpired.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:5-13.) She asked A.O. if the hospital would find anything, and he responded, \"They might.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) So initially \"he denied it,\" but then \"he admitted to what he had done\" - \"he agreed there was oral and attempted anal.\" (Doc. 56-1, p. 40:2-3, 10-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Truog called 9-1-1. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:9.) Two police officers came and asked A.O. to step outside. (Doc. 53-1, pp. 45:10-46:2.) Meanwhile, A.O.'s mother wondered what was taking A.O. so long to come back, so she walked over to the Truogs' apartment. (Doc. 53-3, p. 21:1-5.) She met a police officer outside with A.O. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 53-1, p. 46:3-7.) Nothing happened with A.O. that night, he went home with his mother. (Doc. 56-1, p. 41:9-10.) But the Truogs, on suggestion from one officer, drove B.T. to Kids House in Sanford, a children's advocacy center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:1-7; Doc. 53-2, p. 5:21-22.) There, a Child Protection Team Case Coordinator, Eunice Carasas-McIntosh, conducted a forensic interview of B.T. (Doc. 56-1, p. 46:18-23; Doc. 53-2, pp. 7:20-24, 12:2-13:13.) The interview lasted \"through the night\" (Doc. 56-1, p. 47:1), resulting in \"verified findings of child-on-child sexual abuse\" (Doc. 53-2, p. 19:4-6). The Truogs then went home. (Doc. 56-1, p. 47:2-4; Doc. 53-1, p. 61:18-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Two days later, at school on Monday, A.O. was interviewed by law enforcement officers and arrested. (Doc. 53-3, pp. 24:18-20, 26:1-27:1.) Ultimately, A.O. pleaded guilty to sexual battery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:2.) He was placed on probation for three years and ordered to complete counseling, community service, and a court-ordered program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:14-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the aftermath, the Truogs notified Colonial Grand about the assault and their intention to leave the apartment complex. (Doc. 53-1, p. 47:9-20.) They attempted to piece their lives back together, looking for a new place to live and putting B.T. in therapy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-55;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 56-2 (deposition of Dr. Richard Stout).) And Mrs. Truog discovered that in June 2015 - six months before A.O. assaulted B.T. - A.O. sexually assaulted C.S., a thirteen or fourteen-year-old girl who formerly resided at Colonial Grand. (Doc. 53-5, pp. 12:4-6, 16:12-13; Doc. 53-6, pp. 22:25-23:2.) Similar to A.O.'s relationship with B.T., A.O. and C.S. \"were really good friends\" before the assault. (Doc. 53-5, p. 10:4-5.) One day, they had been playing outside with some other kids visiting C.S.'s family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:20-14:5.) At some point, A.O. and C.S. were alone, and A.O. got \"touchy feely\" with C.S., moving \"closer\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   to her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:6-12.) C.S. asked him what he was doing; he responded that he had \"wanted this for a long time now\"; she said she didn't \"feel that way.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:13-15.) A.O. then \"grabbed [C.S.'s] hands\" to where \"[she] couldn't do anything.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:18-20.) He grabbed her face and pulled her toward him, attempting to kiss her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:20-22, 25:4-7.) They struggled, with C.S. telling him to stop and attempting to get away. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:25-25:7.) Eventually she pushed him in the stomach and escaped. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:21-30:3.) She collected the other kids and went home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:4-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   C.S. told her parents what happened. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:12-15.) Her mother, Jaclyn Smartt, went to A.O.'s apartment and knocked on the door for fifteen minutes. (Doc. 53-6, p. 24:11-14.) No one answered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) So Mrs. Smartt told her daughter to stay away from A.O. at the bus stop the next day and tried tracking A.O.'s parents down. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:20-25:6.) She then heard from another mom that A.O. had been telling kids what happened but turned it around, saying \"that C.S. was being forcible to A.O.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:11-16.) On hearing this, Mrs. Smartt talked to A.O. directly, as again his parents weren't home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:18-20.) He first denied any attempt to place the blame on C.S. but eventually admitted, \"You're right. I'm wrong. I did this. I apologize.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:20-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mrs. Smartt also reported the assault to Colonial Grand's manager, Pamela Albert. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:20-11:8.) As Mrs. Smartt recounts,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   I went in there and told her that we needed to speak about something that was pretty important. She shut the door. I sat down in front of her, and I explained to her what had happened at the park the day before and that I had reached out or attempted to reach out to A.O.'s parents but no success. I explained to her that there was - it had been explained to me a couple of years prior that A.O. was to be watched and he wasn't to be trusted because he had tried to assault a little boy. A.O. was a big part of our lives. He was my daughter's best friend for a number of years. I tried to take that and leave it back, but I explained to her that, you know, he did this to my daughter and she - she was scared. She was crying, like, shaking scared. And Pam just kind of sat there and was like, Oh, my God, you know, that's horrible. But at no point was she taking notes, was she - and I had her turn around to see the apartment in which I was talking about because you could see his apartment from her window and I told her it was that one on the corner on the bottom and she said, That's the Owens. And I said, Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:11-14:5.) On telling Pamela Albert \"what he did to [her] daughter\" and \"what [she] had heard about his previous crime that he had committed,\" Mrs. Smartt asked Pamela \"to deal with it appropriately, to reach out to the parents or to tell [her] what [she] can do.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:18-28:9.) That same day, on her way to the office, Mrs. Smartt also told a police officer about the assault; she spotted him driving around the community. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26:13-21, 31:11-18.) He apparently told her she could do nothing because C.S. got away. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26:17-21, 27:9-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Smartts moved out of Colonial Grand within days of the assault. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:19-21.) Mrs. Smartt has heard nothing from Pamela Albert since. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:7-10.) But Mrs. Smartt has spoken to Mrs. Truog, as a mutual friend connected them after hearing that A.O. assaulted B.T. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:1-18:3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 53-1, pp. 22:18-27:5.) Mrs. Smartt told Mrs. Truog that A.O. assaulted C.S., that she spoke with a police officer, and that she went to Colonial\n   Grand's office and \"spoke with Pam about the specifics of what transpired.\" (Doc. 53-1, pp. 25:8-26:14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Pamela Albert never contacted A.O.'s parents to tell them he assaulted C.S. (Doc. 53-3, pp. 14:23-25 (A.O's mother's deposition); Doc. 53-4, p. 12:17-22 (A.O's father's deposition).) According to A.O.'s parents, had they known, they would not have let A.O. babysit B.T. (Doc. 53-3, p. 32:9-14; Doc. 53-4, p. 32:6-13.) Indeed, Pamela Albert vehemently denies that Mrs. Smartt ever told her about the sexual assault. (Doc. 53-7, pp. 23:5-25:23, 29:9-13.) C.S.'s assault took place in June 2015 - six months before A.O. assaulted B.T. (Doc. 53-6, pp. 22:25-23:1; Doc. 56-1, pp. 25:23-26:1.) According to MAA's expert, the \"minimum\" appropriate response by the property manager would have been \"an attempt to contact the Owens parents and bring them in\" and \"hand [Mrs. Smartt] the phone and say call the cops right now.\" (Doc. 53-8, pp. 31:23-33:9; see\n   <em>\n    also id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:8-19.) In addition, the property manager could have posted a generic notice there had been reports of inappropriate behavior at the playground with a warning for parents to watch their children, revealing no specific information about A.O. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:20-36:7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Truogs sued MAA for negligent failure to warn, specifically based on MAA's duty as landlord to protect its residents from reasonably foreseeable criminal conduct where it knew of prior similar criminal conduct on the premises. (Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 31-37.) MAA has moved for summary judgment. (Doc. 53.) Briefing complete (Docs. 56, 57), the Motion is ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   MAA seeks summary judgment on two separate grounds. (Doc. 53.) First, MAA claims that no duty arose because it lacked knowledge of the prior assault by A.O. based on Pamela Albert's testimony that Mrs. Smartt never reported it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Yet, assuming that Mrs. Smartt reported the assault to Pamela Albert, MAA claims that her report created no duty on MAA to take any action, as the underlying conduct was neither similar to A.O.'s assault of B.T. nor criminal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-14; Doc. 57, pp. 2-3.) Second, MAA argues that Plaintiffs' causation arguments fail because they impute liability by stacking inferences. (Doc. 53, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) The Court starts and ends its analysis with the first issue: whether, for summary judgment purposes, the facts in Plaintiffs' best light establish a duty on MAA's part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   There are four elements to negligence under Florida law: (1) a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) breach of that duty by the defendant; (3) an injury to the plaintiff legally caused by the defendant's breach; and (4) damages resulting from the injury.\n   <em>\n    Paterson v.

That Mrs. Smartt testified about this report means that Plaintiffs \"have presented evidence that [MAA] had actual or constructive knowledge of the prior assault of [C.S.].\"\n   <em>\n    T.W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931738\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/908/499/#p504\">\n    908 So.2d at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"Because of [MAA's] knowledge that some sort of sexual assault had occurred against [C.S] on its premises\" by A.O. and its \"landlord-tenant relationship with [Plaintiffs], it had a duty to protect against the foreseeable acts of [A.O.] within the course of that special relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931738\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/908/499/#p504\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And like\n   <em>\n    T.W.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lambert\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that MAA's \"duty encompassed warning.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931738\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/908/499/#p504\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 506 ;\n   <em>\n    Lambert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7630148,7630229\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/453/844/\">\n    453 So.2d at 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As MAA's expert expounded, a sufficient warning here would have included notifying A.O.'s parents and handing the phone to Mrs. Smartt to call the police. (Doc. 53-8, pp. 31:23-33:9.) Beyond this, MAA could have posted a generic notice warning parents of inappropriate behavior at the playground without identifying A.O. specifically. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:20-36:7.) Either way, MAA's knowledge that A.O. assaulted C.S. \"was sufficient for a reasonable apartment complex to recognize that its tenants would be exposed to risk if not warned.\"\n   <em>\n    T.W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931738\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/908/499/#p504\">\n    908 So.2d at 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
