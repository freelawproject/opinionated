Conner, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Press and Journal, Inc. (\"plaintiff\") filed this action alleging First Amendment violations by defendant Borough of Middletown (the \"Borough\"). The Borough moved to dismiss plaintiff's claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b). (Doc. 12). We will deny the Borough's motion to the extent it is grounded in Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background &amp; Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is an independent member of the private press that publishes the\n   <em>\n    Middletown Press &amp; Journal\n   </em>\n   (the \"Journal\"), a newspaper of general circulation in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 11). According to plaintiff, for over 100 years the Borough has advertised in the Journal, placing notices for meetings of Borough council and the local zoning hearing board, advertisements for public events like hydrant flushing and leaf collection, and \"other notices required by law to be published in a newspaper of general circulation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 13). In the ten-year period from June 2008 to May 2018, the Borough allegedly ran 207 such legal advertisements in the Journal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Borough \"abruptly\" ended all advertising with the Journal in June 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14). When plaintiff inquired why the Borough was no longer advertising in the Journal, the Borough responded with a letter, signed by the mayor and six of the Borough's seven council members, dated July 17, 2018 (the \"July 2018 Letter\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 23). The July 2018 Letter provided the following explanation for the Borough ending its advertising relationship with plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   This decision was arrived at through discussion of a number topics that we feel have been detrimental to the efforts and initiatives of the Borough, including articles and editorials published in the Press and Journal over the past year. The topics covered include the Elks Theater, National Night Out, Police discipline, local campaign coverage\n   and the Press and Journal's attempts to help finance select campaigns, Borough ordinances affecting student housing, and the Borough's litigation against Suez and McNees, Wallace &amp; Nurick. Through these disheartening and demoralizing instances of distasteful sensationalism, misrepresentation of information and statements, unfounded speculation, questionable sourcing and observable bias, we feel that the Press and Journal is not entirely committed to presenting the news of our community with an acceptable amount of impartiality or accuracy of facts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (Doc. 1-2). The letter further stated that \"[s]hould the Press and Journal demonstrate reliability to professionally and responsibly report on actions and statements of Borough Council and Management, as well critiquing us from a founded and balanced position, we will be happy to patron your newspaper again.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before commencing litigation, plaintiff's legal representative attended a public Borough council meeting in September 2018. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 34). At that meeting, plaintiff's attorney read from a letter addressed to the mayor and council members indicating that plaintiff believed the Borough's actions were unconstitutional infringements of its First Amendment rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35). The letter requested that the Borough \"correct the unconstitutional action\" it had taken and \"enter into talks to remediate the [Borough's] wrongdoing.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 3). Plaintiff's attorney then provided the mayor and all council members present with a copy of the letter, which the mayor purportedly \"ripped ... in half and threw the pieces on the Council table.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 37-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following month, plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit seeking injunctive relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff accuses the Borough of the following violations of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution: viewpoint discrimination in contravention of the right to free speech and free press (Count I); content discrimination in violation of the right to free speech and free press (Count II); and violation of the right to freedom of association (Count III). The Borough moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b), claiming lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Due to outstanding factual issues underlying the Rule 12(b)(1) challenge, the court instructed the parties to complete their briefing only with respect to the Rule 12(b)(6) matter, which is now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for the dismissal of complaints that fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). When ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must \"accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

According to the Borough, there must be a contract or some\n   <em>\n    guarantee\n   </em>\n   of \"future business\" to establish a preexisting commercial relationship. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 25 at 3-9). The Borough contends that plaintiff had no \"actual contract\" that was terminated like in\n   <em>\n    Umbehr\n   </em>\n   , nor was plaintiff on an \"officially designated rotation list\" that would \"assure[ ] additional government work\" as in\n   <em>\n    O'Hare\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). Plaintiff instead only had \"discrete, individual transactions\" with \"no promise of future purchases,\" which the Borough maintains is insufficient to qualify for First Amendment protection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We find the Borough's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Umbehr\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    O'Hare\n   </em>\n   too narrow. The critical distinction set out in\n   <em>\n    Umbehr\n   </em>\n   was the independent contractor who had a \"pre-existing commercial relationship\" with a governmental entity versus mere \"bidders or applicants for new government contracts\" who had no such prior relationship. \"Pre-existing commercial relationship,\" however, does not require factual circumstances identical to\n   <em>\n    Umbehr\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    O'Hare\n   </em>\n   , or, as the Borough argues, some guarantee of future purchases. We believe the concept is broad enough to include the instant situation, to wit: an independent contractor which has a longstanding, ongoing business relationship with a governmental entity for services of a regular and similar nature, and, \"based on that longstanding practice, had reason to believe [it] would continue.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Hare\n   </em>\n   , 518 U.S. at 721,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730066\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/712/#p725\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Third Circuit Court of Appeals' opinion in\n   <em>\n    McClintock v.

The court emphasized that the contract in question, which the contractors claimed was unconstitutionally denied, was for an entirely new project concerning different subject matter that was\n   <em>\n    unrelated\n   </em>\n   to the contractors' prior business dealings with the governmental entity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11767726\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/812/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11767726\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/812/\">\n    at 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This distinction was integral to the court's conclusion that, with respect to the denied contract, the case did not concern \"the termination of a pre-existing commercial relationship with the government\" but instead involved a \"suit by a bidder or applicant for a new government contract who cannot rely on such a relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11767726\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/812/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (brackets omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Umbehr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730211\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/668/#p673\">\n    518 U.S. at 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730211\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/668/#p673\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The facts as pled in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   are entirely distinguishable from those in\n   <em>\n    McClintock\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiff avers that it has maintained an active and ongoing business relationship with the Borough for over a century related to publishing legal notices and advertisements of public concern. In the preceding ten years alone, plaintiff alleges that the Borough placed no less than 207 such notices and advertisements in the Journal. Moreover, these are the exact same type of notices and advertisements that the Borough will no longer place, purportedly due to plaintiff's speech and association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   There is no formal contract alleged between the parties for these services, but an actual contract is not required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Hare\n   </em>\n   , 518 U.S. at 715-16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730066\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/712/#p725\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prisma Zona Exploratoria de Puerto Rico, Inc. v.

We likewise reject the Borough's argument that some \"future business\" or \"purchase\" must be guaranteed. After all, in\n   <em>\n    Umbehr\n   </em>\n   , the independent contractor had no guarantee of future business-the municipalities could opt out of the annual contract and the county could choose not to renew it.\n   <em>\n    Umbehr\n   </em>\n   , 518 U.S. at 671,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730211\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/668/#p673\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The crux of the holding in\n   <em>\n    Umbehr\n   </em>\n   was that the independent contractor's annual trash-hauling agreement-its preexisting commercial relationship of six years-could not be ended (by nonrenewal) for\n   <em>\n    unconstitutional\n   </em>\n   reasons.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730211\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/668/#p673\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730211\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/668/#p673\">\n    at 674, 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730211\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/668/#p673\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Hare\n   </em>\n   , 518 U.S. at 720-21, 725,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730066\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/712/#p725\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
