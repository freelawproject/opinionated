BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jamal is a citizen of Somalia who fled to the United States in 2001. ECF No. 1 at 5; ECF No. 8-1 at 2-3. Jamal was granted asylum and then later was granted status as a lawful permanent resident (\"LPR\"). ECF No. 8-1 at 3. In 2015, Jamal was convicted of wire fraud and sentenced to eight months in prison. ECF No. 11 at 2. After being released from prison, Jamal fled to Canada, ECF No. 1 at 9; ECF No. 11 at 2, but Canada forced him to return to\n   the United States, ECF No. 8-1 at 2. When Jamal tried to reenter the United States on June 6, 2017, ICE detained him and initiated removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 8-1 at 1-4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a general matter, an LPR who leaves the United States and then tries to reenter the country-like an American citizen who leaves the country and then returns-is \"not ... regarded as seeking an admission into the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(13)(C). But LPRs such as Jamal who commit crimes of moral turpitude before leaving the United States are treated as arriving aliens when they attempt to reenter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   An arriving alien who is not \"clearly and beyond a doubt\" entitled to admission must be detained pending removal proceedings. \u00a7 1225(b)(2)(A). Under these provisions, then, Jamal's detention was mandatory, as he was an arriving alien who did not \"clearly and beyond a doubt\" qualify for admission into the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 8-1 at 2; ECF No. 8-2 at 1;\n   <em>\n    Jennings v.

His habeas petition includes claims under \u00a7 1225(b), the Fourth Amendment, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Court dismisses the statutory and Fourth Amendment claims,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   but grants relief on the Due Process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II. MERITS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties agree that the Due Process Clause places some limitation on detention under \u00a7 1225(b)(2)(a),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14 at 4, but the parties disagree about the scope of that limitation. Much of the parties' briefing focuses on whether arriving aliens detained under \u00a7 1225(b)(2)(A) are entitled to less protection under the Due Process Clause than criminal aliens detained under \u00a7 1226(c). The government argues that aliens detained under \u00a7 1225(b)(2)(A) should receive less protection because they are treated as though they are being detained outside the United States by virtue of the \"entry fiction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14 at 2-7. Jamal argues that the two categories of detained aliens should\n   receive identical protection. ECF No. 12 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court is inclined to agree with the government that arriving aliens detained under \u00a7 1225(b)(2)(A) receive less robust due-process protection than criminal aliens detained under \u00a7 1226(c). \"The distinction between an alien who has effected an entry into the United States and one who has never entered runs throughout immigration law.\"\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas v.

July 5, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   That said, it is not clear what, if anything, turns on this dispute, at least as a practical matter. In theory, if aliens detained under \u00a7 1225(b)(2)(A) receive less protection under the Due Process Clause than aliens detained under \u00a7 1226(c), then the former can be detained somewhat longer than the latter.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 (arriving aliens detained at the border have \"no right of entry into this country\" and thus \"may be held for a greater length of time before [their] continued detention raises Due Process concerns\"). But everyone seems to agree that, under the Due Process Clause, neither group of aliens can be detained indefinitely (at least without some kind of showing that they are likely to flee or harm the community). And in deciding whether an alien's continued detention would violate the Due Process Clause, most courts seem to apply pretty much the same factors-regardless of whether the court agrees that aliens detained under \u00a7 1225(b)(2)(A) receive less protection than aliens detained under other provisions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brissett v.

These factors include (1) the total length of detention to date; (2) the likely duration of future detention; (3) the conditions\n   of detention; (4) delays in the removal proceedings caused by the detainee; (5) delays in the removal proceedings caused by the government; and (6) the likelihood that the removal proceedings will result in a final order of removal.\n   <em>\n    Muse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204466052\">\n    2018 WL 4466052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Most of these factors weigh in favor of granting relief to Jamal:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , courts consider the length of detention. How long detention has lasted \"is critical to the due-process inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.

In November 2017, an IJ granted Jamal deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\") on the basis of his clan affiliation. ECF No. 8-4 at 2, 8-13. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") reversed the IJ's decision in June 2018, finding that Jamal was not entitled to CAT relief on the basis of his clan affiliation, but remanding the case to the IJ to determine whether Jamal was entitled to relief on another basis. ECF No. 8-5 at 1 (notice of appeal); ECF No. 10-1 at 2-5 (BIA ruling). Jamal was scheduled to have a follow-up hearing before an IJ in September 2018. The Court has not been informed whether that hearing took place, but, if the IJ denies relief, Jamal will almost surely appeal the IJ's decision to the BIA. ECF No. 13 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Notably, immigration courts have been struggling to keep pace with the high volume of removal proceedings-and that was before many of those courts were shuttered by the ongoing government shutdown.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v.

Given this backlog, given Jamal's right to appeal an adverse decision of the IJ to the BIA, and given Jamal's right to ask the Eighth Circuit to review an adverse decision of the BIA, Jamal might well be detained for two years or longer before he gets a final decision regarding his removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , courts consider the conditions of the alien's detention.

This factor does not weigh in favor of either party because the Court does not have sufficient information to determine whether Jamal is likely to be removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In sum, four of these six factors weigh (two strongly) in favor granting relief, one weighs against granting relief, and one is neutral. Accordingly, the Court holds that continuing to detain Jamal without giving him a bond hearing would violate his rights under the Due Process Clause. The Court will order that an IJ conduct a bond hearing at which \"the parties must be allowed to present evidence and argument about whether [Jamal] is a danger to the community and whether [Jamal] is likely to flee if he is not detained.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ORDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and on all of the files, records, and proceedings herein, the Court SUSTAINS Jamal's objection [ECF No. 12] and DECLINES TO ADOPT the R &amp; R [ECF No. 11].
