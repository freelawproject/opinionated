History of the Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Charles Byrd, a Helena-West Helena police officer, arrested Green on Friday, June 28, 2013, shortly before 8:00 p.m. On the next day, a City officer swore an affidavit of probable cause and obtained an arrest warrant. Green was transported to the Ashley County jail. He did not receive a first appearance before Monday, July 1. The parties dispute whether he received a first appearance on Monday at all, but the City says that Judge Reid Harrod, an Ashley County District Court judge, presided\n   over Green's first appearance on Monday. After several months, the charges were dismissed and Green was released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Green sued Charles Byrd in his individual capacity and official capacity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Helena-West Helena is located in Phillips County. Green also sued the Phillips County Sheriff in his official capacity. He claimed among other things that his constitutional right to a timely first appearance was violated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Green also initially asserted a claim that he was arrested without probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Document # 16 at 2-3. He has now abandoned that claim. The City argued and provided evidence that Helena-West Helena officers arrested Green based on probable cause,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Document # 84 at 7-8, but Green did not respond to that argument. Any probable-cause claim is therefore waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Denson v. Steak 'n Shake, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519427\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/910/368/\">\n    910 F.3d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369 n.2 (E.D. Mo. 2018) (\"Denson did not respond to Steak 'n Shake's arguments in support of summary judgment on the retaliation claim, and the district court correctly deemed the claim waived.\"). Remaining is Green's \u00a7 1983 claim that Charles Byrd, in his official capacity, violated Green's constitutional right to a timely first appearance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The City conceded for years that Green did not have a first appearance hearing. That concession was made not only in this case but also in a previous class action in which Green opted out of a class comprised in relevant part by \"[a]ll those arrested in Phillips County, Arkansas between 9 October 2012 and 10 November 2016 who did not receive a Rule 8 appearance within seventy-two hours of arrest[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Document # 16 at 1;\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Byrd\n   </em>\n   , 2:15-cv-00095-DPM, Document # 54 (E.D. Ark. Nov. 10, 2016). In preparing for trial in this case, however, the City's lawyers uncovered, for the first time, in the Ashley County records, a \"Record of First Judicial Appearance\" for Green.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Documents # 60 and # 61. This document records that Green received a first appearance before Ashley County District Court Judge Reid Harrod on July 1, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Document # 61-3. Both Judge Harrod's and Green's signatures appear on the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Cross Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The City contends, among other things, that the record shows that Green received a first appearance on Monday, July 1, 2013, within three days of his Friday evening arrest. Document # 85 at \u00b6\u00b6 18-13. The City argues that, as a matter of law, the delay from Friday evening to Monday did not violate Green's rights. Green asserts that he did not receive a first appearance that Monday. He also contends that, even if he did have a first appearance, Judge Harrod had no jurisdiction to conduct\n   it because Judge Harrod is an Ashley County District Court judge whereas Green was arrested and charged in Phillips County. Green argues, therefore, that the first appearance was void. Finally, Green maintains that the City should be estopped from now contending that he received a first appearance when it has previously conceded that he did not have one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether Green's Affidavit Creates a Genuine Dispute of Fact as to Whether He Received a First Appearance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For purposes of his own motion for summary judgment, Green concedes he saw Judge Harrod in Ashley County. In response to the City's motion, however, he contends that even if jurisdiction existed, \"there is still a genuine issue of material fact because the Plaintiff swears he did not see Judge Harrod,\" and he provides an affidavit to that effect. Documents # 98 at 1-2 and # 98-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As noted above, City police officers arrested Green on Friday, June 28, 2013, shortly before 8:00 p.m. Document # 85-1. On the following day a City officer swore an affidavit of probable cause, which a judge signed. Document # 85-2. Warrants for Green's arrest were issued. Document # 85-3. On that same day-Saturday, June 29th-Green was transported to the Ashley County jail. Document # 85-5. All of these facts are undisputed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Document # 99 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The City further says, and provides evidence, that on Monday, July 1, the City asked Judge Harrod to perform a first appearance for Green. Document # 85-6. It made the request via a fax, date-stamped July 1, 2013, sent from the Helena-West Helena Police Department to Judge Harrod.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519427\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/910/368/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Documents included in the fax are a June 29 probable cause affidavit and warrants for Green's arrest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-18. Also included is a blank \"Record of First Judicial Appearance\" for \"Deandre Green.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The City further provides documentary evidence that Green was transported to court on Monday, July 1, around 7:00 a.m. Document # 85-5 at 1. Finally, the City has produced a completed \"Record of First Judicial Appearance\" dated July 1, showing that Green received a first appearance that day. Document # 85-7. This document states that \"the above named Defendant did appear before\" Judge Harrod, and names \"Deandre Green\" as the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Both Judge Harrod's and Green's signatures appear on the form. Judge Harrod attests that the signature is his and that the document reflects that Green received a first appearance before him on July 1, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Green does not dispute that the defendant's signature is his. The record also lists various information that Green was given, including his right to counsel; further, the name of a lawyer that Green \"will retain\" is handwritten on the form.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Green's contrary proof consists of his affidavit in which he swears that he \"did not receive a first appearance before a judge.\" Document # 98-2. He does state, however, that he \"recall[s] being presented with paperwork at the jail to sign.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He does not explain what paperwork he signed, nor does he state that he was confused about what he was signing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The first issue is whether Green's affidavit creates a genuine dispute as to whether he received a first appearance before Judge Harrod on July 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"The presumption of regularity supports the official acts of public officers, and, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Cooper v.

Most important, the July 1 \"Record of First Judicial Appearance\" for Green shows that he appeared before Judge Harrod on that day. Judge Harrod has sworn that his signature appears on the form. Green's signature appears on it as well. Although Green has not expressly admitted that he signed the form, he has not denied that he signed it. Nor does he say or provide any evidence that he was confused about what he was signing. The Court therefore takes as undisputed that Green signed the form. Thus, not only does Green's recent affidavit contradict a court record entitled to a presumption of regularity, it also contradicts Green's own prior affirmation of that court record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bonvillain v.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). But not always.
