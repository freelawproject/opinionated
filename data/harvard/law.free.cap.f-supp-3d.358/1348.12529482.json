Sneed on December 14, 2018 (Doc. 27). In the Report and Recommendation, Magistrate Judge Sneed recommends that the Court deny Defendants' Motion to Stay Proceedings and to Establish Procedure to Determine Amount of Attorneys' Fees (the \"Motion\") (Doc. 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   All parties were furnished copies of the Report and Recommendation and were afforded the opportunity to file objections under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Defendants filed their Objection (Doc. 29), to which Plaintiff responded (Doc. 32). Upon consideration of the Report and Recommendation, and upon this Court's independent examination of the file, it is determined that the Objection should be overruled, the Report and Recommendation should be adopted and the Motion denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff, Michael W. Kenny obtained a position with Defendant Critical Intervention Services, Inc. (\"CIS\") as an armed protection officer. Kenny signed a non-compete agreement which purported to restrict him from working for, or engaging in, any business that competes with CIS or any of its affiliates. Kenny also completed a 70-hour unpaid training course at Safety &amp; Intelligence Institute, Inc., one of CIS' affiliates. Kenny brings this case alleging a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (the \"FLSA\") to pursue compensation for his time spent in the training course.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shortly after Kenny filed the Complaint, Defendants' counsel contacted Kenny's attorney to negotiate a settlement. Several phone calls and emails ensued. Ultimately, Defendants sent Kenny's attorney a letter with certified checks for full tender of Kenny's statutory damages under the FLSA, less attorneys' fees. They offered $ 6,000 in attorneys' fees to resolve the entire case. Kenny counteroffered with $ 15,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   It is Defendants' position that Kenny's claim is now either moot or concluded or both, and all that remains is the issue of his entitlement to and the amount of attorneys' fees. Defendants insist that the Court may stay the case on all issues except the attorneys' fees and establish a procedure to determine the reasonableness of Kenny's attorneys' fees. Doc. 17 at 6. Kenny argues that prior to the Court evaluating his entitlement to and the reasonableness of his attorneys' fees, he must first obtain a judgment, consent decree, or settlement approved by the Court; none of which has occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

But they argue that it, and other cases like it, differ because here they agree that Kenny is entitled to fees and costs. Doc. 28 at 4. The issue, as Defendants put it, is a \"fundamental unfairness\" which gives Kenny's attorney \"improper leverage\" to impede resolution of the FLSA claim by litigating the issue of fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.

Doc. 29 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Kenny's response primarily reargues his opposition to the Motion. But he clarifies that he has since returned the tendered checks to Defendants. Ultimately, Kenny states that Defendants' attempt at absolving themselves of liability by tendering the statutory fees cannot entitle him to attorneys' fees, and consequently, the Court cannot determine the reasonableness of the fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court agrees with Kenny's position and the magistrate judge's recommendation. Despite continually insisting that the Court should implement a procedure to\n   determine the reasonableness of the attorneys' fees, Defendants point to no authority justifying the Court's determination of the reasonableness of attorneys' fees absent judgment, settlement with a consent decree, or its functional equivalent. Defendants discuss an offer of judgment as an example of a \"functional equivalent\" which triggers the Court's authority to determine the reasonableness\n   of the fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 29 at 7. Yet, they made no such offer to Kenny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 32 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The case law is clear, a triggering event must establish plaintiff as the prevailing party before the Court can assess the reasonableness of the attorneys' fees. The fact that the liability issue may be moot does not mean that the Court can now\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   decide reasonableness. The triggering mechanism is a judgment, settlement including a consent decree, or its functional equivalent; none of which appears in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court has reviewed the Magistrate Judge's R &amp; R\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and accepts the recommended disposition. The R &amp; R appropriately reviewed the law on this subject under the correct standard and concluded that no basis for the Court's determination of the reasonableness of attorneys' fees at this time exists.

Defendants argue in part that their tender to Plaintiff of a check \"in the amount of all claimed FLSA unpaid wages damages, statutory damages, and costs\" should make the issue of attorneys' fees ripe for the Court's determination. (Dkt. 17 \u00b6 18.) But a review of Plaintiff's Complaint shows that his demand for relief includes damages for unpaid wages, liquidated damages,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   \"Plaintiff's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs and expenses of this litigation pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\" (Dkt. 7.) Further, Plaintiff has not accepted Defendants' tender offer. (Dkt. 21 at 5.) Without either a judgment or a settlement agreement enforced through a consent decree (or its functional equivalent), this Court has no basis to review the reasonableness of an FLSA plaintiff's attorneys' fees. The Court therefore recommends that Defendants' Motion to Stay Proceedings and to Establish Procedure to Determine Amount of Attorneys' Fees be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Accordingly, it is\n   <strong>\n    RECOMMENDED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' Motion to Stay Proceedings and to Establish Procedure to Determine Amount of Attorneys' Fees (Dkt. 17) be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO REPORTED\n   </strong>\n   in Tampa, Florida, on December 14, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     NOTICE TO PARTIES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   A party has fourteen days from this date to file written objections to the Report and Recommendation's factual findings and legal conclusions.
