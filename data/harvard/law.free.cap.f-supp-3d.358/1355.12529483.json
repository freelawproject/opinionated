For simplicity and fairness, arbitration will be conducted on an individual basis in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's rules for consumer arbitration. By signing this agreement, you acknowledge and agree that you, Planet Fitness, and PF Corporate are each waving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class action, either in court or in arbitration. This Dispute Resolution provision shall apply to this contract unless, within thirty (30) days of signing this contract, you notify Planet Fitness in writing that you reject this provision.
