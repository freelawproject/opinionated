Declaration of Luis Castillo in Support of Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration (\"Castillo Decl.\") \u00b6 14; Crum Decl., Ex. B (Promissory Note).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Franchise Agreement contains a section entitled \"Dispute Resolution\" that provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    XXII. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties to this Agreement recognize that compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the nature of the Franchisor/Franchisee relationship may give rise to the need to resolve disputes between the parties. Both Franchisee and Franchisor wish to avoid the time, expense and disruption that can result from lawsuits, but they desire to have a method of resolving disputes that is mutually acceptable. For this purpose, the parties expressly agree first to resolve disputes by direct negotiation with each other. If such negotiations fail to reach an agreement, the party dissatisfied with the outcome of negotiations must submit the dispute, within 180 days, to mediation and/or arbitration under this Section XXII, as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Mediation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : Before, and as a necessary condition precedent to, filing a demand for arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, Franchisee and Franchisor shall attempt to settle the dispute through mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") at its office closest in proximity to Franchisor's office in accordance with the Commercial Mediation Rules of the AAA. The filing fee for the proceeding shall be borne by the initiating party. The mediator's compensation and any administrative costs shall be borne equally by both parties. If Franchisee and Franchisor arrive at an agreement through mediation, then that agreement shall be set forth in writing and be binding upon both parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Arbitration\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n   All disputes, controversies, and claims of any kind arising between the parties, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the rights and obligations of the parties, the sale of the franchise, or other claims or causes of action relating to the performance of either party that are unable to be settled through mediation shall be settled by arbitration administered by the AAA at its office closest in proximity to the Franchisor's office, in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Rules of the AAA unless the parties otherwise agree in accordance with Section XXII.C of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1. This Section XXII.B shall survive expiration, non-renewal or termination of this Agreement for any reason.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2. The filing fee for the proceeding shall be borne by the initiating party. The arbitrator's compensation and any administrative costs shall be borne equally by both parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   3. Either party shall have the right to seek a court order granting injunctive relief where such relief is necessary in order to provide protection on a temporary or preliminary basis while the arbitration process is pursued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   4. The parties expressly agree that an arbitrator shall have the power to enter an award, including injunctive relief, protecting its rights to the same extent a court could do so, and such relief shall be enforceable by a court having jurisdiction under Section XXII.E of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   5. No arbitration or action under this Agreement shall include, by consolidation, joinder, or any other manner, any claims by any person or entity in privity with or claiming through or on behalf of Franchisee. Franchisee shall not seek to arbitrate or litigate as a representative of, or on behalf of, any other person or entity, any dispute, controversy of any kind arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the rights and obligations of the parties, the sale of the franchise, or other claims or causes of action relating to the performance of either party to this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   6. To the fullest extent permitted by law, direct negotiation, followed by mediation and/or binding arbitration, shall be the exclusive means of resolving any and all claims relating to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, claims of breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, violation of any and all franchise registration, disclosure and/or franchisee protection statutes, regulations, or ordinances, whether federal, state or local, or any other common laws claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Alternative Procedures\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n   The parties understand that specific disputes may make some flexibility in the foregoing dispute resolution procedures desirable. The parties may modify any of the negotiation, mediation or arbitration procedures as described below, or in any other manner that is mutually agreed:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1. Dispute Resolution Procedural Rules. Either party may propose to use a dispute resolution organization other than the AAA, if the proposed organization has rules governing proceedings that are comparable in scope and formality to the AAA Commercial Rules. Under no circumstances shall either of the parties seek to proceed under the AAA Employment Arbitration Rules. The parties may also agree to use a private mediator or arbitrator who would then operate in accordance with the AAA Commercial Rules or a comparable set of rules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Crum Decl., Ex. A at ECF pp. 41-42. Section XXII also provides for waiver of punitive damages, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   FRANCHISEE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT OR CLAIM FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, AND AGREES THAT, IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE, FRANCHISEE SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE ACTUAL DAMAGES SUSTAINED EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Section XXII(G) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, Section XXII contains a savings clause stating that \"[i]f any provision of this Section XXII would violate applicable state or federal law, then the parties agree that such provision shall be excluded from the terms of this Agreement, or shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make the terms hereof lawful.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ECF p. 82 (Franchise Agreement, Section XXII(F) ). Likewise, the Franchise Agreement contains a separate severability provision that provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Except as expressly provided to the contrary herein, each section, part, term and/or provision of this Agreement shall be considered severable, and any section, part, term and/or provision herein is determined to be invalid and contrary to, or in conflict with, any existing or future law or regulation by a court or agency having valid jurisdiction, such\n   shall not impair the operation of, or have any other effect on, such other portions, sections, parts, terms and/or provisions of this Agreement as may remain otherwise intelligible, and the latter shall continue to be given full force and effect and bind the parties hereto, and said invalid sections, parts, terms and/or provisions shall be deemed not to be a part of this Agreement; provided, however, that if Franchisor determines that such finding of invalidity or illegality adversely affects the basic consideration of this Agreement, Franchisor, at its option, may terminate this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ECF p. 83 (Franchise Agreement, Section XXIV(A) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Franchise Agreement also contains a provision addressing the use of English language, which states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     English Language\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n   Franchisee acknowledges that Franchisor's disclosure document and this Agreement are written in the English language. If English is not Franchisee's native language, Franchisee warrants and represents that Franchisee has had the opportunity for translation of the disclosure document and this Agreement; that all aspects of this Agreement have been explained to Franchisee's satisfaction; and that Franchisee understands and accepts this Agreement as written. Franchisee warrants and represents that Franchisee can in fact conduct business in the English language and that conducting business in the English language does not constitute an undue burden on Franchisee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ECF pp. 78-79 (Franchise Agreement, Section XXI(D) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As discussed below, the Franchise Agreement was provided to Castillo as part of a package of documents called \"Franchise Disclosure Documents,\" which included, among other things, a summary of the provisions of the Franchise Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Castillo Decl., Ex. A at ECF pp. 30-32. Item 17(u) on this summary lists \"Dispute resolution by arbitration or mediation,\" which is summarized on the chart as follows: \"Provides for binding arbitration after mediation and negotiation by the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ECF p. 32. Another document in the Financial Disclosures Document, entitled \"California Addendum to Disclosures Document,\" appears to add an additional term to the dispute resolution section of the Franchise Agreement, stating, in part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Item 17(u) of this disclosure document is modified to include the following paragraph:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The franchise agreement requires binding arbitration. The arbitration will occur at the offices of the American Arbitration Association nearest our home office, with costs being paid by the party which does not substantially prevail. You are encouraged to consult private legal counsel to determine the applicability of California and federal laws (such as Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5, Code of Civil Procedure 1281, and the Federal Arbitration Act) to any provisions of the franchise agreement restricting venue to a forum outside of the state of California.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Castillo Decl., Ex. A (Franchise Disclosure Documents) at ECF p. 40 (\"Addendum\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Castillo does not dispute that he signed the Franchise Agreement and also initialed each page of it, including the pages containing the dispute resolution provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, there are factual disputes about the circumstances under which he signed the Franchise Agreement and whether he understood what he was agreeing to. In\n   support of his Opposition brief, Castillo supplied a declaration in which he describes the circumstances as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   3. Spanish is my primary language. I have a high school diploma but do not hold a college degree. I never owned a business, nor had I been trained in owning a business, prior to purchasing the CleanNet franchise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   4. Prior to purchasing a CleanNet franchise, I worked as a janitor for over ten years. My yearly salary was approximately $35,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   5. I learned about purchasing a CleanNet franchise from a Spanish magazine ad in approximately 2011. At the time, I had been laid off for approximately six months and desperately needed work to support my wife and our four children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   6. I called CleanNet and spoke with an employee of CleanNet named Vilma Vega. A few days later, I met her in person in Oakland, California. Vilma was eager to sell me a CleanNet franchise. Vilma promised I could earn $3,000 every month, and I would have the support of the company. I grew excited about the franchise opportunity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   7. All of my communications with Vilma over the phone had been in Spanish, and in our person meeting was also all in Spanish.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   8. Soon after our first meeting, I returned to Oakland and Vilma gave me a large stack of documents. Attached to this declaration as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of the documents I received from Vilma in approximately September 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   9. None of the documents I received were in Spanish, and I was not able to read and comprehend the documents presented to me in English. Though I knew a few simple phrases, I was not capable of understanding the English, particularly the legal terminology, contained in documents. I had to rely upon Vilma to explain the documents to me. Vilma gave me some brief explanations and purported translations of what I was signing: this page says this, that page says that. Vilma told me I needed to sign everything in order to get the franchise, and she showed me where to write my initials and where to sign with post-it arrow flags. I felt pressured to sign right there and then. I was not given the option of taking it home to review with someone else.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   10. I was not aware of any dispute resolution or arbitration provisions that were included within the contract that I signed; Vilma did not explain any of this prior to having me sign. I did not understand that I was giving up my right to present any legal claims in a court. I would have not agreed to this had I known.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   11. I was also not aware that there was a part of the agreement that I signed that I said I was capable of conducting business in English. I would not have agreed to such a statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   12. I was presented with a franchise agreement on take it or leave it terms. I did not believe I could negotiate or alter any of the terms of the agreement, and I was not given an opportunity to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   13. My second meeting with Vilma, including signing and initialing all documents, lasted about 1 hour. I was promised that everything was legitimate, and that I did not have anything to worry about. I trusted the promises made to me by Vilma. I thought I was dealing with a large and reputable company. I was convinced my life was going to change for the better.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   14. I paid the $8,500 down payment towards the franchise on the same day that I signed the contract and a promissory note for the difference of $5,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   This amount for the down payment was most of my life savings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   15. Currently, I earn approximately between $35,000 and $40,000 a year. My income goes almost entirely to cover our family's life necessities, like rent, food, etc., and does not permit me to save very much money. If I had to pay for arbitration of my claim, it would be a financial hardship to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Castillo Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 3-15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants have not offered any evidence that contradicts Castillo's account of his interactions with Vilma Vega. In particular, they do not challenge the truth of Castillo's statements that all of his conversations with Vega were in Spanish and or that when he signed the Franchise Agreement Vega \"gave [him] some brief explanations and purported translations of what [he] was signing: this page says this, that page says that.\" They also conceded at oral argument that there is no evidence in the record that contradicts Castillo's statement that Vega did not tell him that the Franchise Agreement contained an arbitration provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Defendants contend that Castillo had a reasonable opportunity to discover the terms of the contract, including the arbitration provision, and therefore, that his claim that he was induced to sign the Franchise Agreement by fraud is false. In support of their position, they offered evidence that was filed with their Reply brief that they contend shows that: 1) Castillo's English language ability is not as limited as he represents in his declaration; 2) Castillo is a savvy business owner who already owns one business and may have more financial assets than he discloses in his declaration; and 3) Castillo received a copy of the Franchise Disclosure Documents, including the Franchise Agreement, in June 2011 and therefore had time to get it translated before signing it. Below, the Court summarizes this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With respect to Castillo's ability to speak English, Defendants have offered a declaration by Andrew Kaska, who was employed by D&amp;G and accompanied Castillo to meetings with customers who did not speak Spanish to discuss the work he was performing. Declaration of Andrew Kaska in Support of Defendants CleanNet USA, Inc. and D&amp;G Enterprises, Inc.'s (d/b/a CleanNet of the Bay Area and CleanNet of San Jose) Reply Memorandum re Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay the Proceedings (\"Kaska Decl.\") \u00b6 2. According to Kaska, he observed Castillo \"conversing with customers in English.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Kaska further states that his own conversations with Castillo \"were in English and Spanish.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants also offer an English-only multiple-choice test that Castillo completed during his franchise training, suggesting that Castillo had some ability to comprehend English.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of David P. Crum in Support of Defendants CleanNet USA, Inc. and D&amp;G Enterprises, Inc.'s (d/b/a CleanNet of the Bay Area and CleanNet of San Jose) Reply Memorandum re Motion to Compel\n   Arbitration and Stay the Proceedings (\"Crum Reply Decl.\"), Ex. F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants also imply that Castillo is more sophisticated - and perhaps more financially well-off - than his declaration suggests. In particular, Defendants offer a business card for \"J &amp; V Maintenance\" which shows that Castillo is the \"owner,\" and a business registration certificate for J &amp; V Maintenance. Crum Reply Decl., Exs. D &amp; E. According to Crum, who states that he is president of D&amp;G, Castillo \"gave out\" the business card \"[a]t or about the time he franchised with defendants\" and produced the business registration certificate as part of his initial disclosures. Crum Reply Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Defendants also introduce evidence showing that Castillo was able to pay $8,500 of the franchise cost when he signed the Franchise Agreement, introducing a copy of a personal check from Castillo for that amount. Crum Reply Decl., Ex. G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, Defendants introduce evidence, in the form of a signed receipt and a subsequent acknowledgment of receipt, they contend shows that Castillo received a packet of Franchise Disclosure Documents on June 14, 2011. Crum Reply Decl., Exs. A (Receipt) &amp; B (Acknowledgement of Receipt). Both the Receipt and the Acknowledgment of Receipt are signed by Castillo and show a date of receipt of the Franchise Disclosure Documents - which is also handwritten on the forms - of June 14, 2011.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to the Receipt, the Franchise Disclosure Documents included a copy of the Franchise Agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants also provide a copy of an application that appears to have been completed by Castillo; that document also is dated June 14, 2014. Crum Reply Decl., Ex. C. Crum states in the accompanying declaration that Castillo signed all three documents on June 14, 2011 but does not state how he knows that the signatures are authentic or that the date reflected on the documents is the date they were completed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crum Reply Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In support of his sur-reply, Castillo provides a supplemental declaration addressing the evidence described above. In his supplemental declaration, Castillo states, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   3. At my first meeting with a CleanNet representative, Vilma Vega, I was given very few pieces of paper. I recall a double-sided, two-page color flyer with images of janitors cleaning, advertising the CleanNet franchise, which I took home. I also remember being provided with a copy of a chart that included the different packages CleanNet offered; it listed monthly billings guarantees, total price, down payment and monthly installments. These were the only documents that I was provided and took home with me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   4. During our first meeting, Vilma asked me to fill out an application form. Since the form was in English, she helped me complete it by translating for me. Some of the sections, like name and address, I completed without her assistance, as I was familiar with those words. Some of the portions I completed in Spanish on her direction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   5. After our first meeting, Vilma called me several times to ask when I was ready to come in to review and sign the agreement with her. During our last phone call before our second meeting, she reminded me to bring a check for the down payment and to make it out to CleanNet USA. I do not recall having any written communications with Vilma.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   6. At our second meeting, on or around September 26, 2011, Vilma provided me a thick packet of documents. The documents were all in English, and I asked if she had the documents translated into Spanish. She told me that the documents\n   included the Franchise Agreement I would have to sign. She said the documents were not in Spanish, but that she would be able to provide me with oral translations. I relied on her oral translation, as I could not read the Franchise Agreement and other documents myself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   7. Vilma reviewed the Franchise Agreement and other documents with me in about an hour. She told me this section is about this, and that section says that, and so on. She pointed out where I needed to initial or sign, which was also marked with post-it arrow flags. She made the process very easy, reassuring me that it was all very straightforward. She seemed trustworthy - as did CleanNet - and so I believed her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   8. As she provided brief explanations and purported oral translations of what we were reviewing, I recall asking her some questions based on the content she shared, including how long before I would see the guaranteed monthly gross billings, and whether accounts are replaced if lost.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   9. In reviewing the Agreement with me, Vilma did not mention anything regarding what would happen if l had a dispute with CleanNet, or if CleanNet had a dispute with me. She did not talk about court, or explain arbitration or anything of the type.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   10. Vilma also did not mention anything about having to conduct business only in English.

Vilma did not at any time advise me to consult with an attorney or any other person about the documents she wanted me to sign.

Before the second meeting with Vilma, I had not received a copy of the Franchise Agreement. Had I been provided the document in advance, I would have brought it home and asked my oldest child, who was around 16 at the time, to translate it - or at least try to translate it - for me, as I would typically do with documents provided to me in English.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   13. During my time working at CleanNet, I got by using my Spanish and some janitorial-related words in English. The CleanNet representatives I spoke with, including Vilma, Andres, and Jorge, were bilingual in English and Spanish, and I communicated with them in Spanish. I was told to not talk with CleanNet clients directly, and certainly not outside the presence of CleanNet representatives. During meetings with CleanNet clients, it was the CleanNet representative, who primarily interfaced with the client. On November 27, 2018, I met with my one of my attorneys to review the documents that were filed with the Court by CleanNet on November 20, 2018.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   15. I did not recognize Exhibit A [ECF 71-3], although I can confirm that it is my signature and printed name on the page. However, I do not believe that the date is my handwriting. I understand the document suggests that I was given six kinds of documents on or about June 14, 2011, but that is not what happened.

I did not write the additional words on this page, and the dates also do not appear to be mine. I understand the document states that I signed the Agreement and provided a check on September 26, 2011, and that is correct. The document also states that I received a Disclosure Statement and a copy of the Franchise agreement on the same day as my first face-to-face meeting with a CleanNet representative, and that is not correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   17. I recognize Exhibit C [ECF 71-5] as the application form I completed with the assistance of Vilma during our initial meeting.

I wrote Spanish words like \"afios\" and \"Casado\" to complete the form because Vilma said it was fine to respond in Spanish.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   18. I recognize Exhibits D [ECF 71-6] and E [ECF 71-7] as documents related to J &amp; V Maintenance, which was a business name I created in 2008 because I needed a company name to keep getting janitorial jobs from my then-employer. I did not have any employees, but I had to invoice my employer and received 1099 tax form for the wages I received. In 2008, I had printed a few dozen business cards for J &amp; V Maintenance, and I brought one to Vilma, upon her request, to our second meeting. I provided the Business Registration Certificate for J &amp; V Maintenance to CleanNet in 2012 also in response to their request to provide such a document.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   19. I recognize Exhibit F [ECF 71-8] as a test I had to take after buying the CleanNet franchise. I recall watching several training videos that covered the responsibilities of a janitor like myself. All the videos were in English. I asked for the Spanish version, but was told there were none. I watched the videos alone, without any translation. When the time came for my test, I asked for a copy of the test in Spanish, but again there was none. Vilma offered to help and basically told me the answers: put A there, put B there and circle true, circle false. I was able to complete the test with Vilma's assistance without needing to read any of the test. On the first page of Exhibit F [ECF 71-8], page 150, I recognize my printed name and date to be in my handwriting; on the last page of Exhibit F [ECF 71-8], page 162, I recognize the signature of my name to be in my handwriting, but not my name written above. I believe the signature below mine is of the man who was responsible for starting the training videos, but I do not recall his name. He did not speak Spanish, and so we did not say much to each other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   20. I recognize Exhibit G [Exh 71-9] as a copy of the check I wrote to CleanNet USA. The check was written at home, prior to my second meeting with Vilma. I remember copying \"Eight Thousand and Five Hundred\" from a reference chart for writing numbers in English in my checkbook. At the bottom of the check I wrote in Spanish, \"Pago Inicial Franquiesa de Limpieza Commercial\" as I did not know how to write that in English but I wanted it to be clear what the payment was for. The payment was basically my entire li[f]e savings and a considerable sum of money for me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   21.

I do not recognize the name Andrew Kaska. I had a supervisor at CleanNet whose name was Andres, and maybe it is the same individual. Andres was bilingual in English and Spanish, and we spoke almost entirely in Spanish.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   On a handful of occasions, Andres and I met with CleanNet clients together. Andres did the majority, if not all of the talking, with the CleanNet clients in English.

Castillo does not dispute that CleanNet can invoke the arbitration agreement even though it is not a signatory to the Franchise Agreement. Nor does he dispute that the claims he asserts in the action fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement or that he can arbitrate only his individual claims and not the class claims if his claims are subject to arbitration. He argues, however, that the arbitration agreement is void - and therefore unenforceable - because he was induced to enter into it by fraud. In particular, he asserts that he does not have sufficient understanding of English to understand the terms of the Franchise Agreement and reasonably relied on Vega's representations about what the agreement said when he signed it and initialed each page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Castillo argues further that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it contains numerous provisions that are unconscionable and/or violate public policy under\n   <em>\n    Armendariz v.

In particular, he argues that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because: 1) it may require that all disputes be brought within 180 days (hereinafter, \"the 180-day requirement\"); 2) it provides for only minimal discovery because it applies the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and prohibits use of the more liberal AAA Employment Arbitration Rules; 3) it forces Castillo to pay unreasonable costs under various cost provisions in the body of the Franchise Agreement and under the provision in the Addendum that shifts costs to the losing party; and 4) it prohibits Castillo (but not Defendants) from seeking punitive damages, which would be available in court on both of his trafficking claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Factual Findings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court makes the following factual findings relevant to the circumstances under which Castillo entered into the Franchise Agreement. All of these findings are based on the preponderance of the evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   1. Castillo's ability to speak and understand English is extremely limited. He conducted all of his conversations with D&amp;G employees - both before and after entering into the Franchise Agreement - almost entirely in Spanish. In signing the Franchise Agreement he relied on the translation of that agreement provided by D&amp;G employee Vilma Vega. Vega had previously assisted him in completing his franchise application, which was in English, and told Castillo he could respond in Spanish. She also helped him to complete the English language multiple choice test he was required to take after he entered into the Franchise Agreement. For the most part, Castillo did not communicate directly with clients and on the occasions when he met with clients, he was accompanied by a bilingual D&amp;G employee who did most of the talking and translated for Castillo when needed. Given his very limited understanding of English, Castillo could not have understood the terms of the arbitration agreement in the Franchise Agreement and other Franchise Disclosure Documents, or that he was waiving any rights, without assistance. Although he asked for a Spanish-language version of the Franchise Disclosure Documents, he was told that none existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   2. Castillo did not receive the Franchise Disclosure Documents in advance of September 26, 2011 meeting with Vega, when he signed them. The Receipt and Acknowledgment of Receipt upon which Defendants rely to show that Castillo received these documents before the September 26, 2011 meeting were signed by Castillo but the June 14, 2011 date reflected on those documents was not in his handwriting and he did not write those dates, which are not accurate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   3. Vega encouraged Castillo to come to the September 26, 2011 meeting with a check to cover the down-payment for the franchise, which he did. She also encouraged him to sign the documents at that meeting and did not advise him to take them home to review them or to obtain assistance in understanding them or the advice of an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   3. Castillo's financial means are limited; he earns approximately $35,000 to\n   $40,000 a year and this income is devoted almost entirely to supporting his wife and four children. J &amp; V Maintenance is simply a d/b/a that Castillo was required by a former employer to adopt to receive payment for his work. It does not have any employees other than Castillo, who, at the time he purchased his franchise, had worked as a janitor for ten years and earned approximately $35,000 a year. At the time he signed the Franchise Agreement, Castillo was under financial pressure because he had been laid off more than six months before and desperately needed work to support his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether the Franchise Agreement is Void Due to Fraud in the Inception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Castillo contends that the Motion should be denied because there was fraud in the inception and therefore, under California law, the arbitration agreement is void. Defendants do not dispute that California contract law applies to the question of whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wolsey, Ltd. v. Foodmaker, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1306674\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/144/1205/#p1210\">\n    144 F.3d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1210 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that courts apply state contract law in determining the validity and scope of an arbitration agreement). They argue, however, that Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the arbitration agreement is void under the doctrine of fraud in the inception. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   California law provides that if there is fraud in the inception of an agreement such that \"the promisor is deceived as to the nature of his act,\" then \"mutual assent is lacking\" and the contract is void.\n   <em>\n    Rosenthal v.

Here, Vega purported to describe the contents of the Franchise Agreement at the time Castillo signed it and did not disclose that the Franchise Agreement (or the Franchise Disclosure Documents generally) included an agreement to arbitrate disputes between the parties.

Instead, LBN contends that it translated the entire contract (including the arbitration clause) into Spanish orally. But Plaintiffs each testified that LBN representatives did not translate or explain the arbitration clause.... And LBN's own evidence shows that it is unlikely that LBN translated the arbitration clause into Spanish for Plaintiffs ... Plaintiffs only speak and read Spanish and are not proficient in English ... LBN representatives purported to translate the English-language contract into Spanish orally.

The fact that an individual who signs an arbitration agreement is not proficient in English is not, by itself, enough to demonstrate fraud in the inception, even if the agreement was provided only in English. As the court in\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   noted, \"[n]o law requires that parties dealing at arm's length have a duty to explain to each other the terms of a written contract.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053764\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/242/674/#p688\">\n    242 Cal.App.4th at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=195%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2034\">\n    195 Cal.Rptr.3d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation and citation omitted). Thus, California courts have held that \"one who accepts or signs an instrument, which on its face is a contract, is deemed to assent to all its terms, and cannot escape liability on the ground that he has not read it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=195%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2034\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations and citations omitted).

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

Apr. 10, 2009). In particular, he reasoned that \"[h]aving the written Arbitration Agreement at home, with her English-speaking son, Mario Nunez, who actually assisted her in filling out the certification of the Arbitration Agreement, Plaintiff had a reasonable opportunity to discover its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20975457\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Rosenthal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , however, there were additional facts that rendered the agreements these plaintiffs signed void, namely, representations on which these plaintiffs relied and circumstances that made it reasonable for them to rely on these representations. In each case, somewhat different facts supported the courts' conclusion that the plaintiff's reliance was reasonable but the Court finds that there is significant overlap between the facts in those cases and the facts here. Like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Rosenthal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , Castillo is not proficient in English and could not have understood the arbitration agreement (or the Franchise Disclosure Documents as a whole) without assistance. Having asked for a Spanish language translation of the agreement and been told there was none, he relied on Vega's assurance that she would assist him and he relied on her translation of the documents. Castillo Supp. Decl., \u00b6 6 (\"She said the documents were not in Spanish, but that she would be able to provide me with oral translations. I relied on her oral translation, as I could not read the Franchise Agreement and other documents myself.\"). In fact, she had assisted him before, when he completed the application at his first meeting with her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4 (\"During our first meeting, Vilma asked me to fill out an application form. Since the form was in English, she helped me complete it by translating for me. Some of the sections, like name and address, I completed without her assistance, as I was familiar with those words. Some of the portions I completed in Spanish on her direction.\"). Based on this past assistance and his numerous conversations with Vega prior to signing the Franchise Agreement Castillo, like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Rosenthal\n   </em>\n   , believed he could trust Vega's translation. It is undisputed that Vega did not tell Castillo about the existence of the arbitration provision in the Franchise Agreement, much less explain what it meant. Nor is there any evidence in the record that she told Castillo about the Addendum that shifts the costs of arbitration to the losing party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In addition, unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Sim\n   </em>\n   , Castillo did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have an opportunity to review the Franchise Agreement or other Franchise Disclosure Documents at home before signing the Franchise Agreement. Instead, he was presented with these documents for the first time at the meeting that he and Vega had set up to finalize the agreement and make a down-payment, on September 26, 2011. Vega did not encourage Castillo to consult an attorney or obtain English language assistance so that he could fully understand the terms of the documents he was signing; instead, she encouraged him to rely on her translation of the documents. Under these circumstances, the Court concludes that Castillo has demonstrated that he reasonably relied on Vega's translation and was unaware that he was entering into an arbitration agreement, giving rise to fraud in the inception and rendering the arbitration agreement void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Because the language quoted above does not clearly state what the 180-day requirement relates to, it could be interpreted in a number of ways. One reasonable interpretation is that this language requires that claims be brought to arbitration within 180 days of the relevant conduct. (The Court disagrees with Defendants that this provision does not place limitations on the time allowed to initiate direct negotiations as the language is not clear on that point.) In contrast, the federal trafficking claim has a 10-year statute of limitations and the California trafficking law has a seven-year statute of limitations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201595\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052.5\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 52.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Further, under the California trafficking statute, this limitation period is tolled if \"a person entitled to sue is under a disability at the time the cause of action accrues so that it is impossible or impracticable for him or her to bring an action\" and \"if a person entitled to sue could not have reasonably discovered the cause of action due to circumstances resulting from the trafficking situation, such as psychological trauma, cultural and linguistic isolation, and the inability to access services.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(d), (e). Consequently, a 180-day limitations period dramatically reduces the time allowed to bring the trafficking claims asserted here. Further, this 180-day limitation is particularly onerous in light of the requirement under the arbitration agreement that parties must engage in both direct negotiations and mediation\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   initiating arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Other reasonable interpretations of the 180-day requirement are that it requires arbitration to be initiated within 180 days of the date when the parties began direct negotiations or alternatively, within 180 days of the date when direct negotiations broke down. Under these interpretations, the arbitration agreement does not reduce the time to begin direct negotiations but nonetheless imposes a significant procedural burden on parties seeking to arbitrate claims, especially as the arbitration agreement contains no provision tolling the 180-day period while a party pursues the required direct negotiations and mediation that are prerequisites to initiating arbitration. (Nor does the arbitration provision provide for tolling of the 180-day period on\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the grounds that give rise to tolling under the California trafficking law.) The Court need not decide which interpretation of this provision is correct because it is apparent that under any of them, the 180-day requirement deprives Castillo of his statutorily mandated rights by shortening the limitation period or imposing a significant procedural barrier that may deprive him of his ability to assert his claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estrada v. CleanNet USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-1785 JSW, Docket No. 77 at 5-6 (finding same provision to be ambiguous and severing from agreement). Consequently, the Court concludes that this provision does not satisfy\n   <em>\n    Armendariz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Gilmer\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    Minimal Discovery\n   </em>\n   : Castillo argues that the arbitration agreement does not protect his substantive rights because it allows for only minimal discovery, pointing to the requirement that arbitration must be conducted under the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and the section prohibiting the parties from using the AAA's Employment Arbitration Rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Franchise Agreement Section XXII(B) &amp; (C)(1). He further asserts that the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules regarding \"exchange of information between parties\" are \"extremely limited, relate only to document exchange, and contain no provision for interrogatories or depositions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Olivier Decl., Ex. A (AAA Commercial Rules), ECF pp. 20-21 (Rule R-22, \"Pre-Hearing Exchange and Production of Information\") ). In contrast, the AAA Employment Arbitration Rules include a rule expressly devoted to \"Discovery,\" which provides that the arbitrator \"shall have the authority to order such discovery, by way of deposition, interrogatory, document production, or otherwise, as the arbitrator considers necessary to a full and fair exploration of the issues in dispute.\" Olivier Decl., Ex.

With this guidance in mind, and in light of the fact that the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules give arbitrators some authority to permit depositions - even if the burden for obtaining such discovery is high, the Court concludes that the minimal discovery requirement under\n   <em>\n    Armendariz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <em>\n    Unreasonable Costs and Fees\n   </em>\n   : Castillo argues that the arbitration provision violates\n   <em>\n    Armendariz\n   </em>\n   because it unlawfully forces him to pay unreasonable costs and fees as a condition of going to arbitration, pointing to five separate requirements. First, the party initiating arbitration must pay the filing fee for the mediation, which is a mandatory prerequisite to arbitration; according to Castillo, that fee is $250. Second, the Franchise Agreement provides that the parties must split the costs of mediation; according to Castillo, these costs can be several thousands of dollars. Third, the party initiating arbitration must pay the filing fee, which is approximately $7,700.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fourth, the parties must split the cost of arbitration,\n   which often exceeds tens of thousands of dollars, according to Castillo.

Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Estrada v. CleanNet USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Judge White found that the same arbitration agreement that is at issue in this case was not substantively unconscionable based in part on his conclusion that the plaintiff \"fail[ed] to provide the Court sufficient information from which the Court could draw a valid conclusion regarding Plaintiff's ability to split costs.\" No. 14-1785 JSW, Docket No. 77 at 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the record is different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   First, Castillo has introduced evidence reflecting his financial means are very limited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact, above. In particular, Castillo has earned approximately $35,000 a year for the past ten years and continues to earn between $35,000 and $40,000 a year. Castillo Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 15. This income is devoted almost entirely to supporting his wife and four children, and the $8,500 Castillo paid as a down-payment on the franchise was most of his life savings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. While Defendants imply that the mere fact that Castillo was able to make the down-payment shows that his financial resources cannot be as limited as he suggests, they do not offer any evidence to support this assertion (or explain why they think it is true). On the flip side, Plaintiff has offered evidence relating to the costs of arbitration that persuades the Court that at least as to the three provisions related to those costs (payment of the arbitration fee, splitting of arbitration costs and cost shifting to the losing party) Castillo has met his burden.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Court's conclusion is based on two uncontroverted facts. First, Defendants concede that the filing fee to initiate arbitration is approximate $7,700. This is almost the same amount as Castillo paid for his franchise down-payment, which was almost his entire life savings. It is not in any way speculative to find on the basis of this evidence that the imposition of the cost of the arbitration filing fee on the party who initiates arbitration imposes a prohibitively high cost on Castillo and therefore will deprive him of his substantive rights as to both his state and federal claim. Second, the arbitration costs in the\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   case, which involved the same defendants and the same arbitration agreement, were set by the arbitrator at almost $60,000 (which included over $38,000 in arbitrator fees).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. B (December 19, 2017 arbitration award in\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the claims asserted in that case were based on allegations that the plaintiffs were employees rather than independent contractors, the factual context of this case has significant overlap with the\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   case, and the two cases appear to be comparable in terms of complexity. Consequently, the Court finds that the arbitration award in that case sheds significant light on the costs that would likely be incurred in this case if it were subject to arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, to the extent that Castillo has shown that arbitration costs are likely to be in the range of $60,000, the Court concludes that both the provision that splits arbitration costs between the parties (which would require Castillo to pay $30,00 - or almost an entire year of his income) and the provision that imposes full costs on the losing party (which would require Castillo to pay $60,000) are sufficient to demonstrate that these costs are\n   likely to be prohibitive and deprive Castillo of his substantive statutory rights. Therefore, the Court concludes that these three provisions violate\n   <em>\n    Armendariz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gilmer\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Finally, the Court rejects Defendants' argument that the cost provisions of the arbitration agreement are lawful because the AAA rules give the arbitrator the discretion to apportion fees and expenses as \"appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 13 (citing AAA Commercial Rules, Rule 47). First, to the extent that the cost of initiating arbitration, by itself, is prohibitively high for Castillo, the possibility that an arbitrator might later award him costs does not address that problem. Similarly, with respect the cost splitting and cost shifting provisions, an award at the end of the arbitration does not sufficiently mitigate the deterrent effect of these provisions. As the court in\n   <em>\n    Armendariz\n   </em>\n   explained, \"it is not only the costs imposed on the claimant but the\n   <em>\n    risk\n   </em>\n   that the claimant may have to bear substantial costs that deters the exercise of the constitutional right of due process.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1180100\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/24/83/\">\n    24 Cal. 4th at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20745\">\n    99 Cal.Rptr.2d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20P.3d%20669\">\n    6 P.3d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Section XXII(G) requires the franchisee to waive its rights to punitive damages \"to the fullest extent permitted by law.\" As Defendants have not pointed to any case in which a court has specifically held that the right to punitive damages under the state and federal trafficking laws may not be waived (or any statutory authority to that effect), it would not be unreasonable to interpret Section XXII(G) as a waiver of Castillo's rights to obtain punitive damages under these statutes. On the other hand, under\n   <em>\n    Armendariz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gilmer\n   </em>\n   , it is fairly well-established that an arbitration agreement may not deprive a party of statutory remedies that would be available in a judicial proceeding. Based on that authority, another possible interpretation of the waiver provision is that it does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   result in a waiver of punitive damages on Castillo's claims because such a waiver is not permitted by law. In determining which of these interpretations is correct, the Court must apply the rule that ambiguous terms are construed against the drafter. Under the circumstances here, the Court concludes that rule means that the latter interpretation of the waiver provision is correct and therefore, that the arbitration agreement does not deprive Castillo of his statutory remedies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

Those standards are undoubtedly met here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   As discussed above, evidence in the record establishes that Castillo's ability to understand English was very limited and his financial circumstances were also difficult.

Further, he was not given a copy of the Franchise Agreement until the day he was expected to sign it and Defendants' representative falsified the date on documents later produced in this action to suggest that Castillo had a reasonable opportunity to discover the contents of the documents. There is no dispute that Castillo was presented with the Franchise Agreement on a take-it-or-or leave it basis. And to make matters even worse, an important provision of the arbitration provision shifting costs to the losing party was not even contained in the Franchise Agreement but instead, was buried in the Addendum to the Franchise Disclosure Documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, Castillo has made a strong showing of procedural unconscionability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    6.

As discussed above, numerous courts have found that procedural barriers in arbitration agreements related to limitations periods are unconscionable and the Court concludes that the 180-day requirement in the arbitration agreement here is unconscionable as well.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pokorny\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225031\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/987/#p1004\">\n    601 F.3d at 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that shortened arbitration period in arbitration agreement was unconscionable);\n   <em>\n    Nyulassy v.

Upon further reflection, the Court concludes that such discovery is not appropriate. Both parties introduced evidence on this question in support of their briefs. Although the question of whether the parties entered into an agreement to arbitrate was squarely raised in Plaintiff's Opposition brief, Defendants chose not to introduce any testimony from Vega in support of their Reply brief, even though they introduced\n    <em>\n     other\n    </em>\n    evidence on this question. Further, although Castillo stated in his declarations that he did not receive the Franchise Disclosure Documents in advance of the meeting in September when he signed them, and Defendants clearly understood the importance of this factual question (having introduced their own evidence purportedly showing that Castillo received these documents in June), Defendants' counsel could only speculate at oral argument about what Vega's testimony might be if she were deposed because they had not contacted her to discuss her interactions with Castillo or to ask her if she had any specific memory as to when she provided the Financial Disclosure Documents to him. (Nor did Defendants represent to the Court that they had any reason to believe that Vega's testimony would contradict Castillo's sworn statement that Vega translated sections of the Franchise Agreement for him but did not tell him about the dispute resolution provisions.) As Defendants were unable to make a good-faith proffer at the motion hearing as to what testimony Vega might offer, or even that it would contradict Castillo's testimony, the Court declines to permit further discovery and concludes that the record is sufficient developed to make factual findings relevant to the Motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    The Court notes that at oral argument, Defendants conceded that although these documents were attached to the Crum Reply Declaration, Crum had no personal knowledge with regard to who filled in the dates on the forms, or when they were actually completed.

At oral argument, in response to the Court's query, Defendants suggested for the first time that this provision was not part of the arbitration agreement at all. A close reading of the Franchise Agreement, however, supports the opposite conclusion. In particular, Section XXV states that \"[t]his Agreement,\n    <em>\n     the documents referred to herein\n    </em>\n    and the Attachments hereto, if any, constitute the entire full and complete Agreement between the parties....\" Franchise Agreement, Section XXV (emphasis added). Further, the Franchise Disclosure Documents are expressly referenced in Section XXI(C), which states that the \"Franchisee represents that it has read this Agreement and Franchisor's disclosure documents in their entirety and that it has been given the opportunity to clarify any provisions that it did not understand and to consult with an attorney or other professional advisor. Franchisee further represents that it understands the terms, conditions and obligations of this Agreement and agrees to be bound thereby.\" Finally, the plain language of the Addendum (which is contained in the Franchise Disclosure Documents referenced in the Franchise Agreement), purports to modify the arbitration agreement to shift costs to the losing party. Therefore, the Court concludes that the modification in the Addendum is, in fact, part of the arbitration agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    The Court notes that in\n    <em>\n     Estrada\n    </em>\n    , Judge White addressed only the cost splitting provision of the Franchise Agreement.

As to the cost of mediation, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's general statement that these costs \"can be several thousands of dollars,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Opposition at 13, is not sufficiently specific or definite to satisfy Castillo's burden under\n    <em>\n     Green Tree\n    </em>\n    or to show that these costs are unreasonable under\n    <em>\n     Armendariz\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    Defendants' request for judicial notice of this document, which is unopposed, is granted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    The Court acknowledges that Defendants have agreed to waive all of the cost provisions and indeed, any provision the Court finds does not pass muster. The relevant inquiry, however, is whether the contract the parties\n    <em>\n     actually\n    </em>\n    agreed to contains invalid provisions, not whether Defendants are now prepared to offer a different contract. In\n    <em>\n     Ramos v. Superior Court\n    </em>\n    , the court rejected a similar argument, finding that the defendant's \"willingness to have the court sever the invalid clauses [was] insufficient to save the agreement.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515031\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/239/679/\">\n     28 Cal.

The parties have not briefed the question of whether a party challenging an arbitration agreement has standing to challenge a provision on the basis that it deprives one party (but not the other) of certain types of remedies where, as here, those remedies are available to the challenging party under the arbitration agreement on the specific claims it asserts.
