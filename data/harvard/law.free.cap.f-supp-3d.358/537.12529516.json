FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 31, 2015, at approximately 7:37 a.m., Plaintiff, an employee of the United States Navy, was injured by a vehicle negligently operated by Davis, who is also an employee of the Navy. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, ECF No. 1. Plaintiff was struck\n   by Davis' vehicle while he was walking in a crosswalk within Naval Station Norfolk, a military base in Norfolk, Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff asserts that he was \"on his way to the gym on his own volition\" when he was hit, and that he was \"not under any orders associated with his employment with the Navy,\" was not \"on an official Navy assignment,\" and \"was not on duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition to, and/or in contradiction to, such facts, Defendants support their dismissal motion by providing a sworn affidavit from Suly Diaz, Plaintiff's Navy Supervisor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 7-1, \u00b6 2. Diaz asserts, under oath, that on the morning of the accident, Plaintiff was required to report to the on-base sports center to participate in mandatory physical training scheduled to begin at 7:30 a.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Diaz further indicates that such training was \"the beginning of the workday\" for Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although Plaintiff's responsive brief denies that he was on his way to mandatory physical training, Plaintiff provides no affidavit or other evidence to support such contrary factual statement made in his brief. ECF No. 11, at 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kulhawik v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668957\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/296/#p298\">\n    571 F.3d 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298 (2d Cir. 2009) (\"An attorney's unsworn statements in a brief are not evidence\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to the disagreement over Plaintiff's reason for going to the on-base gym, the parties' briefs dispute the degree to which Naval Station Norfolk is open to the public. Defendants advance two additional sworn affidavits seeking to demonstrate that: (1) access to the base was restricted to those with an employment, familial, or other connection to the military, ECF No. 7-2; and (2) the gym that Plaintiff was walking to on the day of the accident is located on the base, is operated for the benefit of servicemembers, and may only be patronized by military personnel and other\n   <em>\n    authorized\n   </em>\n   individuals, ECF No. 7-3. Plaintiff does not counter such affidavits with any evidence, but again advances unsworn assertions referencing the vast number of \"civilians\" that have daily access to the base. ECF No. 11, at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff unsuccessfully pursued an administrative claim with the Navy for his injuries resulting from the accident, and he thereafter filed the instant action in this Court. Compl. \u00b6 15-16. In an apparent effort to recover damages through Plaintiff's \"uninsured motorist\" auto insurance coverage, Plaintiff's lawsuit names both the United States and Davis as defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants subsequently moved to dismiss this case on jurisdictional grounds, claiming that: (1) the suit cannot proceed against Davis based on this Court's ruling in a prior federal case filed by Plaintiff;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   and (2) that the case cannot proceed against the United States due to the doctrine of sovereign immunity. ECF No. 7. Defendants further argue that an uninsured motorist claim cannot proceed because Va. Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(F) requires that a Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    first secure\n   </em>\n   a judgment against the owner or operator of the uninsured vehicle, and here, Plaintiff cannot obtain a judgment against either Defendant.

Compl. \u00b6 2. Alternatively, to the extent that the Government is immune from Plaintiff's suit, Plaintiff names Davis as a defendant in an effort to obtain a ruling by this Court that would allow Plaintiff to proceed against GEICO under Plaintiff's own uninsured motorist policy.
