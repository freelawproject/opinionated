The defendants did not merely insist that the claim charts provided by the plaintiff under the Local Patent Rules insufficiently \"disclose[d] where each claim element is found even in each 'exemplary' accused instrumentality.\" [Dkt. # 112 at 7]. The defendants accused the plaintiff of having \"willfully disregarded its obligations to comply\" with the Local Patent Rules, pursuant to a \"strategic decision,\" intended to \"keep defendants in the dark as to the basis for its infringement allegations\" and, intentionally \"to materially prejudice Defendants....\" [Dkt. # 112 at 5, 7, 20, 23].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants said that these \"highly prejudicial and improper tactic[s]\" required them \"to guess as to plaintiff's infringement allegations and theories,\" including its Final Non Infringement Contentions. [Dkt. # 112 at 7, 10, 23]. The defendants insisted that compliance with the Local Patent Rules would have been simplicity itself, and that nothing \"prevent[ed] plaintiff from making an analysis in the manner required....\" The difficulty, the defendants charged, was that plaintiff was simply \"unwilling to mak[e] the effort and tak[e] the time.\" [Dkt. # 112 at 10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff had a very different view of what occurred and of the adequacy of their\n   compliance with the Local Patent Rules and their general discovery obligations. Their respective views were set forth in a recently filed 36-page motion which they styled as a Joint Motion and which presented their respective views of various aspects of the case. [Dkt. # 112].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties appeared before me on the Joint Motion.

[Dkt. # 122]. The \"Status Report\" stated that agreement had been reached regarding issues discussed on pages 1-30 of the \"Joint Motion, but that the issues in Section II of the \"Joint Motion\" relating to Final Unenforceability and Invalidity Contentions remained \"unresolved.\" [Dkt. # 122]. Those issues had been addressed at pp. 31-37 of the \"Joint Motion.\" [Dkt. # 122]. Two days later, the parties filed a \"Joint Updated Status Report,\" noting that they had reached an \"additional agreement\" related to certain of the issues raised in Sections II(A)(1) and II(B)(2), pp. 31-33, 36 of the \"Joint Motion\" and that those matters also \"have been resolved.\" [Dkt. # 125]. However, the issues raised in Sections II(A)(2) and II(B)(1), pp. 33-36 of the \"Joint Motion\" remained unresolved. Thus, of the issues in the original 36-page brief, the parties have resolved all of their disputes except for those in the last 3 \u00bd pages of the original 36 page \"Joint Motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Despite some initial difficulties, counsel in this case were able through concentrated and thoughtful effort to resolve all but one of their discovery related disputes.

The Rule allows four prior art grounds of defense and four non-prior grounds per patent at issue. But, say the defendants, the Rule has \"no limitation as to the number of\n   <em>\n    reasons\n   </em>\n   -[the word is the plaintiff's]-that may be used to support each of the individual grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While LPR 3.1 seeks to streamline patent litigation by, in part, limiting the number of grounds on which a claim of invalidity may be based, it does not purport to dictate or limit the proof that may be offered in support of a specific example of a claim based on a permissible ground. Under the cases, grounds include, but are not limited to, lack of utility, indefiniteness, lack of enablement, failure to disclose the best mode, obviousness, and prior art.\n   <em>\n    Roche Palo Alto LLC v.

But the reality is that each of the 37 instances referred to by the defendants do not constitute 37 separate grounds. The plaintiff is correct in contending that \"any one of them [if proven] could independently be relied upon in an attempt to invalidate the claims of [the] patents.\" [Dkt. # 112 at 33]. That is the purpose of proof. But, that does not mean that under LPR 3.1 each is a separate ground and thus violative of the numerical limitations imposed on the number of grounds that may be advanced under the Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   No one can dispute that Local patent Rule 3.1(b) limits Final Unenforceability and Invalidity Contentions to four prior art grounds per claim and four non-prior art grounds. But, as defendants point out and plaintiff cannot dispute, defendants cite only three separate non-prior art\n   <em>\n    grounds\n   </em>\n   : indefiniteness, lack of enablement, and lack of written description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Then, for each claim at issue, they cite the term and the particular reason why it is believed they have the better of the validity argument. These are, as plaintiff asserts, \"separate and distinct invalidity arguments....\" [Dkt. # 112, at 33]. They are not, however, separate grounds. The Rule, itself, clearly defines what constitutes a non-prior art ground: indefiniteness, lack of written description, lack of enablement....\" Local Patent Rule 3.1(b). And that numerical limitation has not been violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Thus, the defendants' argument as to why the term \"shaft\" is claimed to be indefinite-\"lacks objective boundaries and fails to inform those of ordinary skill in the art, with reasonable certainty\"-is clearly not a separate ground. It is merely a claimed example of alleged indefiniteness, which is a ground. The Rule doesn't limit the former, only the latter. It doesn't limit the number\n   <em>\n    of terms\n   </em>\n   that a defendant might claim are indefinite or not enabling. Accordingly, pointing to six or seven terms in a patent that are claimed to be indefinite or not enabling does not violate the Local Patent Rule. If one supposes a patent riddled with indefinite terms, it would not make sense-and it would certainly not be fair-to, at this stage, limit the defendant to choosing just one term out of that entire patent. And LPR 3.1 does not pretend to do so.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Taylor v.
