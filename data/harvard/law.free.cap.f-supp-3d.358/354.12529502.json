(\"MorphoSys\" or \"Plaintiff\") sued Janssen Biotech, Inc., Genmab US, Inc., and Genmab A/S (together, \"Janssen\" or \"Defendants\") for infringement of three patents on antibodies that bind to the CD38 protein. (D.I. 205) Pending before the Court are summary judgment motions filed by both sides. Janssen moves for summary judgment of (1) non-infringement of the \"human\" antibody claims (D.I. 384) and (2) invalidity for lack of written description, lack of enablement, and indefiniteness (D.I. 382). MorphoSys moves for summary judgment of no invalidity for lack of enablement.

( '746 patent, Abstract) Specifically, in certain kinds of blood cancer, a protein called CD38 appears on the surface of cancerous cells. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:14-19) The patents describe antibodies that bind to CD38, thus causing the destruction of the cancerous cells. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:49-63, 2:33-42) More specifically, the antibodies disclosed by the patents are \"human or humanized\" - they appear human to the human immune system, and therefore they do not trigger a deleterious immune response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:55-60) Janssen produces an antibody drug, Darzalex (chemical name \"daratumumab\"), that MorphoSys contends infringes the asserted patents.

NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THE \"HUMAN\" ANTIBODY CLAIMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Some of the asserted claims are directed to solely \"human\" antibodies (e.g., claim 1 of the '746 patent, which claims \"[a]n isolated human antibody\") while other asserted claims are directed to \"human or humanized\" antibodies (e.g., claim 14 of the '746 patent, which claims \"[a]n isolated human or humanized antibody or antibody fragment thereof\"). The terms \"human\" and \"humanized\" are defined in the specifications ( '746 patent, 6:61-7:22), and these\n   definitions were adopted by the Court in its claim construction order (D.I. 102):\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-18\"><strong>Human</strong> <strong>Humanized</strong> one that is not chimeric (e.g., one that is (i) derived from a non-human source (e.g., a not \"humanized\") and not transgenic mouse which bears a heterologous immune system), from (either in whole or in which antibody is based on a human germline sequence; or part) a nonhuman species (ii) chimeric, wherein the variable domain is derived from a non-human origin and the constant domain is derived from a human origin or (iii) CDR-grafted, wherein the CDRs of the variable domain are from a nonhuman origin, while one or more frameworks of the variable domain are of human origin and the constant domain (if any) is of human origin</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on these constructions, in order for an antibody to be \"human,\" it must\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   be any of the following: (i) chimeric, (ii) humanized, and (iii) derived even in part from a nonhuman species. In other words, if an antibody is chimeric, humanized,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   derived even in part from a nonhuman species, then it is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not human\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Additionally, if an antibody satisfies one or more of the three sets of conditions for being characterized as \"humanized\" then that antibody is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not human\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . This is because in order to be \"human\" an antibody must be \"not humanized\" and, as a matter of logic, the same antibody cannot be both \"humanized\" and \"not humanized.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Janssen moves for summary judgment of non-infringement of the \"human\" antibody claims,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   contending that daratumumab is not a \"human\" antibody either (1) literally (D.I. 385 at 4-7); or (2) under the doctrine of equivalents (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For the reasons below, the Court concludes that no reasonable factfinder could find infringement of the \"human\" antibody claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Literal Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Janssen contends that the \"human\" antibody claims are not literally infringed because, under the Court's claim construction, daratumumab is \"humanized\" and not \"human.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7) Specifically, Janssen argues that (1) \"human\" and \"humanized\" are mutually exclusive (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6); and (2) undisputed facts establish that daratumumab is humanized (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7). Thus, to Janssen, non-infringement of the \"human\" claims can be determined as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its briefing, MorphoSys countered that: (1) an antibody can be both \"human\" and \"humanized\" (D.I. 425 at 4-6); and (2) even if \"human\" and \"humanized\" are mutually exclusive, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that daratumumab is \"human\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4). MorphoSys contends that substantial evidence exists for finding that the accused antibodies are \"human\" because: (a) daratumumab is derived from human genes (albeit in mice); (b) Janssen has characterized the accused product as \"human\" in representations to regulators and other parties; and (c) the antibodies are not chimeric, and therefore, not \"humanized\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   under the Court's constructions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, during the hearing, MorphoSys dropped its argument that an antibody can be both \"human\" and \"humanized.\" Instead, MorphoSys acknowledged that \"human\" and \"humanized\" are mutually exclusive terms, though still contended that daratumumab is a \"human\" antibody:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: [Y]our view [is] that the accused compound is both human and humanized; correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   COUNSEL: That is not our position ... under the law we have from the Court now, that is not our position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: So what is your position?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   COUNSEL:\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Our position is that [daratumumab] meets every, every part of the definition of \"human,\" and it does not meet the definition of \"humanized antibody.\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Specifically, that little Roman numeral (i) which says \"derived from a nonhuman source.\" It doesn't meet that because that means that the source contributed to the sequence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE COURT: So you do agree then that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a compound is either human or humanized\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   in the context of this patent, these patents?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   COUNSEL: Under the claim constructions that the Court has given as they exist now, our understanding,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     yes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE COURT:\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     So they're mutually exclusive; correct?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   COUNSEL: If the claim construction is as we see it,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     yes.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     : Under my claim construction as you understand it, \"human\" and \"humanized\" are mutually exclusive; correct?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   COUNSEL:\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Yes.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Tr. 21-22) (emphases added)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court agrees with Janssen that no reasonable juror could conclude that daratumumab is a human antibody. This conclusion follows from the Court's claim construction and undisputed facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, any reasonable juror would conclude that daratumumab is a humanized antibody. The relevant facts are not in dispute: MorphoSys agrees that daratumumab was made using a transgenic mouse bearing a heterologous immune system and is based on a human germline sequence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 389 Ex. 17, Davis Dep.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   115-16, 133; Tr. 19-20) Thus, daratumumab is a humanized antibody as defined under romanette (i) of the Court's construction of \"humanized.\" Since daratumumab is \"humanized,\" it is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not \"not humanized\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\" and, therefore, is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not \"human.\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   MorphoSys contends, nonetheless, that there is sufficient evidence to find that daratumumab is not \"derived from a non-human source\" because the antibody is derived entirely from human genes. (D.I. 425 at 3) But MorphoSys' argument is premised on a flawed interpretation of \"derived from a non-human source.\" MorphoSys' interpretation excludes the specification's sole example of an antibody \"derived from a non-human source\": \"a transgenic mouse which bears a heterologous immune system.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '746 patent, 6:61-7:22) Thus, MorphoSys' argument fails as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Markman v.

(D.I. 425 at 1) In those contexts, however, Janssen was not using the term \"human\" as it appears in the patents or, crucially, as construed by the Court. At best, Janssen's usage of \"human\" might be considered extrinsic evidence as to the ordinary meaning of the claim term, but such extrinsic evidence may not be used to modify the meaning clearly directed by the intrinsic evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Janssen contends that the claims lack sufficient written description because the patents fail to disclose (1) any species of the Binding Claims (D.I. 383 at 13-17), (2) sufficiently representative species for any claimed genus (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-24), and (3) common structural features sufficient to visualize or recognize the claimed genera (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the reasons below, the Court concludes that a reasonable factfinder could find that: (1) a species was disclosed for the Binding Claims; and (2) representative species were disclosed for all asserted claims. The Court also concludes that any reasonable factfinder would find that the patents fail to disclose structural features common to the members of the genus in a manner sufficient to meet the written description requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Binding Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Janssen first argues that the patents lack written description for the Binding Claims, which are claims on antibodies that bind to certain parts of the CD38 protein. (D.I. 383 at 12-17) Specifically, Janssen contends that the patents fail to show actual possession of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   species of the Binding Claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14) To Janssen, the specification identifies only binding sites using peptide mapping experiments, and a person of ordinary skill in the art (\"POSA\") would know that peptide mapping experiments do not reliably identify binding sites. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16) Janssen further contends that the binding sites identified in Figure 7 of the patents for one particular antibody (MOR03080) are demonstrably false; Janssen conducted an x-ray crystallography experiment that, according to Janssen, proves that MOR03080 does not actually bind to CD38 at the locations identified in Figure 7. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17) Janssen also cites results obtained by MorphoSys in another peptide mapping study (\"the Replitope Report\") that showed different binding locations for MOR03080, and contends that the Replitope Report further illustrates the unreliability\n   of the binding data disclosed in the patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8) In view of all this evidence, Janssen asserts that no reasonable factfinder could find the specification conveys that MorphoSys was in actual possession of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   antibodies that bind to the regions of CD38 claimed in the patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   MorphoSys counters that even though peptide mapping results \"do not necessarily perfectly correspond\" to the binding location in a patient, peptide mapping is a \"valid tool\" that, at the time of the patent, was \"widely used\" to predict binding. (D.I. 424 at 17-18) MorphoSys notes that Defendants have also used peptide arrays to characterize binding and have presented these results to the PTO and the FDA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18) MorphoSys contends that Janssen's x-ray experiment is not relevant to the written description inquiry because it occurred after the priority date of the patents, and, in any event, that the x-ray crystallography data does not disprove the results disclosed in Figure 7. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Having considered the parties' arguments and evidence, the Court concludes that there are genuine disputes of material fact that preclude summary judgment of lack of written description for the Binding Claims. A reasonable factfinder could find that peptide mapping was recognized as sufficiently reliable to demonstrate possession to a POSA. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 387 Ex. 12, Messing\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reb. \u00b6\u00b6 77, 387, 386, 388, 456-460; D.I. 387 Ex. 11, Hubbard\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reb. \u00b6\u00b6 51-54) Janssen is correct that post-priority-date evidence can be considered where, as here, it is used to evaluate whether the disclosed species sufficiently represent the claimed genera.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amgen, Inc v.

Cir. 2017). Even so, based on the record evidence, a reasonable factfinder - taking the evidence in the light most favorable to MorphoSys - could find that Figure 7 of the patents conveys possession, notwithstanding the x-ray crystallography data and the Replitope Report.

Representative species\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Janssen next argues that the patents do not provide \"a representative number of species\" for\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of the claimed genera. (D.I. 383 at 19-24);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221514\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/1336/#p1344\">\n    598 F.3d at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To Janssen, this conclusion follows from the following facts that Janssen contends are not in genuine dispute: (1) the claims cover a very large number of actual and potential antibodies (D.I. 383 at 18-19); (2) the four disclosed antibodies differ dramatically from one another and from the other antibodies that fall within the scope of the claims (D.I. 383 at 20-21; D.I. 444 at 6-7); (3) the potential variants of the four disclosed antibodies are not representative of the full claim scope (D.I. 383 at 21-22; D.I. 444 at 5-6); and (4) daratumumab binds to completely different parts of CD38 than the disclosed\n   antibodies and could never have been made using the phage display method described in the patent (D.I. 383 at 22-23; D.I. 444 at 6). Janssen also contends that Dr. Messing's testimony that the four disclosed antibodies are representative is flawed because he applied the wrong standard. (D.I. 383 at 23-24)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   MorphoSys counters that there is a genuine issue as to the representativeness of the disclosed species because: (1) genuine disputes of fact exist regarding the size of the claimed genera (D.I. 424 at 18-22); (2) daratumumab and MOR03079 have substantial structural similarity, including 90% sequence similarity (D.I. 424 at 13); (3) daratumumab could have been made by a POSA employing the teachings of the patents (D.I. 424 at 13); and (4) besides daratumumab, Janssen has not actually identified any antibodies that are effective but are not variants of the disclosed antibodies and yet fall within the scope of the claims (D.I. 424 at 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court concludes that there are genuine issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment here. For example, a reasonable factfinder could find that the four disclosed antibodies are representative of all known members of the claimed genera, including daratumumab. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 386 Ex. 4C, Bradbury\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rep. \u00b6 175; D.I. 387 Ex. 12, Messing Reb. \u00b6 277; D.I. 426 Ex. 56, Bradbury Dep. 274)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Therefore, the Court will deny this portion of Janssen's summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Common structural features\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Janssen also contends that the patents fail to disclose any structural elements that would \"inform one of skill how to identify antibodies possessing the claimed properties.\" (D.I. 383 at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court agrees. As Janssen points out, the claims \"cover any and all CD38 antibodies that satisfy broad functional tests, yet the specification does not teach the necessary correlation between those claimed\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     functional\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   properties (i.e., binding within specific locations or different cell-killing activities) and the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     structural characteristics\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (e.g., the amino acid sequence) of antibodies having those properties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17) Indeed, multiple MorphoSys witnesses admit that an antibody's sequence cannot be used to predict its binding properties. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 392 Ex. 20, Messing Dep. 210-12 (stating that \"you couldn't say in terms of the primary sequence anything about the properties of the protein\"); D.I. 387 Ex. 12, Messing Reb. \u00b6 282 (stating that \"sequence similarity ... does not tell you about binding properties of antibodies\"); D.I. 392 Ex. 21, Landes\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dep. 79-80 (stating that \"[t]he primary sequence can't tell you where it's going to bind\") ) In fact, it is undisputed that even small changes to an antibody's sequence, particularly in the antibody's complementarity determining regions, can have dramatic and unpredictable effects on function. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 392 Ex. 22, Lund\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dep. 183-84 (stating that \"a single point mutation ... maybe ... would change the binding of the antibody ... to its target\"); D.I. 392 Ex. 20, Messing Dep. 163-64 (agreeing that \"you can't necessarily predict what the result of the change [to an antibody's sequence] is, but you can screen for it\") MorphoSys' expert, Dr. Messing, when asked in deposition if he would know whether a change made to an antibody's sequence would \"make the antibody\n   better, worse or the same,\" answered: \"No.... [T]hat's why you have to do the validation, the experiment.\" (D.I. 392 Ex. 20, Messing Dep. 164)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Given the undisputed lack of a known relationship between an antibody's structure (its sequence) and its function (its binding properties), the only reasonable conclusion is that the specification does not sufficiently disclose structural features common to the members of the genus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AbbVie Deutschland GmbH &amp; Co., KG v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 424 at 14-15) In particular, MorphoSys cites certain claims' limitations to \"human or humanized\" antibodies, limitations to \"IgG\" or \"IgG1\" antibodies, and limitations to antibodies with \"VH3 heavy chain\" and a \"kappa light chain.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As Janssen points out, it is undisputed that the structural features are present in many antibodies that do not bind to CD38, and some of the disclosed anti-CD38 antibodies do not possess these limitations. (D.I. 383 at 24-25) (citing D.I. 386 Ex. 4A, Bradbury Op. \u00b6\u00b6 256, 475-76) Thus, the asserted claims' structural limitations do not provide structure sufficient to satisfy the written description requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   MorphoSys also contends that the \"unique structural motif\" identified by Dr. Messing provides substantial evidence of common structural features. (D.I. 424 at 14-15) Dr. Messing obtained the motif (\"the pentapeptide motif\") by looking at a disclosed embodiment, MOR03079, and daratumumab, and identifying what MorphoSys contends are common structural features between the parts of the two antibodies that bind to the 192-206 region of the CD38 protein. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, the pentapeptide motif is not properly considered because it relies on knowledge that a POSA did not have at the priority date of the patents - namely, daratumumab's amino acid sequence and the knowledge that daratumumab binds to CD38.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221514\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/1336/#p1344\">\n    598 F.3d at 1351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] written description analysis occurs 'as of the filing date sought.' \").

The number of unique human antibodies that bind to CD38 is very large\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Any reasonable factfinder would have to find that very many unique anti-CD38 antibodies exist. Dr. Bradbury \"very conservative[ly]\" estimates that there are 10\n   <sup>\n    19\n   </sup>\n   (ten quintillion) anti-CD38 antibodies. (D.I. 386 Ex. 4A, Bradbury Op. \u00b6\u00b6 184-250) Although MorphoSys disputes Dr. Bradbury's methodology and this particular number (D.I. 424 at 18-22; D.I. 424 at 33-38; D.I. 442 at 20), MorphoSys does not genuinely dispute that the accurate number is very large.

(D.I. 386 Ex. 4A, Bradbury Op. \u00b6 300) In his estimation, every other claim would cover an even greater percentage of all human anti-CD38 antibodies.

Indeed, many of Dr. Bradbury's estimates are based on testimony by MorphoSys' experts. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 258 (relying on Dr. Ravetch's testimony);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 268 (relying on Dr. Eck's testimony) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   It follows that any reasonable factfinder would have to find that each claim covers a very large number of antibodies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    c. \"Non-conservative\" variants of known antibodies would have to be screened to determine their effectiveness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   It is undisputed that there are two ways of making new antibodies that come within\n   the scope of the claims: (1)\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , through methods like phage display (which were used to discover the antibodies expressly disclosed in the patents) and transgenic mice (which were used to discover daratumumab); or (2) by making variants of known effective antibodies. ( '746 patent, 10:44-15:51; D.I. 387 Ex. 12, Messing Reb. \u00b6\u00b6 212-27, 360) It is also undisputed that variants of an antibody can be made by substituting amino acids in either the framework regions of the antibody or in the CDRs of the antibody. ( '746 patent, 10:65-12:2, 15:3-8; D.I. 387 Ex. 12, Messing Reb. \u00b6\u00b6 212-27)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   It is further undisputed that \"conservative\" variants of antibodies that are known to be effective would be \"reasonably expected\" to be effective. (D.I. 386 Ex. 4C, Bradbury Rep. \u00b6 110; D.I. 426 Ex. 56, Bradbury Dep. 202:7-16) Here, \"conservative\" refers to \"conservative point substitutions,\" a process by which one makes substitutions only within the framework regions of an antibody. (D.I. 387 Ex. 12, Messing Reb. \u00b6\u00b6 212, 320) Based on the record, a reasonable factfinder would have to find that such \"conservative point substitutions\" would have a \"small impact\" on the antibody's functional properties, including whether it binds to CD38. (D.I. 387 Ex. 12, Messing Reb. \u00b6\u00b6 212, 320)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   However, it is further undisputed that an antibody made via\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     non-conservative\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   changes, especially by changes to the antibody's complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), would have to be screened in order to determine its effectiveness. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '746 patent, 15:3-17 (discussing making \"variants ... by diversifying one or more amino acid residues ... preferably ... in one or more CDRs, and by screening the resulting collection of antibody variants for variants with improved properties\"); D.I. 386 Ex. 4C, Bradbury Rep. \u00b6 38; D.I. 392 Ex. 20, Messing Dep. 162-63 (stating it \"makes sense\" that \"changes to the CDR region would be more likely to affect the activity of the antibody\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   163-64 (agreeing \"you can't necessarily predict what the result of [changing a CDR] is, but you can screen for it\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   244-45;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   100 (noting that when making changes to antibodies, \"[y]ou would have to search out which change is good, and there could also be some that are not good\") )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Thus, any reasonable factfinder would have to find that new antibodies within the claims can be discovered by varying known antibodies, and when this is done by non-conservative point substitutions, the resulting non-conservative variant would need to be screened to determine its effectiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Daratumumab is not a conservative variant of any antibody disclosed in the patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   There is no genuine dispute that daratumumab is not a conservative variant of any disclosed antibody. This conclusion follows logically from the following undisputed facts. As discussed above, it is undisputed that an antibody's binding properties are substantially dependent on its CDR, and that changes to a CDR affect an antibody's binding properties in an unpredictable manner. Thus, substantially changing the CDR of an antibody is not a conservative variation. It is also undisputed that daratumumab's CDR is only 35% similar to that of MOR03079, the most similar disclosed antibody. (D.I. 386, Ex. 4D, Bradbury Corr. \u00b6 319) Hence, the only reasonable conclusion is that daratumumab is not a conservative variant of MOR03079.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Obtaining antibodies within the claims that are not conservative variants of disclosed antibodies would require substantial time and effort by a POSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   While not undisputed, any reasonable factfinder would conclude that a POSA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   would require substantial time and effort to discover antibodies within the claims that are not conservative variants of the disclosed antibodies. As discussed above, a POSA could obtain such an antibody either by: (1) designing a variant of a known antibody; or (2) by isolating an antibody using a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   technique. In either case, as Janssen points out, \"each [antibody] would need to be designed or isolated, synthesized, and then screened for cell-killing activity, binding to various regions of CD38, and/or treatment of cancer, and sequenced to determine whether it met the framework limitations of the '590 patent.\" (D.I. 383 at 29)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Based on the record evidence, the only reasonable conclusion is that these steps would take a substantial amount of time and effort. For example, three of MorphoSys' experts characterized screening techniques as \"extremely laborious [and] involving trial-and-error experimentation,\" and exhibiting \"a lot of variability,\" \"tak[ing] a while to get them up and running,\" such as \"a period of months\" or \"longer.\" (D.I. 387 Ex. 11, Hubbard Reb. \u00b6 26 (describing x-ray crystallography ); Landes Dep. at 192-93 (describing cell-killing assays); D.I. 392 Ex. 20, Messing Dep. 260 (describing cell-killing assays) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   MorphoSys' own experience developing the disclosed antibodies supports this conclusion. It took MorphoSys four years between starting its CD38 program and filing its first provisional patent application. (D.I. 387 Ex. 12, Messing Reb. \u00b6 363) Several months of that time were needed to isolate, purify, and characterize the four disclosed antibodies (D.I. 392 Ex. 28, Dep. Ex. 1006 at 30) That MorphoSys attempted to develop MOR202 continuously for 15 years and still failed to obtain clinical approval further demonstrates the difficulty of antibody development. (D.I. 392 Ex. 24, Urban Tr. at 384-86) While there may well be genuine disputes as to the precise degree of difficulty, and the specific amount of time and effort required by a POSA to obtain a non-conservative but claimed variant, any reasonable factfinder would have to find that the time and effort involved would be substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Cir. 2014). The\n   <em>\n    Wands\n   </em>\n   factors are: \"(1) the quantity of experimentation necessary, (2) the amount of direction or guidance presented, (3) the presence or absence of working examples, (4) the nature of the invention, (5) the state of the prior art, (6) the relative skill of those in the art, (7) the predictability or unpredictability of the art, and (8) the breadth of the claims.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530779\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/731/#p737\">\n    858 F.2d at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Applying the\n   <em>\n    Wands\n   </em>\n   factors, the Court concludes, as a matter of law, that undue experimentation would be needed to practice the full scope of the claimed invention. First, with respect to \"the quantity of experimentation necessary,\" the Court finds that obtaining antibodies within the claims (other than conservative variants of disclosed antibodies) would require substantial time and effort by a POSA. Turning to \"the amount of direction or guidance presented\" and \"the presence or absence of working examples,\" the specifications are largely unhelpful. Although the patents provide four working examples, they do not teach a POSA how to predict from an antibody's sequence whether it will bind to CD38. Nor do the patents improve a POSA's ability to discover any of the countless antibodies within the\n   scope of the claims that are not a conservative variant of a disclosed antibody. Rather, a POSA attempting to obtain a claimed antibody that is not a variant of a known antibody would have to do essentially the same amount of work as the inventors of the patents-in-suit; like the inventors, a POSA would have to discover these antibodies\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   through phage display or another technique. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   '746 patent, 22:26-28 (noting that disclosed embodiments were generated using phage display)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   D.I. 387 Ex. 12, Messing Reb. \u00b6 352 (stating that POSA could use phage display or other techniques to generate further CD38 antibodies) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The specifications' deficiencies are particularly acute in view of the next four factors: \"the nature of the invention,\" \"the state of the prior art,\" \"the relative skill of those in the art,\" and \"the predictability or unpredictability of the art.\" A POSA would know that conservative variants of the disclosed antibodies could be designed and would be \"reasonably expected\" to be effective even without screening. However, not all antibodies covered by the claims are conservative variants of disclosed antibodies. That is, the claims also encompass non-conservative variants. A POSA would not be able to predict the function of these antibodies from their sequences. Rather, a POSA could only discover claimed embodiments that are non-conservative variants either (1) though trial and error, by making random, non-conservative changes to the disclosed antibodies and then screening those antibodies for desired binding properties, or (2) by discovering the antibodies\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   using, for example, phage display or transgenic mice. Each of these techniques would take a POSA substantial time and effort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Turning to the final factor, the Court finds that \"the breadth of the claims\" here is vast. There are a very large number of anti-CD38 antibodies, and a very large number of them meet the claims' other limitations. Where, as here, the claims recite functional limitations that cover countless embodiments in an unpredictable field, the specification must do more than place a POSA at \"a starting point ... for further research\" and instruct them to \"engage in an iterative, trial-and-error process.\"\n   <em>\n    ALZA Corp. v.

Yet, with respect to the claimed non-conservative variants, that is essentially what the patents here do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   MorphoSys contends that any experimentation required to practice the invention would be \"routine.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 424 at 27-28; D.I. 399 at 28-33; D.I. 442 at 13-15) In particular, MorphoSys contends that a POSA could \"readily\" generate a number of antibodies, including MOR03079 and related antibodies, which a POSA could \"reasonably expect\" to come within the claims. (D.I. 399 at 29; D.I. 424 at 27; D.I. 442 at 13) To MorphoSys, the specification \"supplement[s] the knowledge of a POSA that amino acid substitutions between sequences are often tolerated without giving rise to substantial differences in behavior.\" (D.I. 424 at 27) (internal quotation marks omitted) But this contention - even accepted as true at this stage does not get to the relevant question: whether the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     full scope\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of the claims, which is quite broad, is enabled.

MorphoSys contends that \"[u]nlike in\n   <em>\n    Idenix\n   </em>\n   , it is undisputed that a POSA could readily generate a number of antibodies falling within the scope of the claims and that the specification enables one of skill in the art to make exemplary antibodies from the specification.\" (D.I. 399 at 36) (internal citations, quotation marks, and emphases omitted) It is true that a POSA, armed with MorphoSys' patents, could \"readily\" create conservative variants of the disclosed antibodies and \"reasonably expect\" them to work. (D.I. 386 Ex. 4C, Bradbury Rep. \u00b6 110; D.I. 426 Ex. 56, Bradbury Dep. 202) But, again, this is inadequate.

These working embodiments, however, were only a subset of all embodiments covered by the claims, and a POSA could not have discovered the non-disclosed working embodiments without undue experimentation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *21-22. The same circumstances are present here, warranting the same conclusion: the full scope of the claims is not enabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   MorphoSys also argues that the claims in\n   <em>\n    WEI\n   </em>\n   covered \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     different classes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" of compounds that could not be practiced without undue experimentation, whereas the claims here \"all recite a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     single class\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of compounds well defined by a structure: an antibody.\" (D.I. 442 at 18-19) (emphasis added) Relatedly, MorphoSys contends that a specification only fails to enable the 'full scope' of a claim if there are \"a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     significant subset of embodiments - generally an entire class\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" - that a POSA would not have been able to make without undue experimentation.

Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that, even drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of MorphoSys, clear and convincing evidence shows that each of the patents-in-suit is invalid for lack of enablement. The Court will grant Janssen's motion for summary judgment of invalidity for lack of enablement and will deny MorphoSys' motion for summary judgment of no lack of enablement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The Binding Claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   are claims directed to antibodies that bind to a specific part of the CD38 protein. Janssen contends that the Binding Claims are indefinite because the patents do not make sufficiently clear which measurement technique to use to determine whether an antibody meets the binding properties recited\n   by the Binding Claims. (D.I. 383 at 31-35) The Court disagrees. As MorphoSys notes (D.I. 424 at 33-34), the patents clearly describe measuring binding using PepSpot, which is MorphoSys' tool for peptide mapping. ( '746 patent, 26:27-27:36) As MorphoSys contends, a POSA would know to measure binding using PepSpot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Janssen's analogies to\n   <em>\n    Teva\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dow\n   </em>\n   are not persuasive. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 383 at 32-33) In\n   <em>\n    Teva\n   </em>\n   , the term found indefinite, \"molecular weight,\" was used in the specification in a way that suggested \"peak average molecular weight,\" defined by the patentee during prosecution as \"weight average molecular weight,\" and then defined separately during prosecution as \"peak average molecular weight.\"\n   <em>\n    Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232454\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/1335/#p1341\">\n    789 F.3d 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1344-45 (Fed. Cir. 2015). In\n   <em>\n    Dow\n   </em>\n   , the term found indefinite, \"slope of strain hardening,\" could have been computed four different ways, yet the intrinsic evidence was entirely silent as to which method to use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dow Chemical Co. v. Nova Chemicals Corp. (Canada)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347548\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/620/#p634\">\n    803 F.3d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 634 (Fed. Cir. 2015). Here, by contrast, the intrinsic evidence repeatedly and consistently describes the use of PepSpot to measure binding properties. ( '746 patent, 26:27-27:36)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Janssen contends that a POSA would not use PepSpot to measure binding because \"there is no dispute that PepSpot cannot definitively measure binding to the actual CD38 protein.\" (D.I. 444 at 17-18) In support of this contention, Janssen relies on binding data for MOR03080 from the Replitope Report and Janssen's x-ray crystallography experiment, which Janssen argues shows the inaccuracy of peptide mapping techniques like PepSpot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But Janssen's extrinsic evidence - which would have been unavailable to a POSA at the pertinent date of the patent - is not relevant to the indefiniteness inquiry as the intrinsic evidence unambiguously conveys to a POSA that epitope mapping techniques like PepSpot can be used to measure an antibody's binding properties. ( '746 patent, 26:1-27:36;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051592\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/90/1576/#p1583\">\n    90 F.3d 1576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1996) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   For the above reasons, the Janssen has failed to meet its burden to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Binding Claims are indefinite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   For the reasons given above, the Court concludes that: (1) Janssen does not infringe the \"human\" antibody claims; (2) none of the patents-in-suit discloses sufficient structural features common to the members of the claimed genera to meet the written description requirement; and (3) each of the patents-in-suit is invalid for lack of enablement. Janssen's motions for summary judgment will be granted on those bases. The Court will: (1) deny the remainder of Janssen's motion for summary judgment with respect to written description; (2) deny Janssen's motion for summary judgment with respect to indefiniteness; and (3) deny MorphoSys' motion for summary judgment with respect to enablement. An appropriate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    The parties also argued other summary judgment motions (D.I. 391, 388),\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n    motions (D.I. 380, 393, 395, 396, 398), and motions to strike (D.I. 419, 435).
