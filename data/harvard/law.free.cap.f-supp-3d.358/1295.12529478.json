PIZZO, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a breach of franchise agreement case involving a Maryland-based chicken wing franchise (Defendant franchisor Cluck-U Corp. and its sole shareholder, Defendant Pierre Haddad), a franchisee's attempt at a Florida location (Plaintiff Cluck-U Chicken, Inc. and its owner, Anthony Tartaglia), and the undoing of their business relationship. The parties have litigated in Maryland, where Defendants sued Plaintiffs, and in this Court, where Plaintiffs sued Defendants. The Maryland district court transferred its case here; then this Court consolidated the two cases, and the parties consented to my jurisdiction. Now, both sides have moved for summary judgments on the dozen-plus claims that are outstanding with both sides complaining about each other's conduct and egging each other on by hurling a hodgepodge of legal and equitable actions against each other (docs. 129, 130, 140, 142). The Plaintiffs say the Defendants breached the franchise agreement, committed business torts, and violated assorted statutes regulating such business transactions. The Defendants say the Plaintiffs violated the franchise agreement and then infringed their intellectual property rights during a limited temporal period after the two sides parted ways. And importantly, both sides say the other side made misrepresentations or material omissions leading up to their failed relationship. Having considered all the motions and responses, I grant Defendants' summary judgment motion (doc. 129) as to Plaintiffs' Florida Franchise Act claim (count two) and Florida Sale of Business Opportunities Act claim (count three). I also grant Defendant Haddad summary judgment on Plaintiffs' negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract claim. I also find that Plaintiffs' request for a declaratory judgment concerning the franchise agreement's non-compete provisions is moot, as are Defendants' claims for injunctive relief; otherwise,\n   the motions are denied given the disputed factual landscape.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    A.

For issues on which the non-movant bears the burden of proof at trial, the moving party may show the court that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case, or it may support its motion for summary judgment with affirmative evidence demonstrating that the non-moving party will be unable to prove its case at trial.\n   <em>\n    Fitzpatrick v.

Undisputed Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Cluck-U brand was created in 1985 by Robert Ilvento, who dropped out of Rutgers University to open his first chicken wing restaurant near that campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey. (doc. 131 at 4 (Ilvento Dep. 14:5-14) ) The concept of locating a fast-food chicken wing restaurant within walking distance of a college campus was a successful one. So successful that in the early 1990s, Ilvento began offering Cluck-U franchises for sale. (Ilvento Dep. 16:17-18) Around that time, Defendant Haddad opened a Cluck-U location in New Jersey with Ilvento as co-owner; Haddad eventually bought out Ilvento's interest in that location. (Ilvento Dep. 16:5-12)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   He moved up in the pecking order to become Cluck-U's master franchise developer for Maryland and then, in 2000, Haddad bought the Cluck-U franchise rights outright from Ilvento for $ 400,000. (Ilvento Dep. 19:11-21; 25:6-9) As a part of the deal, Ilvento retained the right to sell Cluck-U sauces to grocery stores and restaurants and to receive royalties from then-existing locations. (Ilvento Dep. 13:7-16; 24:21-25:5; doc. 133-11 at 7 (Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) at Item 1) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under Haddad, the brood of Cluck-U restaurants expanded to Maryland, North Carolina, Delaware, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Lebanon. (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   doc. 133 at 4 (Haddad Dep. at 14:14-15:15) ) In December 2012, at Plaintiff Tartaglia's initiative, Haddad and Ilvento met with Tartaglia (a Florida resident) in Maryland and hatched a plan to open a Florida restaurant. (Ilvento Dep. 26:7-10) Before signing the franchise agreement, Plaintiff Tartaglia traveled from Florida to Maryland to visit Cluck-U's corporate offices; he visited Maryland retail locations; and he recruited three other men - Phil Kahn, David Levine, and Paul DeCosta - to either invest in a Florida location or help him start one. (doc. 140-5, Tartaglia Dep. 109:15-22) At Tartaglia's urging, his ex-wife and employee, Cheryl Tartaglia, toured numerous Cluck-U locations on the east coast. (Tartaglia Dep. 141:24-142:1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cluck-U presented Plaintiffs with its standard franchise agreement and most recent franchise disclosure document dated October 2012. (doc. 1, ex. A) The parties executed the franchise agreement on May 21, 2013, with amendments signed in June and July 2013. (doc. 1, ex. A; doc. 133-11 at 238). The agreement includes a Maryland choice of law provision: \"This franchise agreement and the construction thereof shall be governed by the laws of the state of Maryland without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\" (doc. 1 at 75). Around that time, Tartaglia also signed an Independent Investigation Acknowledgment, which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I have telephone or visited current Cluck-U Chicken restaurant(s). I base the decision to purchase a Cluck-U Corp. franchise solely and completely upon the findings of that independent investigation and the Franchise Disclosure Document provided to me by Cluck-U, Corp. and not on any oral representations whatsoever. I have thoroughly reviewed the Franchise Disclosure Document and all pertinent documents ... Cluck-U, Corp. is not responsible for the financial performance, or overall outcome, of the unit; this is my responsibility alone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (doc. 129-2). Tartaglia signed a personal guaranty as well. It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Guarantor[ ] hereby unconditionally, irrevocably and directly guarantee to Franchisor the prompt, punctual and full: (a) payment when due ... of all principal and interest, interest or principal, royalties, franchise fees, and of all other monies payable under the Agreement; and (b) performance when due of all covenants, promises, agreements, and the accuracy and completeness of all representations and warranties, contained in the Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (doc. 1 at 84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In June 2013, Tartaglia, Kahn, and Levine signed a shareholder's agreement for Cluck-U Chicken, Inc., the company through which the franchise operated, with each shareholder owning one-third of the corporation. (doc. 129-4 at 2) Tartaglia also completed a written application for a Cluck-U franchise on behalf of himself and Plaintiff Cluck-U Chicken, Inc. Tartaglia, Khan, and DeCosta submitted personal financial profiles to Cluck-U as a part of the application process. (docs. 129-9; 133-10) In\n   this paperwork, Tartaglia did not disclose that he had prior bankruptcy filings and a criminal conviction for writing a bad check. (Ilvento Dep. 45:20-46:6) Tartaglia also had a smaller income stream than he represented. (doc. 129-8 at 3) Sometime between June 2013, when he signed the Cluck-U Chicken, Inc. shareholder's agreement, and 2015, Tartaglia's share of the corporation was reduced to 1 percent. (doc. 129-5 at 4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   But accusations fly in both directions, with each side squawking that the other misrepresented key information. Defendants - for their part - did not provide Plaintiffs with quarterly updates to the October 2012 franchise disclosure document. The October 2012 franchise disclosure document was current through the end of 2011; it listed the locations of all Cluck-U franchisees as of 2011 but did not list 2012 store closures. The franchise disclosure document also estimated initial build-out costs to be between $ 65,000 and $ 80,000 (FDD at Item 7); Plaintiffs spent $ 350,000 renovating their leased space (Haddad Dep. 73:7-74:6); Defendants estimated total start-up costs to be between $ 250,000 and $ 350,000 (FDD at 1); and Plaintiffs spent more than $ 600,000 to get the franchise up and running. The franchise disclosure document estimated that the opening inventory would cost between $ 10,000 and $ 13,000 (FDD at Item 7); Plaintiffs spent $ 50,000. According to the franchise disclosure document, Defendants would train at least four of Plaintiffs' managers at an already-existing Cluck-U restaurant (not Plaintiffs' Florida location) and in a classroom setting for a minimum of four weeks (20 hours per week of classroom/computer training; 20 hours per week of on-site training). (FDD at Item 11) Defendants did not implement this training regime and instead sent a trainer to Plaintiffs' restaurant for an abbreviated period. (Haddad Dep. 115:21-116:4; 120:13-17) It is a chicken-or-the-egg scenario: Plaintiffs contend Defendants misrepresented start-up costs; Defendants retort that Tartaglia deliberately upgraded the Florida restaurant with expensive fryers and a point-of-sale system that was more sophisticated than the system utilized by all other locations, among other costly improvements, and insisted on operating as a sit-down (rather than a fast-food) restaurant. (Griggs Dep. 16:2-7, 12-16; Tartaglia Dep. 137:16-138:4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nonetheless, in February 2014, before the restaurant opened its doors, Tartaglia signed an Acknowledgment of Ready to Open for Business and a separate Acknowledgment of Completion of Franchisor Obligations. These documents stated: \"We believe that we are ready to open for business and we have our staff trained and the store is completely done and stocked.\" (doc. 129-10). And: \"We are satisfied that Cluck-U Corp. has completely met all their contractual obligations without exception, and has fully performed as per all the representations made in the Franchise Agreement, Franchise Offering Circular, and other disclosure documents.\" (doc. 129-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The restaurant opened in early 2014. Although non-party Khan was Plaintiffs' primary investor, Tartaglia ruled the roost and managed the Florida restaurant's daily operations. (Griggs Dep. 37:4-38:8) The restaurant never performed as well as Defendants had predicted and as Plaintiffs had imagined. The initial build-out cost more than projected; the opening inventory cost more; and the food and supplies cost more. Eventually, Tartaglia's ex-wife (they divorced in 2004), who had assisted with the build-out and was skilled at smoothing ruffled feathers between Tartaglia and Haddad, flew the coop. (doc. 140-2, Griggs Dep. 14:4-23; 15:8-14; 38:10-24) In February 2015, despite a grim outlook,\n   Tartaglia put all his eggs in one basket. He contemplated doubling-down on his investment and emailed Defendant Haddad requesting a meeting \"to go over the possibility of the purchase of Cluck-U-Corp. Also the future of our operation in North Port shall be discussed.\" (doc. 129-12). Haddad was receptive to the idea. (doc. 140-21)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants attempted to assist Plaintiffs' bottom line by waiving royalties for the Florida location, permitting Tartaglia to deviate from standard menu offerings, and allowing him to purchase food and supplies from other vendors. (Ilvento Dep. 36:1-21; Haddad Dep. 79:8-23) ) But by July 2015, the sky was falling - the relationship between the parties had soured and business had not picked up. Plaintiffs demanded Defendants rescind the franchise agreement, claiming Defendants had not performed their obligations and had misrepresented the health of the franchise in the franchise disclosure document. (doc. 131 at 2, Tartaglia Decl. at \u00b6 7) This ruffled Defendants' feathers - they refused. Plaintiffs put a fork in their Florida Cluck-U operation the next month. (Tartaglia Decl. at \u00b6 8) Tartaglia operated the restaurant as Boardwalk Tony's until March 2016, when that restaurant closed for good without making a profit. (Tartaglia Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 16-17)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    C. The Causes of Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This case, which is the product of two separate causes of actions in two districts, is more complicated than it should be. Plaintiffs assert seven causes of action against each Defendant (doc. 1): fraudulent inducement (count one); violation of the Florida Franchise Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20817.416\">\n    Fla.

Stat. \u00a7 501.201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (count four); a declaratory judgment that the non-compete provisions of the parties' franchise agreement are unenforceable (count five); breach of the parties' franchise agreement (count six); and negligent misrepresentation (count seven).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   All these claims center on nine alleged misrepresentations by Defendants: (1) Defendants told Plaintiffs that the franchise was growing but provided Plaintiffs with outdated information about the number of operating franchisees; (2) Defendants misrepresented the start-up costs for a Cluck-U operation; (3) Defendants did not follow through on their promise to provide Plaintiffs with site and market criteria; (4) Defendants did not provide Plaintiffs with lists of equipment with the build-out requirements necessary to start operating; (5) Defendants required Plaintiffs to purchase extra inventory just prior to opening that was not previously disclosed; (6) Defendants promised to provide formal training for employees, both in the classroom and at an existing Cluck-U location; this training did not occur; (7) Defendants did not assist Plaintiffs with advertising as promised; (8) Defendants said they would negotiate competitive prices for food and supplies on behalf of franchisees but did not; and (9) Defendants predicted Plaintiffs' location would be profitable. All but the last of these alleged misrepresentations relate to the franchise disclosure document rather than the franchise agreement. From all this, Plaintiffs contend the relevant facts (even when viewed from the Defendants' perspective) warrant summary judgment on their\n   counts one, two, four, and five (doc. 130). Defendants, on the other hand, move for summary judgment on all of Plaintiffs' claims (docs. 129, 140).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants countersue (doc. 94) for breach of franchise agreement; trademark infringement under federal and common law (for the time period when Plaintiffs ceased operating their restaurant under the Cluck-U name and instead operated as Boardwalk Tony's); trade dress infringement; unfair competition under federal and common law; trademark dilution; trafficking in counterfeit marks in violation of Maryland's business code; violation of Maryland's uniform trade secrets act; breach of guaranty agreement (against Plaintiff Tartaglia only); civil fraud (against Plaintiff Tartaglia only); intentional and negligent misrepresentation; unjust enrichment; and fraudulent conveyance. Defendants contend that it was Tartaglia who misrepresented information - they would not have sold him a franchise opportunity if they had known he had a low net worth and a past peppered with bankruptcies and financial troubles. Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on all of Defendants' claims (docs. 130, 142).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    D. Choice of Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs' portion of this case is grounded on diversity - a Florida franchisee suing a Maryland franchisor in federal court in Florida for breaches of a franchise agreement with a Maryland choice of law provision. Also thrown into the proverbial fryer are Plaintiffs' tort and statutory claims under Florida law. The result is a roux containing tort, contract, quasi-contract, statutory, and multi-state ingredients with conduct and laws regulating that conduct occurring in Florida and Maryland. And all this prompts choice-of-law questions: which state's laws govern which causes of action? Choice-of-law issues are often thorny, and the parties' wing-and-a-prayer pleadings and their confusing motions do not offer much clarity. For example, Plaintiffs appear to request summary judgment on all of Defendants' claims but do not organize their argument count-by-count; Defendants, for their part, argue against rescission as an available remedy but - again - do not proceed on a count-by-count basis. As explained below, the result - one I reached after disentangling the parties' slipshod arguments - is that Maryland law applies to all but Plaintiffs' FDUTPA claim, and Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' Florida Franchise Act claim (count two) and Florida Sale of Business Opportunities Act claim (count three). Having settled the choice-of-law score, and having considered the elements applicable for the remaining claims, disputed issues of fact exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Defendants are a Maryland corporation and a Maryland resident. The franchise location was in North Port, Florida, which is where Plaintiffs allegedly suffered their damages. But the franchise agreement is governed by Maryland law; Defendants made their alleged misrepresentations in Maryland; and Defendants' principal place of business is in Maryland. It is undisputed that Plaintiffs first approached Defendants in Maryland with the idea of opening a Florida location and visited Defendants' Maryland corporate offices and a retail location in Maryland before negotiating the franchise agreement. Plaintiff Tartaglia also testified to sending his ex-wife and former employee to franchise locations in New Jersey and Maryland in preparation for opening the Florida location. The franchise agreement was mailed from Defendants' Maryland office to Plaintiffs. Also established is that Defendant Haddad visited North Port,\n   Florida at least three times to observe Plaintiffs' progress and to help them establish their location. Defendants sent a corporate trainer to North Port before the franchise opened for business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Taking a bird's eye view of the case, I find that Plaintiffs' tort claims are inexorably tied to the transactions that culminated in the parties' franchise agreement. In fact, in each claim, Plaintiffs incorporate all of the allegations regarding Defendants' misrepresentations and omissions. Plaintiffs' complaint and the record evidence convince me that Plaintiffs' case centers on Defendants' misrepresentations in the franchise disclosure document, a document generated by Defendants' corporate office in Maryland. Defendants have no other franchisees in Florida. Maryland is hub of this dispute and has the most significant relationship to Plaintiffs' tort claims; therefore, I will apply Maryland law to Plaintiffs' fraudulent inducement claim (count 1), and negligent misrepresentation claim (count 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs' claim under FDUTPA is trickier - like Plaintiffs' common law tort claims, it does not arise out of a contract, and it does not exist solely for the benefit of the contracting parties.

Plaintiffs implicitly concede this: Defendants argue in their summary judgment motion that provisions in the franchise agreement disclaim Defendants' liability and excuse them from compliance with franchise laws. In response, Plaintiffs cite to Maryland's franchise law, which includes an anti-waiver provision that prohibits a franchisor from relying on disclaimers and integration clauses to defeat liability. This choice of law analysis as applied to Plaintiffs' claim under the Florida Franchise Act is dispositive of the claim. I find that Florida's franchise statutes are inapplicable to this dispute based on the parties' intent that Maryland law govern their franchise agreement, the dispute's contacts with Maryland, and the fact that neither side has argued that applying Maryland to this dispute is against Florida's public policy.

It requires a franchisor to provide prospective franchisees with a complete and accurate basic disclosure document containing twenty-three categories of information. Plaintiffs' argument is that, under Florida law, Defendants' failure to strictly comply with the FTC's Franchise Rule is a per se deceptive and unfair trade practice. But this is not the law in Florida. Liability under FDUTPA requires more than a mere technical violation of the FTC's Franchise Rule. In the Eleventh Circuit, a party \"must [also] prove that the alleged [deceptive or unfair] practice was likely to deceive a consumer acting reasonably in the same circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Cold Stone Creamery,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4255500\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/332/565/#p567\">\n    332 F.

The parties also agree that Defendants did not train Plaintiffs' staff at an existing Cluck-U location. But these facts are not enough to establish Defendants' liability as a matter of law because Plaintiffs fail to offer evidence that Defendants' alleged violations of the Franchise Rule would have misled a consumer acting reasonably in the same circumstances. On the other hand, Defendants offer evidence that driving up the start-up costs were Plaintiffs' upgrades to the facility and restaurant equipment. These upgrades were not standard at Cluck-U's other locations and made training difficult. Summary judgment as to this claim is therefore inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    5.

But the Florida location - be it Cluck-U Chicken or Boardwalk Tony's - is closed. Plaintiffs do not operate a restaurant from the facility and do not intend to reopen.

Here, although Plaintiffs allege that Cluck-U (through Haddad) made numerous fraudulent misrepresentations, these assertions are insufficient as a matter of law to sustain Plaintiffs' breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation claims against Haddad as the corporation's individual shareholder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs' fraud claim against Haddad, on the other hand, survives. Construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, there are disputed facts that Haddad was a knowing personal participant in the fraud. For example, Plaintiff cites to evidence that Haddad was responsible for the franchise disclosure document and the primary decision-maker for the franchisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    F. Defendants' Counterclaims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiffs move for summary judgment on Defendants' claims, a baker's dozen of tort, contract, and trademark causes of action. But Plaintiffs' motion is not a model of clarity. Plaintiffs do not proceed through Defendants' claims count-by-count. They do not analyze (or even list) the elements of each cause of action or point to undisputed facts establishing that summary judgment is appropriate as to each claim. They request summary judgment on all of Defendants' claims but do not particularize their arguments. I will not do their work for them but make these observations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   First, as stated above, Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on Defendants' requests for injunctive relief. Second, Plaintiffs ask me to find that Defendants violated the FTC's Franchise Rule. But this is not a private right of action, and as explained above, and technical violations of the Franchise Rule are not per se violations of FDUTPA. A triable issue exists regarding whether Defendants' representations and omissions were material and whether Plaintiffs reasonably relied on them. Third, Plaintiffs also ask for blanket summary judgment on all of Defendants' counterclaims because Plaintiffs are entitled to rescind the franchise agreement. The factual landscape detailed above, with each side alleging the other has unclean hands, does not establish Plaintiffs' right to this remedy as a matter of law. Fourth, without a hint at irony Plaintiffs argue Defendants\n   cannot recover against Tartaglia based on the incomplete financial profile he offered when applying for a franchise, because \"[w]here a party has ample time and ability to conduct an investigation into the legitimacy of another party, its failure to do so is attributable to a lack of due diligence, and it is precluded from asserting that it was inadequately informed.\" (doc. 130 at 23). I reject this argument. And, finally, I deny Plaintiffs' request for summary judgment on Defendants' counterclaims (again, a general request) based on Defendants' failure to exercise its option to take over the Florida restaurant's lease. Plaintiffs do not tie this argument to a particular count and I cannot make sense of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    G.
