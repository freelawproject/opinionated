The court now GRANTS the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Hartford is an insurance company organized under the laws of Indiana with its principal place of business in Connecticut. Since 2013, Hartford has provided business liability insurance to Swapp Law, a Utah limited liability company, under policy number 34 SBA PF678 SC (\"the Policy\") that was renewed annually.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Policy covers claims brought against Swapp Law arising from bodily injury, property damage, and personal and advertising injury, subject to specified exclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At issue in this suit is whether Hartford must defend and indemnify Swapp Law from personal and advertising injury claims brought against Swapp Law in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington in the Underlying Action for alleged violations of a federal statute, the Driver's Privacy Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202721\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"DPPA\"). The class action plaintiffs in the Underlying Action allege that between September 2013 and May 2016, Swapp Law \"purchased more than 10,000 accident reports from the Washington State Patrol\" that were used \"to mail numerous letters and glossy pamphlets advertising [Swapp Law's] services to motorists\" in violation of the DPPA. Mot. J. Pleadings at 6-7. The DPPA violations are the sole cause of action brought by the class action plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hartford argues that the claims in the Underlying Action are not covered by the Policy because they fall under two separate exclusions. The first excludes coverage for claims arising solely from federal or state statute (the \"Statutory Exclusion\"). The second excludes coverage for claims arising from materials distributed in violation of a statute (the \"Distribution Exclusion\"). Hartford seeks a declaratory judgment that it is neither required to defend nor indemnify Swapp Law. Swapp Law asks the court to decide whether there is a duty to defend but requests the court defer ruling on the duty to indemnify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

According to Hartford, those claims are excluded from coverage under the Policy by two exclusions: the Statutory Exclusion and the Distribution Exclusion. The court agrees with Hartford that there is no duty to defend because the damages claimed in the Underlying Action are excluded under the Statutory Exclusion. Because the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, Hartford also has no duty to indemnify Swapp Law for its alleged violations of the DPPA. In light of the court's holding that the Statutory Exclusion applies, the court need not and does not consider the applicability of the Distribution Exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Statutory Exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Hartford argues that the damages claimed in the Underlying Action are not covered by the Policy because they arise from violations of a federal statute and thus are excluded by the Policy's Statutory Exclusion. The Statutory Exclusion excludes from the Policy coverage for claims for personal and advertising injury \"arising out of the violation of a person's right of privacy created by any state or federal act.\" Policy, Business Liability Form \u00a7 B (1)(p)(11). There is, however, an exception to the Statutory Exclusion that states \"this exclusion does not apply to liability for damages that the insured would have in the absence of such state or federal act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10423360\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/714/1143/#p1146\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While Swapp Law does not contest the applicability of the exclusion itself, it argues that the claims at issue in the Underlying Action fall under the exception to the exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hartford asks the court to follow\n   <em>\n    Hartford Cas.

In that virtually identical case, the underlying action asserted a single claim for damages under the DPPA for the improper acquisition and distribution of motor vehicle records that were then used to distribute legal pamphlets. The district court held that any claim for relief asserted under the DPPA is \"solely a creature of federal law, which defeats coverage under the plain language of this exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=742%20Fed.%20Appx.%20738\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at *4.

The DPPA explicitly prohibits the release of \"personal information\" and \"highly restricted personal information.\" By definition, the statute creates a right to recover damages for violation of a privacy right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maracich v.

When a party asserts a claim under the DPPA, the party alleges a violation of the privacy right protected by the statute. Thus, the claim brought against Swapp Law in the Underlying Action is a claim for a \"personal and advertising injury\" that \"aris[es] out of the violation of a person's right of privacy created by any state or federal act.\" The damages claimed in the Underlying Action therefore fall under the Statutory Exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Statutory Exclusion Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Having concluded that the Statutory Exclusion applies, the court turns its attention to the applicability of the exception to the exclusion. The Policy states that the Statutory \"[E]xclusion does not apply to liability for damages that the insured would have in the absence of such state or federal act.\" Policy, Business Liability Form \u00a7 B (1)(p)(11). The meaning of this exception is disputed by the parties. Hartford alleges that the exception requires the insured to establish the existence of a separate cause of action for damages under Washington law that plaintiffs could have included in the Underlying Action. Because no such cause of action exists under Washington common law, Hartford maintains that the exception does not apply. In contrast Swapp Law asserts that because the DPPA protects privacy rights, the only issue is whether a \"right of privacy\" has been invaded, not whether the invasion is actionable under Washington common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The burden is on Swapp Law to establish that the exception applies, thus any ambiguity should be resolved in Hartford's\n   favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

But the language of the exception is unambiguous. It explicitly requires that there be \"liability for damages\" absent the statute, not just a violation of some amorphous right. The court must therefore decide whether Swapp Law would be liable for the alleged damages in the absence of the DPPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because the contractual duty to defend is conditioned on potential liability for damages, the court must look beyond the four corners of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fire Ins.

And holding that driver's information is not protected from law enforcement officials is not tantamount to holding that there is no privacy interest in the information at all. The court must therefore more fully examine Washington law to determine whether it would support a claim for damages in the Underlying Action absent the DPPA or a Washington state statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Current Washington state law does recognize a privacy interest in driving records. However, it does so pursuant to statute. Washington's disclosure statute, Revised Washington Code 46.12.635, provides that, except under certain circumstances, \"the name or address of an individual vehicle or vessel owner shall not be released by the department, county auditor, or agency or firm authorized by the department.\" RCW 46.12.635 (2016). The subsequent section, RCW 46.12.640, establishes penalties for \"unauthorized disclosure of information\" and other violations of RCW 46.12.635. Importantly, however, there is no private cause of action for damages under the statute. And even if a claim for damages had been brought pursuant to RCW 46.12.640, those damages would still be excluded from coverage under the Policy because they arise out of a\n    state statute and the Statutory Exclusion applies to claims for damages arising under both federal and\n    <em>\n     state\n    </em>\n    statutes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The court has been unable to locate any authority suggesting that Washington recognized a \"constitutionally protected privacy interest in ... drivers' records\" in Washington prior to the passage of RCW 46.12.635 (formerly codified at 46.12.380) in 1990.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    In fact, the Washington legislature \"recognized an important privacy interest in driver's license records\"\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    when it passed RCW 46.12.635.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    And there is absolutely nothing to suggest that Washington recognized a common law claim for damages arising from a recognized privacy interest in driver's license or motor vehicle information prior to the passage of the statute. In short, any right of action that may currently exist under Washington law\n    <em>\n     was created by statute\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Big 5 Sporting Goods Corp. v.
