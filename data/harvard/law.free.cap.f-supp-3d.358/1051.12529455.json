Dechow, Jr., Anthony Evans, Douglas Klein, and Victoria Scott (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") filed a Motion to Remand. Dkt. No. 15. Defendant Gilead Sciences (\"Defendant\" or \"Gilead\") opposed the motion and Plaintiffs filed a reply. Dkt. Nos. 16, 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court heard oral argument on February 1, 2019 and took the matter under submission. For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs are citizens of Virginia (Dechow), Pennsylvania (Evans), New York (Klein), and Louisiana (Scott). Complaint, p. 5-6 (Dkt. No. 2-1). Plaintiffs are consumers of Defendant Gilead's tenofovir and tenofovir-based antiviral medications, Viread and Truvada. Compl. at 1. Plaintiffs were prescribed Gilead's medication for treatment or as part of a pre-exposure prophylactic program to reduce the risk of new infections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Gilead is a citizen of California and Delaware. Notice of Removal, p. 2 (Dkt. No. 2). Gilead is a pharmaceutical company that develops and markets prescription medicines, including Viread and Truvada. Compl. at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 19, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in the Superior Court for Los\n   Angeles County. Plaintiffs allege that Gilead deceptively promoted two of its prescription medications-Viread and Truvada-as safe when, according to Plaintiffs, those medications can cause kidney and bone injuries. Compl. at 1-4. Plaintiffs contend that while Gilead was promoting Viread and Truvada as effective and safe for kidneys and bones, Gilead was aware of a safer and more effective alternative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that they suffered kidney and/or bone injuries as a result of their use of Viread and Truvada.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs assert claims for: (1) strict products liability (design defect and failure to warn); (2) negligent products liability (design defect and failure to warn); (3) breach of implied warranty; and (4) breach of express warranty. Compl. at 14-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Defendant asserts that this Court has diversity jurisdiction over the case because the parties have complete diversity and the amount in controversy exceeds $ 75,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.

The Court noted that the facts of that case distinguish it from the others that have addressed the issue of pre-service removal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Specifically, the Court held \"[i]f defendants were permitted to remove a case before the plaintiff even had the opportunity to serve them, this would effectively circumvent Congress's entire statutory scheme and render \u00a7 1441(b)(2) superfluous. Such an application could not have been intended by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Such \"absurd or bizarre results\" are not at stake here, where Plaintiffs had the summons available prior to Defendant's removal. Indeed, Plaintiffs had nearly two weeks to effectuate service before Defendant removed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   While the facts here do not support Plaintiffs' position, the Court does recognize that there are differing factual scenarios that may impair or restrict proper service, where applying the plain meaning interpretation of \u00a7 1441(b)(2) could produce \"absurd or bizarre results.\" In such situations, barring removal under Section 1441(b)(2) may be the proper approach which requires fact intensive inquiry. Further, the application of 1441(b)(2) inhibits Plaintiffs from reaping the full benefits of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4. However, because the text of the statute is clear, and the result produced here is not absurd, the sole function of this Court is to enforce the statute according to its terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Neither the Supreme Court nor the Ninth Circuit has addressed this issue of pre-service removal; accordingly, the Court adopts the plain language interpretation of \u00a7 1441(b)(2) which requires a party to be properly joined\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   served before the forum defendant rule may limit the Court's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    b.
