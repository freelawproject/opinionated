Brnovich, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, Plaintiff Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\") filed a Motion For Summary Judgment as to Defendant Ferruggio Insurance Services of L.A. doing business as PenbenLA (\"Ferruggio\") as to Count One only. Oral argument was held on January 11, 2019. The Court has now considered the Motion (Doc. 54, Mot.), Response (Doc. 60, Resp.), and Reply (Doc. 65, Reply) along with arguments of counsel and relevant case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following undisputed facts providing relevant background are drawn from the parties' statements of fact and other parts of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Equa Gaming, an Arizona general partnership, opened a business account ending in 4583 at Wells Fargo (the \"Account\") on or about August 28, 2009. Defendants Victor Carrillo and Dana M. Brannan signed the application for the Account. On March 12, 2016, Defendant Ferruggio, under the name PenbenLA, issued a check drawn upon Pacific Western Bank made payable to Equa Gaming in the Amount of $ 100,000 (the \"Check\"). An employee of Ferruggio deposited the Check directly into the Account at a Wells Fargo branch on March 12, 2016, a Saturday. The Check bore no apparent evidence of forgery or alteration. On March 14, 2016, the Check was posted to the Account and the funds became available for withdrawal. Between March 14 and 16, various debits and withdrawals were made from the Account. After the Check was deposited, Ferruggio directed Pacific Western Bank to stop payment on the Check, and the Check was returned unpaid to Wells Fargo on March 16, 2016. Wells Fargo reversed the $ 100,000 credit, which caused the Account to become overdrawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to the undisputed facts above, Ferruggio asserts the following facts. During the period of March 11-12, 2016, Michael Hand, President of Ferruggio, communicated with Carrillo regarding the payment of $ 100,000 to be made to Equa Gaming, and that the payment was initially to be made by check. After arranging for the deposit of the Check to the Account, Carrillo informed Hand that the funds would not be available immediately, and because time was of the essence, Hand agreed to wire the funds to the Account, which he subsequently did. Ferruggio further contends that during the discussions, Carrillo and Hand agreed that a stop payment would be put on the Check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Wells Fargo initiated this action on July 26, 2017 (Doc. 1), filed a first amended\n   complaint on August 14, 2017 (Doc. 17), and a second amended complaint on September 17, 2018 (Doc. 68, SAC), bringing claims against Ferruggio Insurance Services of L.A., Inc. doing business as PenbenLA (\"Ferruggio\"), Equa Gaming, Victor Carrillo, Dana M. Brannan, and Does I-X. Of the various claims brought by Wells Fargo, one was brought against Ferruggio for enforcement of the Check (\"Count One\") pursuant to A.R.S. Title 47 (codifying the Uniform Commercial Code).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ferruggio filed an answer on November 2, 2018 (Doc. 75, Ans.), and Wells Fargo now moves for summary judgment against Ferruggio on Count One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Wells Fargo asserts that it has proved a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case against Ferruggio, needing \"only to prove that the signatures on the Check were authorized and that it is a holder in possession of the instrument.\" (Mot. at 3). In support of this, Wells Fargo further asserts that Ferruggio \"admits that the signatures are authorized.\" (Mot. at 4) (citing Ans. at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15, 35, 39, 42, 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ferruggio does not argue that the signatures were not authorized or that Wells Fargo is not a holder in possession of the instrument. Rather, Ferruggio argues that it is not liable to make payment on the check because of a defense-an agreement between Ferruggio and Carrillo that the check \"was not to be deposited and another method of payment would be pursued.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Resp. at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Wells Fargo also asserts that even if Ferruggio has a valid defense, Wells Fargo is a holder in due course who took the Check without notice of any defenses or claims, which would limit any defenses proved by Ferruggio. (Mot. at 5-8). Ferruggio contends that Wells Fargo \"is not a holder in due course\" because Wells Fargo \"did not exercise reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.\" (Resp. at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ferruggio also argues that \"[a]ny existing security interest claimed by [Wells Fargo] is limited to the amount of Check, less any rightful set-offs and deductions,\" and that Wells Fargo's security interest cannot exceed $ 75,278.39, the amount that the account was overdrawn. (Reply at 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When \"an unaccepted draft is dishonored, the drawer is obliged to pay the draft ... according to its terms at the time it was issued ... to a person entitled to enforce the draft [ ].\" U.C.C. \u00a7 3-414(b). A \"person entitled to enforce\" an instrument includes \"the holder of an instrument.\" U.C.C. \u00a7 3-301. \"If a customer delivers an item to a depositary bank for collection ... the depositary bank becomes a holder of the item ... if the customer at the time of delivery was a holder of the item, whether or not the customer indorses the item [ ].\" U.C.C. \u00a7 4-205. \"Depositary banks can be holders in due course of unendorsed checks if the payee is its customer.\"\n   <em>\n    Conder v. Union Planters Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9182296\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/397/#p400\">\n    384 F.3d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400 (7th Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In an action brought with respect to an instrument where the validity of signatures is admitted or proved, \"a plaintiff producing the instrument is entitled to payment if the plaintiff proves entitlement to enforce the instrument under Section 3-301, unless the defendant proves a defense or claim in recoupment.\" U.C.C. \u00a7 3-308. One such defense a party may raise is that their obligation to pay the instrument was \"modified, supplemented, or nullified by a separate agreement of the obligor and a person entitled to enforce the instrument, if the instrument is issued or the obligation is incurred in reliance on the agreement or as part of the same transaction giving rise to the agreement.\" U.C.C. \u00a7 3-117 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3-305(a)(2) (\"[T]he right to enforce\n   the obligation of a party to pay an instrument is subject to ... a defense of the obligor stated in another section of this Article[.]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   However, \"[t]he right of a\n   <em>\n    holder in due course\n   </em>\n   to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument\" is subject only to a limited list of defenses. U.C.C. \u00a7 3-305(b) (emphasis added). The rights of a holder in due course are not subject to the defense found in U.C.C. \u00a7 3-117.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Prima Facie Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff is Entitled to Enforce The Check\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   No party has disputed that the signature on the Check was authorized. In order to enforce the Check, Wells Fargo therefore needs to show that it is a holder of the instrument. It is undisputed that the Check payable to Equa Gaming was deposited by Ferruggio directly into Equa Gaming's account with Wells Fargo. There is therefore no dispute as to material facts affecting whether Wells Fargo is a holder of the Check. Upon receipt of the Check, Wells Fargo became a holder of the Check due to its status as the depository bank. Accordingly, Wells Fargo is entitled to enforce the Check, unless Ferruggio proves a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Ferruggio's Defense Fails\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In support of its stated defense, Ferruggio cites to U.C.C. \u00a7 3-117 which states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Subject to applicable law regarding exclusion of proof of contemporaneous or previous agreements, the obligation of a party to an instrument to pay the instrument may be modified, supplemented, or nullified by a separate agreement of the obligor and a person entitled to enforce the instrument, if the instrument is issued or the obligation is incurred in reliance on the agreement or as part of the same transaction giving rise to the agreement. To the extent an obligation is modified, supplemented, or nullified by an agreement under this section, the agreement is a defense to the obligation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Wells Fargo argues that because Carrillo \"was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument, the agreement with him is not a defense to payment of the Check.\" (Reply at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   According to U.C.C. \u00a7 3-301, a person entitled to enforce an instrument means one of three things: (1) the holder of the instrument, (2) a nonholder in possession of the instrument who has the rights of a holder, or (3) a person not in possession of the instrument who is entitled to enforce the instrument pursuant to U.C.C. \u00a7 3-309 or \u00a7 3-418(d). In order to be a \"holder,\" the person must be in possession of the instrument. U.C.C. \u00a7 1-201(b)(21). Neither Ferruggio nor Wells Fargo contend that Carrillo was in possession of the instrument, or that Carrillo was a holder pursuant to U.C.C. \u00a7 3-309, which pertains to lost, destroyed, or stolen instruments, or U.C.C. \u00a7 3-418(d), which pertains to mistake. Given that none of these three categories apply to Carrillo, he cannot be \"a person entitled to enforce an instrument\" in this case. The U.C.C. provides that Wells Fargo became the holder of the check at the time it received the check for deposit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.C.C. \u00a7 4-205.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Any separate agreement made between Ferruggio and Carrillo is therefore not a defense to Ferruggio's obligation to pay the Check. Because there are no disputed facts as to whether Wells Fargo is a holder entitled to enforce the instrument or whether Ferruggio has a valid defense, Wells Fargo has shown that it prevails on Count One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Holder in Due Course\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As the Court has determined that Plaintiff is entitled to enforce the Check, and that Ferruggio's defense fails as a matter of law, the Court need not address whether Wells Fargo is a holder in due course.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.C.C. \u00a7 3-308 cmt. 2 (\"Until proof of a defense ... is made, the issue as to whether the plaintiff has rights of a holder in due course does not arise.\"). The Court will address the issue anyway in an effort to be complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A holder of an instrument becomes a \"holder in due course\" if\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (1) the instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (2) the holder took the instrument\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (i) for value,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (ii) in good faith,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (iii) without notice that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored or that there is an uncured default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as part of the same series,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (iv) without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or has been altered,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (v) without notice of any claim to the instrument described in Section 3-306, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (vi) without notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment described in Section 3-305(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   U.C.C. \u00a7 3-302 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Great W.

After the payor of the check placed a \"stop payment\" on the check, the check was dishonored by the drawee bank, but not before the customer had withdrawn the funds made available by the credit union. The jury found that the credit union had not acted in \"good faith\" by making the funds immediately available to its customer. In analyzing the \"reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing\" part of the test, the Maine Supreme Court determined that the \"factfinder must ... determine, first, whether the conduct of the holder comported with industry or 'commercial' standards applicable to the transaction and, second, whether those standards were reasonable standards intended to result in fair dealing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11621881\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/727/335/#p340\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11621881\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/727/335/#p340\">\n    at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Failure to exercise ordinary care in conducting a transaction is an entirely different concept than failure to deal fairly in conducting the transaction.

The agreement states, in part, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [i]n some cases, the Bank will not make all of the funds that you deposit by check available to you on the first\n   <em>\n    Business Day\n   </em>\n   after the day of your deposit. Depending on the type of check that you deposit, funds may not be available until the fifth or sixth\n   <em>\n    Business Day\n   </em>\n   after the day of your deposit.... In addition, funds you deposit by check may be delayed for a longer period under the following circumstances: ... You deposit checks totaling more than $ 5,000 on any one day\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (Resp. at 4-5); (Doc. 61-4). Ferruggio states that \"[b]y the terms of Plaintiff's own account agreement, the stated process would have been to delay the availability of the deposited funds because the amount of the deposit was significantly above the $ 5,000 threshold.\" (Resp. at 5). However, as Wells Fargo points out, the referenced sections of the agreement do not state that Wells Fargo will always delay availability, but that they \"may\" do so. (Reply at 5). Wells Fargo also points to the \"General\" policy regarding availability of funds: \"The Bank's policy is to make funds from your check deposits to your checking and savings Accounts ... available to you on the first Business Day after the day the Bank receives your deposit.\" (Reply at 5); (Doc. 61-4). Ferruggio, like the court in\n   <em>\n    Maine Family\n   </em>\n   , is conflating \"good faith\" with \"due care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As such, Ferruggio does not point to anything in the record indicating that Wells Fargo was required to place a hold. Nor does Ferruggio point to anything in the record indicating that Wells Fargo acted in an \"unfair\" manner. Wells Fargo notes that it \"accepted the Check for processing in the ordinary course,\" citing an affidavit from Wells Fargo employee Cynthia Bennett-Parks. (Reply at 5) (citing Doc. 55-1, Ex. A). In the affidavit, Ms. Bennett-Parks further describes that the Check was deposited into the Account on Saturday, March 12, 2016, and that the Check bore no \"evidence of forgery or alteration and was not incomplete or irregular in any respect.\" (Doc. 55-1 at 3-4). Ms. Bennet-Parks also states that Wells Fargo had no notice that the Check had been dishonored or \"that any party had a defense or claim in recoupment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Wells Fargo acted in \"good faith\" and therefore is considered a\n   <em>\n    holder in due course\n   </em>\n   of the Check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Security Amount\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Ferruggio also argues that Wells Fargo's security interest cannot exceed $ 75,278.39, the amount that the Equa Gaming account was overdrawn. (Resp. at 6). Ferruggio cites to U.C.C. \u00a7 3-302(e) and asserts that \"[a]ny existing security interest claimed by the Plaintiff is limited to the amount of Check, less any rightful set-offs and deductions,\" and that \"[c]ases addressing this issue have also held that the obligation of the Drawer who stops payment on a check is limited to the overdrawn balance on the depositor's account.\" (Resp. at 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In reply, Wells Fargo argues that (1) U.C.C. \u00a7 3-302(e) does not apply because Ferruggio has no defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument, (2) Wells Fargo obtained a \"security interest in the Check to the extent of the advance to the Account,\" and (3) \"the drawer of an instrument is liable to the holder for the amount of the instrument.\" (Reply at 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   First, section 3-302(e) provides that \"the person entitled to enforce the instrument may assert rights as a holder in due course only to an amount payable under the instrument which, at the time of enforcement of the instrument, does not exceed the amount of the unpaid obligation secured,\" but only if (1) \"the person entitled to enforce an instrument has only a security interest,\" and (2) \"the person obliged to pay the instrument has a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument that may be asserted against the person who granted the security interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As noted above, Ferruggio's defense fails. And Ferruggio has not asserted any claims in recoupment or claims to the instrument. Accordingly, U.C.C. \u00a7 3-302(e) does not apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Second, Wells Fargo asserts that they obtained a \"security interest in the Check to the extent of the advance to the Account.\" (Reply at 6) (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Consolidated Pioneer Mortg.

Cal. 1997) ). Wells Fargo argues that it provided provisional credit of $ 100,000 to the Account, and after the credit was reversed, \"the Account was negative in an amount exceeding $ 100,000.\" (Reply at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   According to U.C.C. \u00a7 4-210(a), \"[a] collecting bank has a security interest in ... an item deposited in an account [ ] to the extent to which credit given for the item has been withdrawn or applied.\" In\n   <em>\n    In re Consol. Pioneer Mortg. Entities\n   </em>\n   , the court stated that \"[i]f the customer only draws against a portion of the available provisional credit, the bank only has a security interest to the extent that the customer has withdrawn uncollected funds.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"273601\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/211/704/#p711\">\n    211 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   711 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Braden Corp. v.

Ct. App. 1996) (bank allowed customer to withdraw provisional credit and \"acquired a security interest in the proceeds of the check to the extent of the withdrawn funds\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Account statement, (Doc. 55-1, Ex. D), does show that on the day the $ 100,000 credit was reversed, the ending balance of the account was a negative balance in excess of $ 100,000. However, the next day the negative balance was no longer over $ 100,000 due to the reversal of recent debits on the Account. And at the time the account was closed, the ending balance was negative $ 75,278.39. (Resp. at 6) (Doc. 55-1, Ex. D). If Wells Fargo were able to recover for the total amount of the provisional credit, as opposed to the amount for which the Account was ultimately overdrawn, the result would essentially allow Wells Fargo to receive more than the credit that was \"withdrawn.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Lastly, Wells Fargo argues that Ferruggio is liable for the amount of the instrument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (Reply at 6). Ferruggio cites two cases for the proposition that courts have \"held that the obligation of the Drawer who stops payment on a check is limited to the overdrawn balance on the depositor's account.\" (Resp. at 6) (citing\n   <em>\n    Falls Church Bank v.
