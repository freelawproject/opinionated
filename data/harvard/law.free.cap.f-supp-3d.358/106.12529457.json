Merrill (\"Merrill\") are defendants in the TelexFree Multi-District Securities Litigation. They move to dismiss the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Tenth Claims for Relief against them in the Second Consolidated Amended\n   Complaint. (SCAC) Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   TelexFree, Inc. (\"TelexFree\") was a pyramid scheme that operated from February 2012 until April 2014. It involved approximately 2 million participants worldwide, nearly one million of whom suffered financial loss. Several Plaintiffs filed actions in district courts across the United States seeking to recover their losses against dozens of defendants, ranging from financial service providers, including banks (such as Fidelity Bank, the moving party), payment processing companies, and the principals of the fraudulent scheme employed by, or otherwise involved with TelexFree. As the actions involved common questions of fact, the judicial panel on Multi-District Litigation joined the actions into a Multi-District Litigation in order to transfer all actions to the District of Massachusetts for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The SCAC alleges that between August and September of 2013, TelexFree opened three accounts in Fidelity Bank with deposits totaling in excess of 10 million dollars. Fidelity continued to accept deposits from TelexFree until December 26, 2013. The CEO of Fidelity Bank, the defendant John Merrill is the brother of principal defendant James Merrill, one of the founders of the TelexFree pyramid scheme. The complaint alleges that this familial relationship made \"Fidelity Bank privy to information regarding TelexFree and its \"suspicious, tortious, or unlawful conduct.\" (SCAC \u00b6 809). The complaint also alleges that Fidelity Bank's regulatory compliance officer performed an investigation of TelexFree prior to agreeing to accept TelexFree as a customer on or about August of 2013. (SCAC \u00b6 813).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   An investigation was initiated by the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth against the bank on April 30, 2014 regarding the relationship of the bank with TelexFree. \"That investigation resulted in the entry of a consent decree dated September 22, 2014, whereby Fidelity Bank agreed to establish an escrow fund of 3.5 million dollars for victims of the scheme.\" (SCAC \u00b6 817). Because of this and other \"red flags\" the bank hired an outside consultant to advise them on the proper way to proceed in future dealings. \"The outside consultant advised Fidelity Bank of his conclusions that TelexFree was a high risk customer based on its account balance and its extensive wire transfers, and that TelexFree's accounts would 'would require the appropriate monitoring level for a high risk customer.' \" SCAC (\u00b6 820). Based on that communication Fidelity determined to close TelexFree's accounts, however several critical weeks elapsed before the closure took place. Further, after receipt of the outside consultant's report the bank transferred over 10 million dollars into personal accounts, including 3.5 million dollar transfer by the defendant Wanzler to a Singapore account on December 30, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must allege a claim that plausibly entitles the plaintiff to relief.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

Rule 9(b) imposes a heightened pleading standard for claims based on fraud. When an aiding and abetting claim sounds in fraud, it must be plead with particularity as set forth in Rule 9(b).

Aug. 21, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fidelity argues that under Massachusetts law, a bank cannot be held liable for a fraud committed by one of its customers where the bank simply provided ordinary deposit services, even if those services were used in connection with an alleged fraud. They cite as authority for this proposition,\n   <em>\n    Go-Best Assets LTD., v. Citizens Bank of Mass,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685741\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/50/\">\n     463 Mass. 50\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=972%20N.E.2d%20426\">\n     972 N.E.2d 426\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2012)\n   </em>\n   . That case holds that a bank may be liable to a third party who was victimized by a fraud perpetrated by a bank customer only where the bank has actual knowledge of the customers wrongdoing and actively participates or provides substantial assistance in the fraud. The defendants further argue that the plaintiffs' allegations in its SCAC are conclusory and fail to allege that the bank had actual knowledge of the defendant's fraudulent conduct. They also argue that being the brother of a person who commits fraud is not enough to subject a person to legal liability; that the Plaintiff's claim for aiding and abetting M.G.L. C. 93 and Chapter 93A should be dismissed because the Plaintiffs were not engaged in trade or commerce, that there is no cause of action for aiding and abetting Chapter 93 and 93A violations; and that the Plaintiffs cannot adequately allege an unjust enrichment claim against Fidelity Bank. Merrill argues that the Plaintiffs have failed to allege specific facts sufficient to establish his personal liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Third Claim for Relief: Aiding and Abetting GLC 93 \u00a7 12 and 69 &amp; C93A \u00a7 2(a) and 11.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   With respect to the issue of whether a Cause of Action exists for aiding and abetting M.G.L. C.93 \u00a7 12 and 69, and M.G.L.

Jan. 8, 2014) (declining to extend the holding in\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    )\n   </em>\n   . The court in\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   did not devote much attention to the theory of an aiding and abetting claim under C. 93A, but spoke at length of a statutory aiding and abetting claim under M.G.L. C. 149. Similarly, the\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   court was not deciding whether a party could aid and abet a C. 93A claim, but whether a party could\n   aid and abet statutory violations of M.G.L. C 149 and 151B pertaining to labor and discrimination respectively. That court held one could not aid and abet C. 149 and 151B violations because the legislature \"could have specifically provided for aiding and abetting liability in G.L.C. 149 \u00a7 148B and chose not to.\"\n   <em>\n    Reynolds,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201758301\">\n     Supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201758301\">\n    at *8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Chapter 93A, which is based upon the Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1) ), also does not recognize a separate aiding and abetting cause of action. \"A defendant acting with knowledge of deception who either directly participates in that deception or has the authority to control the deceptive practice of another, but allows the deception to proceed, engages,\n   <em>\n    through its own actions\n   </em>\n   , in a deceptive act or practice that causes harm to consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

Second, the cases where courts in this district have held that parties may incur liability under Chapters 93 and 93A specifically refer to the \"breach of fiduciary duty\", and not Section 69, which covers illegal Multi-Level Distribution Company (\"MLM\") actions. Accordingly, I find that there is no separate Cause of Action under the facts of this case for aiding and abetting M.G.L.

The Complaint does not break down the allegations against specific financial service providers, and instead makes omnibus allegations, such as \"... each of the defendants chose to enhance fees for providing services to TelexFree's suspicious and unlawful enterprise.\" (SCAC \u00b6 326), \"TelexFree could not have successfully carried out its lawful enterprise or shelter it's [sic] ill-gotten gains without the integral assistance of ... financial institutions.\" (SCAC at \u00b6 313).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To state a claim for unjust enrichment the Plaintiff must demonstrate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   1) a benefit conferred on the Defendant by the Plaintiff;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   2) an appreciation or knowledge of the benefit by the Defendant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   3) the acceptance or retention of the benefit by the Defendant under circumstances which make acceptance or retention inequitable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Stevens v.

The complaint is devoid of any allegation that the fees, interest, and charges received by Fidelity were anything more than payments for banking services, and thus Plaintiffs have failed to allege that they were \"unjust.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McLane, Graf Raulerson and Middleton, P.C. v.
