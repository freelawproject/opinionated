Approximately\n   ten months later, on December 7, 2012, Ms. Arfa filed on behalf of Petitioner a habeas corpus petition in the Los Angeles County Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Four days later, on December 11, 2012, Petitioner (represented by Ms. Arfa) filed in this Court a \"Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus By a Person in State Custody,\" accompanied by a Memorandum of Points and Authorities. The Petition conceded that a number of Petitioner's claims had not been presented to the California Supreme Court, and hence were unexhausted. The case was assigned to United States Magistrate Judge Ralph Zarefsky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 27, 2013, Respondent filed a \"Motion to Dismiss Petition, etc.,\" contending that certain of Petitioner's claims and portions of claims were unexhausted. On April 25, 2013, Petitioner filed an opposition to the Motion to Dismiss and a \"Motion for Stay and Abeyance, etc.\" (\"Motion for a Stay\"). In the Motion for a Stay, Petitioner asserted that his unexhausted claims then were pending in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. Petitioner sought a stay pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rhines v.

Magistrate Judge Zarefsky's order did not directly address the propriety of a\n   <em>\n    Rhines\n   </em>\n   stay. On October 16, 2013, Petitioner filed a First Amended Petition omitting the unexhausted claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 3, 2014, Petitioner, represented by Ms. Arfa, filed a habeas corpus petition in the California Court of Appeal containing the same claims raised in the Superior Court petition. The Court of Appeal summarily denied this petition on March 13, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 19, 2014, Petitioner, represented by Ms. Arfa, filed in the California Supreme Court a petition for review of the Court of Appeal's denial.

Respondent did not oppose the Motion, which this Court granted on June 19, 2014. On August 15, 2014, Respondent filed a motion to dismiss as untimely newly added, newly exhausted\n   Claims Two, Four, Six and portions of Claims Three and Seven of the Second Amended Petition. Petitioner filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss on December 18, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 25, 2015, Magistrate Judge Zarefsky issued a Report and Recommendation recommending dismissal of claims Two, Four and Seven and portions of claim Three as untimely under 28 U.S.C. section 2244 (d).

Thus, if Petitioner were entitled to a\n   <em>\n    Rhines\n   </em>\n   stay, the Court now would reach the merits of these claims on remand.

In Judge Zarefsky's March 25, 2015 Report and Recommendation, Judge Zarefsky concluded that Petitioner was not entitled to statutory \"gap\" tolling for the 157 days between the denial of the Superior Court petition and the filing of the Court of Appeal petition (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    \"Report and Recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge,\" filed March 25, 2015, at pp. 13-14).
