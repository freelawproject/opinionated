The Court, being duly advised of the premises, grants said motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 7, 2018, Plaintiff the United States of America (\"the Government\") filed the above-captioned action to revoke the naturalization of Defendant Mubarak Ahmed Hamed (\"Hamed\"). In the motion\n   before the Court, the Government seeks judgment on the pleadings on each of its four claims. (Doc. # 17). The Court heard argument on the motion on November 8, 2018. Each party appeared through counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1990, Hamed, a native of Sudan, came to the United States to study under an F-1 student visa. In 1991, Hamed became the Executive Director of the Islamic American Relief Agency (\"IARA\"), which received funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development. As the IARA Executive Director, Hamed negotiated cooperation agreements and authorized financing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At some point before October 1994, Hamed obtained an immigrant visa through the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program. On October 2, 1994, Hamed applied to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") to become a lawful permanent United States resident. INS approved the application on February 21, 1995.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about November 23, 1999, after having been a lawful permanent United States resident for five years, Hamed applied for naturalization. In his naturalization application, Hamed checked \"no\" in response to the question asking \"[h]ave you ever knowingly committed any crime for which you have not been arrested?,\" and certified under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the naturalization application was true and correct. Hamed further asserted the same during his INS interview. INS approved Hamed's naturalization application on May 8, 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, Hamed received notice that he would take the oath of allegiance to the United States on July 21, 2000. The notice included a questionnaire requiring Hamed to again certify that he had not, after the date of his INS interview, \"knowingly committed any crime or offense, for which [he had] not been arrested[.]\" Additionally, Hamed again certified that his questionnaire responses were true and correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 21, 2000, Hamed attended his naturalization ceremony, took the oath of allegiance to the United States, was admitted to United States citizenship, and was issued Certificate of Naturalization No. 25738418.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 21, 2008, the Government filed a 41-count indictment against Hamed, charging him with violations of multiple federal criminal statutes in connection with Hamed's work for the IARA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 25, 2010, Hamed pleaded guilty to three counts: (1) conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201701\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1706 ; (2) violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations in contravention of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201701\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1706 ; and (3) corrupt endeavor to obstruct or impede the administration of Internal Revenue laws in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207212\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Consequently, the Court is inclined to find that Hamed's conviction under \u00a7 7212(a), involving a corrupt endeavor to impede operation of the Internal Revenue Code is a crime of moral turpitude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Hamed asserts his conviction under \u00a7 7212(a) is only a crime of moral turpitude if the least culpable conduct under which a person might be convicted under \u00a7 7212(a) is a crime of moral turpitude. Hamed argues a conviction under \u00a7 7212(a) may arise from a state of mind \"that does not necessarily involve evil intent, such as intent to defraud,\" such that violation of \u00a7 7212(a) should not be considered a crime of moral turpitude.\n   <em>\n    Hirsch v.

Hamed submitted his naturalization application on November 23, 1999, such that the five-year statutory period for good moral character began on November 23, 1994, and ended on the date Hamed took the oath of citizenship on July 21, 2000. Therefore, Hamed was convicted of a crime of moral turpitude outside the statutory period for good moral character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Notwithstanding, however, an individual who commits a crime of moral turpitude during the statutory period, \"even if the person was never charged, arrested, or convicted,\" is ineligible for naturalization.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20316.10\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Hamed pleaded guilty to violating \u00a7 7212(a) on June 25, 2010. As part of the plea agreement, Hamed admitted to \"[f]or\n   each year 1997 through 2003, Hamed filed or caused to be filed IRS Forms 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax ...,\" among other conduct in violation of \u00a7 7212(a). Thus, Hamed admittedly committed acts during the statutory period that rendered him ineligible for naturalization.

In the Court's view, Hamed's conduct in soliciting funds on behalf a not-for-profit, for projects in contravention of IIEPA and Iraqi sanction regulations, could be reasonably characterized as fraud on donors to the IARA. Further, the illegal conduct at issue was undertaken knowingly. Thus, the Court concludes the Government has demonstrated that Hamed engaged in unlawful acts during the statutory period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Section 316.10(b)(3)(iii) states that an applicant shall be found to lack good moral character if he or she engaged in unlawful acts, \"[u]nless the applicant establishes extenuating circumstances ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20316.10\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). Hamed argues the record contains a list of positive factors that demonstrate good moral character, including Hamed's advanced degrees, his long employment history in organizations dedicated to charitable causes, and personal contributions to schools, medical centers, and refugee camps. Even if each of these assertions are supported in the record, they are not extenuating circumstances of the type that might outweigh Hamed's admitted criminal conduct involving purposeful fraudulent and/or corrupt acts. Therefore, the Court finds Hamed's naturalization illegally procured based on unlawful acts adversely reflecting upon his moral character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For all of these reasons, the Court finds the Government entitled to judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c) based on illegal procurement of naturalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B. HAMED'S NATURALIZATION AND/OR CITIZENSHIP WAS ILLEGALLY PROCURED BASED ON FALSE STATEMENTS AND/OR WILLFUL CONCEALMENT.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Government argues Hamed's naturalization is subject to revocation because Hamed provided willful misrepresentations to INS during the naturalization process. Hamed counters that he did not know until 2008 that he had engaged in criminal conduct for which he had not been charged during the naturalization process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   There are four requirements for revoking naturalization because of willful misrepresentation: (1) the naturalized citizen must have misrepresented or concealed some fact; (2) the misrepresentation or concealment must have been willful; (3) the fact must have been material; and (4) the naturalized citizen must have procured his citizenship as a result of the misrepresentation or concealment.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Further, the Government asserts Hamed's guilty plea establishes he \"knowingly and willingly\" committed the crimes to which he pleaded guilty. The Government asserts the misrepresentation that Hamed had not engaged in any criminal conduct for which he had not been arrested was material to the naturalization process because had Hamed admitted the criminal conduct, his naturalization application would not have been approved since it would render Hamed statutorily ineligible for naturalization. Finally, the Government asserts Hamed procured naturalization as a result of the misrepresentation\n   that he had not engaged in criminal conduct for which he had not been arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   With respect to the first element, Hamed engaged in criminal conduct for which he had not been charged or convicted during the statutory period, as discussed above. Therefore, Hamed misrepresented or concealed some fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   With respect to the second element, the misrepresentation is considered willful because Hamed affirmed, under penalty of perjury, that the facts to which he was attesting to were true representations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322225\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/741/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322225\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/741/#p748\">\n    at 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

App'x at 357.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, with respect to the third and fourth elements, the Court has determined above that the conduct in which Hamed was engaged during the statutory period was a crime of moral turpitude, or at least unlawful conduct informing a lack of good moral character. Either characterization renders Hamed ineligible for naturalization. Consequently, Hamed's willful misrepresentation that he had not engaged in criminal conduct during the statutory period for which he had not been charged or convicted was material because had he disclosed such conduct, he would have been ineligible for naturalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For all of these reasons, the Court finds the Government entitled to judgment under Fed.

LACHES IS INAPPLICABLE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Government argues Hamed's affirmative defense of laches is inapplicable to this denaturalization proceeding. Hamed argues laches is a suitable equitable defense that, because its analysis is fact-specific, should preclude judgment on the pleadings at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \"It has been consistently held in the lower courts that delay which might support a defense of laches in ordinary equitable proceedings between private litigants will not bar a denaturalization proceeding brought by the Government.
