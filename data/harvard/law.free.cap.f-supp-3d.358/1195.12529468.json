MARTINEZ, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter comes before the Court on Motions for Summary Judgment filed by the three parties. Dkts. # 36, # 37, and # 40. This is an insurance-coverage dispute arising from an $ 18 million arbitration award for the wrongful termination of Dr. David Newell, a neurosurgeon working for Plaintiffs Swedish Health Services and Providence Health Services (collectively \"Providence\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's London (\"Underwriters\" or \"Beazley\") \"requests a declaration that the Beazley Policy affords no coverage in connection with the underlying Newell Claim because it was not reported to Beazley during the requisite reporting period.\" Dkt. # 36 at 2. Providence requests the Court rule that Washington law governs this action, and that Defendants can only avoid coverage if they show actual and substantial prejudice from Providence's delay in reporting. Dkt. # 37 at 2-3. Defendant Federal Insurance Company hopes to rely on the untimeliness of Providence's reporting under the Beazley Policy to support their denial of coverage as well. Dkt. # 40 at 2. For the reasons stated below, the Court GRANTS Providence's Motion and DENIES the Motions of Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ruling on the limited issues raised by the parties' Motions does not require a full recitation of the facts, and indeed discovery in this case is ongoing. The following facts of this case are generally agreed to by the Parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Providence Health and Services (\"Providence\") is a Washington non-profit corporation headquartered in Renton. Dkt. # 38 (\"Bhatia Decl.\"), \u00b6 3. It operates hospitals and other clinics in Washington, Alaska, California, Montana, and Oregon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Swedish Health Services is also a Washington non-profit corporation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Swedish is a subsidiary of Western HealthConnect, which is an affiliate of Providence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Swedish operates hospitals and clinics in Western Washington. Swedish is an insured under Providence's insurance policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Providence is covered by a Beazley One Management Liability Insurance Policy for Healthcare Organizations for the November 1, 2015, to July 1, 2022, Policy Period. Bhatia Decl., Ex. A at 8, 124. The Beazley Policy provides a coverage limit of $ 10 million for each Employment Practices claim, which coverage attaches atop a self-insured retention of $ 1 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. This policy is a \"Claims Made and Reported Policy,\" requiring reporting of claims in writing to Beazley \"as soon as practicable but in no event later than the end of the policy period...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. However, under an endorsement, the requirement was added that the claim had to be reported to Beazley no later than 60 days after an Executive Officer of the Insured Organization becomes aware of the claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. The Policy also includes a New York choice of law provision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Providence is also covered under a Directors and Officers Excess Liability policy issued by Defendant Federal (\"Federal Policy\"). Bhatia Decl., Ex. B at 141, 161. This policy provides a $ 10 million liability limit in excess of the Beazley Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 141. The Federal Policy \"follows form\" to the Beazley Policy, meaning it incorporates the terms of the latter policy \"except as otherwise provided\" in the Federal Policy's own terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 157. The Federal Policy says this about notice:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The\n   <strong>\n    Insureds\n   </strong>\n   shall give to the Company written notice as soon as practicable of the cancellation of any\n   <strong>\n    Underlying Insurance\n   </strong>\n   , any notice given under any\n   <strong>\n    Underlying Insurance\n   </strong>\n   and additional or return premiums charged or paid in connection with any\n   <strong>\n    Underlying Insurance\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 158 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   By letter dated August 28, 2017, Providence notified Beazley and Federal that an arbitration award in excess of $ 17 million had been entered against them in a binding arbitration initiated by Dr. David Newell, a neurosurgeon formerly employed with the Swedish Neurological Institute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bhatia Decl., Ex. H. The letter stated that Dr. Newell's counsel had initially demanded arbitration on February 22, 2017, and that the Hearing took place from July 31 through August 4, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This was the first notification Beazley received concerning the underlying Newell Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Providence acknowledges that it failed to report the claim within 60 days after becoming aware of the claim, as required under the Beazley Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 37 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Providence's defense counsel in the Newell arbitration was Jeff James, a senior partner with the firm Sebris Busto James. Mr. James and his firm are \"panel counsel\" under the Beazley Policy; that is, Beazley pre-approved the firm to handle employment claims brought against Providence. Bhatia Decl., Ex. A at 105. Mr. James and his colleagues, along with Providence's in-house counsel, investigated the claims, took discovery, and otherwise prepared the case for arbitration. Bhatia Decl., \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 23, 2018, Beazley issued a letter denying coverage for the Newell claim. Bhatia Decl., Ex. F. The primary\n   stated reason for declining coverage was that \"Providence and Swedish did not promptly notify\" Beazley of Dr. Newell's claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 191. Beazley specifically relied on the notice-of-claim provisions, including the condition to report a claim within 60 days after an Executive Officer becomes aware of the claim and the requirement for semi-annual reporting of claims, known as bordereau reporting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 198-99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Federal acknowledged notice of the claim on September 22, 2017. Bhatia Decl., Ex. G. Providence alleges that Federal never issued a substantive coverage determination letter. Dkt. # 1-2 at 6. Instead, it relied only on the fact that the Beazley Policy was not exhausted to assert it had no current obligation to act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In response to Providence filing this action, Federal answered and asserted affirmative defenses, claiming that Providence should not be granted relief. Dkt. # 27. Federal's answer effectively denies coverage for this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Providence makes clear that no Washington court has considered the exact question here-whether to apply the notice-prejudice rule where a claim is made under a claims-made-and-reported policy within the reporting period but contrary to a 60-day notice provision. Providence contends that Washington courts would apply the notice-prejudice rule here given rulings on related issues in other cases not directly on point.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Beazley attempts to distinguish all the cases cited by Providence, and argues that Providence is inviting the Court to re-write the insurance contract contrary to the \"well settled rule\" against such practice.

Occurrence policies are built around an insurer who is liable for the insured's malpractice, no matter when discovered, so long as the malpractice occurred within the time confines of the policy period. Coverage depends on when the negligent act or omission occurred and not when the claim was asserted. The occurrence insurer, then, is faced with a \"tail\" that extends beyond the policy period itself. This \"tail\" is the lapse of time between the date of the error (within the policy period) and the time when a claim is made against the insured. The giving of notice is only a condition of the policy, and in no manner is it an extension of coverage itself. It does not matter when the insurer is notified of the claim by the insured, so long as the notification is within a reasonable time and so long as the negligent act or omission occurred within the policy period itself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Claims-made policies, likewise, require that notification to the insurer be within a reasonable time. Critically, however, claims-made policies require that that notice be given during the policy period itself. When an insured becomes aware of any event that could result in liability, then it must give notice to the insurer, and that notice must be given \"within a reasonable time\" or \"as soon as practicable\"-at all times, however, during the policy period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   With claims-made policies, the very act of giving an extension of reporting time after the expiration of the policy period, ... [would negate] the inherent difference between the two contract types. Coverage depends on the claim being made and reported to the insurer during the policy period. Claims-made or discovery policies are essentially reporting policies. If the claim is reported to the\n   insurer during the policy period, then the carrier is legally obligated to pay; if the claim is not reported during the policy period, no liability attaches. If a court were to allow an extension of reporting time after the end of the policy period, such is tantamount to an extension of coverage to the insured gratis, something for which the insurer has not bargained. This extension of coverage, by the court, so very different from a mere condition of the policy, in effect rewrites the contract between the two parties. This we cannot and will not do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Gannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1762049\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/54/330/#p337\">\n    54 Wash.

To conclude otherwise would be to ignore the purpose of the notice-prejudice rule and the inherent distinction between occurrence policies and claims-made-and-reported policies. This does not amount to \"an extension of coverage to the insured gratis\" in this case, as the insured and insurers bargained for coverage for the reporting period-the policy period plus an extension of 60 days. Providence's violation of the 60-day notice provision is more akin to the violations contemplated in those Washington cases cited by the parties involving occurrence-based policies, and the purposes behind the notice-prejudice rule apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Accordingly, Defendants in this case must show prejudice.

However, Providence argues that the plain language of the Federal Policy states that it deviates from the terms of the Beazley policy as \"otherwise provided,\" and the Federal Policy provides that notice is required as soon as practicable after any notice given under the underlying insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 47 at 11.
