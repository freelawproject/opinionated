It was, by then, well settled in the Sixth Circuit that, pursuant to \u00a7 1401(9)(B), the IDEA \"incorporates state law pertaining to educational rights of [disabled] children,\" and, therefore, \"a school district [that] complies with federal law...may still violate the Act if it fails to satisfy more extensive state protections that may also be in place.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

Among its stated purposes were \"[t]o ensure that every student receiving special education services is free from the unreasonable, unsafe and unwarranted uses of isolation and restraint practices\" and \"[t]o ensure that teachers of students receiving special education services are properly trained to protect the student, teacher and others from physical harm, if isolation or restraint is necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10510371\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/9/455/#p457\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(1), (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2008, with SEIRMPBSA on the books, Tennessee again sought and received federal funding under the IDEA. Assurance 1 remained the same, and, indeed, it has remained the same every year since, with Tennessee assuring OSEP, each year, that it would ensure that every Tennessee child from ages 3 to 21 would receive a FAPE, as defined by the IDEA. 2018 Assurances at II-1; 2017 Assurance at II-1; 2016 Assurance at II-1; 2015 Assurance at II-1; 2014 Assurance at II-1; 2013 Assurance at II-2; 2012 Assurance at II-2; 2011 Assurance at II-2; 2010 Assurance at II-2; 2009 Assurance at II-2; 2008 Assurance at II-2. Throughout that time, the\n   statutory definition of \"FAPE\" has continued to include the requirement that, to qualify as a FAPE, a student's special education and related services must comply with both the minimum standards set forth by federal law and any supplemental state special education standards.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201401\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2011, SEIRMPBSA was modified and superseded by the Special Education Behavior Supports Act (\"SEBSA\"), which retained SEIRMPBSA's purposes but replaced several provisions and added others. 2011 Tenn.

Dickson County School District's Treatment of J.M.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   J.M. is a student in the Dickson County School District (\"DCSD\"). It is undisputed that J.M. has multiple disabilities-including autism, intellectual disability, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-which entitle him to a FAPE under the IDEA. (Docket No. 12 \u00b6 9.) In 2010, J.M. began attending DCSD's White Bluff Elementary School as a kindergartener. (Docket No. 67-2 (Promise Mata Deposition) at 79.) By the end of J.M.'s third grade year, he had begun exhibiting what White Bluff personnel described as \"aggressive behavior towards staff and peer[s]\" and \"elopement issues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ex. 19.) At the time, teachers identified J.M.'s aggressive behaviors as occurring, on average, twelve times per day and sometimes as many as over eighty times in a single day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He was referred for a functional behavioral assessment, and, by fifth grade, he was receiving speech/language therapy, occupational therapy, and applied behavior analysis therapy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He continued to exhibit aggressive behaviors, including screaming, kicking, throwing objects, spitting, and head butting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   White Bluff made a number of efforts to address J.M.'s behavior, including referring him to a behavior interventionist, who sought to develop coping strategies for him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14, ex. 19.) Although J.M. experienced some improvement, Ms. Mata and the other members of J.M.'s individualized education program (\"IEP\") team\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   agreed, in February 2016, that White Bluff could not provide the resources, environment, and services necessary for J.M.'s needs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, ex. 22.) They decided to transfer him to New Directions Academy (\"NDA\"), a school within the DCSD characterized as having a \"behavior first\" approach. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The purpose of transferring J.M. to NDA was to put him in an environment with more behavioral supports, including a one-on-one aide to work with him throughout the day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 187-90.) Once J.M. was at NDA, his IEP team formulated a new IEP that took his new environment into account for the remainder of the fifth grade year and carrying into his sixth grade year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 186-87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   J.M., however, continued to exhibit aggressive and disruptive behavior. His teachers attempted, when possible, to respond to those behaviors with de-escalation techniques, such as offering him sensory toys or giving him the opportunity for a break from the other children. (Docket Nos. 65 at 6, 67-3 (Jeremy Howell Deposition) at 24.) Sometimes, however, de-escalation was ineffective, or J.M's behavior was so dangerous or disruptive that it required an immediate, more decisive response to ensure the safety of all involved. NDA has documented a number of instances during the 2016-17 school year when school personnel used restraint on J.M. in response to his most dangerous behaviors. (Docket No. 67-19.) NDA's reports on the incidents describe J.M.'s being restrained after slapping, pinching, kicking, biting, and scratching NDA staff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.) The uses of restraint that were documented mostly lasted only a few minutes, and the reports show that Ms. Mata was informed of the use of the restraint after school for each of the uses documented. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.) The Complaint filed in this case does not take issue with any of these uses of restraint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   However, J.M., through Ms. Mata, alleges that, in addition to the properly documented uses of restraint, NDA also repeatedly, during the 2016-17 school year, subjected J.M. to undocumented isolations in a manner that violated both the substantive and procedural guarantees of SEBSA. The State Defendants concede that, in at least one instance-on February 10, 2017- J.M.'s teacher, Jeremy Howell, placed J.M. in isolation in an \"intensive problem solving\" (\"IPS\") room that did not meet the physical requirements for an isolation room under SEBSA. (Docket No. 67-15 (Karen Willey Deposition) at 68-69).) For example, SEBSA requires that \"[a]ny space used as an isolation room shall be...unlocked and incapable of being locked,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-10-1305\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-10-1305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), but the IPS room in which Howell placed J.M. was capable of being locked, and, indeed, one of its doors was locked for a period of time while J.M. was inside. (Docket No. 67-15 (Willey Deposition) at 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ms. Mata became aware of the February 10, 2017, isolation shortly after it occurred. She complained to the school and sought information about both that isolation and the possibility of other instances of improper isolation of J.M. (See Docket Nos. 67-28 &amp; -29.) Although the State Defendants argue that the improper February 10, 2017, isolation was a unique occurrence, Ms. Mata claims that information revealed to her by DCSD personnel suggested that J.M. had been improperly isolated numerous times. Specifically, NDA's records indicate numerous \"time outs\" for J.M. other than the February 10, 2017 isolation, and Ms. Mata has testified that, in her conversations with DCSD personnel after she confronted them about J.M.'s treatment, the NDA personnel indicated that J.M. was placed in an ISP for at least some of those time outs. (Docket No. 78-1 (Promise Mata Deposition) at 88-89.) According to Ms. Mata, NDA revealed to her that at least some of those time outs involved J.M.'s being placed in the smaller of two ISPs, the area of which was fewer than forty square feet, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-10-1305\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-10-1305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(6). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98-104, 108-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The evidence shows that Howell and other DCSD personnel received some training related to SEBSA before the 2016-17 school year, but it was limited. (Docket No. 79 \u00b6\u00b6 19-29, 38-39.) The State of Tennessee offered additional training to school districts but apparently did not require DCSD to take part. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-52, 59.) In August 2017, following the discovery of the improper isolation or isolations\n   of J.M., the TDOE released an \"FAQ\" document providing basic guidance for schools regarding compliance with SEBSA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40, 55;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TDOE, Frequently Asked Questions: Restraint and Isolation for Students with Disabilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) The document had apparently been in a draft state for at least eight months. (Docket No. 79 \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the nearly two years since Ms. Mata first complained about NDA's treatment of J.M., NDA has taken steps to rectify and improve its policies regarding the handling of aggressive students, in particular with regard to the use of isolation. It removed the doors from its ISP rooms and brought in a behavioral specialist to provide additional training to its personnel over the summer of 2017. (Docket No. 79 \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) J.M. was not isolated at all during the 2017-18 school year, and it is undisputed that he is \"excelling now at NDA because they have better training and staff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ms. Mata filed a Complaint on J.M.'s behalf against DCSD on March 2, 2017, and filed a First Amended Complaint (\"Amended Complaint\") adding the State Defendants on April 19, 2017. (Docket Nos. 1 &amp; 12.) Count I of the Amended Complaint pleads claims against all defendants under the IDEA. (Docket No. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.) Count II pleads claims against all defendants under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (\"Section 504\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"Title II\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-48.) Counts III and IV plead common law claims against DCSD only. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-59.) On May 30, 2017, Ms. Mata, DCSD, and DCSD's insurer moved the court to approve a settlement of all claims against DCSD. (Docket No. 16.) On June 12, 2017, the court approved the settlement following a hearing in chambers. (Docket No. 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On July 31, 2017, the State Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the remaining claims. (Docket No. 25.) The State Defendants made two arguments: first, that J.M. had failed to plead a violation of the IDEA because his only allegations were about improper isolations under SEBSA; and, second, that even if J.M. had pled violations of the IDEA, he pled only violations by the DCSD, not the State Defendants. (Docket No. 26 at 3-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court denied the motion. As the court explained, both this court and the Eastern District have held that the IDEA's definition of \"FAPE\" incorporates compliance with SEBSA.

Tenn. 2017) ). An allegation that defendants provided special education and related services that violated the substantive provisions of SEBSA, therefore, was also an allegation of a denial of a FAPE. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With regard to the State Defendants' second argument, the court noted that, \"[u]nder the IDEA, the responsibility for ensuring that disabled students receive a free appropriate public education lies with the state educational agency (SEA),\" not merely local school districts.

The court concluded that, because J.M.'s Amended Complaint alleged \"systemic, state-level failures that only the State Defendants can rectify,\" he had stated a claim against those defendants, and they\n   were not entitled to dismissal of the claims against them.

J.M., however, has not asserted a state-law cause of action arising out of SEBSA. He has pled a federal cause of action under the IDEA. The determinative question, then, is whether Congress has created a cause of action, under the IDEA, that can encompass SEBSA violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The State Defendants argue that a plaintiff cannot file suit under the IDEA for a violation of SEBSA because \"there is no mention of SEBSA in the text of the IDEA or its regulations.\" (Docket No. 65 at 10.) The IDEA's definition of \"FAPE\" incorporates all \"standards of the State educational agency\" related to special education and related services,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201401\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9)(B), but it does not name any\n   specific standard, from any state, by name. The IDEA's incorporation of state standards through general language, however, is not unique. For example, the Assimilative Crimes Act \"assimilates into federal law, and thereby makes applicable on federal enclaves..., certain criminal laws of the State in which the enclave is located,\" not by setting forth a laundry list of individual states' statutes, but by referring generally to \"act[s] or omission[s] which...would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State...in which [the enclave] is situated.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

Another example comes from the federal statute prohibiting \"patient dumping\" by hospitals, which takes its damages formula from \"those damages available for personal injury [or] financial loss, under the law of the State in which the hospital is located,\" without citing any particular state's laws. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd(d)(2)(A)-(B) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reid v.

Ind. 1989) (\"The language of this federal statute...incorporates state standards to delineate the damages that would be available through...a civil action....\"). Even the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure employ such an approach. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e)(1), for example, uses general language to incorporate \"state law for serving a summons in an action brought in courts of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located or where service is made.\" Incorporating state standards by description, rather than enumeration, is not only ordinary practice, but it is also the most practical course of action in most cases, given the array of different state rules that may be at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The State Defendants respond that, even if the IDEA incorporates some state laws, it can only do so for state laws that existed prior to the IDEA's enactment, because incorporating later-enacted state laws would be a \"temporal impossibility.\" (Docket No. 65 at 10.) The Supreme Court, however, has considered the issue of prospective incorporation of state law in federal statutes and concluded that the Constitution permits the practice. Discussing the Assimilative Crimes Act, the Court wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Having the power to assimilate the state laws, Congress obviously has like power to renew such assimilation annually or daily in order to keep the laws in the enclaves current with those in the States. That being so, we conclude that Congress is within its constitutional powers and legislative discretion when, after 123 years of experience with the policy of conformity, it enacts that policy in its most complete and accurate form. Rather than being a delegation by Congress of its legislative authority to the States, it is a deliberate continuing adoption by Congress for federal enclaves of such unpre-empted offenses and punishments as shall have been already put in effect by the respective States for their own government.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The IDEA's continuing incorporation of state laws is, therefore, consistent with Congress's power, as construed by the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The State Defendants argue, in the alternative, that, even if Congress theoretically could incorporate a law such as SEBSA into the IDEA, the language of the IDEA does not provide sufficient notice that the State of Tennessee, by accepting federal funds, may be subject to a suit arising out of violations of SEBSA. The Supreme Court has held that the IDEA can only impose those obligations for which \"a state official who is engaged in\n   the process of deciding whether the State should accept IDEA funds...would clearly understand that\" the state is accepting the obligation.\n   <em>\n    Arlington Cent.

As long as a state is on notice as to what its acceptance of funds entails, however, and it accepts the funds and attendant responsibilities knowingly and voluntarily, the state has, the State Defendants concede, waived its sovereign immunity and accepted liability to suit under the IDEA. (See Docket No. 81 at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The system imposed by the IDEA is unavoidably complex; any given child's education is likely to implicate three layers of government-federal, state, and local-as well as, potentially, multiple agencies, schools, teachers, and other professionals. It is understandable, then, that confusion often arises with regard to what is required under the statute. On the specific question of whether the IDEA incorporates SEBSA into the requirements for a FAPE, however, the law is sufficiently clear to put the state on notice and support a cause of action. The IDEA's definition of \"FAPE\" adopts \"the standards of the State educational agency,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201401\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9)(B), and Tennessee's state educational agency-the TDOE-is charged with at least some aspects of overseeing the administration of SEBSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-10-1306\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-10-1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), (f). SEBSA itself, moreover, is clearly intended to function hand-in-hand with the structure imposed by the IDEA; for example, it defines its scope in terms of the state's general special education statutes,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-10-1304\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-10-1304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and repeatedly mentions its functioning in relation to IEPs,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-10-1304\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 49-10-1304(b), (d)(2). In light of the established structure of the IDEA and the plain intent by the General Assembly that SEBSA function as an integral part of the state's educational system, a reasonable policymaker would or should have known that SEBSA would be enforceable under the IDEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, the State Defendants argue that SEBSA is not enforceable via the IDEA in this case because the gravamen of J.M.'s claim is not related to the denial of a FAPE. The State Defendants base this focus on the gravamen of the claim on\n   <em>\n    Fry v. Napoleon Community Schools\n   </em>\n   , in which the Supreme Court held that the gravamen of the claim determines whether a plaintiff suing under a statute other than the IDEA, but seeking relief available under the IDEA, must satisfy the IDEA's exhaustion requirements.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p748\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   , however, is about the procedural requirements governing some claims; it does not create any limitations on what conduct is covered by the IDEA as a substantive matter. To the contrary,\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   , if anything, demonstrates just how much the various laws and causes of action governing special education can overlap-and how, accordingly, a claim with its gravamen under one cause of action may still be viable under another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p748\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"[t]he same conduct might violate all three\" of the IDEA, Section 504, and Title II).

Nor can he rely on the possibility of injunctive relief against DCSD, which is no longer a party and is, by all accounts, now complying with SEBSA, at least with regard to J.M.

The problem facing J.M.'s claims, however, is not that the State Defendants have ceased their allegedly unlawful behavior, but that DCSD has. At the time J.M. filed his Amended Complaint, DCSD was, he alleged, failing to provide him with a SEBSA-compliant FAPE, a failure that was attributable, in part, to the State Defendants' failures of oversight. Now, though, DCSD has rectified its errors, and, even if the State Defendants are providing insufficient oversight and training to other school districts, those failures are not depriving J.M. of anything. In other words, this is not a case where the defendant that is asserting mootness has temporarily rectified its behavior to avoid liability. Rather, another defendant, DCSD, has changed its practices and adequately trained its personnel, and those actions severed the connection between the State Defendants' wrongdoing and J.M.'s injuries. \"If events occur during [an IDEA] case...that make it 'impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to a prevailing party,' the [case] must be dismissed as moot.\"\n   <em>\n    I.L. by &amp; through Taylor v.

J.M. does not, however, set forth any facts suggesting that compensatory education would be a necessary or appropriate remedy for a student's having been isolated in a way that did not comply with SEBSA. If there were evidence of specific educational deficits associated with the improper isolations, which would not have arisen if isolation had been administered appropriately or not at all, then compensatory education might be warranted. J.M., however, has identified no such deficits and has made clear, throughout this suit, that his primary concern has been with the conditions of his isolation and DCSD's failures to communicate with Ms. Mata about them, not any particular pedagogical effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The State Defendants have concrete and ultimately nondelegable responsibilities to ensure that Tennessee complies with its special education laws, and, when they fail in those responsibilities and a denial of FAPE results, the affected student has a right to seek redress against them under the IDEA. Nevertheless, the student will be limited to the relief that the IDEA can provide, and the IDEA is chiefly a tool for securing adequate educational and related services, not for providing general monetary redress or hashing out broad questions of policy. Once a student's educational situation is remedied, and there remain no more correctives available to the court appropriate to that student's particular case, the IDEA provides no basis for keeping his litigation alive merely to consider abstract questions about the defendants' responsibilities.

In particular, the Sixth Circuit has held that \"the Rehabilitation Act further requires that the [plaintiff] must ultimately prove that the defendant's failure to provide [the plaintiff] with a [FAPE] was discriminatory. Surmounting that evidentiary hurdle requires that either bad faith or gross misjudgment must be shown before a \u00a7 504 violation can be made out, at least in the context of\" educating children with disabilities.\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1006877\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/58/162/#p166\">\n    58 F.

App'x 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 742 (6th Cir. 2008) (affirming grant of summary judgment for defendant on a Section 504 claim because plaintiff could not show deliberate indifference).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The court considered the same basic issues with regard to Section 504 and Title II in\n   <em>\n    N.S. v. TDOE\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-0610, which has been consolidated with this case. The court concluded that disputed issues of fact existed with regard to whether the State Defendants exhibited gross misjudgment in their failure to provide sufficient oversight and guidance to school districts under SEBSA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   The State Defendants argue that there is no evidence in the record of bad faith or gross misjudgment. To the contrary, the evidence, if found true, may show that the defendants regularly allowed restraints and isolations to be performed on disabled children without following the applicable regulations governing their use and that this was due to a failure to train and instruct faculty and staff members on the governing law. At the very least, this provides a basis by which a trier of fact could find gross misjudgment. The State Defendants were, further, on express notice that there was a lack of clarity among educators throughout the state as to the applicable laws, which should have put them on notice that these laws were not being followed and could have resulted in violations of rights to disabled students. Yet, the State Defendants did not act to implement even very basic recommendations by the [Advisory Council for the Education of Students with Disabilities] to prepare and disseminate [an FAQ] document that could offer some clarity, let alone take other affirmative efforts to ensure the enforcement of SEBSA regulations. Again, the trier of fact could certainly infer that this is the result of gross misjudgment, if not bad faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    N.S.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 33 at 32-33. The State Defendants argue that the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    N.S.\n   </em>\n   should not extend to this case because (1) the state has now published the FAQ document and has presented evidence suggesting that its delay in doing so was reasonable, and (2) the State Defendants have presented evidence that they did, in fact, provide adequate training and monitoring to school districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   With regard to the first difference between this case and\n   <em>\n    N.S.\n   </em>\n   , it does not matter that the FAQ document has been released now, because J.M.'s Section 504 and Title II claims seek not merely declaratory and injunctive relief but retrospective damages, based on DCSD's actions before it received any such guidance. While the State Defendants have produced some additional evidence explaining why the document took as long as it did to release, it will be up to the court to determine whether those explanations are, in the totality of circumstances, convincing. The same is true with regard to the evidence of training and oversight. The mere fact that the State Defendants provided some training and engaged in oversight does not negate J.M.'s contention that what the State Defendants provided was so woefully inadequate with regard to preventing cases such as his that it amounted to gross misjudgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The court, accordingly, will not grant the State Defendants summary judgment with regard to J.M.'s Section 504 and Title II claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     F. Exhaustion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (l), a plaintiff who has filed Section 504 and Title II claims that overlap with the IDEA may be required to exhaust his administrative remedies, as he would for an IDEA claim.\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p748\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   , however, such exhaustion is not required if the gravamen of the plaintiff's claim is not for denial of a FAPE.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The State Defendants have argued that the gravamen of J.M.'s claims is not for the denial of his FAPE. As explained above, however, J.M.'s grievances regarding noncompliance with SEBSA are not so easily separated from the question of whether a FAPE was provided, because FAPE, as a legal term of art, encompasses J.M.'s SEBSA concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In any event, even if IDEA exhaustion would ordinarily be required for a SEBSA-based Section 504 or Title II claim, J.M. points out, correctly, that it would not have been required with regard to the systemic-failure claims he has raised against the State Defendants. The IDEA does not require administrative exhaustion \"when it would be futile or inadequate to protect the plaintiff's rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Donoho ex rel. Kemp v. Smith Cty.

The administrative procedures available under the IDEA would, at most, have given J.M. and Ms. Mata the chance to address, prospectively, the school-level deprivations by DCSD and craft an educational remedy going forward in spite of the allegedly inadequate oversight to which DCSD was subject. Such procedures, however, would have been ill-suited to the issues of state-level culpability and systemic failures underlying their surviving claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J.S. ex rel.
