Although \"Smartling\" is an invented term, and therefore would arguably be classified as a suggestive mark, it is essentially a simple combination of the word \"smart\" and the abbreviation for linguistics, \"ling,\" which slides the mark toward descriptiveness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Linguistics is a broad concept that encompasses more than the professional language translation services for online companies provided by Smartling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Attrezzi, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"939906\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/436/32/#p39\">\n    436 F.3d at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that with regard to a business named Attrezzi LLC that sold chef's tools, the word \"Attrezzi translates as 'tools,' not 'chef's tools',\" and therefore \"the term can easily be viewed as suggesting a similarity, not an identity, between ordinary workman's tools and electrical appliances or the like used by a chef,\" allowing the jury to find the term suggestive). Thus, although the Smartling mark is not entirely arbitrary, a reasonable fact finder could conclude that imagination is required to connect \"Smartling\" with its product in the language translation field, making the mark suggestive and thereby stronger. This factor therefore supports Smartling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In sum, the\n   <em>\n    Pignons\n   </em>\n   analysis presents a close call: the marks are similar, the products compete directly, the companies use the same channels of commerce and forms of advertising to target the same prospective customer base, there is some evidence of intentional copying, and the mark could be deemed suggestive. Importantly however, there is not a single instance of actual confusion over the many years the parties have been in the marketplace together. Skawa Facts \u00b6 28. Even given that the other factors favor Smartling, the absence of actual confusion weighs strongly against the likelihood of confusion, which is critical to the claims asserted.

Smartling also relies on the \"[r]ipping off your name and website look and feel\" and \"imitation is the sincerest form of flattery\" emails discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , which while not persuasive direct evidence of secondary meaning, provide some support for Smartling's contention that the allegedly infringed trade dress distinguished Smartling from its competitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Smartling relies most heavily on the fifth factor-proof of intentional copying-to argue that it can prove secondary meaning through indirect evidence. [ECF No. 89 at 20-21]. Smartling emphasizes the fact that Skawa copied its terms and conditions, but provides no case law in support of its contention that usage of the same contractual language constitutes material proof of copying trade dress. There is, however, little doubt that Skawa copied other aspects of Smartling's alleged trade dress. Although it may be that Skawa copied Smartling's website out of mere laziness, it would not be unreasonable for a jury to conclude that Skawa copied features of Smarling's website because they viewed is as distinctive and attractive to consumers. Considering the evidence, Smartling has brought forth sufficient evidence to allow a jury to conclude that Smartling's website was distinctive, either inherently or through the use of the Smartling mark in combination with other design elements, or due to secondary meaning that consumers attached to the trade dress elements that Skawa infringed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Likely to Cause Confusion Among Consumers as to the Product's Source\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   A reasonable jury could also find that consumers were likely to be confused as to the source of the product based on the Easyling site's similarity to the trade dress identified by Smartling. The parties dispute whether there was temporal overlap in their respective use of several of the trade dress elements at issue. Although Smartling updated its website in late 2011 such that there was no longer a light blue strip in the center of the website, orange buttons and trim, text in the center of the page saying \"translate your website,\" links for \"HOW IT WORKS\" and \"PRICING\" in the upper right-hand corner, or the video described in the Amended Complaint, Easyling's late 2011 website mimicked those and other features of Smartling's website.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 78-5 at 5],\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 25-1 at 11]. Additionally, some of the mimicked features, including the Smartling mark and the color scheme continued to be used by Smartling long after it replaced most of the features that Smartling copied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 78-5]. As discussed above,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   part III.A.1, the Easyling mark viewed in isolation could have been confused with the Smartling mark, and a jury could reasonably conclude that the other features that Skawa copied made that confusion more likely. Skawa's motion to dismiss Smartling's trade dress claim will therefore be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

To the extent that Skawa otherwise communicated with Lionbridge from outside of Massachusetts, the record is clear that Lionbridge was aware that\n   Smartling and Easyling were separate, unrelated companies. [ECF No. 78-2 at 139].

Although the Counterclaim alleges that Smartling \"repeatedly claimed to potential clients of ... Skawa and others at exhibitions and elsewhere that ... Skawa would be driven into bankruptcy by this litigation,\" [ECF No. 33 \u00b6 27], the evidence in the record amounts to a single affidavit describing Smartling's statements at one industry conference. [ECF No. 86-1]. The affiant, Mr. Jose Palomares, attests that he attended the American Translator Association's conference from November 5 through November 8, 2014, where he \"spoke directly with sales representatives of Smartling,\" and \"heard those representatives speaking with conference attendees that were potential customers of Smartling and Easyling.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. Moreover, Mr. Palomares \"observed the Smartling representatives telling multiple attendees that Easyling might not be the best choice because they were having financial difficulties, including due to an ongoing lawsuit with Smartling, and that they might go out of business in the short term.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Skawa presents no additional information regarding the significance of the American Translator Association's annual conference with regard to Skawa's business relationships. The affidavit does not identify any of the relevant conference attendees, their names or affiliated companies, or their role at their respective companies, nor does it describe how Mr. Palomares knew that these attendees were \"potential\" customers of both parties. There is no evidence showing the impact of these statements on the conference attendees or suggesting that Mr. Palomares himself was in any way affected by them. There is likewise no evidence concerning the damages that Skawa purportedly incurred as a result of these statements. Even accepting the statements in the affidavit as true, they show at most that during one out-of-state industry conference that took place after\n   the filing of this lawsuit, one attendee overheard unidentified Smartling representatives stating to other unidentified attendees that Skawa \"might\" not be the \"best\" choice \"at the time\" because of the financial difficulties associated with Smartling's lawsuit, and \"might\" go out of business soon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Such equivocal and speculative statements, made solely to a limited number of conference attendees, are not sufficiently immoral or oppressive conduct to constitute the sort of \"extreme or egregious\" business practice necessary to sustain a 93A claim. Although Skawa's allegations were sufficient to survive the pleadings stage, the evidence is plainly insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. Summary judgment is therefore granted in Smartling's favor on the Counterclaim in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Although Defendants do not expressly move for summary judgment on this issue, Smartling now acknowledges that \"[a]pparently [Easyling LLC] is not in fact an LLC ... nor even a distinct entity from Skawa.\" [ECF No. 89 at 5 n.2].

Skawa does not identify any claims that are appropriate for dismissal under Rule 12(c) as opposed to Rule 56, or otherwise distinguish its arguments between those two standards. It is inappropriate for Skawa to seemingly tack the Rule 12(c) standard onto a summary judgment motion to introduce favorable evidentiary materials into the record while asking the Court to look only to the pleadings for the Rule 12 motion. Rule 12(c) makes clear that \"[i]f, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gulf Coast Bank &amp; Tr.
