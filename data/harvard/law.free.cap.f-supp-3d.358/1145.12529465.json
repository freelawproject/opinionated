Defendants are the Director of the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), members of the Oregon Transportation Commission, and the Administrator of ODOT's Driver and Motor Vehicles Division. Collectively, they are \"the DMV.\" Simultaneously with filing the Complaint, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction and to certify the class. This Opinion addresses the preliminary injunction motion only. At oral argument on that motion, I deferred any further briefing on the class certification motion, and any other activity in the case, until resolution of the preliminary injunction motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs bring three claims, each alleging a violation of either due process, equal protection, or both. Because Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits as to any of their claims, I deny the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Oregon, like other states, has a statutory scheme in which the failure to pay a court-adjudicated traffic violation fine can result in the suspension of a driver's license. Recently, some states have addressed the practice through legislation. In California, for example, according to a\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Times\n   </em>\n   article cited by Plaintiffs, the California Legislature passed a bill, signed by the Governor in June 2017, preventing the suspension of driver's licenses because of unpaid fines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other\n   states are in litigation over the practice.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fowler v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-11441,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206379676\">\n    2017 WL 6379676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich.

Oct. 5, 2017) (challenge to Tennessee statutes allowing suspension of driver's licenses for nonpayment of fines or costs imposed for conviction of driving offenses) (\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson I\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case, however, involves Oregon's statutory scheme. Thus, I begin there before turning to other evidence in the record submitted in support of, and in opposition to, the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. Oregon's Statutory Scheme\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Oregon Vehicle Code defines \"traffic violation\" as \"a traffic offense that is designated as a traffic violation in the statute defining the offense, or any other offense defined in the Oregon Vehicle Code that is punishable by a fine but that is not punishable by a term of imprisonment.\" Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 (O.R.S). 801.557 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   O.R.S. 153.008(1)(a), (b) (providing generally that an \"offense\" is a \"violation\" if it is \"designated as a violation by the statute defining the offense,\" or the \"statute prescribing the penalty for the offense provides that the offense is punishable by a fine but does not provide that the offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Violations are classified into categories. O.R.S. 153.012 (designating categories as Class A, Class B, Class C, and Class D, as well as \"unclassified violations as described in O.R.S. 153.015,\" and \"[s]pecific fine violations as described in O.R.S. 153.015.\"). \"The penalty for committing a violation is a fine.\" O.R.S. 153.018(1). There are maximum, presumptive, and minimum fines for each category of violation. O.R.S. 153.018(2) (maximum fines); O.R.S. 153.019 (presumptive fines); O.R.S. 153.020 (increasing presumptive fines for violations committed in a highway work zone, school zone, or safety corridor); O.R.S. 153.021 (minimum fines). The Chief Justice of the\n   Oregon Supreme Court is required to establish a uniform fine schedule for violations prosecuted in circuit courts. O.R.S. 153.800(4)(b). Courts other than circuit courts are required to establish schedules of the amounts of penalties to be imposed for first, second, and subsequent violations, designating each violation specifically or by class. O.R.S. 153.800(4)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When law enforcement officers issue a citation and summons to a driver for a traffic violation, certain information must be included as specified in O.R.S. 153.045 - 153.051. This includes the amount of the presumptive fine, if there is one for the violation. O.R.S. 153.051(4) (requirements of the summons). The summons must notify the person that a monetary judgment may be entered for up to the maximum amount of fines, restitution, and other costs allowed by law if the person fails to make all required appearances at proceedings. O.R.S. 153.051(5). And, the summons must notify the person that if he or she pleads no contest and pays the presumptive fine, the person may submit an explanation of the circumstances of the violation and the court may consider that explanation in establishing the amount of the fine, but the court cannot impose a fine less than the statutory minimum. O.R.S. 153.051(7). The summons must also notify the person that if the person pleads not guilty and requests a trial, the fines still cannot be less than the minimum unless the person is found not guilty. O.R.S. 153.051(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A person who has been issued a citation must make an appearance in person at the time indicated in the citation/summons, request a trial, or deliver payment of the presumptive fine to the court. O.R.S. 153.061(1), (3). Circuit courts, municipal courts, and justice courts adjudicate traffic violations. In cases where the defendant pleads no contest by delivering payment of the presumptive fine to the court under O.R.S. 153.061(3), the amount of the fine may not exceed the presumptive fine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204418134\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, a judge may suspend operation of any part of a judgment entered under the \"Violations and Fines\" chapter of the Oregon statutes upon condition that the defendant pay the nonsuspended portion of a fine within a specified period of time. O.R.S. 153.090(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When a traffic violation fine remains unpaid, a court may use a private collection agency to seek recoupment of the debt or refer the debt to the Oregon Department of Revenue (ODOR). O.R.S. 1.197(1). In addition to these options, \"[a] court may ... (a) issue a notice of suspension to the [DMV] that directs the department to implement procedures under ORS 809.416 [,] or (b) [o]rder a defendant's driving privileges restricted.\" O.R.S. 809.210(1). This case concerns only (a), the issuance of the notice of suspension. Although an unpaid traffic violation fine allows a court to send a suspension notice to the DMV, a court is prohibited from sending a notice of suspension for those who have failed to pay fines for bicycle, pedestrian, or parking offenses. O.R.S. 809.210(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Upon receipt of the notice of suspension from a court, suspension of a driver's license by the DMV is mandatory. A person \"is subject to suspension under ORS 809.415(4) if the department receives a notice of suspension from a court under ORS 809.210 indicating that the person has failed or refused to pay a fine[.]\" O.R.S. 809.416(2). The \"department\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   suspend driving privileges when provided under ORS 809.416.\" O.R.S. 809.415(4) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   O.R.S. 809.210(4)(b) (providing that if the court issues a notice of suspension that directs the DMV to implement procedures under O.R.S. 809.416, the DMV shall take action on the suspension as provided under O.R.S. 809.416 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A person is subject to suspension under O.R.S. 809.416(2) until one of the following occurs: (1) the person presents the department with a notice of reinstatement issued by the court showing that the person (a) is making payments or has paid the fine; or (b) has enrolled in a preapprenticeship program as defined or is a registered apprentice as defined; or (2) twenty years has elapsed from the date of the traffic offense. O.R.S. 809.416(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   O.R.S. 809.415(4)(a) (the mandatory suspension shall continue until the earlier of (1) the person establishes that she or he has performed all acts necessary under O.R.S. 809.416 to make the person not subject to suspension; or (2) twenty years from the date the traffic offense occurred if the suspension is imposed for a reason described in O.R.S. 809.416(2) (failure or refusal to pay a fine) ). Echoing the exception in O.R.S. 809.210(7), O.R.S. 809.416(3) exempts from suspension persons who fail or refuse to pay a fine relating to any pedestrian, bicycle, or parking offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While mandatory unless excepted under O.R.S. 809.416(2)(a) or (b), the suspension does not take effect immediately. Instead, the department, upon receipt of a notice of suspension from a court, must send a letter by first class mail advising the person that suspension will begin sixty days from the date of the letter unless the department is presented with a notice of reinstatement by the court under O.R.S. 809.416(2)(a). O.R.S. 809.416(3) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   O.R.S. 809.210(4)(a) (providing that if the court issues a notice of suspension that directs the DMV to implement suspension procedures under O.R.S. 809.416, and if at any time within the period of suspension, a person pays the fine or has begun making payments according to the payment schedule established with the court, the court shall immediately send to the department a notice of reinstatement; further stating that the notice of suspension may be reissued if the person ceases making payments before the fine is paid in full).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A person whose license has been suspended under O.R.S. 809.415(4)(a) is entitled to administrative review under O.R.S. 809.440. O.R.S. 809.415(4)(b). This review is an \"informal administrative process to assure prompt and careful review by the department of the documents upon which an action is based.\" O.R.S. 809.440(2)(a). A person may defend against the department's action by showing (1) that the conviction did not involve a motor vehicle and the department's action is permitted only if the offense involves a motor vehicle; (2) an out-of-state conviction on which the department's action is based was for an offense that is not comparable to an offense under Oregon law; or (3) the records relied on by the department identify the wrong person. O.R.S. 809.440(2)(b). Judicial review of a department order affirming a suspension is allowed. O.R.S. 809.440(2)(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The statutes do not appear to address the contents of the sixty-day notice sent by the DMV. However, the preliminary injunction record contains copies of such notices sent to several of the Plaintiffs. First, a sixty-day notice was sent to Plaintiff Gloria Bermudez on October 7, 2013 and makes clear that her driving privileges will be suspended beginning at 12:01 AM on December 6, 2013. Bermudez Decl., Ex. 2, ECF 4-2. The information in the notice is comprehensive and includes information indicating that the suspension can be prevented by contacting the applicable court. It states, at various places in the notice:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   To prevent this suspension you must make certain the action required below is completed and received by DMV no later than 5:00 pm on the last business day prior to December 06, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   You can stop this suspension by contacting the court named below and completing all the requirements necessary to clear this matter.

Ganuelas Decl., Ex. 1, ECF 6-1.

Mendoza Decl., Ex. 2, ECF 8-2; Roberts Decl., Ex. 1, ECF 9-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Even if suspension has begun, a court may still issue a notice of reinstatement and the suspension will be terminated.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Bermudez Decl., Ex. 2 (\"You can stop this suspension after it begins by meeting the court's requirements and obtaining a court clearance notice.\"; \"If we receive the clearance notice on or after the date the suspension begins, you will have to pay a reinstatement fee to DMV[.]\"); Ganuelas Decl., Ex. 1 (\"If DMV receives the court clearance after the suspension begins, you will have to pay a DMV reinstatement fee.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II. Plaintiffs' Suspensions &amp; Personal Circumstances\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Each of the six named Plaintiffs currently has a suspended license for failure to pay traffic debt. Bermudez Decl. \u00b6 6; Ganuelas Decl. \u00b6 3, ECF 6; Heath Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6, ECF 7; Mendoza Decl. \u00b6 5, ECF 8; Roberts Decl. \u00b6 6, ECF 9; Chase Decl. \u00b6 12, ECF 34. Some have had multiple suspensions over many years.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Bermudez Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10 (license suspended in 2003 and again in 2014); Heath Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6 (license suspended in 1995 and has received six notices of suspension since then); Mendoza Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7, 13 (license suspended in 2010, again in 2016, and expects another as a result of unpaid fines).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The underlying violations which resulted in fines include (1) failing to obey a traffic control device, failing to use proper child seats, driving with expired tags, driving while using a cell phone; Bermudez Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9, 10, 13; (2) failing to display plates or illegal display of plates; Ganuelas Decl. \u00b6 3; Roberts Decl. \u00b6 6; (3) speeding; Ganuelas Decl. \u00b6 4; Mendoza Decl. \u00b6 7; Chase Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8; and (4) failing to appear at\n   arraignment for misdemeanor traffic case involving a car accident with property damage only; Mendoza Decl. \u00b6 12. Additionally, Plaintiffs have received citations, and thus fines, for driving with a suspended license.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Bermudez Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13; Ganuelas Decl. \u00b6 5; Mendoza Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6; Roberts Decl. \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Some Plaintiffs have attempted to work out payment plans.

Bermudez Decl. \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204418134\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1 (copy of citation). Because she failed to appear at her arraignment and apparently did not pay the presumptive fine, her license was suspended in May 2003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. The debt was sent to collections but the court later set up a payment plan, allowing her license to be reinstated in 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, she could not keep up with the $ 50/month payments and her license was suspended again in 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In July 2012, Bermudez was cited for several violations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. She worked out a payment plan with the court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 3. She was to pay $ 75 per month, on the 24th of each month, until the total of $ 435 was paid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On August 24, 2012, the date her first payment was due, she wrote a letter to the court explaining that she could not make the payment because she just had a premature baby.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 4. A handwritten note dated the same day states \"allow 30 days extra.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, she still could not make the payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.

Ganuelas Decl. \u00b6 5. On one of those occasions, in 2015, she was offered a payment plan for the $ 485 owed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. She made $ 50 monthly payments for a time but was unable to pay a $ 160 balance at which point the court notified the DMV which suspended her license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Heath states that \"various courts have forced me into payment plans that I couldn't afford.\" Heath Decl. \u00b6 8. Most required her to make a minimum $ 50 monthly payment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Most recently, the Pendleton Municipal Court imposed that requirement on her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She began making $ 20 monthly payments instead, which subjected her to a show cause hearing during which the court agreed to allow her to continue making $ 20 monthly payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mendoza does not remember being offered a payment plan for traffic debt owed to the Beaverton or Milwaukie Municipal Courts. Mendoza Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9. She currently is on a payment plan for traffic debt owed to Clackamas County Circuit Court, but she has missed some of the $ 100 monthly payments and that court has now sent the debt to collections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 13. She expects that the court will send a suspension notice to the DMV which will suspend her license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Roberts states that at one point, he made payments to the Baker County Justice Court but since then, he has acquired more traffic tickets which he cannot pay off with his limited income. Roberts Decl. \u00b6 7. It is his belief that the Baker County Justice Court will not ask the DMV to lift his suspension unless he is able to make $ 50 monthly payments to that court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Chase was offered payment plans in Gilliam and Sherman County Justice Courts when he explained he could not pay the fines and fees for speeding citations. Chase Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8.

He also received traffic violations in 2006 and 2008 in Beaverton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Consistent with what he was told by the Gilliam and Sherman County Justice\n   Courts, the Beaverton Municipal Court also told him that a payment plan was available, but it could not extend beyond twelve months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This debt was also assigned to a private debt collector.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Chase worked out payment plans with the private collection agencies beginning in 2013 to pay off the debts to the Gilliam and Sherman County Justice Courts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-17. Both of those debts have been discharged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He has attempted to negotiate a payment plan with the Beaverton Municipal Court but was told that because the debt had been referred to a private collection agency, the debt was \"out of house\" and he could not meet with a judge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.

Judge Jad Lemhouse, a Justice of the Peace for the Linn County Justice of the Peace District 4A, regularly conducts proceedings on traffic offenses, both misdemeanor crimes and violation offenses. Lemhouse Decl. \u00b6 2, ECF 25. He states that in his experience, \"most judges in Oregon are willing to work with people to get them out of the system.\" Lemhouse Decl. \u00b6 16. But, he explains, a person must appear in court and follow the court's directions and procedures \"for that to happen.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   When a person with a suspended license comes into Lemhouse's court for a driving while suspended violation, he talks to the person about whether the person wants to get her or his driving privileges reinstated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. If the person does, he defers sentencing and discusses what is required for reinstatement and what kind of timeline is necessary to accomplish certain tasks such as contacting each of the courts to which the person owes a fine to try and make payment arrangements, contacting the state support enforcement division to\n   address the person's unpaid child support, if any, and contacting five or six insurance agents to ascertain the cost of obtaining insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lemhouse works with the person to schedule proposed payments to the courts or the support enforcement division along with the monthly insurance cost.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. At this point, the person can show each of the courts that he or she is seriously making an effort.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If necessary, Lemhouse writes to the judge or judges in question supporting the person's proposal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Attach.

She hears traffic violation cases and states that when a fine is imposed, the person may pay in full or set up a payment plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. The monthly payment may be different for each person based on the ability to pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If the person is unable to make a payment after the payment plan is set, and the person is in contact with the court, the court will work with the person to assure compliance with the court's order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In such cases, the person may be allowed to skip a monthly payment or reduce the amount of the monthly payment until the person can get back to work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She states: \"The key is to keep in contact with the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   When individuals do not appear or do not contact the court, or fail to continue to make their payments as part of a payment plan, and when the court \"cannot get the convicted person's attention for compliance,\" the court will issue the notice of suspension to the DMV to initiate suspension procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Once the DMV sends the sixty-day suspension notice, the person can contact the court and get into compliance by paying the fine or setting up a payment plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This allows the person to entirely avoid the license suspension and the DMV reinstatement fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Even post-suspension, the person can obtain reinstatement by working with the court to pay the fine via a payment plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Brisbin, \"[p]ersons may provide a letter to the judge stating their financial hardship along with documentation to resolve the license suspension.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Brisbin observes that the notice of suspension issued by the DMV \"often ... works so that the person contacts the court who then works with the person to facilitate payment of the fine.

Thus, even assuming that the Declarations are based on potential inadmissible hearsay, the statements are appropriately considered for the purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   IV. Oregon's Scheme in Law &amp; in Practice\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Oregon courts adjudicate traffic violations. Punishment for a traffic violation is a fine. Citations give notice of the court date and time that the violator must appear to address the citation. Some violators do not wish to contest guilt and are willing and able to pay the assessed fine, which is the presumptive fine as set by the Oregon Legislature. This may be accomplished without a formal court appearance. Otherwise, the violator must appear. The statutes addressing the contents of citations and summonses do not require that the violator be told that even when guilt is admitted, a payment plan may be worked out in cases of indigency or that failure to pay could result in suspension of a license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The statutes also do not require that an Oregon court assessing a fine for a traffic violation notify the violator of the possibility of a payment plan for the fine. Nonetheless, several Oregon courts, as demonstrated by the judicial officers' Declarations as well as the Declarations of several Plaintiffs, do consider a person's indigency and will offer a payment plan. Whether this occurs frequently, regularly, occasionally, or otherwise is unclear. The evidence indicates\n   that each time a Plaintiff requested an initial payment plan from a court, he or she was given one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   It may not have been one that suited the Plaintiff's ability to pay, for example when Chase was told the fine had to be paid over twelve months making for untenable monthly payments, but a payment plan was initially offered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   While the statutes provide for a minimum fine for each type of violation, they also provide that a judge may suspend any part of the judgment, including the fine, \"upon condition that the defendant pay the nonsuspended portion of a fine within a specified period of time.\" O.R.S. 153.090(4). This suggests that judges have flexibility to work with a violator so that the total fine paid may be less than the minimum statutory fine. In fact, Judge Lemhouse notes that he remits the unpaid portion of a fine upon completion of his requirements of consecutive payments of twenty-four months with no new violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The lack of consistency among the courts in whether they affirmatively account for violators' indigency and notify violators of the possibility and terms of a payment plan is troubling. What may benefit a violator in one jurisdiction may be unavailable in another. Certainly, the statutes do not\n   <em>\n    prohibit\n   </em>\n   a court from offering a payment plan or from accounting for an individual's financial circumstances. But, the statutes undisputably do not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   a court to make an assessment of an individual violator's ability to pay a fine and structure a fine and payment plan accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   It is also clear that the suspension of a driver's license is within the discretion of the court. The statute unambiguously states that when a fine is unpaid, the \"court\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   ... issue a notice of suspension to the [DMV] that directs the department to implement procedures under ORS 809.416 [.]\" O.R.S. 809.210(1)(a) (emphasis added). It is not mandatory for the court to issue the notice. However, once issued, it is\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   for the DMV to suspend the license after issuing the sixty-day suspension notice when no reinstatement order from the court is received by the DMV before the sixty-day period expires. In contrast to the discretion afforded the court, there is no discretion for the DMV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The sixty-day notices in the record expressly direct the recipients to the court to address the outstanding fine, but they fail to mention anything about options if one is unable to pay. While the statute contemplates that the court has the authority to work out a payment plan at that point, or even after suspension has begun, the sixty-day notices do not specifically inform the recipients that a payment plan may be an option. Instead, recipients are told that they can stop the suspension by contacting the court and \"completing all the requirements necessary to clear this matter,\" or by \"meeting the court's requirements.\" In the more recent version of the notices, the recipient is told to \"[c]ontact the court to determine how to obtain a court clearance for the docket(s) shown.\" Unless one knows to ask for a payment plan, it may not occur to a person receiving the sixty-day notice that anything other than full payment is possible.

But, I agree with Defendants that the requested relief requiring Defendants to revoke Plaintiffs' suspensions and reinstate their licenses without any additional fee, is mandatory because it orders Defendants to take action instead of prohibiting them from future allegedly unconstitutional conduct. And, in this case, the requested injunctive relief that is prohibitory is unavailable to Plaintiffs unless the mandatory injunctive relief is granted. Because the status quo is one of current suspensions, it is only if Defendants first rescind Plaintiffs' suspensions and restore their driving\n   privileges that a future prohibition on suspending Plaintiffs' licenses without an exemption upon demonstrated inability to pay would matter.

Next, they argue that the interests involved are greatly affected as demonstrated by Plaintiffs' unchallenged Declarations detailing the burdens they experience when deprived of their driver's licenses. Third, Plaintiffs contend that there is no rational connection between suspending a license for failure to pay traffic debt and the challenged means of doing so without an inquiry into the debtor's ability to pay before or during suspension. Plaintiffs concede that O.R.S. 809.416 may be a rational means for coercing payment of traffic debt for those who can afford to pay it. But, that is not the case for those low-income individuals who cannot afford to make payments on the debt. \"Visiting a harsh consequence on 'someone who through no fault of his own is unable to make' the payment sought 'will not make [payment] suddenly forthcoming.' \"\n   <em>\n    Thomas I\n   </em>\n   , 303 F.Supp.3d at 614 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299177\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/660/\">\n    461 U.S. at 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299177\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/660/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (brackets in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ). In fact, Plaintiffs argue, depriving traffic debtors of their\n   driver's licenses based on a failure to pay is counterproductive because it undermines the objective of obtaining payments on traffic debt by adversely affecting the debtors' ability to find and maintain a job.

Thus, the state has a legitimate\n   interest in punishing, in some form, violations such as speeding, driving while talking on a cell phone, failure to obey a traffic control device, failure to use proper car seats, etc. Even a broken tail light implicates visibility and thus, safety. Fines, therefore, are rationally related to enforcement of traffic laws and to the deterrence of continued violations. The sting of paying a fine will hopefully prevent future unsafe driving practices. Even those who can pay the fine likely do not desire to part with their money for this reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Methods by which the state can enforce compliance with the fine requirement, therefore, are rationally related to the safety goal. Without a compliance mechanism, the fine is toothless and without deterrent effect. Accordingly, fines are reduced to a judgment, subject to payment or collection by a number of methods, and eventually or additionally, can result in the violator's license suspension if the fine is unpaid. Nonetheless, as the judicial officers explain, the threat of suspension is an effective tool to coerce payment. Of course, compliance efforts may be ineffective as to those whose life circumstances leave them on the edge of economic survival every day.

I understand Plaintiffs' position that the risk of erroneous deprivation is high under the procedures currently used because absent the opportunity to establish indigency, Plaintiffs' fundamental rights will be wrongfully deprived. But, Plaintiffs' characterization of the deprivation is founded upon an assumption that there is a constitutional right to an indigency determination in the first place and that the rights implicated by the suspensions are fundamental in a constitutional sense. As stated previously, I disagree with Plaintiffs on this point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   I do not intend my conclusion to suggest that I am blind to the fundamental effect that driver's license suspensions for nonpayment of traffic debt have on Plaintiffs' lives. I do not underestimate the adverse effects on their employment opportunities, recreational opportunities, access to medical care, and more. But, for the reasons previously explained, I do not find support in the caselaw for concluding that the rights they assert have been recognized as \"constitutionally fundamental.\" Thus, Plaintiffs' articulation of the risk of erroneous deprivation is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The second\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factor also looks at the probative value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards. Here, the fine is imposed only after a violation has been adjudicated by a court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franceschi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516614\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/927/\">\n    887 F.3d at 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the facts supporting suspension related to the plaintiff's tax deficiency had already been established through prior proceedings). If the court exercises discretion to initiate suspension of the license for nonpayment of the fine, the DMV issues a pre-deprivation sixty-day notice informing the violator that she or he may resolve the issue by returning to the court. Again, because I conclude that the Constitution does not require Plaintiffs' indigence to be assessed, the fact that the DMV sixty-day notice does not expressly inform the violator that the court may be willing to entertain a payment plan does not render the notice ineffective. Thus, the procedures currently used allow the violator to appear in court to contest the violation and then, if a fine is imposed and remains unpaid and the court notifies the DMV, the violator receives a pre-deprivation notice directing him or her to return to the court. At that point, the court may consider indigency and can create a payment plan or adjust the fine. The pre-deprivation notice also advises the violator of the right to administrative, albeit limited, review. Additional procedures here would be of little probative value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Finally, the government has a strong interest in enforcing traffic fines to deter continuing traffic violations.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272892\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/271/316/#p329\">\n    271 F.Supp.3d at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Massachusetts has a substantial interest in securing public safety on its roads by suspending the operating privileges of drivers who default on [civil motor vehicle infractions].\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   When weighing all of these factors, I conclude that the Oregon scheme complies with procedural due process. The nature of the private interest, the nature of the government interest, and the low risk of erroneous deprivation support a determination that the opportunity to initially contest the violation and the pre-deprivation notice with its instructions to return to court and information regarding the right to administrative review, sufficiently protect an individual's property interest in his or her driver's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   VI. Remaining Preliminary Injunction Considerations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Having found that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of any of their claims, I do not need to consider the remaining preliminary injunction factors of the likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, balancing of the equities, and whether an injunction is in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191886\" index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/733/#p740\">\n    786 F.3d at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because it is a threshold inquiry, when a plaintiff has failed to show the likelihood of success on the merits, we need not consider the remaining three\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   elements.\") (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Nonetheless, I briefly address the factors to provide the parties, and the Ninth Circuit should this ruling be appealed, my analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   A. Irreparable Harm\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that any constitutional violation is, by definition, irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266713\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/976/#p999\">\n    872 F.3d at 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the deprivation of constitutional rights unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury\") (internal quotation marks omitted). They also rely on the facts in their Declarations which show the harm they have suffered from their license suspensions and which will continue absent injunctive relief. Every day, they state, they are faced with the\n   impossible choice between driving with a suspended license and risking deeper debt, and providing the basic necessities of life for themselves and their families.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Defendants note that under the heightened standard for a mandatory injunction, Plaintiffs must show that serious and extreme damage will occur absent preliminary injunctive relief. Defendants argue that the harm here is speculative. They acknowledge that Plaintiffs have described difficult lives in their Declarations. But, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not proven that without an immediate injunction some specific factors will cause an additional and irreparable harm. They note that any injunctive relief will not address past harm and the future harms are only speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Defendants' evidence establishes that there is no irreparable harm because even if I granted the requested relief, Plaintiffs' licenses would remain suspended. According to Mary Garcia, a Driver Control Operations and Policy Analyst for the DMV, the DMV driving records for each Plaintiff\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   show that each one would need to resolve additional suspensions and satisfy other requirements, separate from the suspensions for failure to comply and related reinstatement fees which they challenge here, before they could drive with an Oregon driver's license.

Balance of Equities\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   This factor requires the court to \"balance the competing claims of injury\" and \"consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    555 U.S. at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

At this point, absent certification of a class, the relief is restricted to only the six named Plaintiffs. Thus, the balance of equities goes to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   C.

Reply 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Defendants make no separate \"public interest\" argument other than to state that their administrative burden argument supports a conclusion that Plaintiffs cannot show that an injunction would be in the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Given that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their constitutional claims and that their' argument relies on the class certification motion being granted, which it has not, at this point, I find the public interest to be a neutral factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   SUMMARY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   For the reasons explained above, I conclude that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits as to any of their three claims. Plaintiffs may be correct that suspending driver's licenses for indigent traffic debtors is an exercise in futility. While the record shows that the threat of suspension, or the actual suspension, of a driver's license has prompted some Plaintiffs to make payments on traffic debt from time to time, I assume that for the majority of indigent traffic debtors, suspension is misguided and counterproductive. I recognize that Plaintiffs' economic situations are marginal and the loss of their driver's licenses for their inability to pay their traffic debt burdens their lives with little chance that the state will actually collect full payment. Nonetheless, their predicaments, as desperate as they may be, do not raise constitutional claims. Absent constitutional implications, it is not the court's position to determine if the statutory scheme is \"unwise,\" whether it \"best fulfills the relevant social and economic objections\" that the state \"might ideally espouse,\" or if \"a more just and humane system could not be devised.\"\n   <em>\n    Dandridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12055070\" index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/471/#p485\">\n    397 U.S. at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12055070\" index=\"325\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/471/#p485\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
