OMB's Decision to Review and Stay Component 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Just under a year after OMB approved the data collection, on August 29, 2017, Neomi Rao, the OIRA Administrator, sent a memorandum to Victoria Lipnic, the Acting Chair of the EEOC, stating that OMB had decided to initiate a review and stay of EEOC's new collection of pay data under Component 2. In support of this decision, the memorandum stated in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The PRA authorizes the Director of OMB to determine the length of approvals of collections of information and to determine whether collections of information initially meet and continue to meet the standards of the PRA. In this context, under 5 CFR 1320.10(f) and (g), OMB may review an approved collection of information if OMB determines that the relevant circumstances related to the collection have changed and/or that the burden estimates provided by EEOC at the time of initial submission were materially in error. OMB has determined that each of these conditions for review has been met. For example, since approving the revised EEO-1 form on September 29, 2016, OMB understands that EEOC has released data file specifications\n   for employers to use in submitting EEO-1 data. These specifications were not contained in the Federal Register notices as part of the public comment process nor were they outlined in the supporting statement for the collection of information. As a result, the public did not receive an opportunity to provide comment on the method of data submission to EEOC. In addition, EEOC's burden estimates did not account for the use of these particular data file specifications, which may have changed the initial burden estimate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   OMB has also decided to stay immediately the effectiveness of the revised aspects of the EEO-1 form for good cause, as we believe that continued collection of this information is contrary to the standards of the PRA. Among other things, OMB is concerned that some aspects of the revised collection of information lack practical utility, are unnecessarily burdensome, and do not adequately address privacy and confidentiality issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Memorandum from Neomi Rao, Adm'r, OIRA, to Victoria Lipnic, Acting Chair, EEOC (Aug. 29, 2017); JA020, ECF No. 44 (\"Rao Memorandum\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The memorandum further directed EEOC to publish a notice in the Federal Register \"announcing the immediate stay of effectiveness of the\" pay data collection but \"confirming that businesses may use the previously approved EEO-1 form in order to comply with their report obligations for FY 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   EEOC published this notice on September 15, 2017.

Therefore, OMB claimed that 1) \"the public did not receive an opportunity to provide comment on the method of data submission to EEOC\"; and 2) \"EEOC's burden estimates did not account for the use of these particular data file specifications, which may have changed the initial burden estimate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201320.10\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   OMB's assertion that the data file specifications were not contained in the Federal Register, thereby depriving the public of an opportunity to comment on them, is misdirected, inaccurate, and ultimately unpersuasive. The claim is misdirected, because the data file specifications consisted of a sample spreadsheet and formatting specifications which explained how to format a spreadsheet; they did not change the content of the information collected. In both the Sixty-Day and Thirty-Day notices, EEOC described in detail the information it proposed to collect. The government's argument therefore focuses on a technicality that did not affect the employers submitting the data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The government's claim that employers lacked an opportunity to comment on the data file specifications is strained, because the Thirty-Day Notice explicitly stated that for employers who were going to file through data uploads, the EEOC would post online the new data file specifications \"for Components 1 and 2 of the modified EEO-1 as soon as OMB approves the information collection.\" 81 Fed. Reg. at 45487. Moreover, the Sixty-Day Notice directed employers to a website with sample data collection forms which provided \"an illustration of the data to be collected by both Components 1 and 2 [of the revised EEO-1].\" 81 Fed. Reg. at 5118. The sample spreadsheets in the data file specification match in all material respects the sample form provided in the Sixty-Day Notice.\n   <em>\n    Compare id.\n   </em>\n   with Link Decl. \u00b6 8, Ex. E. Thus, employers not only knew that the data file specifications would be posted after OMB's approval, but also knew what the specifications would look like, putting the employers in a good position to comment if they desired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Moreover, OMB gave its approval knowing that the Thirty-Day Notice stated that the file data specifications would be posted \"as soon as\" OMB approved the information collection. Plainly, OMB and employers expected\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   file specifications, so OMB's assertion that anyone was caught off guard by the mere posting of data file specifications rings hollow. Unable to point to any material variance between the sample form in the Sixty-Day Notice and the specifications ultimately posted, OMB's burden was to show how the file data specifications altered the content of the information required from employers or significantly increased the burden on employers in producing that information. OMB did not carry that burden. Moreover, OMB did not explain why posting the data file specifications after OMB approved the Component 2 collection should jeopardize the collection, when OMB had previously allowed data file specifications to be submitted after it approved EEO-1 forms.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Agency Information Collection Activities: Notice of Submission for OMB Review; Final Comment Request,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%2071294\">\n    70 Fed.

First, as noted, EEOC's sample form in the Sixty-Day Notice and description in both the Thirty-Day and Sixty-Day notices of the pay data that would be collected were consistent with the data file specifications. Second, OMB did not actually\n   <em>\n    find\n   </em>\n   that the data file specifications would change the initial burden estimates; rather, it stated that data file specifications \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   change the initial burden estimate.\" Rao Memorandum at 1 (emphasis added). This equivocation is not surprising given that OMB's assertion was unsupported by any analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The only \"changed circumstance\" alleged by OMB is the release of the data file specifications. But this is far from a \"changed circumstance\" in any meaningful sense. As mentioned, in the Thirty-Day Notice, EEOC informed OMB and the public that it would post file specifications after OMB approved the collection of information. After OMB approved the collection of information, EEOC released the data file specifications. There was no changed circumstance. EEOC proceeded exactly as planned and as OMB had approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Moreover, OMB merely speculated that the initial burden estimate \"may\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   be incorrect, while failing to support its speculation with any analysis. This omission is remarkable because OMB did not assert that EEOC's previous analyses were based on formats meaningfully different from the file data specifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   81 Fed.

The EEOC provided this tool to employers for use with the 2016 EEO-1, as evident on the EEOC website where the file specifications for the 2016 EEO-1 were published ... Like those later published for the EEO-1 pay data collection, the 2016 specifications were in comma-separated values format (\"csv\"), a format that enables employers to convert tabular data (like that in the EEO-1) for importation and exportation to a database. Employers that used data upload technology for their 2016 EEO-1 reports used these csv specifications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Publication of the file specifications after OMB's approval of the pay data collection is not a \"significant\" change that warrants OMB's reconsideration. As noted above, EEOC indicated in the 30-day notice its intent to post updated\n   specifications, and stated that it would provide support to employers and HRIS vendors as they transitioned to the new reporting requirements. EEAC had notice of these data specifications, was probably familiar with the 2016 version, and had ample opportunity to raise questions or concerns before OMB's approval of the revised EEO-1, but did not do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Memorandum from Peggy Mastroianni to Victoria Lipnic, Acting Chair, EEOC (Apr. 14, 2017); JA126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The government now claims that Component 2 required \"significant formatting changes.\" Defs. Mem at 23. But the Rao Memorandum did not reach that conclusion. Administrator Rao's letter said only that the data file specifications \"may have changed the initial burden estimate.\" Rao Memorandum at 1. Moreover, even if OMB had relied on a finding of \"significant formatting changes\" at the time of the stay, its conclusion would have lacked analytic and evidentiary support. This court cannot \"fill in critical gaps in an agency's reasoning. We can only look to the [agency's] stated rationale.

While there may be instances when formatting changes could be burdensome, that is not the case here. Similarly, it is conceivable that the government could impose formatting requirements that made the presentation of collected information far more difficult for employers. But in this case, OMB and the regulated entities knew what the formatting would look like before OMB gave its approval to the Component 2 collection, and the government has failed to demonstrate any likelihood that the data file specifications meaningfully increase the burden on employers. Indeed, neither the Rao Memorandum nor the administrative record as a whole demonstrates that before issuing its stay, OMB ever analyzed the data file specifications in an effort to determine whether they meaningfully changed the burden of collecting Component 2 information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. REMEDY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Because the court has determined that OMB's stay of EEOC's pay data collection was illegal, it must fashion an appropriate remedy.
