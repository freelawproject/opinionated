INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the court is a motion to suppress evidence and statements (ECF No. 38) filed by defendant Jamal Brooks (\"Brooks\"). Brooks is charged in a criminal indictment with possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon on August 22, 2017, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). The charge in the indictment is based upon three firearms and ammunition recovered from a search of Brooks' residence conducted pursuant to a search warrant on August 22, 2017. Brooks in the motion to suppress and supplemental submissions argues that law enforcement violated his rights guaranteed by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the evidence and statements obtained from those violations should be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 12, 2018, the government filed a response in opposition to Brooks' motion to suppress. (ECF No. 43.) On February 23, 2018, Brooks filed a supplemental brief with respect to the motion to suppress. (ECF No. 44.) On March 19, 2018, the government filed a response in opposition to Brooks' supplemental brief. (ECF No. 52.) On March 25, 2018, Brooks filed a reply brief with respect to the motion to suppress. (ECF No. 53.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 12, 2018, the court held a hearing with respect to Brooks' motion to suppress. The parties entered exhibits into evidence and the government presented the testimony of three witnesses. On November 15, 2018, the parties each filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. (ECF Nos. 82, 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 28, 2018, the court sua sponte raised the issue of inevitable discovery with respect to the search of the crashed gray sedan and requested the parties to brief the issue. The court inquired whether additional evidence was necessary. On November 30, 2018, the parties filed their supplemental briefs. (ECF Nos. 89, 90.) Brooks did not request the record be reopened for additional evidence. To the contrary, Brooks objected to reopening the record. (ECF No. 89.) The government requested an opportunity to reopen the record to present testimony by Howard Burton, the chief of police for the Penn Hills Police Department, about the Penn Hills Police Department's inventory policy. (ECF No. 90 \u00b6 6.) The court denies the government's request because the record\n   is sufficient without that additional evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The motion to suppress having been fully briefed is now ripe to be decided by the court. The court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Warrantless Search of the Gray Nissan Rental Car on July 23, 2017\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1. On July 23, 2017, at 3:28 a.m., Adam Lawrence (\"Lawrence\"), a police officer with the Penn Hills Police Department, and other police officers were dispatched to a residence on Leechburg Road in Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, for a reported burglary in progress involving \"possible kidnapping\" and \"reports of gunshots.\" (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   2. Prior to being dispatched to the incident on Leechburg Road, Lawrence, who was in a police uniform, was at a gas station with other police officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Once the police officers received the call with respect to the incident on Leechburg Road, they drove with lights and sirens on toward that area. Lawrence's marked police car was the last in a line of police cars heading in the direction of the Leechburg Road. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   3. While the other police cars drove straight on Verona Road in Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, Lawrence took an alternate route via Shannon Road to \"cover more area and maybe encounter suspects fleeing[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   4. Once Lawrence turned onto Shannon Road, he saw a vehicle in his lane of travel, i.e., driving in the opposing lane of travel. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 20.) Lawrence explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   They just passed a vehicle coming to the end of the roadway which is a T intersection with the stop sign. The stop sign is on their end, and I had to lock up my brakes, stop to avoid a head-on collision with them, and they proceeded past me and ran the stop sign and turned left on to 2nd Street.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The vehicle observed by Lawrence was a \"newer\" gray sedan, i.e., a 2016 Nissan Altima, with an Ohio registration plate and had two occupants, i.e., a driver and front seat passenger. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20, 23; Gov't Ex. 3.) Lawrence described the driver as a \"light skinned black male with black dreadlocks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) Lawrence could not describe the passenger of the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   5. Brooks \"is not a light skinned black male[.]\" (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No 67) at 49; H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   6. Lawrence explained that the gray sedan, which almost struck his police vehicle, appeared to be \"trying to quickly get away from a certain area\" and was coming from the direction of Leechburg Road where the robbery had taken place. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 24.) He suspected that the vehicle was involved in the robbery that had taken place at the residence on Leechburg Road. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lawrence, therefore, turned his police vehicle around and began to pursue the gray sedan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   7. Lawrence pursued the gray sedan as it drove down various streets in the area, and he observed several traffic violations\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   during the pursuit. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 25.) For example, the gray sedan did not have its lights on, which made it more difficult for the vehicle to be detected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The gray sedan was travelling at a rate of approximately forty to fifty miles per hour on side streets and residential streets, which have speed limits of twenty-five miles per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   8. Lawrence attempted to conduct a traffic stop on the gray sedan. (Gov't Ex. 5 \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   9. He eventually lost sight of the gray sedan because he could not see the vehicle's taillights. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   10. A few moments after Lawrence\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   lost sight of the gray sedan, a police officer with the Verona Police Department located the vehicle crashed nearby at the intersection of Penn Street and Allegheny Avenue in Verona Borough, Pennsylvania. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 26-27; H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 29.) The vehicle was wrecked into a fence of a parking lot, there were no occupants inside the vehicle, the engine was running, and the vehicle was partially on the roadway. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 27-28; H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   11. Lawrence did not see anyone exit the vehicle. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 26.) He believed, however, that the occupants ran away from the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [G]iven the time that, you know, the distance that they were ahead of me until the time that I covered that distance, when they had turned right where they crashed and didn't negotiate the turn properly, it wasn't that long. So, there is no way that they were walking. They had to have got out and run. I mean, I was there within seconds passing by and I would have noticed people walking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   12. Lawrence determined the vehicle was registered to Enterprise Rental Car, also known as \"EAN Holdings.\" (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 28; H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 15, 33.) The vehicle was rented from Enterprise Rental Car by Brooks. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   13. Lawrence and other police officers with the assistance of two police service dogs searched the area in which the gray sedan was crashed in an attempt to locate its occupants. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 28-29.) The police officers did not locate either occupant of the vehicle. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   14. After Lawrence briefly participated in the search for the occupants of the vehicle, he\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   returned to the crashed gray\n   sedan to conduct an inventory search of the vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   15. Lawrence testified that he conducted an inventory search of the crashed gray sedan because \"[i]t was involved in a crash, after a vehicle pursuit[,]\" and, therefore, it was subject to being impounded by the Penn Hills Police Department. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 8-9.) Lawrence explained: \"The driver and the other occupant of the vehicle fled after crashing the vehicle and we were unable to locate them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   16. Lawrence conducted an inventory search of the vehicle at the scene of the crash, i.e., it was not towed to a separate location prior to Lawrence's inventory search. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   17. On July 23, 2017, the Penn Hills Police Department had a policy in place with respect to the \"Inventory of Impounded Vehicles\" (the \"inventory policy\"). (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 6; Gov't Ex. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   18. The inventory policy, in pertinent part, provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   It shall be the policy of the Penn Hills Police Department that all vehicles impounded by the authority and direction of the Department shall be examined and inventoried immediately upon acceptance into the custody and control of the Penn Hills Police Department or as soon after as is practical under the circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A. Officer Responsibility\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   1. The Penn Hills Police Department Impounded Vehicle Information Sheet and an inventory of personal items of value in said vehicle will be completed and submitted by the officer who took custody or control of the vehicle or his designee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   2. Containers found within the impounded vehicle shall be opened and inventoried, unless the contents can be easily ascertained from examining the exterior of the container. If the container is locked and cannot be opened without damaging [the] same, it shall not be forced open, but rather noted on the inventory sheet as a locked container.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   3. If the impounded vehicle is part of a crime and/or is suspected to contain evidence, and a search of it becomes necessary, the vehicle will be secured at the Penn Hills Police Department impound facility\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   until the proper search procedure can be carried out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   4. After the aforementioned procedure has been carried out, the vehicle shall be secured in the Penn Hills Police Department impound area, or other areas utilized by the department for the storage of vehicles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   5. If there is no need to retain the impounded vehicle, the officer who took control and custody of said vehicle, or his designee, shall make arrangements to have said vehicle\n   returned to the owner as soon as possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 6-7; Gov't Ex. A at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   19. On July 23, 2017, at 5:25 a.m., Lawrence completed a Vehicle Impound Record, which is a document used in the ordinary course of business by the Penn Hills Police Department. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 10-11; Gov't Ex. 3.) Lawrence completed the form immediately after the inventory search of the crashed gray sedan. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   20. Lawrence's search of the crashed gray sedan included a search inside a black backpack found in the backseat of the vehicle and a search inside a red duffel bag found inside the trunk of the vehicle. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 13.) According to Lawrence, the contents of the two bags could not be easily ascertained without opening them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   21. The Vehicle Impound Record also included a \"Vehicle Recovery/Tow Notification,\" which was a letter the Penn Hills Police Department used to notify the registered owner of the vehicle that the vehicle is being towed and to provide the registered owner of the vehicle contact information for the place to which the vehicle is being towed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14; Gov't Ex. 3 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   22. Lawrence was unable to contact Enterprise Rental Car, i.e., the registered owner of the crashed gray sedan, because it was in the middle of the night. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) Lawrence, therefore, prepared the Vehicle Recovery/Tow Notification to be sent to Enterprise Rental Car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   23. From inside a blue grocery store bag on the floorboard in front of the driver's seat of the crashed gray sedan the following items were recovered: (a) a \"SIG Sauer 22 caliber pistol with the serial number of F309749\" (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 31-32), which was registered to Tia Collins, who was one of the victims in the alleged robbery on Leechburg Road (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 32; Gov't Ex. 5 \u00b6 17); and (b) a \"Taurus 9 millimeter pistol\" with serial number \"TJN07656\" and a corresponding magazine with eight, nine millimeter cartridges (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 33-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   24. A magazine that corresponds to the \"SIG Sauer 22 caliber pistol\" that had ten, twenty-two caliber cartridges in it was also found in the crashed gray sedan. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   25. From inside the red duffel bag\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   found in the trunk of the crashed gray sedan the following items were recovered: (a) a stainless steel \"Taurus 357 caliber revolver\" with serial number GY69526 and \"five 357 cartridges...inside the cylinder on the revolver\" (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 32-33); (b) a \"Mossberg 12 Gauge Shotgun\" and four, twelve-gauge shotgun shells (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34); and a cardboard box containing a 50-round capacity nine-millimeter drum-style magazine, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   26. A \"Ruger 22 caliber pistol\" with serial number 36521861 was found in the center console of the crashed gray sedan. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 33.) A magazine containing .22 caliber ammunition was located inside the \"Ruger 22 caliber pistol\" and one round was chambered in the firearm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   27. Another magazine containing .22 caliber ammunition was recovered from inside a red and black bag found in the backseat of the crashed gray sedan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   28. A nine-millimeter pistol extended magazine with thirty, nine-millimeter cartridges inside it was located in a black nylon backpack in the backseat of the crashed gray sedan. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 35-36.) A number of items were inside the black nylon backpack with the nine-millimeter extended magazine, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   - a bag of plastic zip ties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   - a set of handcuffs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   - black gloves;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   - a black face mask;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   - a red knife;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   - a silver flashlight;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   - a black tossle cap; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   - a small black flashlight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   29. A \"knotted plastic bag containing multiple cartridge casings\" and one, nine-millimeter cartridge were inside a Taurus box that contained the Taurus .357 caliber firearm and was found in the trunk of the crashed gray sedan. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 36.) The cartridge casings were empty, meaning they were not live ammunition and did not contain a projectile. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   30. A \"federal ammunition box\" containing fifteen \"22 caliber cartridges\" was inside a black nylon small carrying bag located in the front section of the vehicle. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 37.) That ammunition could function with the \"Ruger 22 Pistol\" that was in the center console of the crashed gray sedan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   31. Assorted ammunition and magazines for ammunition for firearms were found throughout the crashed gray sedan. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   32. Clothing items, including a black ski mask, black gloves, and blue latex gloves,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   were also found in the crashed gray sedan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   33. Three Pennsylvania State Police records of sale, a receipt from a gun purchase, and warranty cards for Taurus firearms listed in Brooks' name were found inside the crashed gray sedan. (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 39.) A grocery store receipt was also found inside the crashed gray sedan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   34. The documentation for the Taurus firearms listed Brooks' name and address and was consistent with the Taurus .357 caliber firearm found in the crashed gray sedan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.) The address provided for Brooks was \"literally...down the road from where the vehicle was found crashed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   35. The following items were also found in the crashed gray sedan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   - Monroeville Dodge key chain;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   - Chrysler key fob;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   - handcuff key;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   - house key;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   - Giant Eagle card registered to Brooks' girlfriend R'Vaenita Squires (\"Squires\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   - Dick's Sporting Goods card registered to Squires;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   - Louis Vuitton monogram wallet with the initials JMB embroidered on it, which contained a driver's license for \"Jamal Brooks;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   - two credit cards in Brooks' name;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   - Enterprise Rental Car business card;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   - Anthony Arms membership card; and\n   - Crown Royal bag, which contained an e-cigarette and metal grinder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (H.T. 7/10/2018 (ECF No. 67) at 40-41; Gov't Ex. 5 \u00b6\u00b6 23, 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   36. At approximately 5:25 a.m., after Lawrence inventoried the contents of the crashed gray sedan, the vehicle was towed to \"Don Kuhn in Penn Hills.\" (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 36, 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     DuThinh's Surveillance of 1204 Wade Street, Aliquippa, Pennsylvania\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   37. In late July 2017, DuThinh spoke with a detective from the Penn Hills Police Department about the events of July 23, 2017, of which Brooks was a suspect. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 56-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   38. DuThinh learned that Brooks rented the crashed gray sedan and the Penn Hills Police department found Brooks' property inside the vehicle. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 57.) DuThinh obtained Brooks' address at 1204 Wade Street, Aliquippa, Pennsylvania (\"1204 Wade Street\") from the driver's license found inside the crashed gray sedan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   39. In August 2017, DuThinh conducted surveillance of 1204 Wade Street on four separate days over a span of three weeks to determine whether Brooks lived at that residence. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 57-58; Gov't Ex. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   40. DuThinh obtained from the Penn Hills Police Department the Chrysler key fob found in the crashed gray sedan. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 47.) The key fob was a \"one in-laid piece\" comprised of a metal key and keyless entry system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   41. On August 17, 2017, DuThinh traveled to 1204 Wade Street. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   42. Upon DuThinh's arrival at 1204 Wade Street, a \"Chrysler was parked in the driveway. It was backed in.\" (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   43. The government entered into evidence a photograph taken by \"Google Maps\" of 1204 Wade Street, which depicted the Chrysler parked in the driveway of 1204 Wade Street. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 48-49; Gov't Ex. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   44. DuThinh testified that the photograph accurately depicted 1204 Wade Street on August 17, 2017, including the manner in which the Chrysler was positioned in the driveway. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 49.) DuThinh, however, retrieved the photograph from Google Maps after August 17, 2017, and did not know when Google Maps captured the image. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   45. DuThinh was asked whether the location of the vehicle as depicted in the photograph was the \"precise location as...[he] saw it on August 17[, 2017.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61.) DuThinh responded: \"I can't say precise. It's oriented and parked in the driveway, whether it's slightly forward, slightly back. But it is in and around that area.\" (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 61.) He confirmed that it was \"possible that...[the] vehicle was not located precisely as it's depicted...[in the photograph].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   46. DuThinh walked onto the empty lot to the right of 1204 Wade Street. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 50.) DuThinh described the empty lot:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   It's distinctly an empty lot. It's all grass versus the driveway. I would have approached there because I was concerned being too close and being discovered.

He stood approximately three to four feet from the Chrysler in the unkempt\n   grassy area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.) DuThinh was not \"very close\" to the short, white brick wall located behind the Chrysler. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Gov't Ex. 4.) DuThinh approached the vehicle from the front driver's side of the car. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   48. DuThinh stood \"on that little, the corner of the grass...[between] the sidewalk, and the driveway.\" (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   49. DuThinh did not enter the driveway of 1204 Wade Street; he did not enter the front yard of the residence; and he did not walk onto the front porch of the home. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 51-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   50. DuThinh used the keyless entry on the Chrysler key fob and heard the doors lock. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF Non. 84) at 51.) He did not physically touch the vehicle or use the metal key in the lock on the door of the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50, 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   51. DuThinh walked parallel to the Chrysler toward the back of the house, stood at the back of the Chrysler, and \"peeked to the rear of the vehicle, and identified the license plate.\" (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 54, 59.) It was from that \"vantage point\" that DuThinh was able to view the license place which read: \"JYS2961.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54-55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   52. DuThinh had to \"bend...[his] body around to look at...[the] license plate.\" (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   53. DuThinh did not walk onto the driveway or back of the property located at 1204 Wade Street to view the license plate. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 55, 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   54. DuThinh determined the Chrysler was registered to Roosevelt Reese (\"Reese\"). (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 55.) DuThinh believed Reese was a relative of Squires. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55-56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   55. On the same day, DuThinh spoke to an employee of the United States Postal Service at the post office. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 59-60.) The employee \"stated that she recognized...[Brooks' name] or had seen someone matching that description at that residence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60.) DuThinh could not recall the employee's name or whether he showed her a photograph of Brooks.

DuThinh in the affidavit relied upon the events of July 23, 2017, including the information received from the robbery victim, Tia Collins, and her husband, Cordell Collins, and information received from Lawrence about the subsequent police chase of the gray sedan. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 65; Gov't Ex. 5 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 17, 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   58.

At some point after DuThinh's investigation of Brooks concluded, he learned that Tia Collins was being investigated for Medicare fraud.

He was arrested on felony drug charges in New York, Texas, and Pennsylvania, but the charges did not result in criminal convictions. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 67; Gov't Ex. 6.) In 1998, he sustained a felony drug conviction in Pennsylvania and was sentenced to a period of imprisonment.

Prior to submitting the search warrant affidavit, DuThinh: met with a Penn Hills Police Department detective to discussed the incident involving Tia Collins and Cordell Collins on July 23, 2017; conducted two interviews of Tia Collins and Cordell Collins; reviewed the evidence; \"did a record sale for the pistol that was recovered[;]\" and determined the statements given by Tia Collins and Cordell Collins were corroborated by other evidence obtained by the Penn Hills Police Department. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 68-69.) Based upon the foregoing, DuThinh \"believed...[Tia Collins and Cordell Collins] were being truthful and they gave a consistent account of what happened.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69-70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   72.

The court, therefore, ordered the parties each to file a supplemental brief addressing whether the inevitable discovery exception applied to Lawrence's inventory search of the crashed gray sedan.

Brooks in his supplemental brief did not request to reopen the record and objected to reopening the record for the government to present evidence. (ECF No. 89 \u00b6 4.) Brooks argued that: (a) the government waived any argument about the inevitable discovery doctrine by failing to raise it, and (b) in any event, the government did not satisfy its burden to show the inevitable discovery doctrine applies in this case.

The government, which does not concede that Lawrence's inventory search was improper, argues that the evidence seized from the crashed gray sedan should not be suppressed because it would have been inevitably discovered by a proper inventory search.

In\n   <em>\n    Sinkler\n   </em>\n   , the doctrine of inevitable discovery was first raised on appeal by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The court of appeals remanded the case to the district court \"for further factual findings\" about, among other things, whether evidence in issue would have been discovered \"as part of a properly conducted inventory search pursuant to established police department procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3572832\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/267/171/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3572832\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/267/171/\">\n    at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   29. On remand, the district court decided the suppression motion based upon the inevitable discovery doctrine. The defendant on appeal of that decision by the district court argued that \"when the District Court raised the doctrine sua sponte in its opinion, it violated his constitutional Due Process rights by denying him the opportunity to respond.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3572832\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/267/171/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   30. The court of appeals rejected the defendant's argument. It explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n   While the government may not have expressly used the words 'inevitable discovery' during the remand proceedings, it was not a legal theory snatched out of thin air by the District Court. This Court's prior opinion clearly made inevitable discovery an issue to be considered by the trial court on remand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3572832\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/267/171/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3572832\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/267/171/\">\n    at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In other words, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Sinkler\n   </em>\n   considered the doctrine of inevitable discovery and ruled in the government's favor on the issue even though the court of appeals-and not the government-first raised the issue. The court of appeals determined the defendant had an opportunity to present evidence on the issue, and, therefore, his due process rights were not violated by the courts consideration of the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   32. Similarly, here, the court-having given defendant an opportunity to present evidence and argument on the doctrine of inevitable discovery-may consider the issue without offending defendant's due process rights. The court need not reopen the record for the government to present additional evidence because the record is sufficient for the court to rule upon the issue of inevitable discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   33.

U.S. Ex. 2 at 1. Additionally, at the Hearing, one of the officers (Officer Obsenica) explicitly testified that an inventory search was conducted in this case pursuant to the relevant policy, and there is no evidence in the record to contradict that testimony. ECF No. 30 at 27:5-27:9, 88:18-21. The Court concludes that the United States has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the heroin would inevitably have been discovered via the inventory search conducted pursuant to, and consistent with, the \"Towing and Tow Pound Procedures: Inventories.\" On this ground, the Court holds that the heroin should not be suppressed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269779\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/227/432/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269779\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/227/432/\">\n    at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   39. Here, the government proved that the Penn Hills Police Department had a policy with respect to the \"Inventory of Impounded Vehicles\" due to \"either a crime or an accident.\" (Gov't Ex. 2.) The gray sedan was in an accident, its occupants were not at the scene of the crash when it was discovered by law enforcement, and law enforcement could not locate the occupants. The vehicle, therefore, was subject to be impounded pursuant to the inventory policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   40. Brooks argues that the government failed to satisfy its burden to show the inventory search exception to the warrant requirement applies to Lawrence's search of the crashed gray sedan because \"the warrantless search conducted did not comply with the stated policy.\" (ECF No. 83 \u00b6 46.) Brooks explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n   Specifically, Officer Lawrence clearly suspected that the Nissan had been involved in a crime - the Leechburg incident for which he had received a dispatch call while on patrol that night. Pursuant to the Penn Hills Police Department inventory policy, when an \"impounded vehicle is part of a crime and/or is suspected to contain evidence, and a search of it becomes necessary, the vehicle will be secured at the Penn Hills Police Department impound facility until the proper search procedure can be carried out.\" Gov't Exhibit 2 at \u00b6 A.3. Here, Officer Lawrence deviated from the stated policy because he conducted the search right on scene, rather than first securing the car at the Penn Hills Police Department impound facility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   41. Brooks also argues that Lawrence conducted the search of the crashed gray sedan because of his \"suspicion\" that the crashed gray sedan was the car used by the suspects to flee the incident on Leechburg Road. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) According to Brooks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-243\">\n   The inventory was not conducted for purposes of protecting the property in the car against claims of loss, but was rather an extensive and complete search for evidence of criminality. Indeed, Officer Lawrence began immediately seizing items that he thought were evidence of the Leechburg incident while conducting the \"inventory search.\" Officer Lawrence's motivation in conducting the search defeats application of the inventory search exception to the warrant requirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3386823\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/376/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   42. Brooks' arguments are unavailing because a lawful inventory search of the crashed gray sedan at the Penn Hills Police Department impound facility would have resulted in Lawrence inevitably discovering the same evidence that he obtained from his search at the scene of the crash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   43. The evidence shows that but-for the location of the inventory search,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lawrence complied with the inventory policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   44. He accepted \"custody and control\" of the crashed gray sedan as soon as was \"practical under the circumstances,\" i.e., the police officer from Verona who found the crashed gray sedan stayed with the vehicle until Lawrence conducted the inventory search, which occurred within forty minutes of first receiving the telephone call about the incident on Leechburg Road. (Gov't Ex. 2); (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   45. Lawrence completed \"an inventory of personal items of value\" in the crashed gray sedan. (Gov't Ex. 2 at A(1); Gov't Ex. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   46. Lawrence testified that opening the black backpack and red duffel bag\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and identifying each item in the bags was necessary to ascertain the contents of the bags to inventory them. (Gov't Ex. 3 at\n   A(2); H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 13-14.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   47. Based upon the foregoing, even if Lawrence first towed the crashed gray sedan to the impound facility, he would have inevitably discovered the same evidence found in the vehicle at the scene of the crash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   48. The court gave the parties an opportunity to reopen the record and present evidence with respect to these issues. Brooks, however, did not request the court to reopen the record to present evidence about why a search conducted at the impound facility would have resulted in Lawrence recovering different or less evidence from the crashed gray sedan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   49. Based upon the foregoing, if Lawrence had the crashed gray sedan towed to the Penn Hills Police Department impound facility for a \"lawful\" inventory search, he would have inevitably discovered the same evidence found in the vehicle at the scene of the crash. The evidence recovered by Lawrence from the crashed gray sedan will not, therefore be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   50.

The top portion of the driveway that sits behind the front perimeter of the house is enclosed on two sides by a brick wall about the height of a car and on a third side by the house.

DuThinh explained that while government exhibit 4 depicted the correct orientation of the Chrysler in the driveway, i.e., the direction in which the vehicle was facing, he could not confirm that government exhibit 4 showed the \"precise location\" of the vehicle; rather, the vehicle could have been parked either closer to the road or closer to the residence.

Brooks argues that the foregoing statements by DuThinh constitute \"unsupported beliefs\" and do not provide the nexus between Brooks' home and the crimes under investigation because DuThinh's training and experience \"was not in robberies or home invasions.\" (ECF No. 83 \u00b6 88.) As explained above, however, DuThinh's affidavit provides that he received training and has experience about firearm violations and home invasions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 9, 11, 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   81. Based upon the foregoing, the magistrate judge had a substantial basis upon which to find that there was a fair probability that Brooks carried a firearm to commit a home invasion robbery at the Collins' residence and persons who commit home invasion robberies often store in their homes firearms for protection, tools for committing home invasions, and records about firearms purchased for them. The affidavit of probable cause, therefore, established a nexus between the firearm offenses under investigation and Brooks' residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   82. Brooks argues, however, that the affidavit did not establish probable cause to show that evidence of the home invasion would be found in his home because the \"instruments\" used to commit the home invasion were found in the crashed gray sedan and the affidavit did not provide probable cause to show that additional evidence existed in Brooks' residence. (ECF No. 83 \u00b6 81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   83. Brooks' argument misses the mark. While he is correct that a nexus must be established between his residence and the crime under investigation, his argument is based upon DuThinh's failure to establish a nexus between Brooks' residence and a specific home invasion robbery. DuThinh, however, provided in the affidavit of probable cause that home invaders possess firearms in their residences to protect their\n   profits and it is listed in Attachment B to the search warrant that the crimes under investigation included violations of federal firearm laws, i.e.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), 922(j), and 924(l). (Gov't Ex. 5, Attachment B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   84. DuThinh's application for a search warrant was made to obtain evidence that Brooks, for whom there was probable cause to believe was a home invader and convicted felon, possessed a firearm, stole a firearm, or possessed or received a stolen firearm. DuThinh also requested permission to search for evidence that Brooks committed home invasions, i.e., property belonging to Tia Collins and Cordell Collins and \"physical evidence commonly used in home-invasion robberies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   85.

Similarly, in this case, the government's investigation of Brooks is not limited by the quantity of evidence found in the crashed gray sedan. The affidavit contained probable cause that Brooks was a home invader and possessed a firearm in the past, i.e., he was convicted of carrying a firearm without a license, and on the night of the home invasion robbery there were five firearms in the crashed gray sedan rented by Brooks. Based upon DuThinh's training and experience, home invaders often possess firearms in their residences to protect their profits. Thus, the magistrate judge had a substantial basis upon which to conclude that there was a fair probability that Brooks possessed an additional firearm and ammunition in his home for protection one month after he committed the home invasion robbery at the Collins' residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   88.

Here, Brooks argues that DuThinh \"intentionally omitted information bearing directly on the credibility of complainants, Tia and Cordell Collins, when he submitted the warrant affidavit to the magistrate.\" (ECF No. 83 \u00b6 94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   98. DuThinh at the time he applied for a search warrant of 1204 Wade Street knew that Tia Collins had previously been arrested and that Cordell Collins had a record of arrests and sustained a felony drug conviction in Pennsylvania for which he was sentenced to a period of incarceration. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 65-68; Gov't Ex. 6.) DuThinh did not include that information in the affidavit of probable cause submitted to the magistrate judge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68; Gov't Ex. 5.) DuThinh explained that he did not \"feel it had any bearing on their testimony as victims.\" (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   99. Under those circumstances, Brooks satisfied his burden to show that DuThinh\n   <em>\n    intentionally\n   </em>\n   omitted from his affidavit of probable cause information that Tia Collins was previously arrested\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Cordell Collins was previously arrested and sustained one felony conviction for\n   which he was sentenced to a period of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   100. Brooks, however, did not satisfy his burden to show that the omissions were\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   to the magistrate judge's determination of probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   101. First, the magistrate judge would have had a substantial basis upon which to issue the search warrant even if she was informed that Tia Collins was previously arrested. The Supreme Court of the United States has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-339\">\n   Arrest without more does not, in law any more than in reason, impeach the integrity or impair the credibility of a witness. It happens to the innocent as well as the guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   <em>\n    Michelson v.

Under those circumstances, one prior arrest would not impeach the credibility of Tia Collins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   102. Similarly, the magistrate judge would have had a substantial basis upon which to issue the search warrant even if she was informed that Cordell Collins was arrested on three different occasions and sustained one felony conviction. As discussed above, the arrests would not impeach the credibility of Cordell Collins, and the felony conviction occurred in 1998, i.e., approximately nineteen years prior to the home invasion robbery in 2017, and, therefore, does not weigh heavily against Cordell Collins' credibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   103. Information provided by Tia Collins and Cordell Collins and set forth in the affidavit of probable cause was also corroborated by the evidence obtained from the crashed gray sedan by law enforcement. Tia Collins' pistol, which she reported was stolen by the two actors was found in the crashed gray sedan. Tia Collins reported that the two actors wore masks. Masks, along with handcuffs, zip-ties, and gloves, were found in the crashed gray sedan. It was reported that two shots were fired at Cordell Collins, and five firearms were found in the crashed gray sedan. Under those circumstances, even if the magistrate judge was made aware of the arrest of Tia Collins and the arrests and conviction of Cordell Collins, she would have had a substantial basis upon which to find there was probable cause to believe that the information provided by Tia Collins and Cordell Collins was accurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   104. Brooks also argues that DuThinh omitted that: (a) he had suspicions that the home invasion robbery was a drug-related crime, which contradicted the motive suggested by Tia Collins and Cordell Collins; and (b) he suspected the nightclub owned by Tia Collins and Cordell Collins was involved in criminal activity. (ECF No. 84 \u00b6\u00b6 97-98, 108-110.) According to Brooks, that information should have been included in the affidavit of probable cause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   105. DuThinh explained that while he had suspicions about the Collins, he did not have any evidence to support that the home invasion robbery was drug-related or that their nightclub was involved in nefarious activity. (H.T. 10/12/2018 (ECF No. 84) at 70.) The inclusion of DuThinh's suspicions in the affidavit would not, therefore, have a\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   impact on the magistrate judge's determination of probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   106. In any event, even if the home invasion robbery against Tia Collins and Cordell Collins was drug-related and the Collins' nightclub (where the Collins had been prior to the home invasion robbery)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   was involved in nefarious activities, the affidavit provided a substantial basis upon which the magistrate judge could conclude that the conduct of Brooks was criminal and corroborated by other evidence obtained from law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   107. Based upon the foregoing, Brooks was not entitled to a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing because he failed to make a substantial preliminary showing that the omitted information was material to the determination of probable cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, even if DuThinh included in his affidavit of probable cause all the information suggested by Brooks, i.e., the criminal histories of Tia Collins and Cordell Collins, including the information about Tia Collins' federal investigation, and his suspicions about the home invasion robbery being drug-related and the Collins' nightclub being involved in nefarious activity, the magistrate judge still would have had a substantial basis upon which to conclude that there was a fair probability that evidence that Brooks unlawfully possessed a firearm would be found in 1204 Wade Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   108.

Undoubtedly most police officers, if placed in Officer Kraft's position, would act out of a host of different, instinctive, and largely unverifiable motives-their own safety, the safety of others, and perhaps as well the desire to obtain incriminating evidence from the suspect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-365\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-366\">\n   The police in this case, in the very act of apprehending a suspect, were confronted with the immediate necessity of ascertaining the whereabouts of a gun which they had every reason to believe the suspect had just removed from his\n   empty holster and discarded in the supermarket. So long as the gun was concealed somewhere in the supermarket, with its actual whereabouts unknown, it obviously posed more than one danger to the public safety: an accomplice might make use of it, a customer or employee might later come upon it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-367\">\n   In such a situation, if the police are required to recite the familiar Miranda warnings before asking the whereabouts of the gun, suspects in Quarles' position might well be deterred from responding. Procedural safeguards which deter a suspect from responding were deemed acceptable in Miranda in order to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege; when the primary social cost of those added protections is the possibility of fewer convictions, the Miranda majority was willing to bear that cost. Here, had Miranda warnings deterred Quarles from responding to Officer Kraft's question about the whereabouts of the gun, the cost would have been something more than merely the failure to obtain evidence useful in convicting Quarles. Officer Kraft needed an answer to his question not simply to make his case against Quarles but to insure that further danger to the public did not result from the concealment of the gun in a public area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-368\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-369\">\n   The exception will not be difficult for police officers to apply because in each case it will be circumscribed by the exigency which justifies it.

First, the court explained that the appellate courts were not in consensus about whether principles or a test implementing\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   was warranted or appropriate. The court described its approach to understanding\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-399\">\n   We have taken a different tack in attempting to follow the teachings of\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   in this particular case. Although we have certainly looked at the rationales employed by the appellate courts that have interpreted\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   , we have actually broken the cases down into fact patterns, to see what the courts did, along with what they\n   <em>\n    said.\n   </em>\n   Viewing the legal landscape that way, it seems to us that most of the appeals decisions we have studied are consistent in their outcomes, and faithful to\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   , based upon the facts found by the trial courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-400\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3386823\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/376/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-401\">\n   137. The court divided the decisions into two groupings: (1) multiple occupant cases, \"in which in addition to the person who makes the challenged statement, there are other individuals present when police ask their questions, or the police do not yet know whether there are other individuals present or likely to arrive while police are on-site[;]\" and (2) sole occupant cases, in which \"the police make entry and are able to determine that only one individual is there, and police have the location secured from others entering when they ask their questions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182269\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/812/570/#p620\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182269\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/812/570/#p620\">\n    at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   138. In all the\n   <em>\n    multiple occupant cases\n   </em>\n   , the appellate courts held the public safety exception applied to police officers' questioning. The courts of appeals in those decisions relied upon \"the presence or reasonably feared presence of other occupants on the premises, who might injure themselves or the officers or others if they gained access to a weapon[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182269\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/812/570/#p620\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   139. The court explained that in the\n   <em>\n    sole occupant cases\n   </em>\n   , the appellate courts applied the public safety exception if the defendant retained some freedom of movement. The public safety exception was not applied in cases in which \"the defendant was firmly under the control of the officers when the question was asked, such that there was no reasonable fear that he could reach a weapon, whether that control was achieved by handcuffing or any equivalent exercise of police authority[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182269\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/812/570/#p620\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182269\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/812/570/#p620\">\n    at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   140.

Based upon the foregoing, the court in\n   <em>\n    Fautz\n   </em>\n   concluded that if faced with the decision, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which had consistently recognized the public safety exception as \"narrow,\" would adopt a \"narrow approach\" to\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   and hold:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-411\">\n   [T]he danger of officers encountering or mishandling a weapon, during an encounter on private premises, will not alone support application of the public safety exception. Thus, if the premises have been determined by the officers to have a sole occupant, or even if there is more than one occupant, but the police have achieved complete physical control over all occupants and can foreseeably maintain that control as long as necessary, any \"safety\" questioning of the occupants does not fit within the public safety exception even if police have reasonable grounds to fear that they will encounter a weapon while performing their functions at the premises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-412\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3386823\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/376/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-413\">\n   143.

Although the\n   <em>\n    Fautz\n   </em>\n   decision is seven years old, its analysis and prediction remain relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   145. More recently, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070148\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/538/#p541\">\n    751 F.3d 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2014), described the circuit split recognized by the court in\n   <em>\n    Fautz\n   </em>\n   as a distinction between a\n   <em>\n    broad\n   </em>\n   approach to\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   and a\n   <em>\n    narrow\n   </em>\n   approach to\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   . The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-418\">\n   [I]f there is a perceived risk that, when searching a vehicle or a residence, the officer might inadvertently bump or otherwise mishandle a hidden firearm (or other dangerous object) the broad approach would permit the officer to first ask whether any such danger is present.

The court recognized, however, the issue is different if there is \"a risk of the suspect or others who were there obtaining any weapon that was hidden on the premises.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070148\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/538/#p541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   146. The court of appeals in\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   also explained that \"even among circuits that otherwise take a narrow approach, questions designed to prevent officers from hurting themselves during a search of the suspect's person are permitted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070148\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/538/#p541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   147. Based upon the foregoing, this court will join in the prediction made by the court in\n   <em>\n    Fautz\n   </em>\n   . If faced with the issue, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals would hold that if the place to be search is determined to have more than one occupant, \"but the police have achieved complete physical control over all occupants and can foreseeably maintain that control as long as necessary, any 'safety' questioning of the occupants does not fit within the public safety exception even if police have reasonable grounds to fear that they will encounter a weapon while performing their functions at the premises.\"\n   <em>\n    Fautz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182269\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/812/570/#p620\">\n    812 F.Supp.2d at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   148. Here, the first issue the court must address is whether it was objectively reasonable for Price to conclude that law enforcement had complete physical control over\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   occupants of the house. The evidence showed that at the time Price questioned Brooks about the dangers in the home there were multiple\n   <em>\n    known\n   </em>\n   occupants of 1204 Wade Street who were detained on the front porch, i.e., Brooks, Squires, and their two children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   149. The court, however, cannot discern from the evidence of record whether it was objectively reasonable for Price to conclude that his questioning was necessary because there may be\n   <em>\n    other persons\n   </em>\n   with access to firearms\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   hiding in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-424\">\n   150. The issue is one of timing. If the secondary search of 1204 Wade Street had been completed and it was determined that\n   there was no one hiding in the home, Price could not have an objectively reasonable belief that he had to question Brooks about the dangers in his home to preserve the safety of the officers conducting the search. Any exigency created by other persons hiding in the home with access to firearms ended once law enforcement determined there was no one else hiding in the home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On the other hand, if the secondary search had not started or was ongoing at the time of questioning, it may be objectively reasonable for Price to believe that questioning Brooks about known dangers in the home, i.e., hiding persons with access to firearms, was necessary to preserve the safety of the law enforcement officers conducting the secondary search inside the home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Price questioned Brooks prior to or during the secondary search for hiding persons. The testimony presented by Price and DuThinh was unclear with respect to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-427\">\n   153. Price testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-428\">\n   My interaction with him was when we brought him out on the porch. We had, the initial search had been done, then the secondary, bodies that hide. I had to ask him, I said, look, is there anything in this house that could get anybody hurt to include, you know, fentanyl, carfentanil, weapons, anything like that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   (H.T. 10/12/2019 (ECF No. 84) at 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-430\">\n   154. DuThinh when asked about\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   Price questioned Brooks about the dangers in the home testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-431\">\n   It was probably possibly between the first search and the secondary search. But definitely before the full-on, thorough search of the residence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-432\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   155. As discussed above, the evidence shows that it was objectively reasonable for Price to believe that at the time he questioned Brooks he had physical control of all\n   <em>\n    known\n   </em>\n   occupants of the home, i.e., Brooks, Squires, and the two children. The court, however, cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the questioning was done prior to or during the secondary search. In other words, the government did not satisfy its burden to show that it was objectively reasonable for Price to believe that other,\n   <em>\n    unknown\n   </em>\n   persons with access to firearms could have been present in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-434\">\n   156. The court must also decide whether Price's questioning of Brooks falls within the public safety exception to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   because law enforcement intended to permit Squires and the children inside the home to prepare for school during the \"full-on\" search of the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   157. The Supreme Court of the United States has held that that \"a warrant to search for contraband founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.\"\n   <em>\n    Michigan v. Summers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313927\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/692/\">\n    452 U.S. 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313927\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/692/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313927\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/692/\">\n    69 L.Ed.2d 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981). Thus, law enforcement had authority to detain Squires and the children during the \"full-on\" search of 1204 Wade Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   158. Price was not in the position of the questioning police officer in\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   , who was faced with a matter of exigency and urgency with respect to a missing\n   firearm in a public grocery store. The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-437\">\n   We decline to place officers such as Officer Kraft in the untenable position of having to consider,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     often in a matter of seconds\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , whether it best serves society for them to ask the necessary questions without the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and render whatever probative evidence they uncover inadmissible, or for them to give the warnings in order to preserve the admissibility of evidence they might uncover but possibly damage or destroy their ability to obtain that evidence and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     neutralize the volatile situation confronting them\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-438\">\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205709\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/649/#p654\">\n    467 U.S. at 657-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205709\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/649/#p654\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   159. At the time Price questioned Brooks, law enforcement had achieved complete physical control over the\n   <em>\n    known\n   </em>\n   occupants of the home and could foreseeably maintain that control as long as necessary. There was a need for the search for hidden persons, but the evidence adduced was not sufficient for the court to conclude it is more likely than not that the questioning was prior to or during the secondary search. On the record presented, it is just as likely that the secondary search was completed at the time Price questioned Brooks about dangers in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-440\">\n   160. The court must, therefore, conclude that Price would have had time to read Brooks his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights prior to questioning him and permitting Squires and the children back inside the home. The decision to permit Squires and the children back inside the home to prepare for the school day, while commendable, was at the discretion of law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-441\">\n   161. To the extent Brooks was\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   and refused to answer Price's questions, there is no reason to believe law enforcement could not continue to detain Squires and the children on the porch until the \"full-on\" search was completed and he was satisfied that the home was safe for reentry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-442\">\n   162. The government, therefore, did not satisfy its burden to show it was objectively reasonable for Price to believe that asking Brooks about dangers in his home was\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   to protect himself, the law enforcement on scene, Squires and the children, or the public from\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   danger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duncan\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3467834\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/308/601/\">\n    308 F.

Brooks' argument is based entirely on speculation about what DuThinh would have done if he knew about the federal investigation at the time he drafted the affidavit and is not a basis to suppress evidence in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-488\">\n    The affidavit reflects that the majority of the information relayed to DuThinh by the detective was provided by Tia Collins.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-489\">\n    Even if Brooks satisfied his burden to make a substantial preliminary showing that the omissions were material, he did not prove their materiality by a preponderance of the evidence, and the motion to suppress this issue would be denied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"28\">\n   <p id=\"p-490\">\n    If Price's question to Brooks had been limited to fentanyl the result may be different.
