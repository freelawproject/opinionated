Grimm, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Jose Dilone wants to become a U.S. citizen. He applied for naturalization through the ordinary channels in December 2016, but after waiting nearly a year and a half for the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") to render a decision, he opted to seek recourse in the courts. His suit urges this Court to exercise its authority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), either by adjudicating the application itself or by ordering DHS to approve it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants, who include the Secretary of Homeland Security, do not deny that the Court had jurisdiction over Mr. Dilone's Complaint when he first filed it in April 2018. They contend, though, that the case became unsustainable soon afterward, when the agency placed Mr. Dilone into removal proceedings. Their legal argument, in brief, is that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201429\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   prevents both the agency and the courts from considering a naturalization application while removal proceedings are pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Not so. Section 1429 very clearly precludes DHS from acting on a naturalization application while the applicant is facing\n   removal, but it does not say anything about the courts. Because I decline to construe a statute in a manner that conflicts with its unambiguous terms,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yith v.

As it is not at all clear to me that Congress intended to upend this policy, I am staying this case to allow the removal proceedings to run their course, while retaining authority to reopen the case in the event that those proceedings are not completed in a timely manner. To assist me in monitoring the progress of the removal proceedings, and to ensure that the government pursues its removal case in a non-dilatory fashion, I will require it to provide me with status reports every 45 days, commencing the date of this memorandum opinion and order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The facts of this case are undisputed and do not require much elaboration. The suit began with four plaintiffs - all lawful permanent residents of the United States - seeking to compel a decision on their long-pending applications for American citizenship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, ECF No. 1. Three of the plaintiffs moved for a voluntary dismissal of their claims after U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") agreed to adjudicate their applications within 30 days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 7. The Court granted their motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 8, leaving Mr. Dilone as the sole remaining plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Dilone, a native of the Dominican Republic, became a lawful permanent resident of the United States on October 30, 1992, at the age of 16.

Section 1429 does not expressly bar a\n   <em>\n    court\n   </em>\n   from reviewing the application under these circumstances, but Defendants argued that allowing a court to do what DHS cannot would defeat the purpose of \u00a7 1429, which was to prevent aliens from evading deportation by seeking and obtaining citizenship before removal proceedings have run their course.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

First, does\n   the Court have subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Dilone's claim? Second, assuming jurisdiction does exist, is the claim redressable? And finally, assuming the claim survives the motion to dismiss, how should this case proceed?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   These three questions are closely related. To answer any of them, it is necessary to examine the interplay between two processes: naturalization and removal. As the laws that govern these processes have evolved over time, some history would seem to be in order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Today, the primary responsibility for deciding who may become a U.S. citizen and who is to be removed from the country is centralized in the executive branch. By statute, the \"sole authority to naturalize persons as citizens of the United States\" rests with the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201421\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20557\">\n    6 U.S.C. \u00a7 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Removal proceedings, meanwhile, are conducted by immigration judges appointed by the Attorney General.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20557\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1229a(a)(1), 1101(b)(4). To the extent that courts may concern themselves with these matters, their role is mainly to provide judicial review of the executive agency's actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20557\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1421(c) (authorizing an applicant for naturalization to seek judicial review of a decision denying his application);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20557\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1252(a)(1) (authorizing judicial review of a final order of removal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It was not always this way, though. For much of the twentieth century, responsibility for removal and naturalization was split between the judicial and executive branches. While the Attorney General wielded authority over deportations, courts played the \"pre-eminent role in the naturalization process,\" bearing the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether to grant or deny an alien's petition for naturalization.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Va. 1991). The courts did not make these determinations in isolation, of course, but rather considered input from the U.S. Department of Justice, whose agents \"conducted the preliminary investigation and examination of applicants and made recommendations to the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Ajlani v. Chertoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859326\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/229/\">\n    545 F.3d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 236 n.5 (2d Cir. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   One aspect of this division of labor that came to be seen as problematic was that neither proceeding had priority over the other. Consequently, an alien could find himself in a race against the government, with the alien pressing the court to grant him citizenship before the government could order his removal from the country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shomberg v.

DHS had yet to conduct an examination in Barnes's case, and as Barnes had not identified a way of compelling the agency to do so, the panel could not conclude that the BIA's decision had deprived him of the chance to seek relief under \u00a7 1447(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3800235\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/625/801/\">\n    625 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   807 n.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This case presents an entirely different set of circumstances.

Mr. Dilone then properly invoked the Court's jurisdiction under \u00a7 1447(b).

What remains to be decided is how this case should proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Section 1447(b) states that a court exercising its authority under this statute \"may either determine the matter or remand the matter, with appropriate instructions, to [USCIS] to determine the matter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). I have already explained, though, that the latter option is unavailable under the present circumstances, because an order directing USCIS to adjudicate Mr. Dilone's application would be in conflict with \u00a7 1429. That leaves the first option. Taking that path, it would seem that the appropriate next step, were this case to proceed, would be to schedule a hearing to assess Mr. Dilone's entitlement to naturalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   But such an approach presents its own problems.

Typically, the process concludes with the recitation of an oath of allegiance (which may be administered either by USCIS or by a court, provided DHS has certified the alien as eligible for naturalization) and with USCIS's issuance of a certificate of naturalization.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1421(b), (d). If, as this Court's opinion contemplates, a district court exercising its jurisdiction under \u00a7 1447(b) were to approve a petitioner's application, there would be nothing to prevent the Attorney General (or, rather, the Secretary of Homeland Security) from administering these final steps in the process. Section 1429, certainly, would pose no barrier, as this provision merely bars the Attorney General from \"consider[ing]\" an \"application for naturalization.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201429\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Context, as always, is critical. While Defendants insist that the\n    <em>\n     Barnes\n    </em>\n    court's statement about the availability of judicial review is somehow relevant to Mr. Dilone's \u00a7 1447(b) claim, it must be observed that the Fourth Circuit situated the statement in a string of paragraphs about \u00a7 1421(c).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Barnes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3800235\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/625/801/\">\n     625 F.3d at 806-07\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . I also note that, in support of the statement, the court cited to two cases expressly concerning \u00a7 1421(c).\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3800235\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/625/801/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citing\n    <em>\n     Zayed v.
