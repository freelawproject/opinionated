For the reasons discussed below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action arises from an automobile accident on August 29, 2003. (ECF No. 1-1 at 4 \u00b6 5.) At the time of the accident, which allegedly caused Plaintiff serious injuries, Plaintiff was insured by Erie with a policy that included underinsured motorists coverage limits of $ 20,000 per person and $ 40,000 per occurrence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.) Following the accident, Plaintiff presented an underinsured motorists claim to Erie, and Erie subsequently paid Plaintiff the alleged underinsured motorists coverage limit of $ 20,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13.) Plaintiff now challenges the underinsured motorists coverage provided by Erie. Plaintiff alleges that \"Erie refused to use the forms prescribed by the West Virginia Insurance Commissioner, as required by the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2033-6\">\n    W.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-18 \u00b6\u00b6 48-74.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Erie removed the case to this Court on June 8, 2018, asserting diversity jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   as the sole basis for this Court's subject matter jurisdiction. (ECF No. 1.) Erie filed its Motion to Dismiss on July 3, 2018, arguing that all of Plaintiff's claims should be dismissed because they are barred by a previously executed release and the applicable statute of limitations.

DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The predicate task before the Court is to determine whether Plaintiff's claims against Erie can proceed in light of the release and applicable statute of limitations. Erie argues that Plaintiff's claims are barred because they are based on actions arising from the 2003 motor vehicle accident and are encompassed within a release of claims executed in connection with the prior resolution of Plaintiff's underinsured motorists claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 6 at 2.) Erie further asserts that Plaintiff's common law bad faith and UTPA claims are barred by the statute of limitations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This Court agrees with Erie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    A. Plaintiff's Claims Are Barred By The Prior Release\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court is not limited to the factual allegations in the complaint but \"may properly take judicial notice of matters of public record\" without converting the motion into one for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Philips v. Pitt Cnty. Mem'l Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670870\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/176/#p180\">\n    572 F.3d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 180 (4th Cir. 2009) ; Fed. R. Evid. 201 (governing judicial notice). A court is also free to consider documents attached to the motion to dismiss, \"so long as they are integral to the complaint and authentic.\"\n   <em>\n    Philips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670870\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/176/#p180\">\n    572 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   180 (citing\n   <em>\n    Blankenship v. Manchin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5251946\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/471/523/\">\n    471 F.3d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526 n.1 (4th Cir. 2006) ). Erie's motion calls upon the Court to take judicial notice of the underlying complaint and dismissal order and find the release and settlement communications integral to the allegations in the Complaint. The Court will judicially notice the underlying complaint and dismissal order, finding they are public records. Further, the Court will consider the release and settlement communications because the Complaint references the settlement of the underinsured motorists claim and there is no dispute as to their authenticity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1 at 4-5 \u00b6\u00b6 10-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Erie argues that Plaintiff, in connection with the prior resolution of his underinsured motorists claim, contractually released Erie from the instant claims. (ECF No. 6 at 11.) The release was executed\n   in 2005 and includes a general release of any and all claims against Erie arising out of the 2003 motor vehicle accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 6-4 at 1.) In addition, the release expressly acknowledges a release of \"all claims for damages which exist as of this date, but of which the undersigned do not know or suspect to exist, whether through ignorance, oversight, error, negligence or otherwise, and which if known would materially affect the undersigned's decision to enter into this settlement agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After executing the release, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his claims against Erie with prejudice. (ECF. No. 6-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff responds that the release was fraudulently procured and must be void because the settlement was based on Erie's alleged misrepresentations of available coverage. (ECF No. 9 at 13-17.) Plaintiff's \"factual misrepresentation\" claim is based on the contention that Erie's offer of underinsured motorists coverage was commercially unreasonable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the Complaint, Plaintiff presupposes that because \"Erie refused to use the forms prescribed by the West Virginia Insurance Commissioner\" its offer was commercially unreasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 1-1 at 5, 12 \u00b6\u00b6 16, 50.)

Second, the attempted class action in a separate matter has no bearing on when Plaintiff should have known of his potential claims against Erie. The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals established the law concerning the selection or rejection of underinsured motorists coverage prior to Plaintiff's 2003 motor vehicle accident.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bias\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8575682\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/179/125/\">\n    179 W.Va. 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8575682\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/179/125/\">\n    365 S.E.2d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) (requiring an insurer to make a commercially reasonable offer of coverage by which an insured can make a \"knowing and informed\" decision as to the selection or rejection of coverage). The Court acknowledges that by way of enactment of West Virginia Code \u00a7 33-6-31d the law has evolved to ensure compliance with an insurer's duty under West Virginia Code \u00a7 33-6-31. Nonetheless, the\n   <em>\n    Bias\n   </em>\n   standard has remained unchanged since the West Virginia Supreme Court's ruling, which predates Plaintiff's 2003 accident and subsequent resolution of his underinsured motorists claim.
