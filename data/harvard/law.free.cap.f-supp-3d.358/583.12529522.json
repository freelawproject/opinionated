Arch contends that coverage did not exist under policies issued by it to Gilchrist Construction Company, LLC (\"Gilchrist\") and therefore it also had no duty to defend Gilchrist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   For the reasons that follow, the Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This matter arises from a petition filed by Gilchrist in the Thirty-Third Judicial District Court, Allen Parish, Louisiana, against The Travelers Indemnity Company and Arch Insurance Company, and individual defendants Juanita Fontenot (\"Fontenot\") and T. June Wilder (\"Wilder\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 1, Ex. 3 (state court record). Gilchrist asserts breach of contract claims against the insurers and seeks declaratory judgments against them based on their denial of defense and indemnity to Gilchrist, in alleged violation of commercial general liability policies acquired by Gilchrist from those insurers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-9. Gilchrist's claims against Arch are in connection with a lawsuit brought by Fontenot and Wilder to recover damages from Gilchrist for trespass and breach of contract. The Fontenot/Wilder lawsuit arose from an agreement between the parties to buy and sell dirt from the Fontenot/Wilder property and to temporarily store debris on their property from a nearby road construction project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7. Gilchrist alleges that it was forced to defend itself in the Fontenot/Wilder suit and that neither of its insurers has indemnified it for the $ 5,559,000 verdict, plus costs and fees, awarded to Fontenot and Wilder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the instant suit, Gilchrist raised no claims against Fontenot and Wilder but instead named them as \"interested parties\" in its claim for declaratory judgment against the insurers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9, \u00b6\u00b6 39 &amp; 49. The insurers removed the suit to this court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that Fontenot\n   and Wilder were improperly joined to defeat jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 1. Gilchrist moved to remand, contesting the allegations of improper joinder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 19. Magistrate Judge Kay recommended that the motion to remand be denied and that Fontenot and Wilder be dismissed without prejudice as improperly joined, and this Court adopted her recommendation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Documents 34 and 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While the motion to remand was pending, Arch filed the instant motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 25. Gilchrist sought, and was granted, an extension of time to file an opposition to Arch's motion to dismiss, requesting ten days after a ruling issued as to the motion to remand to file its opposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Documents 31 and 32. Gilchrist has now filed an opposition to Arch's motion and Arch has filed a reply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Documents 41 and 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Relevant Allegations and Policy Provisions.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Arch insured Gilchrist through a commercial general liability policy, which was renewed twice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 25 at Exs. C, D and E.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the underlying Fontenot/Wilder lawsuit was filed in 2012, Gilchrist requested that Arch provide a defense and indemnity under the policies. Arch denied defense and indemnity coverage for the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In their state court complaint, Fontenot and Wilder asserted that Gilchrist's actions violated Louisiana law through failure to perform the contract with them in good faith and failure to perform its duties and obligations under the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 25, Ex. 2 at \u00b6 13. They alleged that \"Gilchrist [ ] filled in the pit from which they extracted Petitioner's dirt with worthless dirt, debris, concrete, wood and trash from elsewhere\" and that Gilchrist \"under-measured and underpaid for the dirt that it did haul from Petitioner's land.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 9.

The alleged acts of implementing the tip policy and taking the tips were done intentionally, not accidentally nor negligently.

To the contrary, the conduct alleged in the petition is conduct that\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   result in \"actually knowing or expecting\" that Gilchrist would be held liable for damages as a result. Specifically, the petition asserts that \"[b]eginning on or about August 18, 2007 up and until March 23, 2011, Petitioner noticed and complained to Gilchrist that it had been using the land subject to the contract to dump worthless asphalt, dirt, concrete, wood and trash. Gilchrist had assured Petitioner the entire time that the site would be cleaned up and the contract honored.\" Record Document 25, Ex. 2 at \u00b6 6. These are not actions which could unknowingly result in liability for Gilchrist. As the court in\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   noted, through a comprehensive general liability policy, a contractor seeks protection against the almost infinite ways in which he might unintentionally (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , by accident) be held liable in the operation of his business. There is simply no reasonable way to interpret the allegations of the Fontenot/Wilder petition to include unintentional or accidental conduct.

In the Fontenot/Wilder petition, the allegations are of intentional conduct, which prevent the conduct from being considered an accident, and thus an occurrence, under the policy. There is no question that \"dump[ing] worthless asphalt, dirt, concrete, wood, and trash\" on the Fontenot/Wilder property is an intentional act. Record Document 25, Ex. 2.

Gilchrist's attempts to reframe the description of its actions cannot mask all of the factual allegations of intentional conduct set out in the Fontenot/Wilder petition. Therefore, in the underlying Fontenot/Wilder action, Gilchrist's actions do not constitute an \"occurrence\" within the meaning of the policy. The underlying state court proceeding is a lawsuit pertaining to the intentional acts of Gilchrist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Arch policy does not provide a duty to defend the Fontenot/Wilder lawsuit, as there has been no \"occurrence\" as contemplated by the Arch policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Arch relies upon the fact that prior to trial in the underlying lawsuit, Fontenot/Wilder sought leave to file an amended petition, which was granted by the trial court, \"clarifying that [Fontenot/Wilder] are not seeking loss of farming income or asserting claims in tort.\" Record Document 17, Ex. 1, First Amended Petition at 1 \u00b6 3.
