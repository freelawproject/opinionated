Edgar Hoover Building) and cash with a developer who would build a new headquarters facility in a D.C. suburb. The Court has already issued one ruling in favor of CREW, denying GSA's motion for summary judgment and requiring the agency to conduct a broader search for responsive documents and provide a more robust explanation for its withholdings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion and Order, ECF No. 23. That ruling, however, left one issue unresolved: whether GSA permissibly redacted information-including appraised values of the Hoover Building, and the value of offers it received for the property-from a document titled \"Findings and Determination\" (\"F &amp; D\") that explained the agency's decision to cancel the swap-relocation project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16 (discussing F &amp; D, Ex. E, ECF No. 17-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   GSA contended that the redactions were appropriate under the deliberative-process privilege encompassed by FOIA Exemption 5, but the Court had doubts that the document was predecisional, as is required for the privilege to apply. After communicating those doubts to GSA at the summary judgment hearing, counsel for the government offered to prepare a supplemental declaration to address that concern. The Court agreed to defer judgment on that issue until it reviewed the agency's declaration and CREW's response. The agency has since produced that declaration,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Joel T. Berelson (\"Berelson Decl.\"), ECF No. 26-1, and CREW has responded to the agency's new assertions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Response re Notice (\"Response\"), ECF No. 27.

Totally missing from the document are any of the hallmarks of predecisional give-and-take, such as a recommendation to take a particular course of action or a weighing of alternatives. The F &amp; D instead contains exactly what its title suggests it contains: the agency's determination and the findings that support that determination. The document is announcing what the agency\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   doing (and why), not arguing for what it\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   be doing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Even without the\n   <em>\n    Pfeiffer\n   </em>\n   factors as guide, the Court would still conclude that the F &amp; D is not predecisional for one fundamental reason: nothing in the document shows it was \"prepared in order to assist an agency decisionmaker in arriving at his decision.\"\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4033789\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/715/134/#p139\">\n    715 F.Supp.2d at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A at 1. The F &amp; D's contents confirm that conclusion. It describes the \"FBI Headquarters Consolidation\" as a two-phase process involving the selection of an \"exchange partner\" who would take the Hoover Building and an undetermined amount of cash in return for the construction of a new headquarters facility.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4033789\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/715/134/#p139\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Crucially, the F &amp; D makes clear that the agency discontinued that process,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (\"Determination\"); indeed, the entire purpose of the F &amp; D was to provide an explanation for that decision,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10 (\"Summation of Rational Basis for Cancellation\"). That makes the F &amp; D a quintessential example of a document intended \"to support a decision already made.\"\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4033789\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/715/134/#p139\">\n    715 F.Supp.2d at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, it is unfit for the deliberative-process privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The agency's supplemental declaration tries in vain to alter this analysis. To frame the F &amp; D as predecisional, GSA claims that the FBI headquarters procurement project is ongoing, Berelson Decl. \u00b6 4 (stating that \"the FBI Headquarters Consolidation project remains a live procurement action\"), describing it as a stalled but soon-to-be-resumed project,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5 (\"As GSA intends to reinitiate its procurement action ....\"). In other words, the agency contends that the cancellation of the swap-relocation plan was but one component of the larger \"FBI Headquarters Consolidation project.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That is a curious position for the agency to take, given that another agency declaration in this case explained that \"GSA's decision to cancel the procurement of a new FBI facility ... is a wholly separate matter from GSA's decision to renovate the current FBI headquarters.\" Second Declaration of Travis Lewis (\"2d Lewis Decl.\") \u00b6 4. If the agency believed that canceling the swap-relocation project was distinct from renovating the current facility, that suggests the agency does not lump together the various proposals to achieve the FBI's goal of a larger, more modern, and more secure headquarters-but instead treats each means to achieving that end as a discrete proposal to be approved or declined. The agency's prior representation in this case therefore undermines its current attempt to portray its cancelation of the swap-relocation project as part of a larger process, rather than the end of a discrete procurement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In any event, the agency's argument that the swap-relocation was only a\n   <em>\n    part\n   </em>\n   of the \"FBI Headquarters Consolidation project\" is inconsistent with the F &amp; D itself. The document indicates right off the bat that, at least within the F &amp; D, \"the FBI Headquarters Consolidation\" is synonymous\n   with \"the 'Procurement' or 'Project[.]' \" Ex. A at 1. The final paragraph in the F &amp; D provides a further clue that, at least at the time the F &amp; D was issued, there was no difference between what the Berelson declaration calls the \"FBI Headquarters Consolidation project\" and the swap-relocation procurement. Ex. A at 10 (explaining that it has decided \"to cancel the FBI Headquarters Procurement\"). And while the F &amp; D does state that the agency plans to develop \"an alternative procurement approach,\" that does not change the fact that the procurement canceled on July 10, 2017 was apparently\n   <em>\n    the only\n   </em>\n   headquarters consolidation project being considered at the time. The fact that an alternative plan could be put forward later on does not render predecisional the decision to call off the swap-relocation plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Casad v.

Exemption 3 protects from disclosure documents which are \"specifically exempted from disclosure by statute[.]\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(3). The declarant suggests that disclosure of the redacted information would run afoul of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102.75.320\">\n     41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.75.320\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (providing that appraisals should be kept confidential) and\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203.104\">\n     48 C.F.R \u00a7 3.104\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e) (providing that offerors' bid information relating to federal procurement project should be kept confidential). Berelson Decl. \u00b6 5. But the former applies only to \"pre-decisional appraisal documents,\" and the Court has already explained that the procurement cancellation is not predecisional.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102.75.320\">\n     41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.75.320\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The latter, meanwhile, does not protect bid information \"relating to a Federal agency procurement after it has been canceled by the Federal agency ... unless the Federal agency plans to resume the procurement.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203.104\">\n     48 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.104\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e). The swap-relocation procurement has been canceled, and the bid information contained in the F &amp; D pertained only to that project. While the agency may later develop a new FBI headquarters procurement project, that is not the same thing as \"resum[ing]\" the canceled one, so the bid information does not appear to fall within \u00a7 3.104(e)'s protection. And as noted earlier, GSA and FBI have indicated publicly a preference for renovating the current headquarters, not renewing a plan to sell the existing building.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    55-56 n.1. This further undermines any argument by GSA that the appraisal and bid information would be protected from disclosure by the cited regulations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
