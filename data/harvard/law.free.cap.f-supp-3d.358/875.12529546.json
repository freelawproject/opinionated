Plaintiff alleged that she is disabled due to bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia. Plaintiff's applications were denied initially and on reconsideration. Plaintiff requested a hearing. After a hearing on September 26, 2017, an administrative law judge (ALJ) denied plaintiff's claims. Plaintiff sought review of the ALJ's unfavorable opinion. On March 9, 2018, the Appeals Council denied plaintiff's request for review, thereby making the ALJ's January 9, 2018 decision the final decision of the Commissioner. On May 7, 2018, plaintiff commenced this action in which she asks the court to review the Commissioner's final decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    General Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff was born on December 3, 1979.

Dr. Koster's opinion was contradicted by Dr. Marks', Dr. Titus', and Dr. Bailey's opinions. Thus, the ALJ was required to give specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting Dr. Koster's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The ALJ rejected Dr. Koster's opinion because it was inconsistent with her treatment notes, because it was inconsistent with plaintiff's \"achieved score of 29 points out of 30 on the MMSE, which indicates normal cognition[,]\" and because it was inconsistent with plaintiff's \"subjective reports that she could prepare meals, pay bills, shop and read.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff argues that these were not specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting Dr. Koster's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As for the first reason, that Dr. Koster's opinion was inconsistent with her treatment notes, the ALJ explained that Dr. Koster's treatment notes from 2016 and 2017 \"noted that the claimant was oriented, alert, had normal speech quantity, logical thought process, euthymic mood, appropriate effect, good memory, good concentration, and fair insight and judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ALJ then cited to Exhibit 9F as support.

But, plaintiff's limitations flow from her schizoaffective disorder and her\n   depressive disorder, not from any cognitive disorder. The Ninth Circuit has pointed out, \"observations of cognitive functioning during therapy sessions do not contradict [a claimant's] reported symptoms of depression and social anxiety.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180481\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/1154/#p1164\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, observations as to plaintiff's cognitive functioning do not contradict her reported symptoms of depression and hearing voices.

The second reason the ALJ gave for rejecting Dr. Koster's opinion was not legitimate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As for the third reason, that Dr. Koster's opinion was contradicted by plaintiff's daily activities, the Ninth Circuit has recognized that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[t]he critical differences between activities of daily living and activities in a full-time job are that a person has more flexibility in scheduling the former than the latter, can get help from other persons ..., and is not held to a minimum standard of performance, as she would be by an employer.
