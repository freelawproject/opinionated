(Dkt. 1). Plaintiff claims that because his credit card account had accrued interest at a rate exceeding that permitted by New York's usury statutes while his balance was pending with the original creditor, Defendant unlawfully attempted to take or receive interest in violation of New York law by seeking to collect the principal due after the account had been charged off. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 at 5-6; Dkt. 12 at 10-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court are Defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and request for sanctions (Dkt. 10), and Plaintiff's cross-motion for sanctions (Dkt. 12). For the following reasons, Defendant's motion to dismiss is granted, Plaintiff's Complaint is dismissed, and Defendant's and Plaintiff's respective motions for sanctions and costs are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff's Complaint unless otherwise indicated and are assumed true for purposes of this motion. (Dkt. 1). On January 30, 2018, Defendant mailed a letter to Plaintiff seeking to collect an alleged debt \"relating to a credit card issued by Synchrony Bank\" (the \"Letter\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1-1). The Letter informed Plaintiff that Defendant had purchased the debt from Synchrony Bank on December 20, 2017. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 33). By the time Defendant acquired the debt, Plaintiff had already defaulted on his account balance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). Plaintiff alleges that, \"[u]pon information and belief, Defendant attempted to collect interest at a rate which exceeds New York's maximum rate under its criminal usury statute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a result, Plaintiff claims that he, and the other members of the putative class, were harmed by Defendant's misrepresentation of the \"character, legal status, or amount of the debt\" as well as its ability to collect interest above the rate set by New York's criminal usury statute, and by Defendant's threat \"to collect interest which could not legally be collected\" and its collection of interest in \"an amount which was not permitted by New York law,\" all in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692e, (2)(A), (5), and 1692f(1). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35-38). Plaintiff seeks statutory and actual damages on behalf of himself and the members of the putative class as well as recoupment of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 23, 2018, Plaintiff commenced this putative class action against Defendant, alleging that Defendant violated the FDCPA by attempting \"to collect interest at a rate which exceeds New York's maximum rate under its criminal usury statute.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 35-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). On June 12, 2018, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint, which also\n   includes a request for court-ordered sanctions and costs. (Dkt. 10).

Nonetheless, to accept Plaintiff's theory of liability would require this Court to extend\n   <em>\n    Madden's\n   </em>\n   applicability far beyond the Second Circuit's contemplations. For example, in reaching\n   its conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Madden,\n   </em>\n   the Second Circuit distinguished\n   <em>\n    Phipps v.

The Eighth Circuit rejected the plaintiffs' argument and determined that the fees were charged by the national bank, indicating that \"[c]ourts must look at the originating entity (the bank), and not the ongoing assignee ... in determining whether the NBA applies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8945482\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/1006/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8945482\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/1006/\">\n    at 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). In distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Phipps,\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    Madden\n   </em>\n   court noted that \"the national bank was the entity that charged the interest to which the plaintiffs objected,\" while \"Madden objects only to the interest\n   <em>\n    charged after\n   </em>\n   her account was sold by [the national bank] to the defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    Madden,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190383\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/246/\">\n    786 F.3d at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Accordingly, the distinction the Second Circuit drew between\n   <em>\n    Phipps\n   </em>\n   and the facts in\n   <em>\n    Madden\n   </em>\n   suggests that interest charged by a national bank-or in this case, a savings association-does not become interest charged by a third-party once the balance has been sold off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Furthermore, as the Court mentioned in\n   <em>\n    Cole,\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's theory of FDCPA liability would discourage non-savings association entities from purchasing debt from savings associations because any interest lawfully charged by the latter would become unlawfully \"taken\" or \"received\" by the former upon issuance of a collection letter. Plaintiff's assertions run counter to the financial reality of interest payments and the role of debt collection agencies in securing balances rightfully owed. The FDCPA was not enacted solely to prevent credulous consumers from falling victim to unscrupulous debt collectors; the statute also serves to \"protect[ ] debt collectors from unreasonable constructions of their communications.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacobson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3640577\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/516/85/#p90\">\n    516 F.3d at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Construing the FDCPA as a barrier to the collection of principal composed of lawful interest charges would be wholly unreasonable and completely unrelated to the purposes for which the statute was enacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, while there are few if any cases that directly address Plaintiff's theory of liability, the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Llewellyn v. Asset Acceptance, LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12388048\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/669/66/\">\n    669 F.

In\n   <em>\n    Llewellyn,\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff challenged the validity of her debt before the district court, arguing that the national bank had \"applied an interest rate of 25.99% per annum, in excess of New York's civil and criminal usury laws....\"\n   <em>\n    Llewellyn v.

In confirming the validity of the plaintiff's debt, the district court acknowledged that the national bank was not a party to the suit and determined that \"no party in this case is attempting to collect interest from [the p]laintiff in excess of New York's usury laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. On appeal, the Second Circuit noted that because the national bank is \"located in South Dakota, ... New York usury law does not apply\" to it.\n   <em>\n    Llewellyn,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=669%20Fed.%20Appx.%2066\">\n    669 Fed.Appx. at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the\n   <em>\n    Llewellyn\n   </em>\n   court indicated that New York's usury statutes did apply to the defendant debt collectors, it also found that \"the district court properly determined that neither defendant charged her usurious interest on her\n   <em>\n    post-default\n   </em>\n   debt,\" and that the \"25.99 percent annual interest rate charged on her\n   <em>\n    pre-default\n   </em>\n   debt by a national bank did not violate New York usury law\" and did not\n   \"undermine the validity of the debt now being collected.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=669%20Fed.%20Appx.%2066\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Likewise, Plaintiff has failed to assert that Defendant ever charged him an usurious interest rate. The fact that Synchrony Bank may have charged Plaintiff an interest rate in excess of New York's usury laws does not invalidate the debt sought by Defendant-Synchrony Bank is located in Utah and thus, New York's usury laws do not apply to it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 12-4);\n   <em>\n    Llewellyn,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=669%20Fed.%20Appx.%2066\">\n    669 Fed.Appx. at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22-4 at 27-29). Based upon the Court's review of those latter arguments, Defendant's request for a sanctions award under any of these authorities was certainly \"well grounded in fact\" and \"warranted by existing law.\"\n   <em>\n    Kropelnicki,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432581\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/118/#p127\">\n    290 F.3d at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff contends that Defendant's motion for sanctions was improperly filed as an intimidation tactic. (Dkt. 12 at 22). However, considering that even Plaintiff concedes he was unable to find case authority in support of his interpretation of the New York usury statute (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15), as well as his flawed belief that\n   <em>\n    Madden\n   </em>\n   could form the basis for his claim, there is no indication that Defendant filed its motion for an \"improper purpose,\" or that its request was \"utterly without support.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    ED Capital LLC v.
