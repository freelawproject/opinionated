Owen asserts claims of hostile work environment and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\") against the County, and related claims of assault and battery against Morris. The County has moved for summary judgment on the retaliation claim. The court held a hearing on the motion via teleconference on February 7, 2019.

Owen Dep. 11, Dkt. No. 109-1. Morris became the County Building Official and Owen's head supervisor in November of 2014. Morris Dep. 27, 47-48, Dkt. No. 109-15. Morris remained in that position for the duration of Owen's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Within months of becoming Owen's supervisor, Morris began to sexually harass her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   101. The harassment began with comments regarding the plaintiff's attractiveness, which Morris made in person and in text messages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   47-48. When the comments were made at work, Owen would point to a photograph of Morris' wife and ask him to \"stop.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   48. Rather than doing so, Morris engaged in increasingly inappropriate conversations with Owen. For instance, Morris asked Owen how she had lost her virginity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   106. When Owen refused to answer his question, Morris proceeded to describe his first sexual experience in detail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   106. Morris also made sexual advances via text message, asked Owen to send him inappropriate photographs of herself, offered to perform oral sex on Owen, and told Owen they were going to \"do it\" and \"she was going to like it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   123, 125, 127-28, 154-55. Owen reminded Morris that he was\n   married with four children and asked him to \"stop.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   126. Rather than doing so, Morris requested that Owen perform oral sex on him for his birthday.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   127.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the summer of 2015, Morris began to engage in inappropriate physical contact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   35. Morris touched Owen's breasts on several occasions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   146;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   (\"[H]e would come up behind me and grope me and grab me.\"). He also \"forced [Owen] to kiss him many times,\" \"tried to force her to feel his penis,\" and \"placed his hand on [her] genital area\" while she was driving.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   146-47, 150-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lewis Turner, another County employee in Owen's chain of command, also made comments of a sexual nature to the plaintiff. Turner showed Owen photographs of women and ask her if she thought the women's breasts were real or fake.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   39. Turner also engaged in \"drunk texting,\" during which he sent Owen inappropriate messages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Owen complained to Morris about Turner's behavior, but \"nothing changed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   40. Instead, as the year progressed, Owen's work environment worsened, and she began to fear that Morris would hurt her or terminate her employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   71. Morris advised Owen that she would be immediately fired if he ever saw her enter the area of the building where the County's human resources (\"HR\") department was located.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   71-72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In November of 2015, Owen made it clear that she was not going to tolerate Morris' behavior any longer. While Owen was sitting at her desk, Morris approached her from behind, placed his hands down her shirt and under her bra, and squeezed her breasts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   147. In response, Owen slapped her fist on the desk and said, \"That's it .... You're going to stop touching me now. No more. Leave me alone. Stop.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Owen contends that Morris' demeanor subsequently changed. He became \"cold\" and \"mean,\" and imposed restrictions on the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   155. For instance, Morris told Owen that she was no longer allowed to bring food from home or exercise during her lunch break, and that she would be required to go out to eat with \"the guys.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   157. Morris also made Owen return her work vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   158.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 5, 2016, Morris and Turner met with Owen in a conference room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   61. During the meeting, Morris presented the plaintiff with a bulleted list of alleged reasons to terminate her employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He advised Owen that should could either quit her job or be fired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After meeting with Owen, Morris asked Patricia Barnes, an HR official, to prepare a \"Notice of Intent to Terminate\" letter. Barnes Dep. 42, Dkt. No. 109-2. The letter advised Owen that she would have three days to respond to the proposed course of action before Morris made a final decision. Notice of Intent to Terminate, Dkt. No. 109-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Owen met with Barnes after work that same day in Barnes' office. Owen Dep. 65. During the meeting, Owen told Barnes that Morris had made sexual advances toward her and that she had rejected his advances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   65-66. Owen also indicated that the asserted reasons for her proposed termination were \"fabrications\" and that Morris was retaliating against her for \"standing up for [her]self after months of him molesting [her] and telling him to stop.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the conclusion of the meeting, Barnes told Owen that she would investigate the alleged misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   76. However, Barnes noted that Morris was a \"golden child\" and that she did not believe the County \"would ever do anything about him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   76. Barnes also warned that Owen would \"never work for another municipality\n   again\" if she decided to pursue a complaint against Morris.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Morris had knowledge of Owen's meeting with Barnes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Morris Dep. 107 (\"I know HR had a meeting with Ms. Owen .... It was after hours.\"). After the meeting, Barnes spoke to several employees regarding Owen's allegations. There is a dispute in the record as to whether Barnes questioned Morris.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Barnes Dep. 29 (\"I spoke to ... Barbara Mills, Lewis Turner, [and] Kenny Altice.\");\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   Position Statement 4, Dkt. 109-19 (\"Ms. Barnes conducted a preliminary investigation to determine if there was any evidence to substantiate Ms. Owen's statement. Ms. Barnes interviewed Mr. Morris, Mr. Turner, and other members of the Developmental Services Department.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 10, 2016, Morris terminated Owen's employment. In a Notice of Termination issued that same day, Morris advised Owen that the employment decision was based on the following violations of HR Administrative Policy No. 2.50: abuse of County time for personal business; insubordination or failure to follow a supervisor's instructions; leaving the work site during work hours without permission; and unauthorized use or misuse of County property.

Owen filed an amended complaint on July 14, 2017. In Count I of the amended complaint, Owen claims that she was subjected to a sexually hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. In Count II, Owen claims that her employment was terminated in retaliation for \"complaining about the harassment and hostile work environment.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 40, Dkt. No. 16. In Count III, Owen asserts claims of assault and battery against Morris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 30, 2018, the County moved for summary judgment on the retaliation claim.

Owen's retaliation claim is premised on the opposition clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To establish a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of Title VII, a plaintiff must prove: (1) that she engaged in protected activity; (2) that her employer took a materially adverse action against her; and (3) that a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the materially adverse action.\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

In moving for summary judgment, the County focuses exclusively on the first element, arguing that \"Owen did not engage in protected activity as a matter of law.\" Br. in Supp. of Mot. Summ.

Because the term \"oppose\" is not defined in the statute, the Supreme Court has held that the term \"carries its ordinary meaning: '[t]o resist or antagonize ...; to contend against; to confront; resist; withstand.' \"\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

This conclusion comports with the plain language of the opposition clause, the broad interpretation articulated in\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   , and the Fourth Circuit's similarly \"expansive view of what constitutes oppositional conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    DeMasters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768563\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/409/#p417\">\n    796 F.3d at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Sixth Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    New Breed Logistics:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Sexual harassment is without question an 'unlawful employment practice.' If an employee demands that his/her supervisor stop engaging in this unlawful practice-i.e., resists or confronts the supervisor's unlawful harassment-the opposition clause's broad language confers protection to this conduct. Importantly, the language of the opposition clause does not specify to whom protected activity must be directed. Therefore, it would be unfair to read into the provision a requirement that a complainant only engages in protected activity when s/he opposes the harassment to a particular official designated by the employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148488\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/783/1057/#p1067\">\n    783 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1067-68 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Charest v.

Sept. 20, 2017) (finding the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    New Breed Logistics\n   </em>\n   to be \"sound\" and observing that it \"would undermine the fundamental purpose of the statute, if Title VII's protections from retaliation were not triggered when an employee confronts a supervisor and demands that the harassment stop\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Owen, the court concludes that a reasonable jury could easily find that Owen's statements to Morris regarding his offensive behavior constituted protected activity. This is not a case in which an employee merely rejected a supervisor's advances on one occasion. Instead, the plaintiff's evidence indicates that Morris subjected Owen to increasingly inappropriate sexual comments and physical contact, and that she repeatedly told Morris to cease the harassment. On the final occasion in November of 2015, Morris approached Owen from behind, placed his hands under her shirt and bra, and squeezed her breasts. In response, Owen slapped her fist on her desk and demanded that Morris stop touching her and leave her alone. Such evidence, if proven, would be sufficient to establish that Owen engaged in protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Additionally, the plaintiff has offered evidence indicating that her oppositional activity was not limited to communications with Morris regarding his offending conduct. Owen also complained to Morris about Turner's behavior, and she reported Morris' harassment to Barnes before a final termination decision was made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeMasters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768563\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/409/#p417\">\n    796 F.3d at 413, 417-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"the proper test for analyzing oppositional conduct requires consideration of the employee's course of conduct as a whole,\" rather than a \"myopic\" evaluation of \"discrete acts\"). While the County argues in its reply brief that Barnes did not relay Owen's allegations to Morris, the court agrees with the plaintiff that a genuine dispute of material fact exists with respect to this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Position Statement 4 (indicating that Barnes spoke to Morris about Owen's allegations of sexual\n   harassment);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.
