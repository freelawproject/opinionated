COLLYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   John Paul Waymack is a citizen of the United States, a transplant surgeon living in Washington, D.C., and the founder, Chairman, and Chief Medical Officer of Kitov Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Ltd., a drug company headquartered in Israel and listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. The Israel Securities Authority is conducting a criminal investigation of Kitov Pharmaceuticals and has asked the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for assistance by obtaining documents and deposition testimony from Dr. Waymack here in the U.S. Because Dr. Waymack objects, the Securities and Exchange Commission has sought a court order compelling his compliance with its subpoenas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Dr. Waymack faces a significant difference in criminal law between the United States and Israel. He has rights under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n   to refuse to answer questions that may incriminate him; no U.S. prosecutor may later cite the silence of a defendant as indicative of guilt. In Israel, however, while a person under investigation can refuse to answer questions, his refusal may be cited as evidence of guilt. Dr. Waymack protests that the Securities and Exchange Commission cannot properly use a civil subpoena to obtain evidence for a criminal investigation or put him in this dilemma between asserting his rights in the U.S. and having it used against him in Israel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court concludes that the Securities and Exchange Commission has statutory authority to proceed as it is but that its subpoenas for documents are unreasonably broad. Therefore, it will grant the Securities and Exchange Commission's motion in part and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

This denial was based on Dr. Waymack's belief that the ISA is attempting to use the SEC process to obtain legally certain of his documents that the ISA had unlawfully seized through an improperly-executed search warrant in Israel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Waymack Jan. 2018 Letter at 1.

Waymack Opp'n at 4-7. Specifically, Dr. Waymack states that his email account, which is exclusively based in the United States, was accessed and frozen by the ISA for weeks.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Dr. Waymack informed the SEC that Kitov is challenging the validity of that aspect of the search with the Attorney General of Israel, but that no decision has been reached.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Waymack Jan. 2018 Letter at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 23, 2018, the SEC served Dr. Waymack with a second subpoena for documents and testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SEC Appl. at 5-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Commission argues that its subpoenas are part of an investigation authorized by Congress, that the information sought is relevant to the inquiry, and that Dr. Waymack has no valid argument that the inquiry is unreasonable or to otherwise fail to comply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dr. Waymack posits four reasons why the Commission's subpoenas should not be enforced:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The Commission cannot issue a civil administrative subpoena for the sole purpose of furthering a criminal investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The subpoenas offend the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because they are being used to recapture evidence obtained in an unlawful search and seizure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The subpoenas offend the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because negative inferences can be drawn against Dr. Waymack in a criminal trial in Israel should he invoke his right against self-incrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The subpoenas are overly broad and unduly burdensome, effectively requesting production of nearly every communication between Dr. Waymack and his Israeli colleagues and any documents he has related to Kitov.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Waymack Opp'n at 1. Dr. Waymack's first argument is the one to which he gives greatest emphasis; it constitutes an attack on the SEC's authority in this situation. The remaining arguments contest the reasonableness of the inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A. SEC's Authorization\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Section 21(a)(2) and (b) of the Exchange Act specifically gives the Commission (1) authority to assist foreign securities authorities and (2) power to subpoena testimony and documents as part of an investigation to assist a foreign securities authority.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2021\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) and (b). Dr. Waymack does not contest the statutory authority of the Commission to assist the ISA, but instead argues that the SEC cannot use its civil investigative authority to assist with a criminal ISA investigation. Dr. Waymack relies on\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Dresser Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507292,1292654\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/628/1368/\">\n    628 F.2d 1368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1387 (D.C. Cir. 1980), to argue that an agency acts in bad faith when it uses its civil investigative authorities \"solely for criminal enforcement purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. LaSalle Nat'l Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179473\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/298/#p307\">\n    437 U.S. 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307-08, 316 &amp; 316 n.18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179473\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/298/#p307\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179473\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/298/#p307\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978) (relating to the Internal Revenue Code). Further, Dr. Waymack quotes the Commission's Enforcement Manual to the same effect:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   It is important that the civil investigation has its own independent civil investigative purpose and not be initiated to obtain evidence for a criminal prosecution. This does not prevent the staff from taking an action if the action will provide a benefit\n   <em>\n    to both the SEC's case\n   </em>\n   and the parallel criminal matter. It does mean, however, that the staff should not take an SEC civil investigative action for which the\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   aim is to benefit the criminal matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Waymack Opp'n at 12 (quoting Securities and Exchange Commission Division of Enforcement, Enforcement Manual \u00a7 5.2.1, available at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/enforcement manual.pdf (Nov. 28, 2017) (first emphasis added, second emphasis in original) ). The SEC does not say that it has its own ongoing civil or criminal investigation of Dr. Waymack or Kitov, only an investigation to assist the ISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Commission argues that its subpoenas were not issued solely for criminal enforcement purposes but were instead issued pursuant to Congress's explicit authorization for it to engage in reciprocal cooperation with foreign securities authorities. The language of Exchange Act \u00a7 21(a)(2) is clear that the Commission can, \"in its discretion,\" \"conduct such investigation as the Commission deems necessary\" to assist a foreign authority. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u(a)(2). Congress cabined the Commission's discretion in two ways: the foreign securities authority must have agreed to reciprocity should the Commission seek its assistance and the Commission's assistance to the foreign authority cannot injure the interests of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Through the Declaration of Matthew B. Greiner, Assistant Director of the Office of International Affairs of the SEC, the Commission states that the ISA has \"previously undertaken to provide assistance to the Commission staff in securities matters of concern to the United States.\" Decl. of Matthew B. Greiner [Dkt. 1-4] \u00b6 9. The Commission also states that the Formal Order of the Commission authorizing the subpoenas included the statement that compliance with the ISA request for assistance would not prejudice the United\n   States' public interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SEC Mem. at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4, SEC Appl., Formal Order [Dkt. 1-5].

Thus, the policy is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Dresser\n   </em>\n   that courts should \"not block parallel investigations by [the SEC and DOJ] in the absence of 'special circumstances' in which the nature of the proceedings demonstrably prejudices substantial rights of the investigated party or of the government.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507292,1292654\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/628/1368/\">\n    628 F.2d at 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Dresser\n   </em>\n   refused to extend the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    LaSalle National Bank\n   </em>\n   that the Internal Revenue Service \"may not use its summons authority to investigate possible violations of the tax laws\" to the SEC's transmittal of civil investigative materials to the DOJ.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507292,1292654\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/628/1368/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1377 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507292,1292654\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/628/1368/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507292,1292654\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/628/1368/\">\n    at 1379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The language of the securities laws and the nature of the SEC's civil enforcement responsibilities require that the SEC retain full powers of investigation and civil enforcement action, even after Justice has begun a criminal investigation into the same alleged violations.\"). The SEC policy does not address coordination between the SEC and a criminal investigation by a foreign securities authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Congress gave the Commission broad authority to assist foreign securities authorities, many of which-unlike the SEC-have both civil and criminal functions. In so doing, Congress used broad language allowing the SEC to assist \"if the requesting authority states that the requesting authority is conducting an investigation which it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate\n   <em>\n    any laws or rules relating to securities matters\n   </em>\n   that the requesting authority administers or enforces\"\n   <em>\n    regardless of\n   </em>\n   \"whether the facts stated in the request would also constitute a violation of the laws of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u(a)(2) (emphasis added). Congress, therefore, anticipated that the SEC might seek information about actions that are completely lawful in the United States but violate a foreign securities law. With such authority, it does not follow that Congress limited the SEC, a fully civil authority, in its use of a civil subpoena to assist a foreign criminal investigation. The subpoenas issued to Dr. Waymack were consistent with the congressional authorization to assist foreign securities agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Relevance and Reasonableness of the SEC Inquiry\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Commission asserts that it seeks only relevant documents and testimony, arguing that \"[c]ourts must enforce the terms of an agency's authorized subpoena if 'the demand is not too indefinite and the information sought is reasonably relevant.' \" SEC Mem. at 6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He first argues that the subpoenas prejudice the public interest because they compromise his constitutional rights under the Fourth and Fifth amendments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Waymack also argues that the search terms proposed by the Commission are overly broad because they include the terms \"Kitov\" and \"Israel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    1. The Public Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Dr. Waymack contends that the Commission's investigation of him prejudices the public interest of the United States because if he responds to the subpoenas he will lose the protections of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. He emphasizes that the Bilateral MOU between the SEC and the ISA requires that \"any person giving statements or providing information or documents as a result of a request made under this [MOU] ... be entitled to all the rights and protections of the laws of the jurisdiction of the requested Authority,\" in this case, the United States. Bilateral MOU, art. 6, \u00b6 7. Dr. Waymack contends that he is being forced to choose between compliance with the subpoenas and his constitutional rights because (1) any invocation of his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination could be used against him in Israel\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) the ISA is attempting to use the SEC subpoenas to avoid the constitutional prohibition on its use of evidence obtained through an unlawful search and seizure-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the earlier, allegedly unlawful, ISA search and seizure of Dr. Waymack's email account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Commission responds that its subpoenas do not deprive Dr. Waymack of any constitutional rights because (1) even if the ISA violated the laws of Israel in conducting its search of Dr. Waymack's Google account, there can be no argument that the ISA violated his rights under Fourth Amendment because, as a foreign entity, the ISA is not bound by the Fourth Amendment; (2) Dr. Waymack does not argue that the SEC is directly violating the Fourth Amendment by issuing the subpoena; and (3) the Fifth Amendment does not protect from foreign prosecution. Further, the SEC would recognize Dr. Waymack's constitutional right against self-incrimination should he assert the Fifth Amendment in producing documents or answering questions in the United States. The fact that Israel would not recognize the same right under the U.S. Constitution does not bar the SEC from aiding the ISA \"in its discretion\" since the ISA \"is conducting an investigation which it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate any laws or rules relating to securities matters that the [ISA] administers or enforces.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court agrees with the SEC. Although Dr. Waymack's invocation of the Fifth Amendment might be used to infer guilt in Israel, Kitov agreed to be subject to and to abide by Israeli law when its headquarters were moved to Tel Aviv.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Amendment does not protect individuals from self-incrimination in foreign tribunals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Additionally, Kitov is currently challenging the legitimacy of the ISA search with the Israeli Attorney General in Israel. This Court does not have the authority to opine or comment on the legitimacy of that search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Munaf v.

Reasonableness of the Search Terms\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, Dr. Waymack challenges the over-inclusiveness of the SEC's proposed search terms. He argues that requiring him to produce all documents that contain the words \"Kitov\" and \"Israel\" will include all emails sent by him because those words are present in his signature block. Waymack Opp'n at 16. He also argues that the remaining search terms are not targeted to seek only materials relevant to the Data Monitoring Committee and, specifically, its involvement with the approval of the drug, Consensi\u2122.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17. The SEC does not adequately counter Dr. Waymack's objection or explain why all documents with the words \"Kitov\" and \"Israel\" would be relevant to its inquiry, but merely argues the search terms are reasonable because they are limited in number and time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under these circumstances, in which the terms \"Kitov\" and \"Israel\" are in Dr. Waymack's signature line on all of his emails, the Court finds it is unreasonable to require production of all documents with those terms, even for a limited time period. The SEC will be ordered to craft search terms that are targeted to identify relevant documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court will grant in part and deny in part the SEC's application for an order to show cause and for an order requiring compliance with its administrative subpoenas [Dkt. 1]. The Court will require Dr. Waymack to comply with the SEC's subpoenas for testimony and documents but will require the SEC to craft search terms that are targeted to identify relevant documents. The parties will be ordered to meet and confer about reasonable search terms within the next two weeks and the Court will retain jurisdiction to resolve any disputes,\n   if needed.
