(Docket No. 142.) The Court referred the United States' motion to Magistrate Judge Marshal D. Morgan. (Docket No. 143.) The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (\"R &amp; R\"), recommending that the Court disqualify attorneys Jedrick Burgos-Amador (\"Burgos\") and Ricardo Lozada-Franco (\"Lozada\"). (Docket No. 190.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTS\n   </strong>\n   the R &amp; R.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Burgos and Lozada are\n   <strong>\n    DISQUALIFIED\n   </strong>\n   from representing Mulero in this criminal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(Docket No. 1, Ex. 1 at p. 1.) Among the items the PRPD officers seized during the execution of the search warrant were seven firearms, over 1000 rounds of ammunition, 154 prescription pills, 266 baggies containing cocaine, six digital scales, a drug ledger, and $ 612 in United States currency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Subsequently, the PRPD officers arrested the two occupants of the apartment, Mulero and Luis Merced-Garc\u00eda (\"Merced\") (collectively \"defendants\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 10, 2017, a grand jury charged the defendants with possession of a machinegun in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, and possession with intent to distribute a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(B)(ii),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A)(i), and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), respectively. (Docket No. 16.) Mulero completed a CJA 23 Financial Affidavit, setting forth his income, assets, obligations and debts at the time of his arrest. (Docket No. 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Magistrate Judge Bruce J.

(Docket No. 10.) The following day, however, Mariela Maestre-Cordero (\"Maestre\") filed a notice of appearance on Mulero's behalf. (Docket No. 11.) The appearance of privately retained counsel prompted Celedonio to withdraw from this litigation. (Docket No. 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Maestre represented Mulero for less than two months, appearing at the initial detention and\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   bail hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Docket Nos. 12 and 32.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Javier Cuyar-Olivo (\"Cuyar\") filed a notice of appearance on June 28, 2017. Maestre subsequently moved to withdraw, and the Court granted her motion. (Docket Nos. 53 and 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 21, 2017, the defendants filed a joint motion to suppress evidence pursuant to the Fourth Amendment. (Docket No. 65.) The Court referred the defendants' joint motion to Magistrate Judge Camille L. V\u00e9lez-Rive. (Docket No. 57.) Cuyar, Burgos, and Lozada - all defense counsel in private practice - attended the suppression hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket Nos. 123 and 124.) Burgos and Lozada filed notices of appearance on July 2, 2018. (Docket Nos. 125 and 126.) After Cuyar accepted a position at the office of the Federal Public Defender for the District of Puerto Rico, he moved to withdraw on July 4, 2018. (Docket Nos. 127, 128.) The Court granted Cuyar's motion. (Docket No. 128.) Mulero is now represented by Burgos and Lozada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 5, 2018, the United States moved for an inquiry to determine \"where the money for multiple private attorneys [came] from.\" (Docket No. 142 at p. 5.) The Court referred the United States' motion to Magistrate Judge Marshal J. Morgan. (Docket No. 143.) The magistrate judge recommends that the Court disqualify Burgos and Lozada, appoint counsel from the CJA Panel to represent Mulero, and order Burgos and Lozada to return the fees they received to represent Mulero. (Docket Nos. 158 and 190.) The Puerto Rico Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (\"PRACDL\") submitted an\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   brief in opposition to the United States' motion. (Docket No. 164.) Mulero objected to the R &amp; R, the United States responded, and Mulero replied. (Docket Nos. 197, 200 and 202.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

This case involves multiple firearms, controlled substances, and a substantial possibility that unindicted persons participated in the commission of the charged offenses. As the magistrate judge correctly observed, \"there are people who would benefit from [Mulero's] silence.\" (Docket No. 190 at p. 33.) Mulero does not possess the means to pay for the legal fees of\n   <strong>\n    three\n   </strong>\n   privately retained attorneys. The Court is thus dutybound to ensure that any potential conflict arising from the payment of Mulero's legal fees is addressed to safeguard his Sixth Amendment rights, and the integrity of the judicial process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quintero v.

Ultimately, Burgos requested leave to identify Mulero's third-party benefactor to the magistrate judge\n   <em>\n    ex parte.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 17-18.

Lozada served as Cuyar's intern to gain experience in criminal litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 39. Cuyar testified that he charged Vargas $ 15,000.00 to represent Mulero \"up to either sentencing or dismissal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 45. Vargas purportedly withdrew $ 17,000.00 from her pension trust account at Home Depot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 46. Vargas paid Cuyar $ 10,000, followed by one payment of $ 2,500.00, and two payments of $ 1,250.00, all in cash and without a written agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Maestre's and Cuyar's testimony establishes that Vargas paid a total of $ 25,000.00 in cash for Mulero's defense, $ 8,000.00 more than Vargas purportedly withdrew from the Home Depot pension account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After accepting a position at the Office of the Federal Public Defender for the District of Puerto Rico, Cuyar met with Mulero and Vargas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 38. Cuyar referred them to Burgos, requesting that Lozada remain on the case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 39. Burgos requested $ 5,000.00 to represent Mulero, agreeing \"in fairness to give [Lozada] ten percent of [his] fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 42. Cuyar \"personally paid\" Burgos, providing him with two personal checks for $ 2,000.00 and $ 500.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 57;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 159, Ex. 1 at pp. 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Before the evidentiary hearing concluded, the magistrate judge reiterated that Burgos and Lozada invoked the Fifth Amendment. (Docket No. 160 at p. 78.) Burgos and Lozada asserted that they refused to testify \"[o]ut of an abundance of caution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 78 and 80. The magistrate judge stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Burgos and Lozada] have both indicated that [they] raise the Fifth Amendment. I want to be abundantly clear to everyone in this room and that the record be clear that [Burgos and Lozada] refuse to take the stand, [to] be placed under oath because [they] understood that to answer the questions, [they] would be implicating [themselves] in criminal activity. That is the understanding of the Court and that is what the record will so reflect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 80-81. Burgos answered \"yes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Burgos and Lozada are Disqualified\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In support of his objection to the R &amp; R, Mulero submitted a sworn statement conveying his desire that Burgos and Lozada continue to serve as defense counsel. (Docket No. 197, Ex. 2 at p. 4.) The Court agrees with the magistrate judge, however, that Burgos and Lozada \"cannot engage in representation of a client when such representation exposes counsel to criminal liability or criminal prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 39. Accordingly, Burgos and Lozada are\n   <strong>\n    DISQUALIFIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Invocation of the Fifth Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Burgos and Lozada's invocation of the Fifth Amendment demonstrates that their personal interests are separate and potentially divergent from Mulero's interests. The right not to incriminate oneself is no trivial matter, to be invoked \"out of an abundance of caution.\" (Docket No. 181 at pp. 78 and 80.) The Puerto Rico Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys contends that invocation of the Fifth Amendment \"may not have been necessary, or the wisest or most elegant choice.\" (Docket No. 164, Ex. 1 at p. 14.) The Court will not speculate whether Burgos' and Lozada's actions were \"necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Both defense attorneys are versed in criminal law. By invoking the Fifth Amendment, Burgos and Lozada \"show[ed] at the very least that [they themselves were] faced with some authentic danger of incrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
