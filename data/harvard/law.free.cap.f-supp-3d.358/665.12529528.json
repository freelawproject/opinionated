SARGUS, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on the parties' cross motions for partial summary judgment. Defendant Eclipse Resources, I, LP (\"Defendant\") moves for summary\n   judgment against Plaintiffs Shanesville Investments LLC and Graber Land LLC (\"Plaintiffs\") regarding the interpretation of a lease agreement between the parties. (ECF No. 20). In turn, Plaintiffs seek partial summary judgment against Defendant in favor of their lease interpretation. (ECF No. 22). For the reasons that follow, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's motion (ECF No. 20) and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion (ECF No. 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs are successors in interest to an oil and gas lease between Robert and Elizabeth Savage (collectively \"Savages\") and Anschutz Exploration Corporation (\"Anschutz\"). (Exhibit A, ECF No. 3-1). Plaintiff Shanesville Investments LLC (\"Shanesville\") owns a 72.355-acre property in Oxford Township, Guernsey County. (Exhibit B, ECF No. 3-2). Plaintiff Graber Land LLC (\"Graber\") owns 70.231 acres adjacent to Shanesville's property. (Exhibit C, ECF No. 3-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2008, the Savages signed a lease with Anschutz. (Exhibit A). In 2014, as successors in interest to the Savages, Plaintiffs signed identical amendments to the lease with Anschutz's successors in interest, Chesapeake Exploration, LLC (\"Chesapeake\"); CHK Utica, LLC (\"CHK\"); and Total E &amp; P USA, Inc. (\"Total\"). (Exhibits D, ECF No. 3-4; Exhibit F, ECF No. 3-6). The amendments will be referred to as the \"Shanesville Amendment\" (Exhibit D) and the \"Graber Amendment\" (Exhibit F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties to the amendments recorded memoranda on January 22, 2015, which will be referred to as \"1st Shanesville Memorandum\" (Exhibit E, ECF No. 3-5) and \"1st Graber Memorandum\" (Exhibit G, ECF No. 3-7). Plaintiffs, Chesapeake, CHK, and Total recorded subsequent memoranda on March 12, 2015, adding Total's signature. (Exhibit H, ECF No. 3-8; Exhibit I, ECF No. 3-9). The subsequent memoranda were titled \"2nd Shanesville Memorandum\" (Exhibit H) and \"2nd Graber Memorandum (Exhibit I). Collectively, the Court will refer to the lease, lease amendments, 1st lease memoranda, and 2nd lease memoranda as the \"Amended Lease.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 21, 2018, Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit, alleging breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment. (Pls.' Compl., ECF No. 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, Plaintiffs assert that Defendant breached the express terms of the Amended Lease by improperly deducting expenses before calculating Plaintiffs' royalty payments. (Pls.' Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75-91). Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant sold extracted wellhead product to unaffiliated third parties for processing and subsequently deducted the costs of this processing from their royalty payments to Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-25). Plaintiffs contend this net cost calculation resulted in smaller royalty payments, preventing Plaintiffs from \"enjoying the full benefits of their minerals and rights\" under the Amended Lease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30). According to Plaintiffs, Defendant continues \"to improperly deduct costs from the royalty payments,\" despite previously refunding a portion of the deducted costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that Defendant is not entitled to make deductions from gross proceed royalty payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94). In its Answer, Defendant denies that it underpaid royalties to Plaintiffs. (Def.'s Answer \u00b6 4). Defendant asserts a counterclaim for declaratory judgment, arguing that its current calculation of royalties is proper under the Amended Lease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 7, 2018, Defendant moved for partial summary judgment in favor of its interpretation of royalty calculations under the Amended Lease. (ECF No. 20). That same day, Plaintiffs filed a cross motion for partial summary judgment on the interpretation of royalty calculations. (ECF No. 22). The parties filed simultaneous responses in opposition (ECF Nos. 24 and 25) and reply briefs (ECF Nos. 29 and 30). The parties' cross motions for partial summary judgment are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant has the burden of establishing there are no genuine issues of material fact, which may be achieved by demonstrating the nonmoving party lacks evidence to support an essential element of its claim.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Parties' Arguments Regarding Royalty Calculations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the instant action, both parties contend the contract is unambiguous regarding the calculation of royalty payments. Defendant argues that \"[a] careful yet common sense reading of the relevant provisions\" of the Amended Lease indicates that Eclipse may calculate royalties based on the proceeds it receives from a third-party processor. (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 1). Therefore, Defendant asserts there is no need for \"divining the parties' intentions through parole or extrinsic evidence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Conversely, Plaintiffs state that \"[t]he plain and unambiguous language of the\n   Lease as Amended ... forbid[s] Eclipse from deducting from Plaintiffs' royalties the costs and expenses of placing the oil, gas, and liquefiable hydrocarbons into marketable condition.\" (Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 2). According to Plaintiffs, Defendant is expressly prohibited from adjusting royalty payments \"directly or indirectly with any expense required to make gas marketable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3) (citing Exhibit D &amp; Exhibit F \u00b6 (e) ). The Court will consider the parties' arguments in turn to determine: (1) whether the language of the Amended Lease is unambiguous, and (2) if so, which interpretation is controlling,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To support its contract interpretation, Defendant relies on the definition of \"Gross Proceeds\" under the Amended Lease's royalty provision. Paragraph (a) of the Amended Lease provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    Percentage\n   </em>\n   . The royalties payable to the Lessor under this Lease shall be on a well by well basis. As to each and every well completed as a producer of oil and/or gas on the leased premises or on lands pooled therewith, the royalties paid to Lessor shall be sixteen and one-half percent (16.5%) of all the oil, gas and casinghead gas and casinghead gasoline removed or recovered from the leased premises or, at Lessor's option (which shall be presumed to be exercised unless Lessor advises Lessee to the contrary prior to any applicable production month) the\n   <strong>\n    Gross Proceeds (as hereinafter defined in paragraph (d) )\n   </strong>\n   of the total gross production attributable to the applicable well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Exhibit D &amp; F \u00b6 (a) ) (emphasis added). As noted by Defendant, paragraph (d) defines \"Gross Proceeds\" with the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (d)\n   <em>\n    Gross Proceeds\n   </em>\n   . For the purpose of this Lease, \"Gross Proceeds\" means the total consideration paid for the sale of oil, gas, casinghead gas, casinghead gasoline, associated hydrocarbons, and marketable by-products, produced from the leased premises or payments for future production or delivery of production at a future time, or sums paid to compromise claims relating to payment obligations associated with the sale of oil, gas, casinghead gas, casinghead gasoline, associated hydrocarbons, and marketable by-products\n   <strong>\n    with the following exceptions:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (i) If gas produced from the Leased Premises is processed for the recovery of liquefiable hydrocarbon products prior to sale, and if such processing plant is not owned by Lessee or any Affiliate of Lessee,\n   <strong>\n    Lessor's royalty shall be calculated based upon the consideration paid to Lessee from Lessee's sale of such liquefiable hydrocarbons and residue gas.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 (d)(i) ) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   According to Defendant, subparagraph (d)(i) of the Amended Lease is the \"lynchpin for determining how royalties\" should be calculated. (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 7). Focusing its analysis to the last phrase of romanette (i), Defendant argues the Amended Lease requires royalties on processed wellhead product to be \"calculated based upon the consideration paid to Lessee from Lessee's sale of such liquefiable hydrocarbons and residue gas.\" (Def.'s Opp'n at 3, ECF No. 25) (citing Exhibit D &amp; F \u00b6 (d)(i) ). In other words, Defendant contends that royalties must be computed \"based on the money paid to Eclipse for the sale of processed gas to either a processor or other third party.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant continues by analyzing the plain meaning of \"consideration.\" (Def.'s Mot for Summ. J. at 7). Relying on the Merriam Webster dictionary definition, Defendant asserts that \"consideration\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   must be interpreted to mean \"recompense\" or \"payment\" under the terms of the Amended Lease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Consequently, Defendant argues \"consideration\" in subsection (d)(i) refers to \"the amount of money Eclipse, as the Lessee, receives from the Processor for the sale of its gas.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In Defendant's view, this monetary payment represents the net costs of processing the raw wellhead product, rather than the gross proceeds from sale to a third-party processor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Anticipating Plaintiffs' position, Defendant cites paragraph (e), in which the Amended Lease explicitly addresses the \"Costs of Production.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). The provision provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (e)\n   <em>\n    Costs of Production\n   </em>\n   . Lessee shall place oil and gas produced from the leased Premises in marketable condition and shall market same as agent for Lessor.\n   <strong>\n    Except as expressly provided in (d) above,\n   </strong>\n   Lessor's royalty shall not be charged directly or indirectly with any expense require to make gas marketable, including but not limited to the following: Expenses of production, gathering, dehydration, compression, manufacturing, processing, treating, transporting or marketing of gas, oil, or any liquefiable hydrocarbons extracted therefrom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (Exhibit D &amp; F \u00b6 (e) ) (emphasis added). Although Defendant recognizes that paragraph (e) appears to prohibit the adjustment of royalties for production costs, it notes: \"[i]n actuality ... this provision supports Eclipse's method for calculating royalties.\" (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 8). By including the language \"Except as expressly provided in (d) above,\" the drafters reinforced the exceptions to the definition of \"Gross Proceeds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Moreover, Defendant notes that a \"contract should be construed to give effect to all of its provisions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9) (citing\n   <em>\n    Eastham v. Chesapeake Appalachia, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056205\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/356/#p363\">\n    754 F.3d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 363 (6th Cir. 2014) (\"A contract must be construed in its entirety and in a manner that does not leave any phrase meaningless or surplusage\") ). Defendant argues that if the drafters intended royalties to be calculated using the gross sales price, it would have been unnecessary to define \"Gross Proceeds\" or include multiple exceptions. (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 9). According to Defendant, such a reading would render subsection (d)(i) meaningless. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Defendant's interpretation of the Amended Lease is improper.

(Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 10). Citing paragraph (e), the \"\n   <em>\n    Costs of Production\n   </em>\n   ,\" Plaintiffs contend \"[t]here is no other provision that speaks more directly on the issue Eclipse's obligations\" to bear the costs associated with raw material processing. (Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 9). Specifically, Plaintiffs point out that the Amended Lease states: \"Lessee shall place oil and gas produced from the leased premises in marketable condition and shall market same as agent for Lessor.\" (Exhibit D &amp; F \u00b6 (e) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that \"marketable condition\" is a term of art in the oil and gas industry. (Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 13). As noted by Plaintiffs, \"[n]atural gas must generally be treated or processed-to remove waste products\" before it can be marketed as a commodity.\n   <em>\n    Abraham v.

App. 2016). This raw wellhead product must be processed into \"dry gas\" or liquefiable hydrocarbons before it is in marketable condition. (Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 15) (citing\n   <em>\n    Carter v. Exxon Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10001481\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/842/393/#p395\">\n    842 S.W.2d 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 395 (Tex.

Mot. for Summ. J. at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs argue the Amended Lease requires Defendant to bear the costs and expenses of this processing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). In particular, Plaintiffs note that the second sentence of paragraph (e) expressly prohibits Defendant from charging royalties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     directly or indirectly\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   with any expense required to make gas marketable, including but not limited to the following: Expenses of production, gathering, dehydration, compression, manufacturing, processing, treating, transporting or marketing of gas, oil,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     or any liquefiable hydrocarbons extracted therefrom\n    </em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (citing Exhibit D &amp; F \u00b6 (e) ). Because the drafters included the language \"extracted therefrom,\" Plaintiffs assert that paragraph (e) specifically bars Defendant from charging Plaintiffs any costs \"associated with services performed subsequent to the gas leaving the wellhead-including the cost of processing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiffs also point out the inclusion of subparagraphs (d)(ii) and (d)(iii) suggests that Defendant is expected to internalize all processing costs. (Pls. Mot. for Summ. J. at 24-25), Subparagraph (d)(ii) protects Plaintiffs from potential \"price manipulation caused by Eclipse's decision to process the wet gas in its own facility.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). Plaintiffs interpret the provision to ensure that Defendant \"cannot artificially lower the basis for calculating Plaintiffs' royalties by undervaluing the liquefiable hydrocarbons and dry gas on less than arm's-length terms to an affiliate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25). Similarly, Plaintiffs contend that subparagraph (d)(iii), which shields Plaintiffs' royalties from losses incurred due to Defendant's poor processing decisions, also indicates that royalties cannot be lowered by processing costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Despite their assertions, Plaintiffs acknowledge there is one \"qualification on Eclipse's obligation to cover all costs and expenses with making the oil and gas marketable.\" (Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 18). According to Plaintiffs, subparagraph (d)(iv) permits Defendant to reduce royalty payments in the event it settles with a third-party for a breach of contract related to processing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   However, Plaintiffs reject Defendant's reading of the paragraph (d) and subparagraph (d)(i). Addressing Defendant's interpretation of \"Gross Proceeds,\" Plaintiffs contend that paragraph (d) is a \"landowner-friendly provision that does not authorize Eclipse to deduct any expenses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). Plaintiffs emphasize the term \"total consideration\" in paragraph (d), arguing that \"consideration\" encompasses more than monetary payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20) (Exhibit D &amp; F \u00b6 (d) ). Citing Black's Law Dictionary, Plaintiffs defines \"consideration\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   The inducement to a contract. The cause, motive, price, or impelling influence which induces a contracting party to enter into a contract. The reason or material cause of a contract.

Plaintiffs also offer a provision of the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code in support of their interpretation. (Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 21). Under O.R.C. \u00a7 1302.03(A), \"[a] contract for the sale of minerals of the like, including oil and gas, or a structure or its materials to be removed from realty is a contract for the sale of goods within sections 1302.01 to 1302.98 of the Revised Code.\" Section 1302.17 of the Ohio Revised Code indicates the price for a sale of goods \"can be made payable in money or otherwise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Consequently, Plaintiffs argue the Amended Lease \"contemplates that 'Gross Proceeds' includes all value received by Eclipse.\" (Pls. Mot. for Summ. J. at 22). When read together with paragraph (e), Plaintiffs suggest that paragraph (d) requires Defendant to calculate royalties based on the total consideration obtained by Defendant for the sale of \"wet gas.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). To Plaintiffs, any services received by Defendant from a third-party processor constitute a benefit-and therefore consideration within the meaning of the Amended Lease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs contend that subparagraph (d)(i) does not support Defendant's position. Although the text provides that: \"Lessor's royalty shall be calculated based upon the consideration paid to Lessee from Lessee's sale of such liquefiable hydrocarbons and residue gas,\" Plaintiffs argue the provision merely addresses timing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). According to Plaintiffs, subparagraph (d) \"dictates when royalties are to be calculated.\" (Pls.' Reply at 9). Thus, Plaintiffs assert that (d)(i-iii) are \"exceptions to when royalties are to be calculated under paragraph (d), not exceptions to the rule that royalties are to be calculated based upon consideration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In other words, if Defendant processes wet gas into marketable dry gas and liquefiable hydrocarbons prior to sale, Plaintiffs\n   argue that (d)(i) entitles them to royalties on both the processed dry gas and the separated liquefiable hydrocarbons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiffs also aver that interpreting paragraph (d) to permit net royalty calculations would render the royalty provisions of the Amended Lease superfluous. (Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 27). The Court must \"generally seek to avoid interpreting contracts to contain superfluous words.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (citing\n   <em>\n    Filicky v.

Furthermore, when interpreting a contract:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   courts should give effect, if possible, to every provision therein contained, and if one construction of a doubtful condition written in a contract would make that condition meaningless, and it is possible to give another construction that would give it meaning and purpose, then the latter construction\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   obtain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (Pls.'

In Plaintiffs' view, the original lease clearly called for a net royalty calculation-permitting Defendant to deduct the costs of processing raw materials into marketable product. (Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 28). Because the Amended Lease \"supplanted and drastically modified\" the original lease, Plaintiffs contend the amendments converted a net royalty lease to a gross royalty lease.

Interpretation of Paragraph (d)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendant's reading of paragraph (d).

Yet the parties disagree on the meaning of the phrase \"consideration paid to Lessee.\" Defendant again invokes the ordinary meaning of \"consideration,\" citing the Merriam Webster Dictionary. (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 7). Furthermore, Defendant argues the \"[r]eceipt of money for the sale of processed gas fits squarely with the ordinary meaning of the word 'paid.' \" (Def.'s Opp'n at 7).

By including subparagraphs (d)(i-iv) as exceptions to the general rule, the drafters highlighted these provisions as distinct or only applicable in certain circumstances. Plaintiffs' legal definition of \"consideration\" is well taken. However, construing \"consideration paid\" as both the price of the raw materials and the value of the processing services would erase any meaningful distinction between paragraph (d) and subparagraph (d)(i). The Court has already acknowledged \"total consideration\" to mean the entire benefit\n   to the promise or detriment to the promisor (i.e., monetary and otherwise). Subparagraph (d)(i) is reasonably interpreted as an exception to this general rule where Defendant sells the raw wellhead product to a third-party processor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs' contention that subparagraph (d)(i) merely refers to the timing of royalty calculations is not well taken. On the face of its language, subparagraph (d)(i) has nothing to do with timing. If, as Plaintiffs assert, subparagraph (d)(i) means that royalties should be calculated after processing but without cost deductions, then paragraph (d) would be sufficient. If the drafters intended that royalties be calculated for wet gas and liquefiable hydrocarbons separately, again without cost deductions, then paragraph (d) would still be sufficient. As indicated in its Opposition, Defendant \"does not dispute that Plaintiffs are entitled to a royalty from the sale of all produced hydrocarbons, whether the gas is sold as a raw wellhead product or after processing into constituent parts.\" (Def.'s Opp'n at 4). Because royalty calculations on constituent parts are already required by paragraphs (a) and (b), \"there would be no reason to repeat the same requirements\" in subparagraph (d)(i). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Moreover, by characterizing subparagraph (d)(i) as merely providing \"the option to process the 'wet gas' into 'dry gas' prior to sale,\" Plaintiffs undercut their own argument regarding paragraph (e). (Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 23). Plaintiffs contend paragraph (e) requires Defendant to place oil, gas, and liquefiable hydrocarbons into marketable form prior to sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). In addition, Plaintiffs argue that dry gas and separated hydrocarbons must be processed before they are in marketable condition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Accordingly, Plaintiffs' assertion that subparagraph (d)(i) \"gives Eclipse the ability to process\" raw wellhead product contradicts its position that paragraph (e) mandates processing. In order to harmonize all provisions of the Amended Lease, the Court must not construe subparagraph (d)(i) as inconsistent with paragraph (e) if another reasonable interpretation exists.\n   <em>\n    Cameron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231484\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/974/1042/#p1054\">\n    974 F.Supp.2d at 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Finally, Defendant's reliance on the ordinary meaning of the word \"paid\" is well taken. True, \"consideration\" should be accorded its legal meaning.\n   <em>\n    Moran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5649635\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/90/492/#p497\">\n    90 U.S. at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the word \"paid\" is not a term of art and should be given its ordinary meaning.\n   <em>\n    Sunoco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4113854\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/129/397/#p405\">\n    129 Ohio St.3d at 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=953%20N.E.2d%20285\">\n    953 N.E.2d 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant cites Merriam Webster's Dictionary, which defines the root word \"pay\" as: \"to make due return to for services rendered or property delivered; to engage for money; to give in return for goods or service; to discharged indebtedness; to make a disposal or transfer (of money).\" (Def.'s Opp'n at 6). Defendant argues the receipt of services does not traditionally fall within the ordinary meaning of \"paid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Rather, payment in the form of services is typically agreed upon between the parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Consequently, Defendant suggests the words \"consideration paid\" solely refers to a monetary payment for the sale of raw wellhead materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court agrees. By modifying the term \"consideration\" with the adjective \"paid,\" the drafters indicated that \"consideration paid\" should be construed differently than \"total consideration.\" Had the parties intended \"paid\" to include the value of processing services, subparagraph (d)(i) would have said so. Furthermore, the Court agrees with Defendant that the drafters \"would presumably have identified a methodology to monetize the value of those services\" in the Amended Lease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). They did not. Taking into account the four corners of the Amended Lease, the Court interprets subparagraph\n   (d)(i) to be an exception to the calculation of royalties based on gross proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiffs' arguments regarding subparagraphs (d)(ii-iii) are also unpersuasive. In fact, both provisions support Defendant's reading of paragraph (d). By shielding Plaintiffs from price manipulation caused by Defendant's decision to process wet gas at its own facility, subparagraph (d)(ii) acknowledges that Defendant is expected to deduct the costs of processing from its royalty calculations. If Defendant could not deduct these processing costs, then Plaintiffs would not be vulnerable to price manipulation in processing. A royalty calculation based on gross proceeds is unaffected by processing costs. However, a royalty calculation based on net proceeds could be manipulated down by unreasonably high processing cost deductions. The same logic applies to subparagraph (d)(iii), which protects Plaintiffs' royalties from losses incurred by Defendant's poor processing decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Consequently, the Court finds no ambiguity in subparagraphs (d)(i-iii). Giving effect to all provisions of the Amended Lease, Defendant's position is the only reasonable interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Interpretation of Paragraph (e)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Next, the Court considers whether paragraph (e) is ambiguous. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , paragraph (e) reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (e)\n   <em>\n    Costs of Production\n   </em>\n   . Lessee shall place oil and gas produced from the leased Premises in marketable condition and shall market same as agent for Lessor.\n   <strong>\n    Except as expressly provided in (d) above,\n   </strong>\n   Lessor's royalty shall not be charged directly or indirectly with any expense require to make gas marketable, including but not limited to the following: Expenses of production, gathering, dehydration, compression, manufacturing, processing, treating, transporting or marketing of gas, oil, or any liquefiable hydrocarbons extracted therefrom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   (Exhibit D &amp; F \u00b6 (e) ) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In their Opposition, Plaintiffs argue the language of paragraph (d)(i) \"can hardly be said to be an 'expressly provided for' exception to the default rule.\" (Pls.' Opp'n at 6). Plaintiffs continue by stating their interpretation does not ignore the exception to paragraph (e). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that subparagraph (d)(iv) is the only provision in paragraph (d) which \"expressly provides for\" the deduction of processing costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). According to Plaintiffs, this (d)(iv) exception is the language referenced in paragraph (e)-rendering each provision of paragraphs (d) and (e) meaningful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Defendant rejects this argument, contending that Plaintiffs' interpretation creates unnecessary inconsistency and renders subparagraphs (d)(i-iii) superfluous. (Def.'s Opp'n at 4). Thus, Defendant suggests \"[p]aragraph (d) and its subparagraphs simply identify a list of circumstances that serve as exceptions to the prohibition in paragraph (e) against charging the costs of processing against the lessor's royalty.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   This Court agrees. If the exception language in paragraph (e) only references a single exception in subparagraph (d)(iv), then subparagraphs (d)(i-iii) are meaningless. Such an interpretation ignores the fact that \"the meaning of a contract is to be gathered from a consideration of all its parts.\"\n   <em>\n    Karabin v. State Automobile Mutual Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1815410\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/10/163/#p167\">\n    10 Ohio St.3d 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 167,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=462%20N.E.2d%20403\">\n    462 N.E.2d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). In addition, paragraph (d) expressly identifies subparagraphs (d)(i-iv) as exceptions to the rule against net royalty calculations by stating: \"\n   <strong>\n    with the following excep\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    tions\n   </strong>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   plural. (Exhibit D &amp; F \u00b6 (d) ) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Subparagraphs (d)(i-iii) all begin with the word \"if,\" indicating that each romanette provides an exception to gross royalty calculations in a specific circumstance. Romanette (i) expressly provides for net royalty calculation by stating that, if the extracted gas is processed, \"Lessor's royalty shall be calculated based upon the consideration paid to Lessee from Lessee's sale of such liquefiable hydrocarbons and residue gas.\" (Exhibit D &amp; F \u00b6 (d)(i) ). Romanettes (ii) and (iii) expressly provide that, if the extracted gas is processed, royalty calculations will never be arbitrarily lowered by an interested processor or a poor processing decision. (Exhibit D &amp; F \u00b6 (d)(ii-iii) ). Because all three provisions highlight a specific circumstance in which gross proceed royalty calculations will not apply, they expressly provide for exceptions to paragraph (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Accordingly, paragraph (e) is unambiguous. Because Plaintiffs' reading renders several provisions superfluous, Defendant's reading is the only reasonable interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Effect of Royalty Provisions in Original Lease\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiffs further contend the drafters' intent regarding the Amended Lease may be gleaned by examining the original lease. (Pls.' Reply at 11). Plaintiffs cite portions of the original lease (Exhibit A), where the royalty provisions expressly provided for net royalty calculations. (Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 27-28). According to Plaintiffs, the lease amendments \"supplanted and drastically modified the original royalty provision of the Lease as Amended, converting the Lease from a net royalty lease to a gross royalty lease.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28). In their view, ignoring these changes would render the amendment to the royalty provision superfluous. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendant argues the amendments did not convert the lease from a \"net royalty\" to a \"gross royalty\" lease because the Amended Lease does not require gross royalty calculations in every circumstance (i.e., exceptions in subparagraphs (d)(i-iv) ). (Def.'s Opp'n at 11). Moreover, Defendant characterizes Plaintiffs' argument as \"untenable\" because the 2014 amendments altered the original lease in multiple ways. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In addition to revising the royalty provisions, the lease amendments extended the primary lease term and added 13 additional sections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For purposes of resolving the present dispute, the Court declines to consider the royalty provisions of the original lease.

Here, the royalty provisions of the Amended Lease are unambiguous. Moreover, the lease amendments contain the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   If any of the above stated provisions in this Amendment conflict with or are inconsistent with the printed provisions or terms of the Lease, the above stated provisions in this Amendment shall control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   (Exhibit D &amp; F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Accordingly, the royalty provisions in the Shanesville and Graber Amendments reflect the parties' final and complete agreement regarding the calculation\n   of royalties. Under the parol evidence rule, \"absent fraud, mistake, or other invalidating cause, the parties' final written integration of their agreement may not be varied, contradicted or supplemented by evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements, or prior written agreements.\"\n   <em>\n    Glazer v.

Because the amended royalty provisions supersede any past agreements, the royalty provisions in the original lease are properly excluded as parol evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Implied Covenants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Finally, the Court declines to analyze Plaintiffs' arguments regarding implied covenants at this stage. Although several implied covenants apply in the context of oil and gas leases, these covenants do not alter the Amended Lease's express terms. Since the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment seeking a declaration of the proper calculation of royalties, the Court will not conduct analysis beyond the four corners of the Amended Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Pursuant to the general rule in paragraph (e), the Court finds that royalties are calculated using gross proceeds under the terms of the Amended Lease. However, where gas is processed for the recovery of liquefiable hydrocarbon products prior to sale, production costs are deductible under subparagraph (d)(i). Consequently, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 20) and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 22) in accordance with this Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Plaintiffs identify Defendant as the successor in interest to Chesapeake, CHK, and Total under the Amended Lease. (Pl.'s Compl. \u00b6 3). Defendant does not dispute it is bound by \"an oil and gas lease and a lease amendment between the parties.\" (Def's Mot. for Summ. J. at 1, ECF No. 21). Moreover, Defendant admits it extracts raw oil and natural gas from Plaintiffs' leased premises. (Defs.' Answer \u00b6 20, ECF No. 14).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
