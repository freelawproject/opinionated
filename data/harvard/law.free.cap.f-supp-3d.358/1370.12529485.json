Were Tos\u00e7elik Companies' sales made on a f.o.b. basis, the Department would be required to adjust those prices under its regulations to achieve an apples-to-apples comparison with its purchased HRS prices. As such, even if we were to find that the Tos\u00e7elik Companies' proposed benchmark was permissible under 19 CFR 351.511(a)(2)(i), we would lack the information required to ensure a comparable benchmark, as required under 19 CFR 351.511(a)(iv). Thus, we find that the benchmark proposed by the Tos\u00e7elik Companies-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the prices at which the Tos\u00e7elik Companies sold HRS to other private parties-is not a viable benchmark on this record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Decision Memorandum\n   </em>\n   at 15-16. Tos\u00e7elik challenges as unreasonable Commerce's finding that Tos\u00e7elik's HRS sales data do not specify delivery terms (whether they are on a delivered or free on board (\"FOB\") basis). Tos\u00e7elik Br. at 6-8. Tos\u00e7elik argues that its domestic sales of HRS were made on a delivered basis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C994\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Tos\u00e7elik references a worksheet as support, which has three separate columns-one for total weight, one for total value, and one for freight-adjusted value.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C994\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Tos\u00e7elik Sales Worksheet, CD\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   193). According to Tos\u00e7elik the presence of the freight-adjusted column confirms that its domestic sales were made on a delivered basis. Tos\u00e7elik Br. at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant has a compelling counter-argument. Defendant explains that Tos\u00e7elik confirmed that it made some export sales on an FOB basis, and that Tos\u00e7elik reported its export sales in the same format as its domestic sales-one column for total weight, one column for total value, and one for freight-adjusted value-meaning the presence of the freight-adjusted column does not itself confirm Tos\u00e7elik's delivery terms as Tos\u00e7elik argues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp at 10. (citing Tos\u00e7elik's Case Brief and Tos\u00e7elik Sales Worksheet).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In its reply brief Tos\u00e7elik acknowledges the weakness of its argument by attempting to introduce a\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   fact that it failed to establish on the administrative record: an alleged \"common practice in the Turkish domestic market\" of making sales on a delivered basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tos\u00e7elik Reply at 12. One might infer such a general practice from the limited number of Turkish HRS transactions with clear delivery terms on the administrative record: (1) Tos\u00e7elik's purchases of HRS from Erdemir are on a delivered basis, (2) Tos\u00e7elik's purchases of\n   HRS from other Turkish producers are on a delivered basis, and (3) Tos\u00e7elik's imports of HRS are on a delivered basis. The administrative record, however, does not mandate such an inference, especially because Tos\u00e7elik never informed Commerce of the practice. All that a reasonable mind may definitively conclude from the administrative record is that Tos\u00e7elik's\n   <em>\n    purchases\n   </em>\n   of HRS identify delivery terms whereas Tos\u00e7elik's\n   <em>\n    sales\n   </em>\n   of HRS do not. It was therefore reasonable, if not correct, for Commerce to conclude that it could not determine the delivery terms of Tos\u00e7elik's\n   <em>\n    sales\n   </em>\n   of HRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Tos\u00e7elik's Purchases of HRS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Tos\u00e7elik argues that Commerce should have excluded from its benchmark calculation certain purchases of HRS that involved a distinct grade of allegedly non-comparable HRS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tos\u00e7elik Br. at 10-19. Tos\u00e7elik though did not record the grade of its HRS purchases, and had to acknowledge in its administrative case brief that in another proceeding,\n   <em>\n    OCTG from Turkey\n   </em>\n   , Commerce did not consider steel grades in its benchmark analysis because the record did not reflect the grades purchased or the grades in the dataset used for the benchmark.\n   <em>\n    Decision Memorandum\n   </em>\n   at 17 (summarizing Tos\u00e7elik's arguments in its case brief). Without direct evidence of the grade of its HRS purchases, Tos\u00e7elik had to rely on indirect evidence to try and establish that some of its HRS purchases were an alleged non-comparable grade for the benchmark. Tos\u00e7elik tried to argue that the alleged grade difference is revealed through (1) disparate pricing within the benchmark database (a higher price and a lower price), and (2) the fact that Tos\u00e7elik, as supplier to a major pipeline project, was buying large volumes of higher priced HRS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C994\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Tos\u00e7elik offered an interpretation of its product catalog from which one might infer the grade differences of its HRS purchases. Commerce was not persuaded and did not exclude the HRS purchases from its benchmark calculation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C994\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C994\">\n    at 17-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Not much need be said here other than that the court does not believe the administrative record requires a reasonable mind to draw Tos\u00e7elik's hoped-for inference about the non-comparability of its HRS purchases. Tos\u00e7elik implicitly concedes the weakness of its opening brief arguments by yet again raising a\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   argument in its reply brief-that Commerce made a similar exclusion for another respondent. Tos\u00e7elik Reply at 7-11. Leaving aside the problems of raising arguments for the first time in one's reply brief, the court notes that Tos\u00e7elik's argument about the other respondent does not have Tos\u00e7elik's intended persuasive effect, quite the opposite. Rather than demonstrating alleged arbitrary treatment of similarly situated parties, Tos\u00e7elik instead highlights that the other respondent made a more rigorous and persuasive evidentiary proffer, which earned that other respondent the exclusion of certain noncomparable purchases of HRS from the benchmark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C994\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The good news for Tos\u00e7elik is it now has an approach that it can emulate to better develop the administrative record for future administrative reviews. As for the instant review, the court sustains as reasonable Commerce's treatment of Tos\u00e7elik's HRS purchases in the benchmark calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Erbosan's No Shipment Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Erbosan challenges Commerce's denial of its no shipment certification. Commerce denied the no shipment certification based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") information demonstrating that Erbosan's subject merchandise entered the United States during the\n   POR. The record confirms this fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. at 26 (citing record evidence of entries of Erbosan's subject merchandise). Erbosan argued in its administrative case brief that other than a test shipment, \"[i]t made no other shipment itself, and it does not know or have reason to know that any of its domestic or third country customers of subject merchandise subsequently exported or resold Erbosan's merchandise to the United States during the POR. Its understanding is that no such transshipments were made.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Erbosan Administrative Case Brief at 4, CD 219. The POR entries of Erbosan's subject merchandise appear to involve exportation to the United States by a third country purchaser of Erbosan's merchandise. In any event, Commerce did not address Erbosan's contention that it did not know or have reason to know of any transshipments of its subject merchandise to the United States during the POR. Commerce simply concluded \"that record evidence contradicts Erbosan's assertions of no shipments, and demonstrates that subject merchandise produced by Erbosan entered the United States during the POR.\"\n   <em>\n    Decision Memorandum\n   </em>\n   at 19. The statute requires Commerce to provide \"an explanation of the basis for its determination that addresses relevant arguments made by interested parties.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f(i)(3)(A). The court might infer from Commerce's decision that Erbosan's knowledge (actual or constructive) about any transshipments is simply irrelevant in the CVD context. The Government argues as much in its brief. Def.'s Resp. at 34-35. Erbosan counters that its knowledge matters. Erbosan Reply at 9-12. Commerce should address this issue in the first instance prior to consideration by the court. The court will therefore remand this issue to Commerce to address whether Erbosan's knowledge of U.S. entries of its subject merchandise is relevant in the CVD context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
