Pub. L. 94-210,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Stat.%2031\">\n    90 Stat. 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The case comes to the Court on cross-motions for summary judgment. In his Findings and Recommendation (F &amp; R), United States Magistrate Judge John Jelderks recommended granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant. For the reasons that follow, the Court declines to adopt the F &amp; R and instead grants BNSF's motion for summary judgment and denies Defendants' cross-motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Subsection (b)(4) of the 4-R Act prohibits states from imposing a tax on railroads \"that discriminates against a rail carrier.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4). BNSF contends that the State of Oregon has violated this provision. BNSF seeks a permanent injunction, preventing Oregon from taxing BNSF in violation of the 4-R Act, as well as declaratory relief. Defendants argue that Oregon's tax comports fully with subsection (b)(4) of the 4-R Act because a\n   property tax is not \"another tax\" within the meaning of the 4-R Act and because the United States Supreme Court has determined that Congress did not intend to prohibit states from granting property tax exemptions to non-rail entities while not exempting rail entities.

Only two hundred sixty-six of those miles of track, however, run through Oregon. In 2010, Berkshire Hathaway acquired all of the outstanding shares of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. After the acquisition, the company was renamed Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC, and Plaintiff BNSF became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC. As is common in corporate acquisitions, Berkshire Hathaway purchased BNSF for more than its book value. The difference between book value and purchase price is commonly referred to as \"accounting goodwill.\" More than $ 14 billion dollars of accounting goodwill was recorded as an asset on Berkshire Hathaway's balance sheet as a result of its acquisition of BNSF. Oregon law considers goodwill to be a form of intangible personal property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Admin.%20R.%20150\">\n    Or.

In 2015, however, Oregon began to include this goodwill in its calculation of BNSF's RMV. Because BNSF's MAV was calculated without including goodwill, it was the lesser of the two as between RMV and MAV. In 2015, therefore, BNSF was not required to pay taxes on the goodwill. In 2016, Oregon again included the goodwill in BNSF's RMV but not its MAV, and thus BNSF was not required to pay taxes on the goodwill. In 2017, however, Oregon for the first time included goodwill in its calculation of both MAV and RMV. In addition to the intangible personal property consisting of goodwill, Oregon also included more than $ 600 million of other forms of intangible personal property, including franchise and customer assets. As a result of the inclusion of this intangible personal property in BNSF's tax assessment in 2017, BNSF's MAV was approximately 30 percent higher than it had been in years past. Historically, BNSF had typically paid between $ 1.5 and $ 2.1 million in Oregon property taxes. In 2017, BNSF's tax bill was $ 2.9 million. According to BNSF, the inclusion of intangible personal property has inflated its tax bill by more than $ 600,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In October 2017, BNSF sued the Oregon Department of Revenue, alleging that Oregon has singled out and targeted BNSF and other railroad companies for disfavored treatment in violation of the 4-R Act.

Because Congress enumerated three specific prohibited property tax practices in subsections (b)(1)-(3), Defendants argue, subsection (b)(4) should not be read to permit challenges to property taxes at all, and therefore no challenges to property taxes-no matter how discriminatory-can be brought under subsection (b)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Each side's argument turns on the Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    ACF.\n   </em>\n   In that case, as here, there was a challenge to a specific portion of Oregon's tax law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    ACF\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs-companies that leased railroad cars to railroads and shippers-challenged Oregon's tax exemptions for some classes of tangible property (for example, agricultural machinery and equipment, livestock, and poultry) but not for railroad cars.

The Court made clear that the 4-R Act was not violated simply because some taxpayers received an exemption that railroads did not also receive. By adopting a comparison class of \"taxed property\" in subsections (b)(1)-(3), the Supreme Court explained, Congress in the 4-R Act implicitly contemplated that some property would be tax-exempt. Further, if subsections (b)(1)-(3) expressly permit some property tax exemptions, it would be illogical to conclude that they were prohibited by subsection (b)(4). In reaching this ruling, the Supreme Court reviewed the importance of tax exemptions in state tax policy and found that principles of federalism directed that the 4-R Act did not deprive the states from using this important tool of tax policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232363\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/332/#p336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232363\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/332/#p336\">\n    at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232363\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/332/#p336\">\n    114 S.Ct. 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Supreme Court also noted that\n   <em>\n    ACF\n   </em>\n   was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   not a case in which the railroads-either alone or as part of some isolated and\n   targeted group-are the only commercial entities subject to an ad valorem property tax.

In addition, Oregon relies on a Seventh Circuit case\n   that shares some of the same characteristics of the cases from the Eighth and Tenth Circuits but resulted in a favorable ruling for Wisconsin.

The granting of exemptions from a generally applicable tax is not what this case is about. BNSF is not challenging an exemption from a generally applicable tax. Instead, BNSF is challenging a tax that, in actuality, is levied on only a small category of businesses, including railroads. To view the tax on intangible personal property as a form of tax exemption requires an unnatural reading of Oregon's tax laws. Unlike the tax on the tangible personal property (the railroad cars) owned by the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    ACF\n   </em>\n   , Oregon does not even impose a generally applicable tax on intangible personal property. Thus, this case more closely resembles the trio of\n   <em>\n    Bair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Huddleston\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Ogilvie\n   </em>\n   , than\n   <em>\n    ACF.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Ultimately, whether Oregon's tax on intangible personal property is characterized as a generally applicable tax from which all taxpayers other than centrally assessed taxpayers are exempt or as a tax that is only levied on centrally assessed taxpayers might, however, be a distinction without a difference. Even if the Court were to accept Defendants' characterization of the tax as an exemption from a generally applicable\n   ad valorem property tax, that characterization alone would not immunize the tax from challenge under subsection (b)(4). Congress passed the 4-R Act to restore the financial stability of the United States' railway system and protect railways from being \"easy prey for state and local tax assessors.\"\n   <em>\n    W.

These words, when read in isolation, appear at first glance to support Defendants' position that property taxes, no matter how discriminatory, cannot be challenged under subsection (b)(4). This conclusion, however, fails for at least two reasons. First, in\n   <em>\n    CSX I\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that granting exemptions from a generally applicable sales and use tax to some entities, but not giving those same exemptions to railroads, could be a variant of tax discrimination prohibited by subsection (b)(4). This was the same practice that, in the property tax context,\n   <em>\n    ACF\n   </em>\n   had allowed. In\n   <em>\n    CSX I\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court clarified that\n   <em>\n    ACF\n   </em>\n   reached the outcome that it did because \"[e]ven assuming property tax exemptions 'discriminate[d],' they did so in a way that the specific provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 11501(b)(1)-(3) allow.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457249,5936238\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/277/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457249,5936238\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/277/\">\n    at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457249,5936238\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/277/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    CSX I\n   </em>\n   explained that\n   <em>\n    ACF\n   </em>\n   's holding was based on the structure of subsections (b)(1)-(3), not on the meaning of the term \"discriminate.\" Because the Court stated in\n   <em>\n    CSX I\n   </em>\n   that all tax exemptions are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   discriminatory, property tax exemptions, even those approved under subsections (b)(1)-(3), are still a type of tax discrimination. When\n   <em>\n    CSX I\n   </em>\n   referred to property tax exemptions as a variant of tax discrimination that falls outside the reach of subsection (b)(4), it did not mean that property tax exemptions could never be discriminatory. The Supreme Court only clarified that subsections (b)(1)-(3) specifically allowed some forms of discrimination, and what is allowed under subsections (b)(1)-(3) cannot be prohibited by subsection (b)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    ACF\n   </em>\n   stated that the kind of tax at issue here, where railroads, as part of a targeted or isolated group, are the only ones subject to an ad valorem property tax, would not be properly considered a tax \"exemption\" in the first place.\n   <em>\n    ACF\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232363\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/332/#p336\">\n    510 U.S. at 346-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"232363\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/332/#p336\">\n    114 S.Ct. 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, the relevant questions are whether under Oregon law railroads are treated differently than other commercial and industrial taxpayers and, if so, whether Oregon has provided a justification for that difference in treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CSX I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457249,5936238\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/277/\">\n    562 U.S. at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457249,5936238\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/277/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants concede that non-centrally assessed commercial and industrial taxpayers, such as Nike and Precision Castparts, own vast amounts of intangible personal property but are not required to pay taxes on that property. Further, Defendants do not dispute that railroads are treated differently than other taxpayers. Instead, Defendants argue that this differential treatment is due to the valuation challenges presented by the multi-state nature of centrally assessed companies. Defendants argue that differences in local assessment and central assessment of property, along with the overlay of Article XI, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, \"confute plaintiff's argument that discrimination exists.\" Defendants explain that, for centrally assessed properties, property taxes are assessed on \"an allocated unit valuation of a group of assets as 'one property' without reference to the individual value of the component parts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants, however, do not provide a justification for differences in treatment. Although Defendants appear to argue that it is difficult to disentangle the values of real property, tangible property, and intangible property for multi-state companies (and, thus, easier simply to count the value of all the property as one lump sum), Oregon also is capable of exempting certain classes of intangible property owned by centrally assessed companies from taxation. For example, even for centrally assessed\n   taxpayers, property \"[d]oes not include items of intangible property that represent: ... [c]laims on other property, including money at interest, bonds, notes, claims, demands or any other evidence of indebtedness, secured or unsecured ... [a]ny shares of stock in corporations, joint stock companies or associations.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20308.505\">\n    Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 308.505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14)(c). Because Oregon is capable of distinguishing between intangible property in the form of goodwill or software from intangible property in the form of bonds, notes, and stock, Oregon's argument that it is \"too difficult\" to distinguish between the component parts of property owned by centrally assessed taxpayers is not persuasive. Further, Defendants do not explain why it is more difficult to distinguish tangible and intangible personal property for centrally assessed businesses like BNSF than for businesses not subject to central assessment, such as Nike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Supreme Court has recognized at least one acceptable justification for different treatment of railroads.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CSX II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587011\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1136/#p1141\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A tax is not discriminatory under subsection (b)(4), even if it is levied only on railroads, if non-railroad entities must pay another comparable tax from which the rail carrier is exempt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587011\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1136/#p1141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants, however, do not argue that Oregon's different treatment of railroads is justified because non-centrally assessed taxpayers must pay another tax from which centrally assessed taxpayers are exempt. Defendants also do not argue in their briefing that there are any genuine issues of material fact over its tax treatment of railroads as compared to other commercial and industrial taxpayers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendants also argue that Oregon's tax scheme is justified because of its longstanding historical pedigree. This argument is unpersuasive: Discrimination has never been allowed simply because it is longstanding. Further, the 4-R Act was enacted expressly to prohibit discriminatory tax practices by states. Thus, the fact that Oregon's tax practice pre-dates the 4-R Act is not persuasive evidence that the practice does not violate the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W. Air Lines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131183\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/123/#p131\">\n    480 U.S. at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131183\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/123/#p131\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, for the first time at oral argument, Defendants argued that the factual record should be further developed to determine whether the group of centrally assessed taxpayers was truly isolated and targeted. Defendants assert that this group includes several politically powerful companies in the State, such as Comcast and AT &amp; T. Arguments raised for the first time at oral argument are generally considered waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Pac.

Even if the Court were to entertain the argument that railroads in Oregon are not part of an isolated and targeted group because several other businesses are included in the group of centrally assessed taxpayers, Defendants' argument would fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Only 14 types of entities are subject to central assessment, and nearly half of those entities are involved in the railroad industry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20308.515\">\n    Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 308.515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statute specifically calls out the rail industry\n   by name in six of the fourteen types of industries subject to the tax, which also includes air transportation, communication, heating, gas, electricity, pipelines, and toll bridges.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20308.515\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Other courts have concluded that a group including railroads, airlines, utilities, and telecommunications companies was a sufficiently isolated and targeted group to fall within the exception outlined in\n   <em>\n    ACF. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huddleston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11345819\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/1413/#p1417\">\n    94 F.3d at 1414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (group included railroad, airline, electric, telephone, telegraph, gas, domestic water, pipeline, coal slurry, and private rail companies);\n   <em>\n    Bair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12038663\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/60/410/#p411\">\n    60 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   411 n.2 (group included public utilities, telephone and telegraph companies, railroads, express companies, electric companies and pipeline companies);\n   <em>\n    Ogilvie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7838843\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/893/882/#p886\">\n    893 F.Supp. at 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (group included railroad companies, airlines, telecommunications and mobile radio communications companies, electric and gas distribution companies, and pipeline companies). Even in 1995 and 1996, when\n   <em>\n    Bair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ogilvie\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Huddleston\n   </em>\n   were decided, telecommunications companies, pipelines, airlines, and utilities were large and politically powerful companies. None of those courts found that the inclusion of a few powerful companies in the disfavored group mitigated the discriminatory structure of the tax. Because the Oregon tax statute here, just like the statutes at issue in\n   <em>\n    Bair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Huddleston\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Ogilvie\n   </em>\n   , singles out railroads as part of a small group for different and unfavorable tax treatment as compared to all other commercial and industrial taxpayers, the conclusion does not follow that the statute does not target railroads for disfavored treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   It is irrelevant whether a group of centrally assessed taxpayers includes some large companies because the relevant comparison class is all commercial and industrial taxpayers. The question is not whether BNSF is treated differently than other centrally assessed taxpayers, but rather whether railroads generally are treated worse than other commercial and industrial taxpayers. Other commercial and industrial taxpayers own vast amounts of intangible personal property and do not pay taxes on that property, and Oregon imposes no equivalent tax on non-centrally assessed taxpayers that would justify this disparate treatment. This constitutes discrimination against railroads that is prohibited by the 4-R Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CSX II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587011\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1136/#p1141\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further,\n   <em>\n    throughout\n   </em>\n   their briefs, Defendants argued that there were no material facts in dispute. At oral argument, Defendants asserted for the first time that the factual record needs further development. Defendants' assertion is untimely. In addition, Defendants have not identified any specific material factual dispute regarding what Defendants concede are differences between the taxation of centrally assessed taxpayers, including railroads, and the taxation of other commercial and industrial taxpayers. Accordingly, under \u00a7 11501(c) of the 4-R Act, Oregon is enjoined from taxing the intangible personal property of railroads as it currently does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court declines to adopt the F &amp; R (ECF 35) and instead grants BNSF's motion for summary judgment (ECF 19) and denies Defendants' cross-motion (ECF 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Defendants also argue that because an unrelated portion of Oregon's tax law was at issue in\n    <em>\n     ACF\n    </em>\n    , the Court should infer that the Supreme Court approved the entirety of Oregon's property tax scheme. Defendants base this argument in part on the fact that a footnote in ACF's brief before the Supreme Court mentioned that Oregon did not tax intangible personal property of most taxpayers. This argument is not persuasive. An issue not actually litigated by the parties should not be presumed to have been decided by a court's silence on that issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Defendants argue that this dicta from\n    <em>\n     ACF\n    </em>\n    referred only to occupation taxes because\n    <em>\n     ACF\n    </em>\n    cited a case dealing with occupation taxes.

Further, Defendants' assertion that this dicta was intended to suggest that an ad valorem property tax that applied only to railroads might be discriminatory not under subsection (b)(4) but under subsection (b)(1) is belied by the fact that that Court expressly refers to subsection (b)(4) in its example.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    At oral argument, Defendants asserted that BNSF specifically had not been treated unfavorably by the Oregon tax scheme because BNSF has benefitted disproportionately from Oregon's Measure 50 and is assessed at slightly more than 80 percent of its real market value, while some railroad companies are paying tax on the full amount of their real market value. The 4-R Act, however, prohibits discriminatory taxes on railroads generally, and a challenge to a discriminatory tax scheme cannot fail simply because one particular railroad that is subject to one discriminatory tax also receives an unrelated tax benefit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
