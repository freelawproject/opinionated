Hanford Holdings LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 16 Civ. 4270,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203471809\">\n    2018 WL 3471809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2018) (hereafter, \"June 28 Order,\" Dkt. No. 76). Upon further review of the record, the Court now raises concerns about whether it possessed subject matter jurisdiction over those\n   third-party cross claims at issue in the June 28 Order. Accordingly, the Court directs the parties to (1) show cause why the Court should not vacate its June 28 Order in part; and (2) address whether such vacatur impacts the Court's supplemental jurisdiction over other cross-claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of this action are recounted in the Court's June 28 Order, and the parties' familiarity with those facts is assumed. In short, Plaintiff Rocky Aspen Management 204 LLC (\"RAM 204\") commenced this action against Hanford Holdings, LLC (\"Hanford\") seeking a declaratory judgment determining that RAM 204 owns the majority of membership interests in Rocky Aspen LLC, a Colorado limited liability company. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 1; \"First Amended Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 15; \"Second Amended Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 53.) Each of these complaints declares that the Court has jurisdiction over this civil action based on the parties' diversity of citizenship pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Second Amended Complaint 18.) RAM 204 is alleged to be a citizen of the states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida and Colorado. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Hanford is alleged to be a citizen of the state of California and the Cayman Islands. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hanford's answer to the First Amended Complaint included counterclaims against RAM 204, as well as claims against two groups of third-party impleaded defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Answer and Third-Party Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 23.) One group consists of Jeffrey Citron, Stephen Goglia, Mark Hamwi, and Watershed Ventures LLC (collectively, and together with RAM 204, the \"Watershed Defendants\"). The other group consists of Patrick McGrath, AH DB Kitchen Aspen Investors LLC (\"AH DB\"), Castlegrace Equity Investors LLC (\"Castlegrace\"), and Aristone Hospitality LLC (\"Aristone,\" and collectively, the \"Aristone Defendants\"). Among the relevant citizenship allegations, Hanford asserted that AH DB and Castlegrace have principal places of business in New York. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    \u00b6 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) AH DB and Castlegrace subsequently admitted these allegations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 40 \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 14, 2017, the Watershed Defendants filed their answer to Hanford's Third-Party Complaint and alleged three state law cross-claims against the Aristone Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Watershed Cross-claims,\" or \"Cross-claims,\" Dkt. No. 49.) The instant Order concerns the Court's subject matter jurisdiction over those cross-claims. Relevant to the Court's inquiry, the Cross-claims do not distinguish which of the Watershed Defendants the claims are brought on behalf of. Because the Watershed Defendants themselves -- as do the Court and all other parties in the action -- include RAM 204 within the definition of \"Watershed Defendants,\" the Cross-claims are thus presumably brought, in part, on behalf of RAM 204. The Cross-claims include no jurisdictional allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By letter dated March 6, 2017, the Aristone Defendants sought leave to move to dismiss the Watershed Cross-claims pursuant to Rule 12(b) (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\" Rule 12(b)(6)\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"March 6 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 51; \"March 17 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 75 at 1 n.2.) At that time, the Aristone Defendants did not raise any concerns about the Court's subject matter jurisdiction over the Watershed Cross-claims. The Court construed those two letters as a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   June 28 Order at 41-42), and granted it, dismissing all three of the Watershed Cross-claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Finally, the Aristone Defendants recently filed their own cross-claims against the Watershed Defendants, years after Hanford impleaded all the parties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold issue, and courts must evaluate their jurisdiction over every claim, including cross-claims brought by or against impleaded third-parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Republic Ins.

First, the Watershed Cross-claims, all of which assert state law claims, do not invoke federal question jurisdiction. Nor do they invoke diversity of citizenship jurisdiction, because an examination of the parties' citizenship as declared in the pleadings reveals a lack of complete diversity between RAM 204 and the Aristone Defendants. According to the parties' filings, RAM 204 is a citizen of New York, as are at least two of the Aristone Defendants, AH DB and Castlegrace. AH DB or Castlegrace is named in each of the three Watershed Cross-claims, thus destroying complete diversity and divesting the Court of federal subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finding no federal question or diversity of citizenship jurisdiction in this action, the Court evaluates whether it can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Watershed Cross-claims. First, the Court concludes that the Watershed Cross-claims \"form part of the same case or controversy\" as the original action.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Next, however, because this action is predicated on diversity jurisdiction, the Court must apply section 1367(b). Critically, the Court observes that RAM 204 -- the original plaintiff in this action -- is included among the Watershed Defendants bringing claims against the Aristone Defendants. RAM 204's inclusion within the Watershed Defendants transforms the Cross-claims into claims brought by the original plaintiff \"against persons made parties under Rule 14.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The Court is persuaded that the statute compels vacatur of the June 28 Order so as dismiss the Watershed Cross-claims on the basis of absence of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For these reasons, the Court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raises the issue of its subject matter jurisdiction with respect to the Watershed Cross-claims and directs the parties to show cause why the Court should not vacate in part the June 28 Order dismissing\n   the Watershed Cross-claims and simultaneously dismiss the Watershed Cross-claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The parties should bring to the Court's attention any objections, relevant law, or jurisdictional facts that may bear on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Further, the dismissal without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction may enable the Watershed Defendants to raise similar claims in another court of competent jurisdiction. Accordingly, the parties should also address whether the Court should, in its discretion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims in the Aristone Defendants' Third-Party Complaint (Dkt.
