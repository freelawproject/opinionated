According to the Halberts, Credit Suisse and JICS caused them to suffer these losses by manipulating and failing to disclose the published estimates of the XIV's value on and before February 5, 2018.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 41-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Allegedly, Credit Suisse intentionally issued false and misleading offering documents in connection with the XIV ETNs, failed to disclose that it was engaging in activities that inflated their value, failed to update the estimated value of the XIV while its value was dropping, and then ended trading on the XIV in order to realize a profit at investors' expense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 8-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Defendants raise two points in their pending motion. First, they contend that the balance of factors under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) favor a transfer to the S.D.N.Y. Alternatively, they contend that the court\n   should stay this case pending resolution of the New York action based on the first-filed rule. The court addresses each of these contentions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Transfer of Venue Under\n     <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n      28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (a)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Section 1404(a) allows a district court, \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice,\" to \"transfer any civil action to any other district ... where it might have been brought....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). It is undisputed that venue would be proper in the S.D.N.Y.: the alleged violations of federal securities laws occurred in this district, Credit Suisse AG resides in this district, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docs. 45, 24-2; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77v (any civil action under the Securities Act \"may be brought in the district wherein the defendant is found or is an inhabitant or transacts business, or in the district where the offer or sale took place, if the defendant participated therein\"); 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78aa (any civil action under the Exchange Act \"may be brought in the district wherein any act or transaction constituting the violation occurred ... or in the district wherein the defendant is found or is an inhabitant or transacts business\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) (venue is proper in any \"judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred\"). Therefore, the only issue is whether the Defendants have met their burden of showing that the balance of \u00a7 1404(a) factors justifies a transfer in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained below, the Defendants have failed to meet this burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Factors Supporting Transfer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Only three of the relevant factors affirmatively favor transfer: the convenience of the witnesses, the availability of process to compel the attendance of unwilling witnesses, and the location of relevant documents and relative ease of access to sources of proof. More specifically, most of the potential witnesses concerning the allegedly illegal conduct appear to be located either in New York or Darien, Connecticut,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   docs. 24-1 \u00b6\u00b6 4-6; 24-2 \u00b6\u00b6 5-10, and it seems the only potential witnesses in Alabama are the Halberts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   docs. 45; 24-1 \u00b6\u00b6 7-9; 24-2 \u00b6 5. Likewise, as the Defendants note, the location of potential witnesses, which also includes Colorado, likely places them beyond the reach of this court's subpoena power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docs. 24 at 8; 24-1 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10; 24-2; Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c). Furthermore, because the offering documents at issue were prepared in New York, Credit Suisse's only U.S. branch is in New York, and JICS's principal place of business is Darien, Connecticut, the location of relevant documents and access to sources of proof also appears to favor transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docs. 24-1 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6; 24-2 \u00b6\u00b6 5-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Nevertheless, the circumstances of this case mitigate the weight of these factors. For instance, the significance of the convenience of witnesses factor is diminished where, as here, most of the potential witnesses, \"although in another district,\n   are employees of a party and their presence at trial can be obtained by that party.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trinity Christian Ctr. of Santa Ana, Inc. v. New Frontier Media, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181667\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/761/1322/#p1328\">\n    761 F.Supp.2d 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1328-29 (M.D. Fla. 2010) (citation omitted). Furthermore, because the Halberts are willing to travel to New York, Connecticut, and Colorado to depose the Defendants' employees,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   doc. 30 at 11, the convenience of the witnesses does not weigh heavily in favor of transfer. Similarly, the availability of process is of less significance here, where there is no indication the potential witnesses would be unwilling to appear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F.D.I.C. ex rel. Citizens State Bank v. Fedorov\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-20912-Civ.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202110830\">\n    2011 WL 2110830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Fla. May 26, 2011) (finding this factor did not support transfer where \"[n]either of the parties has identified any specific witness who would be unwilling to appear and may require the court's subpoena power.\"). Finally, although many of the relevant documents and other evidence are located in or around New York, this factor is less significant in the absence of any contention by the Defendants that they face substantial difficulty in producing relevant documents and given \"the predominance of electronic discovery in the modern era.\"\n   <em>\n    Weintraub v. Advanced Correctional Healthcare, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4330202\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/161/1272/#p1283\">\n    161 F.Supp.3d 1272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1283 (N.D.

Neutral Factors and Factors Militating Against Transfer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By contrast, the remaining factors are either neutral or militate against transfer. To begin, \"[t]he plaintiff's choice of forum should not be disturbed unless it is clearly outweighed by other considerations,\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. Giarmarco &amp; Bill, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7626199\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/74/253/#p261\">\n    74 F.3d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261 (11th Cir. 1996) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Howell v.

Reyno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/#p266\">\n    454 U.S. 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 266,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/#p266\">\n    102 S.Ct. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/#p266\">\n    70 L.Ed.2d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981) (citation omitted). Next, the presence of six state common law claims and a claim for violations of Alabama's Blue Sky Law, doc. 45 \u00b6\u00b6 67-90, also supports greater deference to the Halberts' choice of forum and disfavors transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trafalgar Capital Specialized Inv. Fund (in Liquidation) v. Hartman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3866877\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/878/1274/#p1290\">\n    878 F.Supp.2d 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1290 (S.D.

Instead, (1) the trading and sales decisions for the alleged securities violations were made by Credit Suisse personnel \"located in or around New York,\" (2) the allegedly fraudulent offering documents and pricing supplement were prepared in New York, (3) substantially all of JICS's employees involved in calculating and updating the XIV ETNs' indicative values were located in Darien, Connecticut, and (4) the Halberts purchased the XIV ETNs, which were available to investors nationwide, in Alabama.

Finally, in light of all of the circumstances in this case, trial efficiency and the interests of justice counsel against transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Therefore, because the Plaintiffs have chosen their home forum, and the Defendants have not shown that the interests of convenience so heavily favor the S.D.N.Y. as to override the Plaintiffs' choice,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7626199\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/74/253/#p261\">\n    74 F.3d at 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the motion to transfer is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The First-Filed Rule\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Defendants also move in the alternative for a stay under the first-filed rule. \"The first-filed rule provides that when parties have instituted competing or parallel litigation in separate courts, the court initially seized of the controversy should hear the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Collegiate Licensing Co. v.

There are also overlapping issues between the New York action and the present case: for instance, both actions assert claims arising under federal securities laws based on alleged misrepresentations in the XIV ETNs' offering documents and alleged losses from declines in value that occurred on February 5, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Doc. 45 \u00b6\u00b6 16-49, 53, 64 with\n   <em>\n    Set Capital LLC et al. v.

Indeed, the Halberts' Amended Complaint expressly incorporates by reference nearly all of the factual allegations from the consolidated New York action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 45 at 2\n   n.1 (incorporating the allegations in paragraphs 1-19 and 50-269 of the amended complaint in the New York action).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   However, \"[a] first-filed analysis looks to the character of the suits and the parties to the suits, not simply to the similarity of issues without regard to the identity of the parties asserting them and their asserted rights as presented in the initial lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Collegiate Licensing Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559977\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/71/#p78\">\n    713 F.3d at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the actions share two overlapping defendants-Credit Suisse AG and JICS-the plaintiffs differ: in this case, the Halberts sue as individuals, whereas the plaintiffs in the New York action seek to represent a class of similarly situated individuals. Even though the putative class in the New York action includes the Halberts, in the absence of certification under Federal Rule 23, the court cannot conclude reasonably that the plaintiffs in the two cases share an identity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

What does have this effect is a class action approved under Rule 23.\"). Applying the first-filed rule at this juncture would not avoid duplicative litigation or \"piecemeal resolution of issues that call for a uniform result.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.

Ala. 2001) (\"A principal concern behind the 'first filed' rule ... is preventing duplication of effort and incompatible rulings.\"). Moreover, if the court in New York ultimately decides against certifying a class, granting a stay in this case would end up causing an unnecessary delay of this case's resolution. And, even if the class is certified, the Halberts may decide to opt out and proceed with their own claims individually,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B), further undermining the contention that the conservation of judicial resources justifies granting the stay. Finally, because the Halberts assert seven claims under Alabama law that are distinct from the New York action, disposition of the New York case on its merits would not necessarily resolve the state law issues in the present case. Thus, the first-filed rule is inapplicable here, where the parties and issues do not sufficiently overlap to justify its application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court finds that neither a transfer of venue nor a stay of the proceedings is warranted in this case.
