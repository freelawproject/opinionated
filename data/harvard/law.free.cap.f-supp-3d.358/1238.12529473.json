JOHNSON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Petitioners Powder River Basin Resource Council (\"PRBRC\") and Western Organization of Resource Councils (\"WORC\") (collectively \"Petitioners\") challenge the decision of the United States Secretary of Interior (\"Secretary\"), the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Management (\"Deputy Secretary\"), the United States Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (\"OSMRE\") (sometimes collectively \"respondents\" or \"federal respondents\") approving a mining plan modification on March 14, 2014 for Peabody Powder River Mining, LLC's (\"Peabody\") North Antelope Rochelle Mine (\"NARM\") in the Powder River Basin (\"PRB\") in Wyoming. The State of Wyoming and Peabody were permitted to intervene in the administrative action (collectively referred to as \"intervenor-respondents\"), also opposing the relief requested by Petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petitioners seek judicial review of the decision approving a mining plan modification under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). Petitioners contend the agency's decision approving the NARM mining plan modification violates the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (\"SMCRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201202\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and does not satisfy the requirements for reclamation set forth in Title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Petitioners contend the agency decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law, in violation of the APA. The respondents and intervenor-respondents assert Petitioners' allegations are overstated and improperly apprehend both SMCRA and the Administrative Record (\"AR\") in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Having reviewed the parties' submissions, all materials in the record, and being fully advised, the Court finds and concludes that the decision recommending approval of the mining plan modification by the Secretary is consistent with and in accordance with applicable law, is supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, and there is no clear error warranting reversal of the Secretary's decision. For the reasons stated more fully below, the Secretary's approval of the mine modification plan is affirmed and the Petition for Review will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background and Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Secretary approved a mining plan modification authorizing a coal mine expansion for Peabody's NARM, one of the largest strip mine operations in the world. The mining plan modification that was approved would expand the size of NARM to approximately 60,000 acres, with over 53,000 surface acres disturbed by mining; approximately half of the disturbed lands are federal public lands. The mining plan increases the public lands available for mining an additional 6,717 acres within NARM, for a total of nearly 30,000 acres of affected federal public land ownership. Petitioners assert that during the 30 years of operation of NARM, no lands or waters of the mine have been permanently reclaimed. None of the federal public lands impacted by NARM operations have been permanently reclaimed, which has resulted in a single use of those federal lands by Peabody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In their petition for review, Petitioners assert that the mining plan modification was authorized \"behind closed doors and without the benefit of public input and participation.\" They further assert that the mining plan modification fails to ensure\n   contemporaneous and timely reclamation of federal public lands and restoration of associated waters by establishing a timetable, measured by bond release, for accomplishment of every major reclamation step and minimizing disturbance to the hydrologic balance. The mining plan amendment exacerbates Peabody's reclamation failures by allowing Peabody to self-bond or provide a \"corporate guarantee.\" Petitioners explain this to mean that Peabody never puts up real money intended to protect the federal resources that are damaged through operations pursuant to the mining plan modification. Thus, there is no real economic incentive for Peabody or the operator to timely or contemporaneously reclaim these public resources. Petitioners also argue that Peabody's ability to self-bond and guarantee successful reclamation is questionable. This is because Peabody has suffered significant losses over a long period of time and its credit rating was downgraded to non-investment grade or junk bond status. Petitioners assert there was a complete failure to consider Peabody's bond status and its ability to self-bond and cover its financial obligations to complete reclamation, while still allowing Peabody to cause additional disturbance of public lands within the mining plan modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The federal respondents have opposed Petitioners' contentions. The process for approving applications for coal leases first comes to the federal agency under the authority of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (\"MLA\"). The first stage in that process requires the Secretary to consider various economic and environmental factors in making decisions regarding applications for federal coal leases. Frequently, this is referred to as the NEPA process. The next step in that process requires the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (\"WDEQ\"), which is the federally approved SMCRA permitting authority,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20950.20\">\n    30 C.F.R. \u00a7 950.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to consider applications for surface mining permits, provide opportunities for public comment, and issue permits and approve proposed mining plans, which includes the requirement to address mining and reclamation requirements of the SMCRA program. WDEQ then forwards to OSMRE for mining plan approval. The third stage of the process requires OSMRE to conduct its own review and make recommendations to the Secretary that the proposed plans for mining federal coal be approved, disapproved, or approved with conditions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ; 30 C.F.R. Part 746. It is the Secretary who makes the final decision on proposed mining plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The first and second stages require public participation; the third stage does not. Petitioner PRBRC participated in the first stage involving the decision to lease the two Wright Area coal lease tracts at issue here, the review process under the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204321\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -4307h. Petitioner WORC did not participate in the first stage where the decision approving leasing of federal coal lands was made. At the second stage, there were four publications in the local press in October 2013 giving notice of the mining permit approval proceedings. Notwithstanding their knowledge of agency procedures providing notice to the public and opportunities to participate and comment, neither of the petitioners in this case did so in that second stage. During the permit approval stage, detailed plans for mining operations and reclamation required by SMCRA are reviewed and assessed. Petitioners offered no comment or input when WDEQ was assessing the permit application and mining plan modification, yet they contend here that the decisions were made behind closed doors and without the opportunity for Petitioners and others to participate and offer input.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As to the third stage of the case, responding to Petitioners' claim that the OSMRE did not provide opportunities for public participation, respondents argue Petitioners have misread the pertinent regulations and applicable law. OSMRE is required to consider comments received during the NEPA and SMCRA permitting processes, but additional formal public comment is not mandated in the third stage. Consequently, the respondents urge that Petitioners do not state a cognizable claim. Respondents also assert that, even if the regulations required public participation, no prejudice was suffered by Petitioners because they were fully aware of the process and the WDEQ/OSMRE proceedings. The remaining claims lack merit because Petitioners have not identified any violation of the SMCRA performance standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The State of Wyoming and Peabody were permitted to intervene as respondents in this action and submitted a joint response brief in opposition to Petitioners' opening brief. Many of the issues raised in the intervenor-respondents' opposition are substantially similar to those advanced by the federal respondents. During the permit approval phase, Petitioners never objected or offered comment that WDEQ, OSMRE or the Secretary violated SMCRA by failing to ensure the mining plan modification meets performance standards for reclaiming federal lands and water resources. Because these comments and arguments were never raised during the pertinent administrative processes, the Intervenor-respondents contend they have been waived and that Petitioners cannot complain about these matters now. Even if Petitioners can raise these arguments now, the record demonstrates the arguments do not have merit. The decision documents, reviewed by OSMRE and approved by the Secretary, approved the mining plan. The mining plan approval relied on the Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") prepared pursuant to NEPA. The EIS was based on extensive environmental analysis, hydrologic and soil monitoring, sampling and testing pertinent to detailed operation and reclamation planning. There were meaningful opportunities for public comment and cooperating agency review and recommendations. Petitioner PRBRC actively participated in this public NEPA process. Intervenor-respondents ask that the Petition be dismissed because Petitioners have failed to identify any flaw in the state and federal analysis conducted under SMCRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Decision History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Stage 1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2010, a Final Impact Statement for Wright Area Coal Lease Applications was prepared. This FEIS concerned approval of the issuance of two large coal leases within the PRB, which included portions of land located within the Thunder Basin National Grassland. The environmental impacts of four Lease(s) by Application (LBAs) were the focus of the EIS prepared for the Wright Area Coal Lease Applications, pursuant to NEPA. The evaluation of the environmental impacts of coal leasing first requires preparation of an Environmental Analysis (EA) or EIS evaluating site-specific and cumulative environmental and socioeconomic impacts of leasing and development of federal coal in the application areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   An announcement of the Draft EIS for the Wright Area LBAs was published in the Federal Register on June 26, 2009; Notice of Availability and Notice of Public Hearing for the Draft EIS was published in the Federal Register on July 8, 2009. A 60 day comment period on the Draft EIS ended August 25, 2009; public hearing was held July 29, 2009, in Gillette, Wyoming, soliciting public comment on the Draft EIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   and other matters. Individuals representing organizations presented statements on the Draft EIS during the hearing; written comments were received from 15 individuals, agencies, businesses, and organizations, in addition to numerous telephone comments and emails from interested individuals and entities during the comment period. A summary of statements from the public hearing and public comments, with agency responses, is included in the Final EIS, AR 021485; Appendix I (Draft EIS Comment Letters, BLM Responses, and Hearing Summary), AR 22605-22813. After the FEIS was prepared, the Records of Decision for the Wright Area Coal Lease Applications, including the South Porcupine and North Porcupine Tracts, were issued. AR 22824 (ROD South Porcupine Coal Lease Application, August 2011); AR 22849 (ROD North Porcupine Coal Lease Application, October 2011). Both the EIS and RODs advised that before mining could commence, the operator would need a permit from WDEQ and the mining plan would have to be approved by the Assistant Secretary of Interior. AR 22834-22835.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The BLM authorized coal leases in the North Porcupine and South Porcupine coal lease tracts in the Wright area, which would expand NARM in the PRB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The FEIS is in the AR 21472-22813; the Record of Decision (\"ROD\") for the South Porcupine Tract is in the AR at 228134-228138; the ROD for the North Porcupine Tract is at AR 22839-22884.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Stage 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Peabody acquired the coal leases in December 2011, approved in February 2012. After acquiring the coal leases, Peabody submitted its permit application package (\"PAP\") on April 29, 2012 to WDEQ seeking a mining permit amendment for the additional coal leases obtained on August 1, 2012 for the South Porcupine Tract and on October 1, 2012 for the North Porcupine Tract in NARM. AR 1-18104. WDEQ approved the permit amendment to include mining of additional coal leases for the South Porcupine and North Porcupine Tracts, adding 10,339.3 acres to the permit area. AR 23473; AR 23568. WDEQ's assessment process included an administrative completeness review and ultimately, a determination approving the permit to mine the additional coal leases in the NARM, conditioned upon approval by the Secretary upon OSMRE's recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The operator, Peabody, published notice of the completed PAP application in the Gillette News Record for four consecutive weeks in October 2013, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201263\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Petitioners here are not asking to offer additional authority that might shed light on the pertinent legal landscape or provide additional guidance in considering the issues raised in the petition for review. The decision by the agency was made in March 2013. Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions were filed by Peabody Energy Corporation and certain direct and indirect subsidiaries on April 13, 2016 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. There were 154 separate entities seeking Chapter 11 relief, all bankruptcy proceedings that were jointly administered. (Doc. 59.) Any decisions or agreements arising out of those bankruptcy proceedings related to coal mining in the PRB, including bonding requirements for proper reclamation, if there are any, did not even exist and were unavailable when the agency decision was made in 2013 approving the mining plan modification for NARM. Anything derived from this massive bankruptcy undertaking would require conjecture and speculation, at best, in aiding the review the propriety of the Secretary's approval of the mining plan in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The agency action has been explained and will be reviewed only upon consideration of the existing administrative record. Nothing suggests that governing principles and factors necessary to the agency decision were disregarded when the mining plan was approved. The extra-record evidence offered to supplement the record will not be considered in this APA review proceeding. Allowing the introduction of evidence that could not have been and never was before the agency will not permitted. As such, the Petitioners' \"Notice of Supplemental Authority\" (Doc. 73) will not be considered and will be struck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Was there a legal violation of public participation requirements in making the decision to approve the NARM mining plan modification?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   As to this first generally defined issue, the Court finds that the Petitioners' public participation arguments are unavailing. The phasing of the various processes concerning coal leasing and permits to mine upon approval of detailed mining plans provides multiple and various opportunities for public participation. In the first stage, the BLM EIS proceedings conducted pursuant to NEPA considered whether\n   the Wright Area Porcupine Tracts should be leased for coal mining. During this EIS / NEPA process, Petitioner PRBRC did participate in the notice and comment stage. WORC did not participate although the opportunity to do so was clearly available. During the EIS process, opportunities to address and comment on the lease applications were provided to the public. By way of example, notice of a public meeting to be held in Casper, Wyoming in January 2007 was given; notice was given in July 2007 of the agency's intention to prepare an EIS. The RODs recite public involvement opportunities to comment and participate with regard to the Porcupine coal lease applications and the NEPA review process concerning the Wright Area Coal Lease Application EIS. For instance:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   BLM received the Porcupine coal lease application on September 29, 2006. BLM announced the receipt of the LBA and published a Notice of Public Meeting in the Federal Register on December 12, 2006. At the public meeting held in Casper, Wyoming on January 18, 2007, the Powder River Regional Coal Team (PRRCT) reviewed the Porcupine coal lease application and BTU presented information about their existing mine and the pending lease application. The PRRCT recommended that BLM process the application. On March 14, 2007, BLM notified the Governor of Wyoming that BTU had made application for the North and South Porcupine Federal coal lands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   BLM published a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS and Notice of Public Meeting in the Federal Register on July 3, 2007, in the Gillette News-Record on July 6, 2007, and in the Douglas Budget on July 11, 2007. Scoping notices were also mailed to Federal, state, and local government agencies, conservation groups, commodity groups, and individuals who could be impacted by this LBA. BLM and the applicant jointly developed the distribution list. On July 24, 2007, a public scoping meeting was held in Gillette, Wyoming.

The BLM published a Notice of Availability/Notice of Public Hearing for the Draft EIS in the Federal Register on July 8, 2009. The BLM's Federal Register notice announced the date and time of the formal public hearing, which was held on July 29, 2009, in Gillette, Wyoming. The purpose of the public hearing was to solicit public comment on the Draft EIS, fair market value, maximum economic recovery, and the proposed competitive sale of Federal coal from the Wright Area LBAs. BLM also published a Notice of Public Hearing in both the Douglas Budget and Gillette News-Record newspapers on July 8, 2009. Two individuals presented statements on the Draft EIS during the hearing. BLM received written comments from 17 individuals, agencies, businesses, and organizations as well as over 500 comment e-mails from other interested parties.

Written comments from PRBRC concerning the Draft EIS are in the AR at 22606-22616.

After a federal coal lease is issued, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) gives OSM primary responsibility to administer programs that regulate surface coal mining operations and the surface effects of underground coal mining operations. USFS is also a cooperating agency on this EIS. If any USFS-administered lands are included in a tract that is proposed for leasing, USFS must consent to leasing the federal coal before BLM can make a decision to hold a federal coal lease sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   WDEQ is also a cooperating agency on this EIS. Pursuant to Section 503 of SMCRA, WDEQ developed, and in November 1980 the Secretary of the Interior approved, a permanent program authorizing WDEQ to regulate surface coal mining operations and surface effects of\n   underground mining on nonfederal lands within the state of Wyoming. In January 1987, pursuant to Section 523(c) of SMCRA, WDEQ entered into a cooperative agreement with the Secretary of the Interior authorizing WDEQ to regulate surface coal mining operations and surface effects of underground mining on federal lands within the state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   Pursuant to the cooperative agreement, a federal coal lease holder in Wyoming must submit a permit application package to OSM and WDEQ/LQD for any proposed coal mining and reclamation operations on federal lands in the state. WDEQ/LQD reviews the permit application package to insure the permit application complies with the permitting requirements and the coal mining operation will meet the performance standards of the approved Wyoming program. OSM, BLM, USFS and other federal agencies review the permit application package to insure it complies with the terms of the coal lease, the MLA, NEPA, and other federal laws and their attendant regulations. If the permit application package complies, WDEQ issues the applicant a permit to conduct coal mining operations. OSM recommends approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval of the MLA plan to the Assistant Secretary of the Interior, Land and Minerals Management. Before the MLA mining plan can be approved, the BLM must concur with this recommendation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   If a proposed LBA tract is leased to an existing mine, the lessee is required to revise its coal mining permit prior to mining the coal, following the processes outlined above. As a part of that process, a detailed new plan would be developed showing how the newly-leased lands would be mined and reclaimed. The area of mining disturbance would be larger than the newly-leased area to allow for activities such as overstripping, matching reclaimed topography to undisturbed topography, constructing flood control and sediment control facilities, and related activities. Specific impacts that would occur during the mining and reclamation of the LBA tract would be addressed in the mining and reclamation plan, and specific mitigation measures for anticipated impacts would be described in detail at that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   WDEQ enforces the performance standards and permit requirements for reclamation during a mine's operation and has primary authority in environmental emergencies. OSM retains oversight responsibility for this enforcement. Where federal surface or coal resources are involved, BLM, and USFS for USFS-administered lands, have authority in emergency situations if WDEQ or OSM cannot act before environmental harm and damage occurs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   Appendix A presents other federal and state permitting requirements that must be satisfied to mine these LBA tracts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   FEIS, AR 21594-21596.

Stat. \u00a7 35-11-406(n) and LQD Coal Rules and Regulations. The SDD noted that the PAP, including 14 volumes of permit revision material, had been submitted by the operator to support the NARM amendment request, with the reclamation plan included in Volumes 28 and 29 of the PAP. AR 23608-23635. The document included a detailed schedule for the mining and reclamation progression. AR 23526-23628. Reference to the mining plan for NARM was noted, and this is where contemporaneous reclamation considerations were addressed. See e.g., AR, 15125-15126, mining plan, 1.3.2. The mining plan discussed possible delays or deferrals of backfill and grading and other operations necessary to satisfy reclamation requirements. Hydrologic resources and bonding requirements were also specifically addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The SDD was submitted to OSMRE for review and for the purpose of making a recommendation to the Secretary regarding the proposed mining plan modification - approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the plan - pursuant to 30 C.F.R. Part 746. Following review, the OSMRE recommendation for approval without special conditions was made to the Secretary. AR 23464-23470. Approval of the SMCRA permit by WDEQ did not impose a requirement that OSMRE reassess that permit approval or mining plan from the ground up. OSMRE's task is to ensure that coal will be mined in compliance with other applicable federal statutes, AR 23423-23425, including but not limited to NEPA, AR 23469, 23474-23547, the Endangered Species Act, AR 23468-23550-23557, the National Historic Preservation Act, AR 23468-234679, 23560, and the MLA, AR 23468, 23548. The OSMRE decision recommendation was also based on the complete PAP, WDEQ's permit amendment decision, AR 23464-23470, and the USFS concurrence on the reclamation plan's impacts on post-mining land use. AR 23558.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   The OSMRE review and decision process does not require a complete renewed review and assessment of the Wyoming review process, which has been delegated to the state pursuant to the cooperative agreement. OSMRE relies on the state and prior federal proceedings in making\n   the decision to approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the mining plan. The charge to OSMRE regarding its review of and recommendations regarding mining plans is outlined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20746.13\">\n    30 C.F.R. \u00a7 746.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   \u00a7 746.13 Decision document and recommendation on mining plan.

The State will have the sole responsibility for reviewing permit applications for SMCRA compliance. In addition, both the proposed and final rules provide that the Secretary's decision on mining plan approval will be based on, among other things, the State's findings on the permit application. See revised 30 C.F.R. 746.13(f).\") The Court finds that the review activities undertaken by OSMRE in reaching the decision to recommend approval of the mining plan modification were appropriate and did not violate any requirements of SMCRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Petitioners have contended that approval of the mining plan modification fails to ensure \"contemporaneous reclamation\" and failed to ensure that the hydrologic plan reflects steps that will be taken to minimize hydrologic disturbances. In substance, this is a claim that the mining plan modification fails to satisfy performance standards for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on federal lands. They argue that the exclusive measure for determining the timeliness of reclamation is Phase III bond release, which was not employed in the reclamation plan. The general tenor of Petitioners' arguments is that OSMRE failed to assess reclamation adequately when the approval recommendation was made, and ultimately, approved by the Secretary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by Petitioners' arguments. The applicable law does not suggest that the language requiring \"contemporaneous reclamation\" is as cramped as Petitioners suggest. Petitioners have claimed that the detailed estimated timetable for major steps in the reclamation plan are absent from the mining plan and this failure precluded approval of the mining plan modification permit. However, Petitioners' assertions regarding the\n   contours and time frames for reclamation are clearly contradicted in the record. The PAP provided extensive analysis and discussion, included maps and schedules for numerous listed reclamation activities such as grading, topsoil replacement and fill, and accomplishing post-mining contours, and many other events. WDEQ reviewed the PAP, submitted the SDD to OSMRE for review and for OSMRE to make its recommendation whether the mining plan should be approved to the Secretary. While Petitioners ask for more, the regulatory scheme does not require more and the activities of the agencies involved in the review, recommendation and approval process satisfy the requirements of SMCRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Performance standards for environmental protection are set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201265\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This statute provides that any permit issued under an approved state program to conduct surface coal mining operations shall require that such surface coal mining operations will meet all applicable performance standards. The State of Wyoming in administration of the cooperative program must require operations to meet applicable performance standards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ensuring compliance with performance standards is a task delegated to WDEQ and the State of Wyoming; this task is not charged to OSMRE or the Secretary. The federal entities, OSMRE and the Secretary, provide limited oversight because the Secretary has an obligation to evaluate administration of approved state programs, inspect and monitor the operations of state programs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201267\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1271.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   More importantly, WDEQ did require with its approval of the permit for the mining plan modification that performance standards be met and satisfied. The PAP for the NARM mining plan demonstrated that the operator intends to meet performance standards and achieve reclamation as \"contemporaneously as practical following coal removal and continue concurrently with mining activity.\" AR 15125. The performance standards must insure that \"all reclamation efforts proceed in an environmentally sound manner and as contemporaneously as practical with the surface coal mining operations[.]\" 30 U.S.C. 1265(b)(16). Reclamation was considered by WDEQ when it determined that the permit for the mining plan modification should be approved and subsequently submitted to OSMRE; WDEQ recognized that \"contemporaneous reclamation\" may be subject to the vagaries of mining operations and may not be not performed with the immediacy or urgency that Petitioners believe is warranted for the NARM mining operations. All documents in the administrative record indicate that reclamation was considered, including the types of reclamation anticipated, estimated timetables for major steps in reclamation, and identification of reclamation activity blocks for reclamation in five year increments. AR 23626. Whether the contemplated reclamation, as set forth in the approved PAP, is actually successful is beyond the purview of this APA review and that is a matter for another day and time. Any invitation to speculate in that regard must be declined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The Court disagrees that Phase III bond release is the exclusive means for measuring timeliness of reclamation and deciding whether the legal requirements for approval of the mining plan modification have been satisfied. Reclamation success is addressed in the OSMRE Directive REG-8, which provides guidelines for evaluating reclamation success. \"Existing bond\n   release systems and forms should be used to the extent possible to evaluate reclamation success.\" AR 23317. Bond release may be a measure, but is not the only means for measuring reclamation success. AR 23320, 23276-23277, 23060, 23112, 23137-233157, 23173-23176, 23208-23229, 23248-23250, 23277-23287. OSMRE evaluates and reports on the effectiveness of successful reclamation on lands affected by surface coal mining regulations and recognizes that final bond release can be an inaccurate measure of actual reclamation activities. See e.g., AR 23275, 23280, 23098-23136 (Evaluation Year 2011), 23137-23157 (Evaluation Year 2011), 23158-23027 (Evaluation Year 2012). The administrative record discloses repeatedly that WDEQ and OSMRE did consider contemporaneous reclamation carefully and considered various means for gauging successful reclamation and deciding whether the legal requirements were met and sufficient to support a decision to approve the mining plan modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Similarly, the operator's mining plan with respect to hydrology demonstrates commitment to a plan intended to \"minimize disturbances to the prevailing hydrologic balance at the mine-site and in associated offsite areas and to the quality and quantity of water in surface and ground water systems both during and after surface coal mining operations and during reclamation[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201265\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(10). By way of example, a detailed hydrologic control plan was included in the mining plan, along with maps and specifications for restoration. AR 17440, 18095-18101. The record includes a hydrologic analysis, \"Cumulative Hydrologic Impact Assessment of Coal Mining in the Southern Powder River Basin, Wyoming\" which was considered by WDEQ. AR 18173-18478. With this record, it seem disingenuous for Petitioners to assert the record fails to include a discussion of the steps that must be taken to minimize disturbance to the hydrologic balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   WDEQ's expertise in this area was utilized to evaluate and determine that the reclamation plan in the mining plan satisfied SMCRA. This expertise was encompassed in the SDD that eventually was forwarded to OSMRE for its review and recommendation for approval of the mining plan. OSMRE's recommendation for approval of the mining plan was then forwarded to the Secretary. This was followed by the Secretary's decision to approve the mining plan. See e.g., AR 23562-23605. The record does not demonstrate that the decision of the Secretary to approve the mining plan modification as recommended by OSMRE following OSMRE's independent review and consideration of the SDD prepared by WDEQ was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance to law. None of the deficiencies Petitioners complain about are sufficient to demonstrate that reclamation was not considered by WDEQ, OSMRE, or the Secretary in making the decision ultimately approving the mining plan modification for NARM. Given the narrow scope of APA review, the Court is satisfied that the agency's decision was based upon relevant factors and was not a clear error of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   The Court will briefly address the final issue raised by Petitioners concerning their claim that the Secretary failed to ensure that bonding was sufficient to protect natural resources. They have argued that Peabody's financial condition was \"dire\" at the time of the agency's decisions and that the assessment of Peabody's ability to self-bond should have been considered more carefully and thoroughly in making the decision to approve the mining plan modification. Petitioners have urged that the operator's \"lack of contemporaneous and timely reclamation\" over the last\n   30 years demonstrates that the operator's \"corporate guarantee\" is inadequate. They submit that Peabody does not have the financial ability to meaningfully self-bond and ultimately, that Peabody will be financially unable to timely and successfully satisfy its reclamation obligations. The arguments raised about the decision approving self-bonding for reclamation purposes do not withstand scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The administrative record reflects that the PAP addressed bonding in the reclamation plan, stating that \"[t[he bond estimate for the current disturbance is shown in the current annual reports for the North Antelope Rochelle Mine. Any revised bond amounts and calculations were to be included in future annual reports.\" AR 17105. Bonding was addressed at length in NARM Annual Report for 2012 (Revised April 2013), Appendix B, Reclamation Performance Bond. This document includes information summarizing the Reclamation Bond for NARM and calculations for estimated reclamation costs. AR 19934-19974. The PAP was reviewed by WDEQ as required to do when a request to mine comes before it. Upon consideration and review of the PAP, WDEQ determined that an adequate bond for reclamation in the amount of approximately $333 million, payable to the State of Wyoming and the United States was appropriate. This determination, included in the SDD, was reviewed and relied upon by OSMRE prior to recommending, and receiving, approval from the Secretary for the mining plan modification that extends permitted mining in the NARM. AR 234690-23470.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   An operator must make an initial application to self-bond at the time an application is made for a license to mine. An applicant must provide a history of financial solvency demonstrating that financial condition satisfies the WDEQ standards for self-bonding. Pertinent statutory and regulatory provisions governing bonding are included at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201259\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20950.10\">\n    30 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 950.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 950.15 (approving state regulatory program and amendments for the conduct of surface mining operations in Wyoming); Wyo. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 35-11-417 to -423; Wyoming Rules and Regulations, Department of Environmental Quality, Land Quality-Coal, Chapter 11 (Self-Bonding Program) and Chapter 15 (Release of Bonds or Deposits and Termination of Jurisdiction for Surface Coal Mining Operations). Information relevant to bonding is in the PAP and was considered by WDEQ. It is also notable that the assessment of appropriate performance bonds is not a static process. Performance bond amounts are calculated annually, so the amount of a bond for reclamation and whether self-bonding is appropriate are reassessed frequently. The record discloses that WDEQ did consider the reclamation plan's provisions for bonding and that estimates for reclamation of disturbances may be revised annually. This information was passed to OSMRE, and in turn passed to the Secretary with the recommendation for approval from OSMRE; the Secretary approved the mining plan amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   As noted earlier, Petitioners have argued that subsequent financial events after Peabody's self-bond was approved by the Secretary show that the permit and mining plan modification approval, with the companion provisions regarding reclamation bonds, were not adequate. However, the Court has not allowed the Petitioners to supplement the record in this case to include matters that were never available at the time the decisions to approve the mining permit and mining plan modification were made. In this APA action, the Court is limited to a review of the record and matters that were presented to the agencies when the decisions to approve the mining plan modification were made. Petitioners'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   arguments in this regard are beyond the scope of appropriate administrative review in this case and are unavailing. The record discloses that the agency's decision regarding reclamation was based on relevant factors. Even if the Court agreed that the bond determinations for reclamation by the operator in NARM were inadequate, the Court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency and will not do so now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   In an APA action, the Court's review is based on the administrative record before the agency at the time of its decision. The Court's role is to determine whether the record supports the agency's decision as a matter of law and the scope of review is narrow. See\n   <em>\n    Colo. Wild, Heartwood v.
