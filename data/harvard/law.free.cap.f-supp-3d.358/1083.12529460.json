Kay, Sr. United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that the trailer on which the M/V Tehani has been secured is an appurtenance of the vessel to which Plaintiff Barnes's maritime lien attaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For purposes of this Order, the Court will not recount this case's lengthy procedural history beginning in 2013. The Court only discusses those facts of specific relevance to the issue that this Order addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has found that Plaintiff Chad Barry Barnes (\"Plaintiff Barnes\") has a maritime lien on in rem Defendant the vessel M/V Tehani (the \"Tehani\") on the basis of Defendant Sea Hawai'i Rafting, LLC (\"Defendant SHR\") and the Tehani's failure to pay Plaintiff Barnes maintenance and cure.\n   <em>\n    Barnes v. Sea Hawaii Rafting, LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516838\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/517/#p535\">\n    889 F.3d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535 (9th Cir. 2018). Defendant SHR owned the Tehani at the time of the subject injury to seaman Plaintiff Barnes. The Tehani is a 25-foot rigid-hull inflatable boat powered by twin outboard engines. ECF No. 446 at 1-2. Plaintiff Barnes seeks to execute his maritime lien through in rem legal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 1, 2018, the Court issued an Order Authorizing Issuance of Warrant for Maritime Arrest of the Tehani. ECF No. 388. However, on August 6, 2018, the United States Marshal Service notified the Court that the marshals did not have the ability to take custody of the vessel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 401. On September 27, 2018, the Court issued an Amended Order Authorizing Issuance of Warrant for Maritime Arrest ECF No. 441, on the basis that Plaintiff Barnes had apparently found a suitable substitute custodian willing to take custody of the vessel after its arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff Barnes's proposed substitute custodian has agreed to serve in this capacity only if the Tehani is arrested along with the trailer upon which it has been secured, which will allow the proposed substitute custodian to easily transport the vessel if doing so becomes necessary in the course of the substitute custodian's duties. Thus, this Court must determine whether the trailer is an appurtenance of the Tehani.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 28, 2018, the Court held a Hearing on Defendant Aloha Ocean Excursion, LLC's (\"Defendant AOE\") Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   426. At the end of the Hearing, the Court raised Plaintiff Barnes's concern that, in response to his submission of proposed substitute custodian documents, the Court had earlier noted in a Minute Order entered on September 26 2018, ECF No. 440, that Plaintiff Barnes's Second Amended Complaint did not assert that the trailer on which the Tehani has been secured was an appurtenance of the vessel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court then asked counsel for Defendant AOE whether it would stipulate that the trailer constitutes an appurtenance. Counsel for Defendant AOE declined to so stipulate, but suggested that maybe the issue should be briefed. After further discussion, the Court stated that it was not going to rule on the issue at that time. The Court then asked counsel for Plaintiff Barnes whether he had attempted to rent a trailer on the Island of Hawai'i, or on Maui or O'ahu. Counsel for Plaintiff Barnes stated that his efforts to rent a trailer on the Island of Hawai'i were unsuccessful, but that he would endeavor to find a rental from the other islands. The Court stated that if counsel for Plaintiff Barnes's efforts to rent a trailer from the other islands were similarly unavailing, then as a last resort he should file a motion asking this Court to determine whether the trailer is an appurtenance of the vessel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, on October 2, 2018, Plaintiff Barnes filed a Fourth Motion to Supplement Petition for Writ of Mandamus before the Ninth Circuit. Case No. 18-72203, Dkt. No. 12. In the supplemented Petition for Writ of Mandamus, Plaintiff Barnes states that this Court had determined the trailer is not an appurtenance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516838\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/517/#p535\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court, in a Minute Order entered on October 10, 2018, ECF No. 448, summarized the foregoing and reiterated that Plaintiff Barnes should file a motion if he continued to be unsuccessful in finding a rental trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 22, 2018, the Court entered another Minute Order, ECF No. 453, where it directed Defendant AOE and Plaintiff Barnes to brief the issue of whether the trailer on which the Tehani has been secured is an appurtenance of the vessel. The Court required the parties to file their briefs by noon on November 2, 2018. Defendant AOE timely filed its brief on November 2, 2018. ECF No. 457. Just before noon on November 2, 2018 Plaintiff Barnes filed a Motion to Extend Time to file his brief, which requested a twelve-hour extension in which to file his brief and further stated that Plaintiff Barnes's counsel would be away on business in the Marshall Islands for the next several weeks. ECF No. 458. In a Minute Order entered that same day, the Court granted Plaintiff Barnes a twelve-hour extension in which to file his brief. ECF No. 459. Plaintiff Barnes filed his brief later that day. ECF No. 460. On November 5, 2018, Plaintiff Barnes filed a Supplement to his brief. ECF No. 462. On November 8, 2018, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit filed an order that stayed proceedings in\n   Plaintiff Barnes's Petition for Writ of Mandamus pending this Court's ruling on the appurtenance issue. Case No. 18-72203, Dkt. No. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 29, 2018, the Court held a Hearing on the appurtenance issue. At the Hearing, the Court directed the parties to file Supplemental Briefs describing in detail the manner in which the trailer is used on a daily basis, both at the time of the incident and currently. Defendant AOE and Plaintiff Barnes filed their respective briefs on December 5, 2018, ECF Nos. 478, 477.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The only question before the Court at this time is whether the trailer upon which the vessel Tehani has been secured is an appurtenance of the vessel to which Plaintiff Barnes's maritime lien attaches. The parties have presented no cases where courts found that a trailer is appurtenant to a vessel, and the Court, through its research, has discovered none. Accordingly, it appears that this is a question of first impression; however, because the appurtenance determination is made on a case-by-case basis, the Court confines its analysis and holding to the unique facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As is explained below, the Court holds that the trailer is an appurtenance of the Tehani to which Plaintiff Barnes's maritime lien attaches on the basis of several findings. First, the trailer is part of the vessel's usual equipment; second, the trailer is essential to the operation and mission of the vessel; third, the trailer is a necessary which provides towage by drawing the Tehani to and from the water; and fourth the Bankruptcy Court both leased and subsequently sold to Defendant AOE the Tehani together with its trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Prior to making its findings, the Court first sets forth the applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Under maritime law, a maritime lien arises against a vessel for various liabilities, including claims for maritime torts.

The Trailer Is Part of the Tehani's Usual Equipment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A maritime lien arises not only against the vessel, but also against its \"usual equipment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Frolic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6751309\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/148/921/#p922\">\n    148 F. at 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   defines \"equipment\" as \"[t]he articles or implements used for a specific purpose or activity.\" (10th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court first notes that Plaintiff Barnes names as the in rem defendant in his initial Complaint, First Amended Complaint, and Second Amended Complaint, the \"M/V TEHANI HA-1629-CP, and her ...\n   <em>\n    equipment\n   </em>\n   ....\" (emphasis added). ECF Nos. 1, 91, and 349. Therefore, if the trailer is part of the vessel's usual equipment, it is subject to Plaintiff Barnes's maritime lien. To determine whether or not the trailer constitutes part of the Tehani's usual equipment, the Court must consider the nature of the trailer and how it is used on a daily basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In Plaintiff Barnes's Supplemental Brief regarding the use of the trailer, he notes that at the time of the accident the trailer was used at least twice a day in order to transport the Tehani from Defendant Kris Henry's (\"Defendant Henry\") house to the Honohokohau Harbor, and later from the\n   harbor back to Defendant Henry's house. ECF No. 477 at 3. The trailer was also used to launch the Tehani into the water at the start of each voyage and to remove the Tehani from the water when each voyage was over.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6751309\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/148/921/#p922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Barnes's Declaration, ECF No. 477-1, confirms that the trailer was used to remove the Tehani from the water after each and every trip it took; in other words, the trailer was not kept in the water between trips. Plaintiff Barnes's Decl. \u00b6 11. After each trip, the Tehani was secured to the trailer and brought to a wash station where the saltwater was rinsed off.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4(n), 11. The trailer was also used as storage for the Tehani at any time when it was not in the water. ECF No. 477 at 4. Finally, the trailer was used to tow the Tehani to the gas station on the harbor or at Costco after each trip (or every other trip depending on ocean conditions) in order to fuel the Tehani. Plaintiff Barnes's Decl. \u00b6 5. Thus, it appears that the Tehani was attached to the trailer the vast majority of every daily twenty-four-hour period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant Henry's Declaration, ECF No. 476-1, notes that the trailer that is currently used with the Tehani is not the same trailer that was used at the time of the accident;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, Defendant Henry also states that the use of the previous trailer at the time of the accident was similar to the use of the current trailer. Defendant Henry's Decl. \u00b6 2, 9. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff Barnes's account regarding the use of the previous trailer is nevertheless instructive in the Court's appurtenance inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In addition, it appears that because of the Tehani's physical dimensions and hull structure, the trailer that is used in conjunction with the operation of the Tehani is quite unique. Plaintiff Barnes's Decl. \u00b6 9. The trailer is apparently so unique, that it is difficult to acquire in the state of Hawai'i. Plaintiff Barnes's Decl. \u00b6 10. Indeed, counsel for Plaintiff Barnes described the difficulties that he and Plaintiff Barnes have faced in renting or purchasing a substitute trailer at the Hearing on September 28, 2018 and at the Hearing on November 29, 2018. The trailer is also used solely in connection with the operation of the Tehani, and is not used to tow, store, or secure any other vessels. Plaintiff Barnes's Decl. \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Based upon the foregoing review of the ways in which the trailer is used on a daily basis, as well as the unique relationship between the Tehani and its trailer, it is abundantly clear that the trailer is part of the Tehani's usual equipment. Indeed, the trailer is used on a daily basis to transport the Tehani to and from the harbor; to place the Tehani into the water at the start of voyages and to remove the vessel from the water when the voyages are over; to store the Tehani at all times when it is not in the water; and for regular maintenance of the Tehani, including the fueling and cleaning that occurs after each voyage. The Tehani and trailer essentially function as a single unit. Accordingly, the Court finds that the trailer is a piece of the Tehani's usual equipment to which Plaintiff Barnes's maritime lien attaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Trailer Is Essential to the Tehani's Operation and Mission\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court next considers whether the Tehani's trailer is subject to Plaintiff Barnes's maritime lien on the basis of whether or not it is \"essential to the ship's\n   navigation, operation, or mission\" such that it should deemed an appurtenance of the vessel.\n   <em>\n    Gowen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11117063\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/244/64/#p67\">\n    244 F.3d at 67-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Specifically, Plaintiff Barnes's declaration states that, in order to launch the Tehani, the trailer was reversed\n   <em>\n    into the water\n   </em>\n   until the Tehani floated off of the trailer bed. Plaintiff Barnes's Decl. \u00b6 4(f). Thus, the trailer is used in the water in connection with the operation of the Tehani.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Furthermore, the trailer is undoubtedly essential to the operation of the Tehani. In order to operate safely, the Tehani must be maintained and supplied with gasoline and rinsed of seawater after each trip. The Tehani is secured upon the trailer while the crew accomplishes these basic maintenance tasks. The trailer is also essential to the operation of the Tehani because the vessel needs to be stored in a safe place when it is not in the water-a function that the trailer serves.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trailer is also essential to the operation of the Tehani because it is used to launch the Tehani into the water for each trip and to retrieve the Tehani from the water when each trip concludes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant AOE argues that this Court should not find that the trailer is an appurtenance because to do so would create a \"slippery slope\" regarding what constitutes an appurtenance. Defendant AOE's Memorandum at 3. Specifically, Defendant AOE posits that if the trailer is an appurtenance, then \"the truck which tows the trailer is also an appurtenance, because the trailer cannot be used without the truck.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1437564\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/187/371/#p373\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant AOE's argument is unavailing for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, contrary to Defendant AOE's assertion, the trailer is often used without the truck. As discussed, the trailer serves\n   as storage for the Tehani whenever vessel is not in the water. Given that trucks serve numerous other transportation functions, the Court finds it unlikely that the truck is attached to the trailer at all times, especially when it is used for storage. It would appear that the truck is only used with the trailer when the Tehani is moved from place to place on land and when it is trailered into and out of the water, which represents only part of the time that the vessel spends attached to the trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, unlike the trailer, the use of the truck is not specific to the Tehani. Indeed, the truck can be used in connection with any trailer or vessel and serves many non-maritime functions. This trailer, on the other hand, is used solely in connection with the operation of the Tehani because the design of the trailer is uniquely suited to the Tehani's dimensions and hull structure. It does not appear that the truck and the Tehani enjoy a similarly unique relationship because unlike the trailer, any vehicle with a tow rig could be used in connection with the operation of the Tehani.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, while Defendant AOE's \"slippery slope\" concern is a legitimate one, the Court reiterates that appurtenance inquiries are conducted on a case-by-case basis, and that the Court's analysis is confined to the unique facts of this case. For these reasons, the Court rejects Defendant AOE's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendant AOE correctly notes that the definition of appurtenance is not so broad as to include any object that has some logical connection to the use of the vessel. Defendant AOE's Memorandum at 5. Here, however, the trailer that is used in conjunction with the Tehani has more than simply a logical connection. The trailer is essential to the Tehani's operation, because without the trailer, the Tehani literally cannot operate on the water. By definition, therefore, the trailer is \"essential to the vessel's ... operation....\"\n   <em>\n    Gowen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11117063\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/244/64/#p67\">\n    244 F.3d at 67-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the trailer is essential to the operation of the Tehani and, therefore, is an appurtenance of the vessel to which Plaintiff Barnes's maritime lien attaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Mission\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant AOE also argues that the trailer is not essential to the Tehani's mission of \"serv[ing] passengers on the water.\" Defendant AOE's Memorandum at 5. The Court rejects this argument for substantially the same reasons it rejected Defendant AOE's argument that the trailer was not essential to the operation of the Tehani.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In his Supplemental Brief, Plaintiff Barnes more fully characterizes the nature of the Tehani's mission. Plaintiff Barnes states that the mission of the Tehani is to take \"customers out to sea for swimming, snorkeling and other recreational activities.\" Plaintiff Barnes's Supplemental Brief at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The parties appear to agree that the Tehani's mission is to take passengers out on the water for recreational tours. The trailer is essential to the Tehani's mission because the trailer is used to place the Tehani into the water in order to embark on these tours, and to draw the Tehani out of the water after when the tours end. The other functions that the trailer serves, such as storage when the vessel is not in the water and securing the vessel during regular maintenance, are also critical to the mission of the vessel. Without the trailer the Tehani could not fulfill its mission of providing passengers with safe recreational tours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the trailer is essential to the Tehani's mission and, therefore, the trailer is an appurtenance\n   to which Plaintiff Barnes's maritime lien attaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Navigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff Barnes argues that the trailer is essential to the navigation of the vessel and, therefore, is also an appurtenance on that basis of the analysis. Specifically, Plaintiff Barnes argues that the trailer momentarily aids the Tehani in its navigation as it carries the vessel down the ramp into the water, at which point the Tehani floats off of the trailer. Plaintiff Barnes's Supplemental Brief at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court finds that this argument is unpersuasive. Instrumentalities which are essential to a vessel's navigation include things like propellers, tail shafts, and engines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    M/V Chris Way MacMillan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7835813\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/890/552/#p562\">\n    890 F.Supp. at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nevertheless, the analysis courts use to determine whether something is an appurtenance of a vessel is disjunctive. The object need only be essential to the vessel's navigation, operation,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   mission. Accordingly, because the Court has already determined that the trailer is essential to both the Tehani's operation and mission, as well as part of the vessel's equipment, the fact that Court finds the trailer is not essential to the Tehani's navigation has no bearing on the Court's conclusion that the trailer is an appurtenance of the Tehani.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Trailer Provides the Tehani with a Necessary in the Form of Towage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Another argument supporting the proposition that the trailer is an appurtenance is that it provides towage for the Tehani. Although there are numerous situations in which maritime liens arise under the general maritime law, maritime liens are also a creature of statute. Specifically,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031342\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 31342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   provides that persons providing \"necessaries to a vessel on the order of the owner or a person authorized by the owner\" have maritime liens on the vessel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bunker Holdings Ltd. v.

An earlier edition of\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   provides a more elaborate definition, which includes \"[t]he drawing of a ship or barge along the water by another ship or boat, fastened to her, or by men or horses, etc., on land.\" (4th ed. 1951). This definition is instructive because it shows that towage need not be rendered by a tug boat, and that the instrumentality providing towage can be land-based.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ryan v.

Like a tug that tows a barge from a harbor into the open ocean at the start of a voyage, and then back into the harbor upon the voyage's end, the Tehani's trailer similarly guides the vessel into and out of the water as each of its tours commences and concludes. While Plaintiff Barnes obviously is not seeking a lien for the provision of necessaries pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031342\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7 31342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for towage services; nevertheless, because the trailer provides the Tehani with a necessary in the form of towage, the Court finds that the trailer is an appurtenance of the vessel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Bankruptcy Court Leased and Subsequently Sold to Defendant AOE the Tehani Together with Its Trailer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendant AOE argues that the trailer should not be considered an appurtenance of the vessel because it is the property of Defendant AOE, and not the property of Defendant SHR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant AOE's Memorandum at 5-6. Defendant AOE further argues that because there is no judgment against Defendant AOE, the trailer is not subject to execution like other property of a judgment debtor would be.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031342\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031342\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court finds that Defendant AOE's arguments are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Moreover, Defendant AOE's argument regarding the judgment now appears to be moot given the fact that the Bankruptcy Court avoided the sale of the Tehani. Regardless, Defendant AOE's argument is misguided because Plaintiff Barnes's is seeking to execute his maritime lien on the Tehani; Plaintiff Barnes is not seeking to execute his judgment against Defendant SHR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Furthermore, the fact that the Bankruptcy Court first leased and then sold the Tehani together with its trailer undercuts Defendant AOE's argument that the trailer is not essential to the Tehani's operation and mission. As the Court has discussed at length above, without the trailer Defendant AOE could not operate the Tehani in connection with its recreational tour business. The Bankruptcy Court leased and then sold the Tehani and its trailer as a unit, which strengthens the argument that the trailer is an appurtenance of the vessel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A final issue related to the Bankruptcy Court's lease and subsequent sale of the Tehani concerns a factual question that arose after the Court requested supplemental briefing on the appurtenance issue. In his Declaration, Defendant Henry\n   states that the current trailer used in conjunction with operation of the Tehani is not the same trailer that was involved in the accident. Defendant Henry's Decl. \u00b6 2. Defendant Henry further states that the current trailer \"was purchased at some point in that [sic] last several years but I am not sure exactly when.\" Defendant Henry's Decl. \u00b6 4. It is unclear, based on the Court's review of the record in the bankruptcy proceedings, which trailer was leased and subsequently sold to Defendant AOE. However, the record does indicate that the vessel and trailer were first leased to Defendant AOE on March 17, 2016, and then sold to Defendant AOE on May 9, 2016. Case No. 14-01520, Dkt. Nos. 142, 185. Because Defendant Henry states that the current trailer was purchased \"in the last several years\" it appears highly likely that the bankruptcy court leased and then sold the current trailer to Defendant AOE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Although the current trailer was not involved in the accident, the Court finds that distinction makes no difference as to whether Plaintiff Barnes's maritime lien attaches to the trailer. As the Court has determined, the trailer is both part of the Tehani's usual equipment and appurtenant to the vessel. Because Plaintiff Barnes's maritime lien attaches to the vessel, its usual equipment, and appurtenances, the fact that this particular trailer was not in use at the time of the accident in no way makes it less a part of the Tehani's usual equipment or an appurtenance to which Plaintiff Barnes's maritime lien attaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Case law supports the Court's position.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v.

These issues are (1) whether Plaintiff Barnes had prudential standing to seek a stay of the sale of the Tehani; (2) if Plaintiff Barnes had standing, whether the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to authorize the sale; and (3) whether the sale of the Tehani should be avoided.\n    <em>\n     In re Sea Hawaii Rafting, LLC\n    </em>\n    , Case No. 14-01520, Dkt. No. 356 at 4. The Bankruptcy Court determined that the sale should be avoided and set aside the Sale Order authorizing the sale.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 10-11. However, the Court notes that on December 10, 2018, Plaintiff Barnes nevertheless appealed the Bankruptcy Court's order.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at Dkt. No. 364. Regardless of the sale and its subsequent avoidance, the Bankruptcy Court's actions did not dispose of Plaintiff Barnes's maritime lien.\n    <em>\n     Barnes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516838\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/517/#p535\">\n     889 F.3d at 535\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Accordingly, the fact that Defendant SHR now owns the Tehani again in no way affects Plaintiff Barnes's maritime lien or the Court's analysis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
