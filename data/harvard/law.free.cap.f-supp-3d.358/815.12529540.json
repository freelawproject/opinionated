He was sentenced to 400 months' imprisonment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed Penoncello's sentence on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Penoncello\n   </em>\n   , 671 Fed. App'x. 399 (8th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Penoncello's motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Penoncello argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel prior to trial-and that, had he received effective assistance, he would have accepted the government's original plea offer, pleaded guilty to one count of producing child pornography, and received a shorter sentence. The Court agrees, grants Penoncello's \u00a7 2255 motion, and orders the government to again offer the original plea deal to Penoncello.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Penoncello was indicted on a single count of production of child pornography on April 15, 2015. ECF No. 10. The details of the crime were horrific: The government alleged that a girlfriend of Penoncello's (N.T.) had visited his home on September 15, 2012, with her seven-year-old son (A.M.), her five-year-old daughter (A.L.M.), and an adult friend (S.H.). After N.T. was bitten by Penoncello's dog, S.H. drove her to an emergency room, and the children were left in Penoncello's care. Penoncello took advantage of the unsupervised access to A.L.M. by sexually assaulting her, recording the sexual assault for his viewing pleasure, and distributing images of the sexual assault over the Internet, where they will forever be available for the viewing pleasure of other pedophiles. Two years later, law-enforcement officers discovered images of A.L.M.'s assault on the computer of a suspect in Dayton, Ohio. After an extraordinarily careful and thorough investigation, Special Agent Craig J. Heidenreich of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was able to identify A.L.M. as the victim and Penoncello as the perpetrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Attorney Craig Hunter was appointed to represent Penoncello. ECF No. 9. On May 6, 2015, Hunter sent a letter to Penoncello advising him that, if he was convicted of producing child pornography as charged in the indictment, he would be facing a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years' imprisonment. ECF No. 144-1. That was true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Hunter also advised Penoncello that the United States Sentencing Guidelines would recommend a sentence of life in prison. ECF No. 144-1. That was not true. Because of the statutory maximum, the Guidelines would actually\n   recommend a sentence of 30 years' imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) ; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(a). (Penoncello was 41 years old at the time.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Six days later, on May 12, 2015, Hunter met with Penoncello. ECF No. 162 at 11. Hunter testified that he again advised Penoncello about the 15-year mandatory minimum and the Guidelines' recommendation of \"life,\" but Hunter admitted that he had no recollection of advising Penoncello-at this meeting or at any other time-about the statutory maximum.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    at 11-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Penoncello further testified that, during their initial meeting, Hunter told Penoncello that he had recently been successful in winning the acquittal of a defendant at trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hunter conceded that Penoncello's testimony on this last point \"may\" be correct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (It is difficult to know how Penoncello would know of that acquittal if Hunter had not told him.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 26, 2015, Assistant United States Attorney Katharine Buzicky advised Hunter that Penoncello had until June 3, 2015 to plead guilty to the pending indictment. ECF No. 144-2. Buzicky warned that, if Penoncello did not do so, the government would seek a superseding indictment that would add a second count of production of child pornography and a count of possession of child pornography.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The second production-of-child-pornography count was based on newly discovered evidence that, months before he recorded himself sexually assaulting A.L.M., Penoncello had recorded himself engaging in sexual intercourse with his son's babysitter (A.O.)-a troubled 14-year-old girl. Penoncello's face does not appear in the videos, but Penoncello's voice is heard, A.O. is heard referring to him as \"Sean,\" and Penoncello's son appears in a portion of one video. The new possession-of-child-pornography charge was based on a large cache of child pornography that law-enforcement officers found at the time of Penoncello's arrest on two thumb drives that had been hidden in a vent in Penoncello's home. Those thumb drives not only contained images and videos of Penoncello's sexual abuse of A.L.M. and A.O., but numerous other images and videos of child pornography. Images and videos of Penoncello's sexual abuse of A.L.M. and A.O. were also found on Penoncello's password-protected smartphone, which he was carrying at the time of his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   That was not all. Penoncello had been employed as a janitor at the AmericInn in Virginia, Minnesota. At the time of Penoncello's arrest, law-enforcement officers found in his vehicle a video-recording device disguised as an outlet cover. An examination of that video-recording device and the thumb drives found in Penoncello's home revealed that Penoncello had installed the device in a changing room near the pool at the AmericInn and surreptitiously recorded women and girls as they undressed. The first recording on the device was actually a video of Penoncello installing the device; although Penoncello's face cannot be seen, the man installing the device is wearing two distinctive articles of clothing that were found in Penoncello's home. The government did not charge Penoncello with any crimes in connection with his recording of the unsuspecting women and girls at the AmericInn, but there was no doubt that the government\n   would attempt to introduce evidence of Penoncello's conduct at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After being told by Buzicky that Penoncello had to plead guilty by June 3, 2015 if he wanted to avoid a superseding indictment, Hunter met with Penoncello on May 26, 2015, and then again on June 1, 2015. ECF No. 144 at 2. The two discussed the discovery of the recording of A.O. and the possibility of Penoncello accepting a plea deal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Echoing his earlier advice, Hunter again told Penoncello that he faced a 15-year mandatory minimum and a Guidelines recommendation of life. ECF No. 162 at 14-19. This, again, was incorrect. Because of the statutory maximums, the Guidelines range was 30 years under the original indictment (one count of production with a 30-year maximum) and would become 80 years under the superseding indictment (two counts of production with 30-year maximums and one count of possession with a 20-year maximum).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), 2252(b)(2). Hunter testified that he had no recollection of\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   advising Penoncello about\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the statutory maximums for the crimes charged in the original or superseding indictments. ECF No. 162 at 14-22. Penoncello testified that Hunter in fact never informed of him of the maximums, and thus, as far as Penoncello was concerned, his exposure would be the same whether he pleaded guilty to the original indictment or was convicted of all of the charges in the superseding indictment: Either way, he would be looking at a 15-year mandatory minimum and a Guidelines recommendation of life.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    at 46-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Penoncello did not plead guilty to the original indictment, and on June 9, 2015, the promised superseding indictment was returned against Penoncello. ECF No. 27. At this point, Penoncello found himself charged with two counts of producing child pornography (for recording his sexual abuse of A.L.M. and A.O.) and one count of possessing child pornography (for possessing a large collection of child pornography on the thumb drives found in his home). Two months later, on August 9, 2015, Buzicky offered another plea deal to Penoncello through Hunter, this one requiring Penoncello to plead guilty to one count of production of child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography. ECF No. 144-3. Buzicky said that Penoncello could still receive the three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility, but she warned that after August 31, 2015, the government would not agree to any plea deal, so if Penoncello wanted to plead after August 31, \"he would have to plead straight up.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hunter again met with Penoncello to discuss his options. ECF No. 149 at 3. Hunter testified that, once again, he advised Penoncello that he was facing a 15-year mandatory minimum and a Guidelines recommendation of life. ECF No. 162 at 19-22. Hunter also testified that, once again, he had no recollection of advising Penoncello about the statutory maximum (50 years under the government's latest offer). ECF No. 162 at 19-21;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), 2252(b). Penoncello testified that he continued to be ignorant of the statutory maximums and knew only that, if he pleaded guilty, he would be subject to a 15-year mandatory minimum, and the Guidelines would recommend a sentence of life. ECF No. 162 at 46-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Hunter also testified that he had no memory of discussing with Penoncello any of the other negative consequences that Penoncello could suffer if he went to trial, with one exception: Hunter told Penoncello that, if he went to trial, he would \"have a much harder time convincing the Judge [to only impose] the mandatory minimum.\" ECF No. 162 at 26. But Hunter did \"[not] recall specifically discussing [anything] ... beyond that.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In particular, Hunter\n   testified that he \"[could not] say\" that he ever told Penoncello \"that the best way to achieve the best sentence would be to plead guilty and accept responsibility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hunter further testified that he never told Penoncello that taking the stand and perjuring himself at trial could result in the judge imposing a longer sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Penoncello testified that, far from warning him of the negative consequences of going to trial, Hunter actually told him that no one would much care if he opted to go to trial. Specifically, Hunter told Penoncello \"that the prosecution would chalk it up as training and that there would be no penalty for going to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hunter did not dispute Penoncello's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Hunter testified that while he personally believed that the evidence against Penoncello was overwhelming and that it was in Penoncello's best interest to plead guilty, Hunter \"[could not] say\" that he ever mentioned this to Penoncello.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ECF No. 69. The prosecution introduced a mountain of evidence that Penoncello had sexually abused A.L.M., recorded the sexual abuse, and distributed images of the sexual abuse via the Internet; that Penoncello had sexually abused A.O. and recorded it; that Penoncello had maintained a large collection of child pornography in his home and on his smartphone, including depictions of his sexual abuse of A.L.M. and A.O.; that Penoncello had secretly recorded women and girls undressing in the changing room at the AmericInn; and that Penoncello had lied repeatedly when interviewed by law-enforcement agents before and after his arrest. Both N.T. (A.L.M.'s mother) and A.O. gave credible and moving testimony. The evidence left no doubt that Penoncello was guilty of the crimes charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Penoncello defended himself by taking the stand, insisting that he was innocent of any crime, and presenting the theory that he had been framed by a man named \"Jesse\"-whom, Penoncello said, had been his rival for the affections of a woman (although Penoncello had never actually met Jesse).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 114 at 211-39; ECF No. 118 at 7-33. Penoncello's theory was that, in order to get back at him for something or other, Jesse had sexually assaulted A.L.M. in Penoncello's home during the brief window of time on September 15, 2012 when N.T. was at the emergency room,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   recorded the assault using\n   the same type of smartphone that Penoncello owned at the time, circulated images of the assault on the Internet, and two years later planted photographs and video of the assault on Penoncello's new (password-protected) smartphone. And, apparently fearing that he had not done enough to get Penoncello in trouble, Jesse also managed to persuade the 14-year-old babysitter of Penoncello's son to have sex with Jesse and allow him to record it-and, during the recording, Jesse pulled off a convincing imitation of Penoncello's voice, got A.O. to call him \"Sean,\" and even recorded Penoncello's son at play in his own house. (Nearly three years later, Jesse also planted photographs and video of his encounter with A.O. on Penoncello's new smartphone.) Just in case that was not enough, Jesse also took the time to amass a large collection of child pornography, download it to two thumb drives, add images and video of A.L.M. and A.O., and hide the thumb drives in a vent in Penoncello's home. And to put the icing on the cake, Jesse stole some of Penoncello's clothing, wore it while installing a hidden video camera in the women's changing room at the AmericInn (Penoncello's employer), returned the clothing without Penoncello noticing that it had been missing, recorded women and girls taking off their clothes, removed the video camera, copied the recordings to the thumb drives that he later hid in Penoncello's home, and stashed the video camera in Penoncello's vehicle shortly before the police arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   That was Penoncello's defense-as preposterous a defense as was ever presented in a federal courtroom. After three days of trial (and to the surprise of absolutely no one), the jury convicted Penoncello of all charges after a brief deliberation. ECF Nos. 73, 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Penoncello appeared before the Court for sentencing on March 10, 2016. ECF No. 99. Hunter requested a downward variance and a sentence of 15 years' imprisonment (the mandatory minimum). ECF No. 89. The government sought a sentence of 480 months' imprisonment. ECF No. 90. The Court sentenced Penoncello to a total of 400 months' imprisonment. ECF No. 99. The Court acknowledged that this was \"an extremely long sentence,\" but found that such a lengthy sentence was warranted because \"Mr. Penoncello committed some of the worst crimes that [the Court had ever] seen, and [then] refused to take any responsibility for those crimes.\" ECF No. 119 at 20-21. The Court said that \"[t]he evidence against Mr. Penoncello was overwhelming\" but that, \"[i]nstead of admitting to [his] crimes ...

Instead, Hunter led Penoncello to believe that, if he went to trial, he would not suffer any negative consequences, except that he \"would not get the three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility\" and he \"would likely have a much harder time convincing the Judge [to] impose only the [15-year] mandatory minimum.\" ECF No. 162 at 12-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As far as Penoncello was concerned, a three-point reduction in his offense level for accepting responsibility was meaningless, as his offense level would likely be capped at 43 whether he received the three-point reduction or not.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513386\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/969/39/#p43\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513386\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/969/39/#p43\">\n    at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (The Court ultimately calculated that, without the cap, Penoncello's offense level would be 51. ECF No. 119 at 5.) And simply stating that it would be \"much harder\" to get a 15-year sentence did not convey the full consequences of going to trial or equip Penoncello to make an informed decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Penoncello was never told that the evidence against him was overwhelming and that he was certain to be convicted, even though Hunter had himself reached that conclusion. Although Hunter claimed that he \"tried to review\" the evidence with Penoncello, Hunter noted that he believed that Penoncello should have been able to \"recognize the clear inference from all of the facts against him.\" ECF No. 162 at 27-28. Further, Hunter did not \"recall specifically\" telling Penoncello that he would almost certainly be convicted, but surmised that he may have told him he had \"great risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Hunter owed Penoncello a duty to explain the likely consequences of going to trial-not just to hope that Penoncello would figure that out for himself. Penoncello was neither smart nor well educated. He had no legal training. He had never before been charged with a federal crime nor even with a felony; instead, his criminal record was made up entirely of misdemeanors and petty misdemeanors (mostly traffic offenses). The prospect of facing at least 15 years in a federal prison on a child-pornography offense had him grasping for straws. Without question, a reasonable attorney in Hunter's possession would have told Penoncello that the evidence against him was overwhelming and that he had no realistic chance of being acquitted. Not only did Hunter fail to inform Penoncello of this fact, but Hunter made other statements-such as telling Penoncello \"there you go\" after Penoncello explained the Jesse-framed-me theory-that could have encouraged him to believe that he\n   could be acquitted. ECF No. 162 at 48 (\"[W]hen we were talking about Jesse ... he did encourage me. He said, well, there you go ... [I took that as a v]ery positive, that we could win.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Hunter also never warned Penoncello of the likely impact on his\n   <em>\n    sentence\n   </em>\n   if he went to trial. As any experienced criminal defense attorney knows, the cost of going to trial is not just the loss of a three-point reduction in the offense level for acceptance of responsibility. The cost is also that the judge (who has tremendous discretion in setting a sentence) will sit in the courtroom with the defendant, hour after hour, immersed in evidence about the horrible things the defendant has done. That cost is compounded when victims or their loved ones take the stand and tell the judge about the often devastating impact of the defendant's actions. That cost is compounded even further when the defendant takes the stand, swears to tell the truth, and then perjures himself. That cost is compounded yet further when the defendant attacks his victims or their family members. And then, at the sentencing hearing, neither the defendant nor his attorney is likely to be able to give an effective allocution, as both have to maintain the pretense that the defendant did not commit a crime. It is difficult for a defendant to express remorse for something that he claims not to have done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Hunter had an obligation to inform Penoncello that the best way to minimize his sentence was to tell the truth, plead guilty, and accept responsibility for what he had done. Hunter did not do so. Hunter admitted that he personally believed that it was in Penoncello's best interests to plead guilty, but he \"[could not] say\" that he gave that advice to Penoncello.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. To the contrary, Hunter told Penoncello \"that there would be no penalty for going to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that, prior to trial, Penoncello did not receive effective assistance of counsel because Hunter did not fulfill the \"critical obligation ... to advise the client of 'the advantages and disadvantages of a plea agreement.' \"\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. at 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Libretti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"328015\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/29/#p50\">\n    516 U.S. at 50-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"328015\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/29/#p50\">\n    116 S.Ct. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    B.

Not until the evidentiary hearing on his \u00a7 2255 motion-after he had been advised by new counsel-did Penoncello finally admit\n   that he was guilty of the crimes charged.

The court explained that, based on his attorney's advice, the defendant \"believed he was only risking seven additional years for a chance at acquittal,\" but \"[i]n actuality, [he] was risking thirty-seven years for the chance at acquittal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564431\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/487/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court reasoned that \"[t]o gamble with seven years for the slim chance of acquittal might be a reasonable calculus for some. It is hard to imagine, however, that any reasonable defendant\n   would be willing to risk thirty-seven years for the remote chance of acquittal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564431\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/487/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Notably, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Julian\n   </em>\n   had been told that, if he lost at trial, he would receive a longer sentence; in other words, the\n   <em>\n    Julian\n   </em>\n   defendant at least knew that there would be\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   cost to going to trial. Penoncello did not know even that. Penoncello had not been told that his sentencing exposure would increase by 50 years if he rejected the government's plea offer and went to trial, but instead was led to believe that his exposure would be the same (15 years to life). Penoncello was also told that the government would not care if he went to trial, but would just \"chalk it up as training.\" ECF No. 162 at 45. And Penoncello was not told of any of the myriad ways that going to trial would likely result in the judge giving him a longer sentence. Under the circumstances, Penoncello made the rational decision that, \"looking at [a] life [sentence either way] ... and with nothing to lose, I thought we had to go to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   This is not something that Penoncello invented while preparing for the evidentiary hearing on his \u00a7 2255 motion. More than two years earlier, Penoncello wrote a letter to his mother-a letter that Penoncello had no reason to believe would be read by anyone but his mother.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 12. In that letter, Penoncello explained to his mother that Hunter had advised him that he would \"be looking at the same sentence\" whether he pleaded guilty or went to trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Penoncello told his mother that it was not until \"months after [sentencing]\" that he learned that he \"would be looking at a lot less time\" if he had pleaded guilty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In sum, had Penoncello received effective assistance of counsel, he would have understood that it was utterly irrational for him to turn down the government's plea offer and go to trial. He had nothing to gain and everything to lose. Defendants are human beings, of course, and human beings sometimes act irrationally (particularly when under great stress). But, in order to establish prejudice, Penoncello need only establish a \"reasonable probability\" that, had he received the effective assistance of counsel, he would have accepted the government's initial plea offer.\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188490\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/134/#p147\">\n    566 U.S. at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188490\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/134/#p147\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Penoncello has done so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Penoncello must also establish a \"reasonable probability\" that the government would not have withdrawn the plea offer before he accepted it, that the Court would have accepted the plea agreement, and \"that the end result of the criminal process would have been more favorable by reason of a plea to a lesser charge or a sentence of less prison time.\"\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   , 566 U.S. at 147,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188490\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/134/#p147\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . None of these factors is in dispute. Buzicky told Hunter that the original plea offer would remain open until June 3, 2015, and Buzicky is a prosecutor who keeps her word. The Court is not aware of any reason why it would have rejected the plea agreement. And the Court does not doubt that it would have given Penoncello a sentence substantially below 400 months if he had accepted the government's plea agreement and testified honestly about his crimes at the change-of-plea hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Even if the Court had imposed the statutory maximum sentence, Penoncello would have received a sentence of 360 months-40 months below the sentence he ultimately received. And it is unlikely that the Court would have imposed the statutory maximum if Penoncello had promptly pleaded guilty, expressed remorse, and spared everyone-especially his victims and the jurors-the burden of trial. At the sentencing hearing, the Court acknowledged that it was imposing \"an extremely long sentence,\" but explained that such a long sentence was warranted given that \"Penoncello committed some of the worst crimes that [the Court had ever] seen, and [then] refused to take any responsibility for those crimes.\" ECF No. 119 at 20-21. The Court went on to lament that although \"[t]he evidence against Mr. Penoncello was overwhelming ... [i]nstead of admitting to [his] crimes ... Penoncello told pathetic lies to investigators and then, at trial, took the stand and perjured himself by telling a preposterous story about a frame-up that was so complicated that not even the CIA could've pulled it off.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24. Had Penoncello pleaded guilty, been honest, and expressed remorse, the Court likely would have imposed a long sentence, but one shorter than 360 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds not only that Hunter's \"representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\" but also \"that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 688, 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    C.

The Court does not give this fact much weight, however. Penoncello had repeatedly testified under oath that he had not committed a crime.
