BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I know I've been a real bad girl\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    (I'll try to change)\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    I didn't mean for you to get hurt whatsoever\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case is about whether a performer (\"Gwen Stefani\" or \"Defendant Stefani\") and the company who booked the performer and oversaw the performance (\"Live Nation\" or \"Defendant Live Nation\") should be held liable for a concert patron's (\"Plaintiff\") personal injuries after the performer invited patrons to move toward the stage, prompting an alleged \"stampede crowd rush.\" (Doc. No. 13 \u00b6 24(a) ). The\n   record establishes, the parties agree, and/or the parties do not dispute the following.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Stefani's Invitation and Plaintiff's Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 23, 2016, Plaintiff attended a Gwen Stefani concert at PNC Music Pavilion in Charlotte, North Carolina, a venue owned and operated by Live Nation Worldwide, Inc. (\"Live Nation\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 13 \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10). Live Nation booked singer Gwen Stefani to perform at PNC Pavilion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). PNC Pavilion has two main seating options for attending patrons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). There are approximately 8,614 reserved theatre-style seats (\"reserved area\") closer to the performance stage and approximately 10,154 available spaces in the lawn seating area farther from the stage (\"lawn\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff purchased a ticket in the reserved seating area, specifically in section 7, row v, seat 20 and attended the concert with a group of her friends. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12). Defendant Stefani entered an annotated diagram of the venue into evidence, which the Court incorporates below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Doc. No. 40-3: Diagram of PNC Pavilion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Twenty minutes into Stefani's performance, Stefani invited patrons to move closer to the performance stage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I'm just going to tell you something. I'm just going to talk to the security guards for one second. If anyone wants to come down a little closer so I can see you a little better, just come on down, I don't think anyone's going to care, like just fill it in and like and you know, who cares\n   about your lawn chairs, you can get new ones.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Doc. No. 40-4 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following this announcement, a crowd of lawn patrons moved through the reserved area and climbed over chairs and railings to get closer to the performance stage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff claims that, at this juncture, she was terrified as she saw the crowd moving forward behind her. (Doc. No. 59 at 2). She alleges that, in an attempt to escape the danger, she left her seat, moved left toward the aisle, and tried to move in the opposite direction of the stage to try and \"get out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff asserts she could not get out because \"she was being pushed by the crowd rushing toward the stage, and feeling \"hydroplaned,\" was then trampled and forcibly pushed into a wall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She ended up injured on the ground \"at the top of section 2 close to the VIP barricades.\" (Doc. No. 39 at 4). Plaintiff's injury occurred approximately five minutes after Stefani's initial announcement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Paramedics transported Plaintiff to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a lateral tibial plateau fracture to her left leg. (Doc. No. 13 \u00b6 18). Plaintiff underwent surgery approximately two weeks later. (Doc. No. 40-1 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Live Nation's Response and Stefani's Retraction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Live Nation employed security personnel to staff Stefani's performance and supplied security barriers at certain locations to manage crowd control. (Doc. No. 13 \u00b6 14). Live Nation has placed various physical barricades in the venue to block off the lawn section from the reserved section. (Doc. No. 39 at 5). These barricades include a concrete wall extending around the perimeter of the upper reserved area, railings separating the lawn area from the upper reserved area, and bicycle racks positioned throughout the venue at the tops of the sections where guest services employees are stationed. (Doc. No. 39-11 at 15-16, 24-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Live Nation staffed the Stefani concert with over thirty ushers assigned to various seating sections at the Pavilion, fifty-two total civilian security personnel, and twenty-seven off-duty police officers deployed in and around the venue. (Doc. No. 39 at 5). Nevertheless, Plaintiff and Plaintiff's friends claim that they saw very few Live Nation security personnel during the alleged stampede and heard no safety instructions from security personnel. Plaintiff asserts she saw only one possible security individual during the crowd rush when patrons were jumping over seats and moving forward. (Doc. No. 59 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Live Nation held a security briefing for security personnel prior to the concert. (Doc. No. 39 at 5). At this briefing, security personnel did not specifically discuss what to do in an event of a crowd rush to protect patrons. (Doc. No. 60 at 6). Charles Singley, a guest services supervisor for Live Nation, testified that Live Nation has a general protocol for when a few patrons (i.e., one to five) attempt to move out of their designated ticket area and toward the stage: \"we try and hold the line ... fast where [they] have the controlled entrances into the sections\" and prevent the few patrons from moving forward (Doc. No. 59-7 at 6-7; Doc. No. 39-11 at 25). But Singley noted that a different procedure applies when there are many people rushing the stage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   However, if it's a massive group of people or more than what would be expected for them to handle, my first concern is their safety, and I typically will instruct them to open that bicycle rack up completely. That way the guests aren't having to climb over the rails so they themselves won't get injured and for\n   them to step up behind the concrete wall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Doc. No. 39-11 at 26;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 59-7 at 7). In the instant case, at least one security agent followed this procedure in response to the numerous lawn patrons rushing toward the stage after Stefani's invitation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 59 at 4). In fact, one of Plaintiff's friends testified that she saw \"one security agent remove a barrier to allow the rush to flow into the reserved sitting area.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   According to Defendant Live Nation, when Stefani initially invited patrons to move toward the stage, Live Nation's Operations Manager Mac Goodrum, who was located in the lawn seating area, \"rushed\" to the reserved seating area and notified the Live Nation General Manager Peter O'Donnell, via two-way radio, of Stefani's announcement. (Doc. No. 39 at 6). When Goodrum arrived in the reserved seating area he instructed ushers \"to not let anybody through.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Goodrum also claims that he tried to stop the patrons who were trying to climb rails and attempted to redirect the ones who had already climbed over. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After receiving the radio call from Goodrum, O'Donnell, who was backstage at the time and near Stefani's tour manager Brian Cross, informed Cross of the issue and instructed Cross to tell Stefani to retract her invitation and tell patrons to return to their ticketed areas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. No. 60 at 8). In turn, Stefani's tour manager communicated with Stefani, who at that point, rescinded the invitation to the crowd about ten minutes after her initial invitation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Hold on a second. So I went back there, I went back to change for you guys, I got in so much trouble for telling you guys to come up here, so, I liked it though, it was fun, like I never get in trouble anymore so it was good, but you guys kind of have to move out of the fire lane or else I'm dead, so, FYI, they said they would beat me afterward and all this stuff so, anyways, I don't want anyone to get hurt, and I'm in trouble, can you please get back to your seats?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Doc. No. 40-5 at 2). Contemporaneous with Goodrum and O'Donnell's efforts, Singley positioned himself at the top of sections 2 and 3 with another guest services employee to prevent the crowd shift from moving forward. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Singley observed patrons climbing over railings and prepositioned bicycle racks at the tops of the sections; however, Singley notes that the majority of patrons gave up, turned around, and walked away. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Instant Suit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On July 7, 2017, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants. (Doc. No. 1). In her Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts individual claims of negligence against (1) Stefani; and (2) Live Nation, under the doctrine of respondeat superior, for the negligence of Live Nation's employed security personnel; and seeks compensatory damages for the alleged negligence. (Doc. 13, \u00b6\u00b6 23-31). Plaintiff also seeks punitive damages against Stefani. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33). In September 2017, Defendants filed answers, (Doc. Nos. 15-16). On January 25, 2018, Defendant Live Nation moved for judgment on the pleadings, (Doc. No. 25). Plaintiff timely filed an opposition brief, and Defendant Live Nation timely filed a reply brief. On August 30, 2018, Defendants Stefani and Live Nation filed separate motions for summary judgment against Plaintiff. (Doc. Nos. 38, 40). Plaintiff timely filed opposition briefing to both Defendants' motions, (Doc. Nos. 59, 60), and Defendants timely filed reply briefs (Doc. Nos. 65, 68). On November 28, 2018, the Court held oral arguments on the pending motions. Having been fully briefed and argued, these motions are now ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Rather, Stefani attempts to circumvent the issue of her alleged negligence altogether by contending that her concert statements are protected speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and thus necessitate summary judgment on Plaintiff's negligence claim. Stefani asserts that because her statements do not fall into one of the exceptions to the First Amendment, she cannot be held liable in tort. The Court agrees that Stefani's statements do not fall squarely within one of the previously recognized categorical exemptions to First Amendment protection. However, the Court disagrees that the First Amendment immunizes all other speech falling outside these categories, including negligent speech which results in bodily injury to others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   It is the Court's duty to determine, as a question of law, whether a statement should be afforded First Amendment protection if the facts are not in dispute.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rosenbloom v.

As mentioned, the relevant task before the Court is to examine the statements and surrounding circumstances and weigh how those statements either further or hinder the principles and purposes undergirding the First Amendment. In all First Amendment cases, this is the central inquiry. Indeed, the Supreme Court derived these now well-known categorical exceptions by utilizing and applying this balancing test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   There are categories of communication and certain special utterances to which the majestic protection of the First Amendment does not extend because they \"are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Bose Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202607\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/485/#p499\">\n    466 U.S. at 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202607\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/485/#p499\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Chaplinsky v.

Thus, while the Supreme Court has clearly defined five categories of speech which do not further First Amendment principles, these categories are not all-encompassing of unprotected speech. The Supreme Court has not held that all other speech is automatically entitled to broad First Amendment protection. Statements exist outside of these categories which do not further the exposition of ideas, search for truth, and the vitality of a society, but on the contrary, actually disserve society by creating the potential for disorder and danger. Stefani's statements are of such tenor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   i. Stefani's Statement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, the Court must examine Stefani's statement which prompted the current lawsuit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   I'm just going to tell you something. I'm just going to talk to the security guards for one second. If anyone wants to come down a little closer so I can see you a little better, just come on down, I don't think anyone's going to care, like just fill it in and like and you know, who cares about your lawn chairs, you can get new ones.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Doc. No. 40-4 at 2). On its face, Stefani's statement was intended to prompt action; it was not intended to further the marketplace of ideas or to aid in \"the common quest for truth and the vitality of society as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Bose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202607\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/485/#p499\">\n    466 U.S. at 503-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202607\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/485/#p499\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Stefani claims that her comments \"were made solely to enhance the feel and experience of her music at her concert.\" (Doc. No. 68 at 3). This might be true, but imbuing Stefani's invitation with artistic significance does not immunize her from being held accountable for negligence and the resulting harm which flowed from her statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   ii. Circumstances in Which Stefani's Statement was Made\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, the Court must assess the circumstances in which Stefani made her statement. Stefani heavily relies on the case of\n   <em>\n    McCollum v. CBS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4652730\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/202/989/\">\n    202 Cal.App.3d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=249%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20187\">\n    249 Cal.Rptr. 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988), to argue that her statement is protected under the First Amendment. In addition to this case being nonbinding, it is distinguishable due to the differing circumstances in which the statement was made. In\n   <em>\n    McCollum\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs sued singer John \"Ozzy\" Osbourne for civil damages for composing, performing, producing, and distributing certain recorded music containing lyrics which plaintiffs claimed resulted in the suicide of their son.\n   <em>\n    McCollum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=249%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20187\">\n    249 Cal.Rptr. at 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs argued that Osbourne's music and lyrics were of such a character as to incite the decedent to commit suicide and intentionally aided, advised, and/or encouraged the decedent to do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=249%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20187\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=249%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20187\">\n    at 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The California Court of Appeals rejected the plaintiffs' arguments and held that the First Amendment protected Osbourne's musical lyrics.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=249%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20187\">\n    249 Cal.Rptr. at 193-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Stefani analogizes the present case to\n   <em>\n    McCollum\n   </em>\n   and asserts that First Amendment protection should apply to her statement made at a musical performance too. But, Stefani ignores the circumstances and reasoning behind\n   <em>\n    McCollum\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In reaching its decision, the California Court of Appeals noted that it must conclude \"in order to find a culpable incitement, (1) that Osbourne's music was directed and intended toward the goal of bringing about the imminent suicide of listeners and (2) that it was likely to produce such a result.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=249%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20187\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=249%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20187\">\n    at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court emphasized the lack of intent or likelihood on Osbourne's part: \"None of the lyrics relied upon by plaintiffs, even accepting their literal interpretation of the words, purport to order or command anyone to any concrete action at any specific time, much less immediately.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=249%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20187\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=249%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20187\">\n    at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court noted that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [t]his is particularly true when the artist's performance of such musical lyrics and poetry was physically and temporarily remote from the listener who only subsequently hears such performance by means of an electronic recording.

First,\n   <em>\n    McCollum\n   </em>\n   involved substantive lyrics-not concert directions-which could be seen as triggering fundamental principles of First Amendment protection. Second, unlike the\n   <em>\n    McCollum\n   </em>\n   plaintiff who was physically and temporarily distant from the artist and musical performance at issue, Plaintiff was in the same time and place as Stefani when Stefani invited the audience to come forward. Stefani made her statement during a live musical performance-she knew the exact circumstances and conditions under which the concert attendees would receive her message. Stefani issued an in-person invitation to thousands of people in a stadium-like arena to come forward toward the stage. And Stefani's announcement, unlike the lyrics in\n   <em>\n    McCollum\n   </em>\n   , was intended to produce immediate action and was likely to bring that action about. Therefore, a jury could find that Stefani could have anticipated the reaction that her statement would prompt: thousands of people, many of whom were consuming alcohol, to descend toward the stage immediately. And it is foreseeable that in this mass movement, someone could get hurt. Overall, Stefani's in-person invitation weighs more toward a statement prompting immediate and likely action than one promoting artistic expression and the free exchange of ideas (i.e., one meriting First Amendment protection).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff's case is more analogous to\n   <em>\n    Weirum v.

The\n   <em>\n    Weirum\n   </em>\n   case involved the transmission of a contemporaneous invitation to listeners and a clear call to action. In fact, Plaintiff's case is even stronger on the foreseeability prong because Stefani's announcement was made to listeners in her immediate presence rather than through a medium such as the radio or television. Stefani could foresee what would likely occur in the Pavilion as a result of her invitation with her own eyes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   iii. Furtherance or Hindrance of First Amendment Principles\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The last step in the Court's First Amendment inquiry is to weigh how Stefani's statement and the circumstances in which it was made either further or hinder the principles and purposes undergirding the First Amendment. The Court must ask whether allowing a negligence action to go forward against Stefani (and thus \"punishing\" her for her speech) would curtail the exposition of ideas, the \"common quest for truth,\" or \"the vitality of society as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Bose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202607\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/485/#p499\">\n    466 U.S. at 503-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202607\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/485/#p499\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendant argues that imposing tort liability on Stefani for her concert announcement would have a \"chilling effect\" on the flow of free speech. On the contrary, imposing liability on Stefani would incentivize performers to abide by the safety precautions in place at concert venues and to maintain and promote order and safety during performances. In sum, the Court finds that Stefani's statement is of the same character of speech which the Supreme Court has held to have \"no essential part of any exposition of ideas\" and has \"such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from [the statement] is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\"\n   <em>\n    Chaplinsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374637\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/568/#p572\">\n    315 U.S. at 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"374637\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/315/568/#p572\">\n    62 S.Ct. 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Stefani's statement is not entitled to the protection of the First Amendment. The First Amendment does not preclude Plaintiff from bringing a negligence claim against Stefani.

To be awarded punitive damages, Plaintiff must first show that she is entitled to compensatory damages, and she must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that Stefani's conduct was \"willful\" or \"wanton.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1D-15(a) - (b).

On the other hand, Defendant has proffered the testimony of multiple, longtime Live Nation employees that, in their many years of experience working at the PNC Pavilion, they had never previously seen a performer inviting patrons to approach the stage. (Doc. No. 39 at 9-10). Only one Live Nation employee, Charles Singley, remembered a previous performer inviting fans to move closer to the stage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He noted that this incident occurred fifteen years prior to the incident at issue here. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

The undisputed facts reveal that Plaintiff's injury occurred nearly five minutes after Stefani's initial invitation. The immediacy of the situation-the crowd rush prompted by Stefani's invitation-is apparent; Live Nation did not have a reasonable amount of time to remove the danger or to give warning of its presence. Live Nation learned of the danger when Plaintiff did, and its reaction to the unforeseen chaos was well within the reasonable care standard. Thus, the Court finds that Live Nation did not owe Plaintiff a duty to protect Plaintiff from the crowd rush and prevent her injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Even if Live Nation owed Plaintiff a duty, it did not breach that duty.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Although the Court finds that no duty existed and could stop the inquiry here, the Court chooses to examine the element of breach. Plaintiff claims that Defendant Live Nation breached its duty of care to Plaintiff by taking no action to prevent patrons in the lawn seating area from moving closer toward the stage and by failing to provide security barricades and other security matter and take adequate measures to prevent patrons moving from the lawn area into the reserved seating area. On the night of Stefani's concert, Live Nation personnel, (1) \"positioned themselves in the aisles between, and at the tops of, the reserved seating sections to hold the crowd back from gaining access to the lower reserved area closest to the stage\" and (2) communicated with Stefani's tour manager to instruct Stefani to rescind her invitation. (Doc. No. 39 at 12). Additionally, Live Nation's security and safety measures on the night of Stefani's concert included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \u2022 A five-feet-high concrete wall separating the upper reserved seating area, where Plaintiff was ticketed to sit, from the sections behind her\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \u2022 A system of rails separating Plaintiff's section from those above/behind her\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \u2022 Bicycle racks positioned throughout the venue, including at the tops of the reserved seating sections, where Live Nation's guest services employees were stationed\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \u2022 Over thirty Live Nation ushers/guest services staff and fifty-two total civilian security personnel throughout the venue, including in the reserved seating sections\n   \u2022 Twenty-seven off-duty police officers deployed in and around the venue\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \u2022 A pre-concert meeting/briefing held before Stefani's performance began, for the express purpose of coordinating venue security efforts\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \u2022 Pre-season training of staff, including instruction on how to respond to the unlikely event of a large and sudden crowd movement toward a barricade in an effort to mitigate against mass injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (Doc. No. 39 at 12). Plaintiff has not argued, nor provided expert testimony, as to why the above measures were insufficient. Rather, Plaintiff asserts that she and her friends \"saw virtually no security during the rush.\" (Doc. No. 60 at 10). The only specific \"breach\" that Plaintiff alleges is that \"the barrier that separates the lawn area from the aisle leading to where the Plaintiff was trampled, was removed during the crowd rush to allow the crowd to stampede through the aisle toward the stage where Plaintiff was trampled.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Here again, Plaintiff has not provided any testimony, besides her own, as to why the movement of a barricade in the midst of a large crowd rush is a breach of the standard of care. In fact, Live Nation contends that the movement was done to aid patron safety and mitigate against injury and was consistent with Live Nation's standard protocol for responding to a crowd rush of \"a massive group of people.\" (Doc. Nos. 39 at 13; 39-11 at 26; 59-7 at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiff relies on the case of\n   <em>\n    Custini v. Radio City Productions, LLC\n   </em>\n   to argue that the question of breach of duty should be taken to the jury.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202459852\">\n    2009 WL 2459852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2009). In\n   <em>\n    Custini\n   </em>\n   , during a performance at Radio City Music Hall, the show was postponed due to a musician union strike after the audience arrived and was seated. The defendant-show operator incited an angry crowd movement by making a late announcement that the show the plaintiff was attending was postponed and asking the audience to leave. A resulting crowd rush ensued in the inner lobby, and the plaintiff was trampled. The court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of plaintiff's negligence claims against the defendant for failing to control and contain the crowd rush.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiff analogizes the present case to the facts in\n   <em>\n    Custini\n   </em>\n   to argue that summary judgment is improper on the issue of breach. Plaintiff's analogy is misplaced because the instant case is distinguishable. First, the defendant-show operator made the announcement in\n   <em>\n    Custini\n   </em>\n   and was thus the party responsible for inciting the crowd rush. Dissimilar from\n   <em>\n    Custini\n   </em>\n   , here, Stefani-a third party-made the initial announcement which triggered the crowd rush. Thus, the inquiry in\n   <em>\n    Custini\n   </em>\n   was not whether and to what extent a venue owner/operator is liable for the alleged wrongful conduct of a third party. Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Custini\n   </em>\n   the defendant-show operator had advance notice of the circumstances which led to the postponement announcement; here, Live Nation had no advance notice or warning of Stefani's announcement inviting the crowd to come forward. Stefani's announcement was a unilateral move which prompted patrons to move toward the stage. As such, Live Nation cannot be held responsible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Assuming arguendo that Defendant Live Nation had a duty and breached that duty, Plaintiff still cannot show that Live Nation caused her injury.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Assuming arguendo that Plaintiff has forecasted sufficient evidence as to the elements of duty and breach, to succeed on her negligence claim against Live Nation, Plaintiff must still show that Live Nation's alleged breached actually and proximately caused her injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=675%20S.E.2d%20666\">\n    675 S.E.2d at 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
