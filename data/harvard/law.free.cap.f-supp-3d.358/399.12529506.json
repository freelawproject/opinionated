Before the Court is Defendants' summary judgment motion [\"the motion\"] (ECF Doc. 467) under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure [\"Fed. R. Civ. P.\" or \"Rule\"] 56(a) that the relevant patent claims are unpatentable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant Xactware Solutions, Inc., is a subsidiary of Defendant Verisk Analytics, and provides online technology tools and systems to insurance carriers, remodelers and construction service providers for determining replacement-cost. The parties have asserted they are competitors to each other (ECF Doc. 15:\u00b6 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court assumes the parties' familiarity with the procedural history of this litigation and points to only those events relevant to the motion. On 23 September 2015, plaintiffs filed their original complaint against defendants and on 30 November 2015, an amended complaint. Both of these (ECF Docs. 1 and 30) allege direct and indirect infringement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 271(a) and (b) of at least one claim of each patent at issue. The case has proceeded through various milestones, including the\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   hearing and the\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   opinion (ECF Doc. 332). The parties have completed discovery, exchanged expert reports and disclosures, and submitted summary judgment motions aiming to dispose of certain issues or of the case itself, as well as motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude experts' testimony (\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions\"). ECF Doc. 459 - 474. This is one of the summary judgment motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    2.0 Parties Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    2.1 Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants contend there is no dispute of material fact that the relevant claims are unpatentable as a matter of law in light of the Supreme Court's two-step test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int'l.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20208\">\n    573 U.S. 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2350\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2350,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2350\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). In particular, defendants assert the patent claims fail step 1 of\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   for reciting the abstract idea of using photogrammetry to calculate roof slope (pitch) and other geometric measurements of a building and then to generate a roof report from the calculations. ECF Doc. 468:6-9, 17-19. They further assert the claims also fail\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step two, and specifically, no material fact dispute exists as to whether the claims recite computer elements operating in a manner that is well-understood, conventional, and routine. ECF Doc. 468:19-27-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs counter that defendants' analysis of\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step one is incorrect. Since the human mind cannot perform the claimed steps, in particular, the generation of a three-dimensional model of two or more correlated but different views of a roof, the recited method is not merely a computerized replacement of mental activity, but a new, computerized method of generating roof reports, improved over manual report creation. ECF Doc. 504: 19-20, 39-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue defendants' analysis of\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step two is likewise incorrect. The\n   specific improvements recited in the claims, in particular, the use of non-stereoscopic images of roofs, was neither known nor routine and is an inventive step over the prior art.

The\n    <em>\n     Thales\n    </em>\n    inertial sensors are similar in function to selected points on the aerial images of a roof, which in the relevant claims are the fundamental mechanism to accomplish correlation of non-stereoscopic geometry of different points on a roof.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The Court does not find the asserted claims are directed to patent-ineligible subject matter as in\n    <em>\n     Affinity Labs\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174961\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/1253/#p1257\">\n     838 F.3d at 1258\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [claims found directed to patent ineligible subject matter, to wit, directed to delivering broadcast content to cell phones without a technological improvement for effecting that delivery and therefore judged ineligible] or in\n    <em>\n     Intellectual Ventures I LLC v.

Cir. 2016) [claims also found patent ineligible, that is, directed to characterizing e-mail based on received identifiers, and filtering the e-mail based on the identifiers]. Nor does the Court find the asserted claims directed to merely a result-roof estimation report- or \"a process that qualifies as an 'abstract idea' for which computers are involved merely as a tool\" (\n    <em>\n     Enfish\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1335\">\n     822 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1335-36 ). Rather, as in\n    <em>\n     Finjan, Inc. v. Blue Coat Systems, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267136\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/1299/#p1305\">\n     879 F.3d 1299\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1305 (Fed.Cir. 2018), the claims recite steps that achieve the result by defining an improvement to computer functionality.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Emphasized in\n    <em>\n     Enfish\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Thales\n    </em>\n    is that the addition of a well-defined improvement directed to solving a technical problem is patent eligible subject matter. Applying the first step of the \u00a7 101 inquiry to the asserted claims, the Court concludes the asserted claims are directed to an improvement in the functioning of a computer. They solve the specific problem of generating a roof repair estimate without direct human measurement of a roof. The claims rely on the concrete and specific technological solution of a computer's correlating, with or without user input, different locations points on two, different, non-stereoscopic aerial views of a roof section and then calculating via photogrammetric methods from the correlated aerial views a mathematical model of the roof section.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    <strong>\n     4.2\n     <em>\n      Alice\n     </em>\n     Step Two: Inventive Concept\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Since the Court has found the relevant claims patent eligible under step one of the \u00a7 101 inquiry, the analysis may end here. However, even if the claims were found directed to an abstract idea, a step two inquiry shows defendants have not met their clear and convincing burden that there is no material fact dispute as to\n    whether the claim elements are routine or conventional. In step two, the claims are reviewed for their embodying a \"specific, discrete implementation of the abstract idea\" and thus an inventive concept.\n    <em>\n     BASCOM\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1350\">\n     827 F.3d at 1350\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    As stated above, the asserted claims recite a specific set of steps to create a roof \"model\" (i.e., a mathematical construct) by correlation of two (or more) non-stereoscopic aerial views. The correlation steps and the steps in which a user may change correlated locations in the aerial views give rise to a presumption of a specific implementation of photogrammetric methods combined with roof pitch estimation, which in turn suggests a\n    <em>\n     specific\n    </em>\n    inventive concept.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Moreover, the parties dispute whether the human mind is even capable of mentally combining two non-stereoscopic views of an image into a third without first drawing the two views on paper in order to correlate the image into a unity. If the human mind is not so capable, this question belies there are no material facts in dispute and implies that the recited method, even if an abstract idea or pre-empting the entire field of computerized roof report generation, represents an improvement in the functioning of a computer, again, a specific inventive concept.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Other than asserting that the claims are the mere combination of photogrammetry and roof pitch estimation, defendants have not presented clear and convincing evidence that the specific combination of the claimed method steps or system elements were routine, well-understood or conventional at the time of the invention according to one of skill in the art in the field of generating roof pitch estimation reports.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Finally, the Court addresses plaintiffs' assertion that the USPTO had already weighed in on the patent eligibility of the claims during the prosecution of the '436 patent and the '840 patent. ECF Doc. 504:4, fn. 1. On pg.2 of a USPTO Non-Final Office Action for the '436 patent dated 10 May 2011,\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    the examiner rejected certain of the original claims under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    for being directed to non-statutory subject matter. In reviewing the '436 patent specification for the definition of the recited term \"machine-readable medium\", the examiner found that term to mean \"data signal\". This grounded his \u00a7 101 rejection of claims 14-22 for reciting subject matter outside the four patent eligible categories. Specifically, a data signal is not a machine, article of manufacture, method, or composition of matter.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    It is clear from the prosecution history that the USPTO had not considered the patent eligibility of the relevant claims to the extent the Office reviews computerized improvement claims today after\n    <em>\n     Alice\n    </em>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    Largely, this \u00a7 101 rejection concerned an informality in claim language,\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    which the\n    patentee fixed by adding the element \"non-transitory\". Thus, the implication that relevant patent claims had been subjected by the USPTO to a \u00a7 101 inquiry and emerged unscathed is misleading.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <strong>\n     5.0 Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    In sum, the Court holds it has not been demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence on the summary judgment record that either the relevant claims are directed to an abstract idea or embody no inventive concept. This motion is therefore DENIED.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-87\">\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Sean B.
