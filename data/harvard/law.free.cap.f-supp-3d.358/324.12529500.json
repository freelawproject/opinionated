BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Millions of New Yorkers rely on the subway to get to work, school, and their friends and family. To access the subway, riders must go through one of New York City's 472 subway stations. Middletown Road Station is one such station. Defs.' Responses \u00b6 1. It is located in the Bronx along the IRT Pelham Line and serves the 6 train. Defs.' Responses \u00b6 1. Middletown Road Station is an elevated station; to board a train, riders must climb one set of stairs to reach a mezzanine area and buy a ticket, then climb a second set of stairs to reach the train platforms. Defs.' Responses \u00b6 2. This path is the only means by which users may board a train at the Station, as no elevators are available. Defs.' Responses \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2003, NYCTA began planning renovations for the station in order to bring it to a \"state of good repair,\" as required under Department of Transportation (\"DOT\") regulations. Pls.' Responses \u00b6 26. These renovations were be part of a larger project to renovate nine elevated stations along the IRT Pelham Line, from Whitlock Avenue Station at the southern end to Buhre Avenue Station at the northern end. Pls.' Responses \u00b6 28. The project design phase for the Middletown Road Station renovations was completed by an NYCTA design team in 2007. Pls.'

The FTA reviews grant applications for, among other things, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Federal Transit Administration, Tips for ADA Compliance (Apr. 22, 2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FTA may only award grant assistance to projects that have been certified as ADA-compliant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Federal Transit Administration, FTA Fiscal Year 2018 Certifications and Assurances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The project master plan and design documents submitted to the FTA included the scope of the intended renovations. The master plan did not include plans for the installation of elevators at the Middletown Road Station. Pls.' Responses \u00b6 31. In fact, no station on the Pelham Line slated for renovations included the installation of any elevators. Pls.' Responses \u00b6\u00b6 31, 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2008, Defendants withdrew their request for FTA funding for the northernmost\n   four of the nine planned Pelham Line stations, including the Middletown Road Station, intending instead to pursue the renovations as part of their 2010-2014 capital plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pls.' Responses \u00b6 33. In August 2011, Defendants determined that they would limit the scope of the renovations at these northernmost four stations, relabeling each from a \"rehabilitation project\" to a \"renewal project.\" Pls.' Responses \u00b6 35. The revised scope of work for the Middletown Road Station included, among other changes, the repair and replacement of the mezzanine's steel framing; the replacement of floors, walls, railings, and platforms; the installation of new lighting on the mezzanine and platforms; repainting; and the replacement of the street-to-mezzanine and mezzanine-to-platform staircases. Pls.' Responses \u00b6 37. The revised scope of work did not provide for the installation of elevators. Pls.' Responses \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In March 2012, Defendants resubmitted to the FTA their request for federal funds for the Middletown Road Station renovations, now more limited in scope. Pls.' Responses \u00b6 36. Defendants resubmitted funding requests for the other three northernmost stations as well. Pls.' Responses \u00b6 36. The FTA granted funding for each station except the Middletown Road Station. Pls.' Responses \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Renovation work on Middletown Road Station took place over a seven-month period that began in October 2013 and ended in May 2014. Defs.' Responses \u00b6 4. The station was closed during this time. Defs.' Responses \u00b6 5. As part of the renovations, Defendants completely replaced the staircases, bringing them into a \"state of good repair\" as defined under DOT guidelines. Defs.' Responses \u00b6\u00b6 17, 18. Defendants also made various renovations to the mezzanine and platform floors, reconstructing platform edges, replacing concrete platforms, and installing new lighting. Pls.'

Section 12147 of Title II regulates the accessibility obligations of public entities making alterations to public transit facilities like subway stations. The densely worded section provides that when a public entity makes alterations to an existing public transportation facility that affect or could affect the \"usability\" of a station or a part thereof,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   it shall be considered discrimination, for purposes of section 12132 of this title and section 794 of title 29, for a public entity to fail to make such alterations (or to ensure that the alterations are made) in such a manner that,\n   <em>\n    to the maximum extent feasible, the altered portions of the facility are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs\n   </em>\n   , upon the completion of such alterations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This provision is known as the \"Accessible Alterations Rule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Section 12147 also provides that when a public entity makes alterations that \"affect[ ] or could affect[ ] [the] usability of or access to an area\" containing a \"primary function,\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   the entity shall also make the alterations in such a manner that,\n   <em>\n    to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area\n   </em>\n   and the bathrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area,\n   <em>\n    are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs ... where such alterations ... are not disproportionate to the overall alterations in terms of cost and scope\n   </em>\n   (as determined under criteria established by the Attorney General).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, Section 12147 recognizes two categories of alterations that can trigger accessibility obligations: those that affect the usability of the station or part of the station, and those that affect the usability of a station area containing a primary function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"), and its subsidiary agency the FTA, are the federal agencies charged with implementing the transit-related provisions of Title II.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012149\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants argue that \u00a7 37.43(a)(2) should apply instead of \u00a7 37.43(a)(1), but no law suggests that either one or the other provision must apply-if both provisions are triggered, both should apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The parties agree that the only issue to be determined by the Court on these cross-motions for summary judgment is whether the scope of work performed at Middletown Road Station triggers the obligations in \u00a7 37.43(a)(1) or (a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   If \u00a7 37.43(a)(1) applies, Defendants must make whatever renovations are required no matter the cost.

Defendants argue that the scope of work performed triggered the obligations set forth in \u00a7 37.43(a)(2) and not (a)(1). The Court finds that \u00a7 37.43(a)(1) applies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accessibility obligations under \u00a7 37.43(a)(1) are triggered \"[w]hen a public entity alters an existing facility or a part of an existing facility used in providing designated public transportation services in a way that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility.\" The Court finds that Defendants' renewal project, which involved the replacement of the stairways at the Middletown Road Station, clearly met this condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   There is no dispute that Middletown Road Station is \"an existing facility used in providing designated public transportation services.\" So the sole question is whether Defendants \"alter[ed]\" the station \"in a way that affects or could affect [its] usability\" by, among other things, replacing the stairways. DOT regulations define an \"alteration\" as such:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Alteration means a change to an existing facility, including, but not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, changes or rearrangement in structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions. Normal maintenance, reroofing, painting or wallpapering, asbestos removal, or changes to mechanical or electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or facility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2037.3\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 37.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants entirely replaced the stairways at Middletown Road Station with new stairways as part of a major renewal project that also included replacement of walls, floors, railings, and platforms. This amounts to a \"reconstruction\" or \"renovation\" of the station, including the stairways, and thus an alteration. Indeed, Defendants do not dispute that their stairway replacement amounted to an \"alteration,\" referring to it as such multiple times in their briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 100 at 14, 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants' replacement of the stairways also affected the usability of the facility. \"Usability\" is left undefined in \u00a7\u00a7 37.43(a)(1) and (a)(2), but the Department of Justice, discussing the term in the context of Title III of the ADA, has stated that it should \"be read broadly to include any change that affects the usability of the facility, not simply changes that relate directly to access by individuals with disabilities.\" Final Rule,\n   Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability by Public Accommodations and in Commercial Facilities,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20Fed.%20Reg.%2035544\">\n    56 Fed.

The alteration thus triggered accessibility obligations under \u00a7 37.43(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants argue that \u00a7 37.43(a)(2), not (a)(1), applies to the alteration because the renovations were to areas of the station that contained a \"primary function.\" But (a)(1) and (a)(2) are not mutually exclusive. Under \u00a7 37.43(a)(2), accessibility obligations are triggered when \"a public entity undertakes an alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area of a facility containing a primary function.\" An alteration can both affect the usability of a facility, which triggers (a)(1), and affect the usability of or access to an area of a facility containing a primary function, which triggers (a)(2). In addition to replacing the stairways, Defendants made extensive alterations to the mezzanine and platform floors of the station. Since these floors are where tickets are bought and trains are boarded, they clearly contain primary functions. Therefore, the Court agrees with Defendants that \u00a7 37.43(a)(2) also arguably applies to the renovations made at Middletown Road Station. Plaintiffs do not dispute this, and the government recognizes that \u00a7 37.43(a)(2) applies to a less broad set of alterations that are \"additional\" to those triggered under (a)(1),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 106 at 10.

The parties have represented to the Court multiple times that the sole issue to be decided in these cross-motions is whether the alterations at Middletown Road Station triggered \u00a7 37.43(a)(1) or (a)(2).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 80 at 5, Doc. 85 at 24:24-25:1. Consequently, the Court will address this issue only.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    In 2015, the FTA issued a guidance that specifically addresses what accessibility obligations a public entity triggers by replacing a staircase. In the guidance, the FTA makes clear that \"[w]hen the altered area is the path of travel,\" like \"passageways between platforms, staircases, and escalators,\" the element of the path of travel undergoing alteration \"will be subject to the general requirement of \u00a7 37.43(a)(1) that the altered area be accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, including wheelchair users, to the maximum extent feasible.\" FTA, Circular C 4710.1 at \u00a7 3.4.3. Plaintiffs and the federal government argue that the Court should defer to the guidance's interpretation of \u00a7 37.43(a)(1) under\n    <em>\n     Auer v. Robbins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11596027\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/452/\">\n     519 U.S. 452\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11596027\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/452/\">\n     117 S.Ct. 905\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11596027\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/452/\">\n     137 L.Ed.2d 79\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1997). But because the Court independently arrives at the conclusion that \u00a7 37.43(a)(1) applies to the Middletown Road Station renovations, it does not address whether\n    <em>\n     Auer\n    </em>\n    deference is warranted here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania v.
