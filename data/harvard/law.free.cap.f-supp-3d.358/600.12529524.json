The plaintiffs allege that \"Drag Queen Storytime,\" a monthly event held at the Houston Public Library, violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. (Docket Entry No. 1). Requesting temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the plaintiffs claim that the Library's partnership with \"Drag Queen Storytime\" unlawfully advances an alleged religion, \"secular humanism.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 5, 65-77).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In November 2018, Lawson and Turner moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. (Docket Entry No. 48). The plaintiffs responded, the defendants replied, and the parties submitted supplemental briefs on constitutional standing. (Docket Entry Nos. 42, 43, 56, 59, 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Based on a careful review of the motion, response, reply, the parties' briefs, the record, and the applicable law, the court grants the motion and dismisses the complaint, without prejudice. (Docket Entry Nos. 1, 48). The reasons are detailed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The complaint alleges the following facts, accepted as true for the purpose of the defendants' motion to dismiss.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket Entry No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 11, 47; Docket Entry No. 44 at \u00b6 6 (\"I find the ... entertainers who will [read] at Drag Queen Storytime to be offensive.\") ). Asserting that \"Drag Queen Storytime\" \"violate[s] community standards of decency,\" the plaintiffs \"do not want themselves or their children to be exposed to the exhibition.\" (Docket Entry No. 9 at 13, 18). They complained to Library officials, demanding that the Library terminate \"Drag Queen Storytime.\" (Docket Entry No. 1 at \u00b6 12).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The Library issued a statement in response:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    Throughout their history, American public libraries have been on the front lines of promoting inclusivity and dispelling intolerance.

The plaintiffs disagree, asserting that Library is \"intolerant of anyone who [finds] homosexuality [to be] immoral.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    According to the complaint, the plaintiffs \"pay and will continue to pay taxes of every kind in Harris County.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 55;\n    <em>\n     see\n     <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     at \u00b6 11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; Docket Entry No. 44 at \u00b6 5; Docket Entry No. 45 at \u00b6 8; Docket Entry No. 46 at \u00b6 5). Pastor Miller and Christopher are Library members, and Sevier \"secured a Library card for\" a religious organization's \"members to use.\" (Docket Entry No. 44 at \u00b6 5; Docket Entry No. 45 at \u00b6 8; Docket Entry No. 46 at \u00b6 5).\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    The plaintiffs \"check out books\" and \"rent DVDs\" from, and \"pay for printing\" services at, the Library, and they are \"responsible for [Library] late fees.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The plaintiffs \"have residents [sic] in Houston,\" and they also rent commercial property in Texas. (Docket Entry No. 1 at \u00b6 11; Docket Entry No. 42 at 7-8).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The plaintiffs claim that the \"Library is a public place,\" and that they have \"encountered promotional materials\" for \"Drag Queen Storytime.\" (Docket Entry No. 44 at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6; Docket Entry No. 45 at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9; Docket Entry No. 46 at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6). The plaintiffs allege that the Library has used government funds to host, promote, and advertise \"Drag Queen Storytime,\" and that the Library spent money to \"special[ly] order\" the books for the event. (Docket Entry No. 1 at \u00b6 71). \"Drag Queen Storytime\" is a nonsecular event, the plaintiffs assert, because the LGBTQ community is associated with an alleged religion, secular humanism. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 12, 71). The plaintiffs allege that Lawson has violated Library policies by advancing secular humanism over other religions, including Christianity, and that she has \"regularly denied Christian groups-including ones that the [p]laintiffs are part of-to have Christian related events, even in designated public forums.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 29; Docket Entry No. 44 at \u00b6 4; Docket Entry No. 45 at \u00b6 7; Docket Entry No. 46 at \u00b6 4).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    In October 2018, after the Library hosted two sessions of \"Drag Queen Storytime,\" the plaintiffs sued Lawson and Turner. (Docket Entry No. 1). They also applied for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the \"Drag Queen Storytime\" scheduled for October 27, 2018. (Docket Entry Nos. 3, 8). The plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to relief because hosting \"Drag Queen Storytime\" in the Library advances religion, and a particular religion, in violation of the Establishment Clause. (Docket Entry No. 1 at \u00b6 71). The court denied the plaintiffs' application for temporary relief and Sevier's motion for recusal. (Docket Entry Nos. 3, 25, 38, 41). The plaintiffs then applied for additional temporary restraining orders, and the court ordered the parties to brief constitutional standing before ruling on those applications. (Docket Entry Nos. 29, 32, 34). Lawson and Turner moved to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), the plaintiffs responded, and the defendants replied.

The Seventh Circuit rejected the parents' argument that use of the series was the practice of \"religion\" under the Establishment Clause.

As in\n    <em>\n     Fleischfresser\n    </em>\n    , they fail to raise a constitutional claim because, even accepting that secular humanism could be a religion for Establishment Clause purposes, the plaintiffs fail to allege any facts or basis showing that \"Drag Queen Storytime\" is a religious activity. There is no allegation that a reader discussed secular humanism at the event, or that any story the Library selected invoked secular humanism or any religion at all. The plaintiffs instead make only conclusory statements associating secular humanism with the event. The statements are not entitled to be taken as true.\n    <em>\n     Iqbal\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     556 U.S. at 679\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     129 S.Ct. 1937\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The plaintiffs claim, for example, that \"[a]ll religion amounts to a set of unproven answers to the greater questions like 'why are we here' .... The LGBTQ ideology that will be sermonized at [\"Drag Queen Storytime\"] attempts to answer those questions in a manner that makes the event ... non-secular.\" (Docket Entry No. 1 at \u00b6 69). The plaintiffs also assert that \"Drag Queen Storytime\" \"has nothing to do with 'diversity' and 'tolerance' but with brainwashing the children of Houston to a religious worldview.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 12). The complaint alleges no facts supporting these conclusory statements. Because the plaintiffs do not allege facts that do or could show that the event is a religious activity, there is no issue of establishment of religion, and the complaint fails to state a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983.\n    <em>\n     Fleischfresser\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1527665\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/15/680/#p687\">\n     15 F.3d at 687\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The defendants have invoked qualified immunity.

Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs fail to establish standing. Even if the court had jurisdiction, the complaint fails to state an Establishment Clause claim. The defendants' motion to dismiss, (Docket Entry No. 48), is granted under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). The complaint, (Docket Entry No. 1), is dismissed, without prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction, while noting that the pleading deficiencies under Rule 12(b)(6) could\n    not be cured by amendment, so dismissal on this basis would be with prejudice. The plaintiffs' motions for reconsideration, temporary relief, to stay, and to compel, (Docket Entry Nos. 27, 29, 32, 63), are denied.
