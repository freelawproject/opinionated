Plaintiff suffers from various mental impairments including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\"). He argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") deciding his case erred in two respects: (1) by improperly weighing the medical opinion evidence from his treating psychiatrist, and (2) by failing to properly evaluate his subjective statements regarding his symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Dkt. No. 12) and remands the action, and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Defendant's motion to affirm the Commissioner's decision (Dkt. No. 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff was 46 years old when he filed his applications for SSDI and SSI on May 5, 2014. R. 287. He had previously worked as a construction laborer, a material handler, and an order filler. R. 96-97. Plaintiff alleged disability due to PTSD, depression, and diabetes. R. 144. He also experienced homelessness and struggled with substance abuse. R. 623-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Medical History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 8, 2014, Plaintiff had his first visit with Dr. Jonathan Rothberg, a psychiatrist. R. 471. Plaintiff scored \"very high\" on a questionnaire that screens for depression. R. 471. Dr. Rothberg noted that the depression was \"possibly situational,\" as Plaintiff was unable to secure a case manager at the homeless shelter or find steady work. R. 468, 471. Plaintiff expressed hopelessness. R. 468.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 11, 2014, Plaintiff underwent psychiatric evaluation by Dr. Esther Valdez. R. 623-28. Plaintiff displayed symptoms of anxiety and depression including agitation, depressed mood, irritability, low self-esteem, and worry. R. 626. Dr. Valdez noted that Plaintiff had a depressed and \"angry/hostile\" mood and displayed \"anxious preoccupations.\" R. 626-27. His appearance, alertness, memory, attention, behavior, thought process, and perception were otherwise normal. R. 626-27. Despite his complaints of \"severe depression,\" Plaintiff declined psychiatric intervention because he was \"looking to find an employment advocate and legal aid only.\" R. 627-28. Plaintiff reported regular marijuana use, as well as a history of cocaine and alcohol abuse. R. 623, 625.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff then saw Dr. Dyanne London, a psychotherapist, on April 16, 2014. R. 464-66. During the visit, Plaintiff expressed a desire \"to meet before he explodes\" and reported a history of depression. R. 465. His mental status exam showed cooperative behavior, good impulse control, euthymic mood, appropriate affect, coherent thought process, intact memory, good insight to disorder, and no judgment impairment. R. 465-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 23, 2014, Plaintiff met with Karen Fink, a licensed social worker, who diagnosed him with anxiety disorder and depressive disorder, and considered a PTSD diagnosis. R. 330. Ms. Fink did not record any mental status findings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff saw Edwige Berrouet, another licensed social worker, two days later on April 25, 2014. R. 339. Mr. Berrouet noted that Plaintiff displayed symptoms of anxiety and depression including difficulty concentrating, irritability, worry, anhedonia, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and depressed mood. R. 342. Plaintiff told Mr. Berrouet that he regularly used marijuana to self-medicate, and that he used cocaine \"off and on.\" R. 339, 341. Plaintiff also reported that he had twice seen a psychiatrist for treatment and had been prescribed Paxil, a drug used to treat anxiety and depression. R. 340.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dr. Anna Fitzgerald, a board-certified psychiatrist, also evaluated Plaintiff on April 25, 2014. R. 312. Dr. Fitzgerald noted the following symptoms: decreased appetite, decreased energy level, loss of interest in pleasurable activities, isolation, avoidance, and panic attacks. R. 315-16. Plaintiff's appearance, behavior, attention, language, thought process, perception, orientation, and memory were again normal. R. 316-17. Plaintiff's Global Assessment of Functioning (\"GAF\") score was 55, which was indicative of moderate symptoms. R. 317. Dr. Fitzgerald prescribed Zoloft, an antidepressant, and recommended that Plaintiff begin individual therapy. R. 317-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff saw Dr. Fitzgerald again on May 2, 2014. R. 321. Dr. Fitzgerald noted that Plaintiff \"continue[d] to feel depressed\" and \"also [had] some panic symptoms and posttraumatic reexperiencing [sic], avoidance, and hyperarousal.\" R. 321. Dr. Fitzgerald added trauma to Plaintiff's list of symptoms and noted that Plaintiff experienced flashbacks and nightmares. R. 323. She urged Plaintiff to stop using marijuana and cocaine both \"for his health and for his application for disability.\" R. 321. Dr. Fitzgerald diagnosed Plaintiff with major depressive disorder (recurrent, moderate) and anxiety disorder, but she ruled out a PTSD diagnosis. R. 324\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff continued seeing Dr. Fitzgerald every three months through at least March 2016. R. 696. Notes from these visits, however, are not included in the administrative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     State Agency Medical Consultant Evaluations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Judith Bevis, Ph.D., evaluated Plaintiff on November 18, 2014. R. 691-95. Plaintiff\n   indicated that he was applying for disability benefits because of \"problems with 'job selection.' \" R. 691. He \"appear[ed] to be dysphoric\" and reported that he had \"become quite depressed\" because of his unemployment and other stressors. R. 691. He described disturbances in sleeping habits, mood, and energy level, but had no difficulties with activities of daily living. R. 693-94. He also reported experiences of abuse as a child and often found himself in situations in which he felt victimized. R. 694. Dr. Bevis diagnosed Plaintiff with major depression and PTSD, and recommended therapy. R. 694. She assessed a GAF score of 65, reflecting mild symptoms. R. 695.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff indicated to Dr. Bevis that he wanted to return to full-time construction work and \"seemed to have difficulty figuring out how to transition to a different type of work outside of being a union laborer.\" R. 694. He expressed aversion to low paying jobs that \"do not lead to a career\" and would leave him \"[un]able to support himself.\" R. 692. Dr. Bevis opined that Plaintiff might be a candidate for vocational retraining. R. 694.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On November 26, 2014, psychologist Aryeh Shestopal, Ph.D., reviewed the then available records. R. 127-28. Dr. Shestopal assigned the greatest weight to the assessment completed by Dr. Bevis. R. 128. He found that Plaintiff had \"potential for antagonistic behavior, possibly due to his interpersonal stance of viewing himself as 'victimized,' in the context of early trauma.\" R. 128. He anticipated \"moderate difficulty in following supervisory instructions or adjusting to change\" but found no evidence of significant limitations in other spheres of functioning. R. 128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Treating Psychiatrist Evaluation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On March 21, 2016, during a regular visit, Dr. Fitzgerald diagnosed major depression and PTSD. R. 696. Plaintiff's GAF scored had also decreased to 40.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 696. Dr. Fitzgerald completed a Mental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment for Plaintiff. R. 696-99. Dr. Fitzgerald reported that Plaintiff was moderately or markedly limited in 12 of 21 areas of mental functioning. R. 696-99. She indicated that Plaintiff was moderately limited in his ability to carry out detailed instructions; work in coordination with or proximity to others without being distracted by them; accept instructions and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors; get along with coworkers or peers without distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes; and set realistic goals or make plans independently of others. R. 697-99. His marked limitations included the ability to understand and remember detailed instructions; maintain attention and concentration for extended periods; perform activities within a schedule, maintain regular attendance and be punctual; complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms and perform at a consistent pace; respond appropriately to changes in the work setting; travel to unfamiliar places or use public transportation; and tolerate normal levels of stress. R. 697-99. Dr. Fitzgerald also reported that she had been seeing Plaintiff for treatment every three months since 2014. R. 696.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Hearing Testimony\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the hearing on May 5, 2016, Plaintiff testified that he had depression, anxiety, and PTSD. R. 73. He stated that because of these impairments he had difficulty understanding\n   and remembering instructions, concentrating, maintaining regular attendance and being on time, and tolerating work stress. R. 75-76, 86. He also claimed that his depression and anxiety caused him to \"clash\" with his employers, causing each of his 50 to 60 employment relationships to end after two or three months. R. 73. He stated that his depression improved with medication, but that when his anxiety was triggered he tended to neglect his health and personal needs. R. 87. He testified that he had not used cocaine in 11 months but continued to use marijuana to deal with PTSD. R. 74, 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff filed his applications for SSDI and SSI on May 5, 2014, alleging a disability onset date of May 15, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 200. His applications were denied initially on July 25, 2014, and again on reconsideration on January 22, 2015. R. 119, 141. On March 20, 2015, Plaintiff filed a request for a hearing, which was held before an ALJ on May 5, 2016. R. 63, 157. Plaintiff appeared at the hearing with counsel. R. 65. A vocational expert (\"VE\") also appeared and testified. R. 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The ALJ issued her decision on June 15, 2016. R. 41-57. At step one, the ALJ found that Plaintiff had not engaged in any substantial gainful activity since the onset of his disability. R. 44. At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from a number of severe impairments, including affective disorder, anxiety disorder, PTSD, and polysubstance abuse disorder with occasional marijuana use and cocaine abuse in early remission. R. 44. At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or a combination thereof that met or equaled the severity of one of the impairments listed in the regulations. R. 44-46. Next, the ALJ found that Plaintiff possessed the capacity to perform light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 416.967(b) except that he could only \"manage superficial interactions in the workplace\" and \"adapt to minor changes in workplace demands.\" R. 46-55. In making this determination, the ALJ gave \"less weight\" to the mental functional assessment completed by Plaintiff's treating psychiatrist, Dr. Fitzgerald, in March 2016. R. 55. The ALJ misidentified Dr. Fitzgerald as a \"treating nurse practitioner,\" concluded that she was \"not a medically acceptable treating source,\" and found her assessment \"[un]supported by the objective record\" and, specifically, contradicted by \"treating physician and evaluating source notes and observations.\" R. 53-55. The ALJ gave \"great weight\" to the psychological assessment completed by Dr. Shestopal in November 2014. R. 55. At step four, the ALJ found that Plaintiff could perform his past work as an order filler. R. 56-57. The ALJ concluded that Plaintiff was not disabled under the Social Security Act. R. 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On July 22, 2016, Plaintiff timely requested review of the ALJ's decision by the Appeals Council. R. 198. The Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review on September 14, 2017. R. 6. This appeal then followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Statutory and Regulatory Framework\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under the Social Security Act, a claimant seeking benefits must prove that he is unable \"to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment... for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A), 1382c(a)(3)(A).

The ALJ provided just two bases for discounting Dr. Fitzgerald's opinion: (1) she was \"not a medically acceptable treating source,\" and (2) \"her moderate and marked mental functional assessments [were] not supported by the objective record\n   and, in fact, [were] contradicted by treating physician and evaluating source notes and observations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 55. With respect to the second basis, the ALJ noted that \"the claimant's mental status exams have all been stable or unremarkable, with normal thought process and content, average intelligence, intact memory and concentration, intact insight and judgement, and no evidence of psychosis, suicidal or homicidal ideation.\" R. 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant concedes that the ALJ erred in misidentifying Dr. Fitzgerald as a nurse practitioner rather than a licensed psychiatrist and, therefore, not a treating source as defined by the applicable regulations. Nevertheless, Defendant contends that this error was harmless because the ALJ's other basis for discounting the opinion of Dr. Fitzgerald satisfied the more demanding \"good reasons\" standard for the weight assigned to a treating source. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The ALJ's decision ignores the crucial fact that there is no evidence in the record of Plaintiff's mental condition between November 2014 and Dr. Fitzgerald's RFC assessment from March 2016. In\n   <em>\n    Soto-Cede\u00f1o v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit held that an RFC assessment performed by the claimant's treating psychiatrist could not be \"reasonably characterized as 'inconsistent' with the other medical evidence in record\" where the RFC assessment and other medical evidence were from \"different time periods.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=380%20Fed.%20Appx.%201\">\n    380 Fed. Appx. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2 (1st Cir. 2010) (per curiam). Specifically, the First Circuit found that a \"current\" RFC assessment was not contradicted by the evaluations of consulting psychiatrists performed more than a year earlier.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=380%20Fed.%20Appx.%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This case presents the same question. Dr. Fitzgerald completed her RFC assessment of Plaintiff in March 2016. The state agency medical consultants, Dr. Bevis and Dr. Shestopol, performed their evaluations of Plaintiff more than a year earlier in November 2014. And, other than Dr. Fitzgerald's RFC assessment in March 2016, the most recent medical evidence in the record from a treating source includes Dr. Fitzgerald's notes from April and May 2014. As in\n   <em>\n    Soto-Cede\u00f1o\n   </em>\n   , these older records do not support the ALJ's finding that Dr. Fitzgerald's opinion was inconsistent with the objective record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=380%20Fed.%20Appx.%201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The record appears to be missing treatment notes from 2014, 2015, and 2016. Dr. Fitzgerald's RFC assessment indicates that she had been Plaintiff's treating psychiatrist since 2014 and that she saw Plaintiff\n   every three months. Yet the record includes only Dr. Fitzgerald's treatment notes from an initial appointment in April 2014 and a follow-up appointment in May 2014. In their briefs, the parties spar over whether the ALJ's failure to develop the record to include the missing notes forms an independent basis for reversing the ALJ's decision and remanding for further proceedings. The Court, however, does not need to reach that argument. The key point is that based on the record the ALJ did not know how Plaintiff presented in his mental status exams during 2015 and 2016, which were the exams most relevant to weighing Dr. Fitzgerald's RFC assessment. Accordingly, the ALJ did not have substantial evidence for discounting Dr. Fitzgerald's March 2016 opinion regarding Plaintiff's functional limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Since the ALJ made a serious error in not identifying Dr. Fitzgerald as a treating psychiatrist and provided no plausible reason for its decision to give little weight to her opinion, remand is required.\n   <em>\n    Lemieux v.
