Obligation to Warn Patin\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Although she claims that a telephone call from J &amp; J or an admonition from the auditor would have caused her to abandon the broadcast, Patin gives no support for the implied assertion that they were under any obligation to do so. Indeed, in one of the cases on which Patin relies,\n   <em>\n    J &amp; J Sports Prods., Inc. v. Bouton\n   </em>\n   , No. 12 Civ. 5762,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012979116\">\n    2015 WL 12979116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D. Cal. May 13, 2015), the court struck a defense of unclean hands, stating\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants once again fail to demonstrate how plaintiff's knowledge of their plans to broadcast the Program at Los Vecos rises to 'inequitable conduct' sufficient to sustain this affirmative defense. Plaintiff did not induce defendants into broadcasting the Program illegally, nor did they bear any obligation to protect defendants from the consequences of doing so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The statutes give notice of the illegality of the broadcast. Section 553 clearly forbids what Patin contemplated, and provides for damages, either from $ 250 to over $ 10,000 as the court considers just for the interception, or up to $ 50,000 if the violation was willful\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and to obtain commercial advantage or private financial gain.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (3) (A)-(B). On the other hand, it provides that if \"the violator was not aware and had no reason to believe that his acts constituted a violation of this section, the court in its discretion may reduce the award of damages to a sum of not less than $ 100.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 553 (c) (3) (C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   J &amp; J's motion to strike the defense of failure to mitigate damages is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Excessive Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Patin claims that she faces a possibility of over $ 110,000 in damages, but it is clear from the foregoing that a damage award (perhaps as little as $ 100) would take account of the circumstances of the violation. The topic is thus dependent upon the evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   J &amp; J's motion to dismiss Patin's counterclaim (Dkt. No. 13) and motion to strike her affirmative defenses (Dkt. No. 15) are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   So ordered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Patin recognizes she has no standing to seek redress or clarification on behalf of others, and withdraws any claim to do so. Def. Mem. at 3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    A familiar legal term meaning with the intent to do something the law forbids - with a bad purpose to disobey or to disregard the law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
