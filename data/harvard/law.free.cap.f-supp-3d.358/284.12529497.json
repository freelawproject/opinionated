Plaintiffs allege that their employer, Defendant EPIC Security Corp. (\"EPIC\") and its Vice President, Defendant Selwyn Falk (\"Falk\") (collectively, the \"Defendants\"), failed to pay Plaintiffs for the time they spent driving to and from certain worksites, which time they allege was compensable. Plaintiffs generally allege that they were employed as drivers and required each workday to\n   report to EPIC's headquarters\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Manhattan, pick up a company car, and drive from there to worksites where they worked as security guards. Defendants deny Plaintiffs' allegations; they contend that Plaintiffs were employed as security guards and compensated properly and that Plaintiffs were free to report directly to worksites and that use of a company car was for Plaintiffs' convenience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties consented for all purposes (including trial) to be held before me, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Consent, ECF No. 115.) The Court conducted a bench trial from December 10, 2018 through December 14, 2018, and on January 7, 2019. Having considered all the evidence and assessed the credibility of the witnesses, the Court makes findings of fact and conclusions of law, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52, as set forth in this Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff David Williams (\"Williams\") filed this collective action on July 17, 2015. (Compl., ECF No. 1.) Initially, EPIC was the only named defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   .) EPIC filed its Answer on August 12, 2015. (Answer, ECF No. 8.) On November 28, 2016, on consent of the parties, District Judge Hellerstein certified a collective class under the FLSA and approved proposed notices. (Mem. Endorsement, ECF No. 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 24, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint, which was amended to include Adrian Brown (\"Brown\") and Hilburn Walker (\"Walker\") as named Plaintiffs, and Falk as a named Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Am. Compl., ECF No. 98.) On September 11, 2017, Defendants filed their Answer to Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer to First Am. Compl., ECF No. 101.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Over time, thirty-seven plaintiffs consented to join this action, in addition to the three named Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 41-50, 52-74, 77-78, 80-82.) After discovery, Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that travel time is not compensable and that Plaintiffs' use of a company car was not a requirement of their job. Judge Hellerstein found that there were material issues of fact and denied summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Epic Sec. Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-05610,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202452757\">\n    2018 WL 2452757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. May 31, 2018). On July 26, 2018, the parties consented to proceedings before me (Consent, ECF No. 115), and at a conference held on September 7, 2018, a trial was scheduled to commence in December 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (9/7/18 Order, ECF No. 120.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 30, 2018, Defendants filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   seeking permission to call each named and opt-in Plaintiff as a witness at trial. (Not. of Mot., ECF No. 125.) Defendants argued that, \"[g]iven the disparity in whether the guards drove to each site, the amount of time they spent driving, and the fact that some guards drove to some sites, and some did not, representative testimony is not appropriate and will not be sufficient in this case.\" (Defs.' Mem., ECF No. 125-4, at 5.) Plaintiffs opposed the motion, arguing that calling all opt-in Plaintiffs was not necessary and that a representative sample of witnesses' testimony was \"more than enough ... for the court to make a determination\n   in this FLSA collective action.\" (Pls.' Mem., ECF No. 127, at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By Order dated November 10, 2018, the Court directed the parties to meet and confer regarding the contents of a short (1-2 page) questionnaire to be completed by each Plaintiff whose deposition had not been taken to elicit sworn responses to the most salient issues in the case (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , whether the Plaintiff drove to his or her work site(s) (and how often) and the number of hours traveled). (Text Only Order, ECF No. 129.) Thereafter, each party submitted a proposed questionnaire to the Court. (Letter, ECF No. 130 &amp; accompanying exhibits.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A pretrial conference was held on November 19, 2018. By Order issued the same day, I granted Defendants' motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   giving them permission to call each named and opt-in Plaintiff as a witness at trial, subject to a 15-hour time limit for each side to put on its case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 131.) Further, after reviewing each side's proposed questionnaire, the Court provided to the parties a revised questionnaire in the form of a sworn Declaration (referred to herein as the \"Questionnaire Declaration\"), which combined elements from both proposed questionnaires. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5.) The Court ordered that, no later than December 7, 2018, Plaintiffs submit \"a sworn questionnaire from each remaining Plaintiff (both named and opt-in), other than those Plaintiffs whose depositions were taken.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) In its November 19, 2018 Order, the Court also permitted the parties (to conserve time against the 15-hour time limit) to submit direct examination by affidavit no later than December 5, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 21, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Letter Motion requesting a pre-motion conference to address their anticipated motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") to add claims under the NYLL on behalf of eight opt-in Plaintiffs: Sharon Carr, James Foster, Princess Logan-Williams, Jonathan Reece, Israel Rivera, Saul Veliz, Jose Vicent and Samuel Wright.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Letter, ECF No. 134.) On November 22, 2018, I denied Plaintiffs' Letter Motion for a conference and directed Plaintiffs to file a formal motion to amend. (Mem. Endorsement, ECF No. 135.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 30, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their motion for leave to file a SAC. (Not. of Motion, ECF No. 139.) In their proposed SAC, Plaintiffs sought to add as named Plaintiffs nine opt-in Plaintiffs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the effect of which would be for such Plaintiffs to be permitted to assert claims under the\n   NYLL (which has a longer statute of limitations than the FLSA, as addressed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ). (Proposed SAC, ECF No. 140-1, \u00b6\u00b6 21-29.) In addition, Plaintiffs withdrew their Third Cause of Action (for Spread of Hours Wages under the NYLL) and Fourth Cause of Action (for Wage Statements under the NYLL). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.) Otherwise, the allegations of the SAC were identical to the allegations of the First Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 6, 2018, Defendants opposed Plaintiffs' motion to amend. (ECF Nos. 149-50.) Defendants argued that they would be prejudiced by the amendment to add the opt-in Plaintiffs as parties to the NYLL claims since the Defendants did not have an opportunity to take those Plaintiffs' depositions. (Opp. Mem., ECF No. 150, at 2, 5-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 7, 2018, the parties appeared for a telephone conference before the Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12/7/2018 Minute Entry.) During the conference, the Court deferred decision on the motion to amend pending trial. The Court reasoned that, since liability under the FLSA and the NYLL is in large part coextensive, the motion to amend implicated only the statute of limitations and the quantum of damages with respect to the opt-in Plaintiffs. The Court directed the parties to submit proof at trial regarding the nine opt-in Plaintiffs both as if the NYLL claims were being asserted by those Plaintiffs, and as if such claims were not being asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the bench trial held from December 10, 2018 through December 14, 2018, and on January 7, 2019, Plaintiffs and Defendants each submitted a post-trial memorandum, as well as a response to one another's memorandum. (ECF Nos. 169, 170, 185 &amp; 187.) In addition, Plaintiffs submitted a spreadsheet (and supplemental spreadsheet) of damages calculations (ECF Nos. 170-2 &amp; 186-1), and Defendants submitted objections and corrections to such spreadsheets. (ECF No. 188.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In this Opinion, I first address Plaintiffs' motion to amend. Next, I address the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law. Finally, I address the amount of damages, if any, to be awarded to each of the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO AMEND IS GRANTED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) provides that a court should \"freely\" grant leave to amend \"when justice so requires.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). The decision to grant or deny leave to amend is within the trial court's discretion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zenith Radio Corp. v.

While the party seeking to amend its pleading must explain any delay, the party opposing the amendment \"bears the burden of showing prejudice, bad faith, and futility of the amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Raffington v. Bon Secours Health Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522964\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/759/#p766\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 766 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court, in its discretion, grants Plaintiffs' motion to amend, and deems the SAC the operative pleading. The Court finds that Defendants have failed to make an adequate showing of prejudice. Their prejudice argument was based upon their inability to take depositions of the moving opt-in Plaintiffs. However, Defendants were provided, from every moving opt-in Plaintiff,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   direct testimony via written affidavit (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 144, 148 &amp; 152) and a Questionnaire Declaration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 154 &amp; 156.) Defendants were able to cross examine at trial each of those Plaintiffs as to the contents of the sworn documents submitted, and Defendants obtained some key admissions from certain of the Plaintiffs at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition, the consent forms signed by the opt-in Plaintiffs to join this case contained sufficiently broad language encapsulating state law claims (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Carr Consent, ECF No. 44 (\"I hereby consent to the prosecution of any claims I may have under the Fair Labor Standards Act for wages, back pay, liquidated damages, costs and attorney's fees, and\n   <em>\n    other relief\n   </em>\n   against defendants\") (emphasis added) ). Thus, the Defendants were on notice that the moving opt-in Plaintiffs were entitled to seek redress in this lawsuit in addition to their FLSA claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court, in its discretion, grants Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file the SAC to add claims brought under the NYLL for Plaintiffs Carr, Etienne, Foster, Logan-Williams, Martin, Reece, Rivera, Veliz and Wright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court makes the following findings of fact after carefully considering the evidence before it:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Defendant EPIC\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant EPIC, located at 2067 Broadway, between 71st and 72nd Street in Manhattan, is a privately-owned company which provides security guard services, employing approximately 300 to 400 security guards and other personnel. (Tr. at\n   332 (Lerner).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"crux\" of EPIC's business is unarmed security guard work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the years 2009 through 2017, EPIC generated annual revenues in excess of $500,000; in 2017, EPIC's gross income was between $10 to $15 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 335-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dr. Mark Lerner is EPIC's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). As CEO, he took steps to keep up to date with law and regulations in the security guard industry (including employment law) by keeping \"a full set of New York State McKinney's laws and forms,\" receiving legal updates through West Publishing and subscribing to resources from a number of New York state agencies which provide him with updated information about wage and hour employment policies. (Tr. at 338 (Lerner).) He also subscribed to Mondaq, a legal service which provides reports about developments in labor law and wage-and-hour matters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 338.) He has maintained these subscriptions for over twenty years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 339.) Additionally, he has attended \"many\" security industry conferences, some of which involved personnel and payroll issues involving security guards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 334.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For the past five or six years, EPIC has maintained a fleet of approximately 35 vehicles. (Tr. at 331 (Lerner).) The vehicles are insured by EPIC: EPIC pays for the insurance of the vehicles, and security guards who drive them as part of their employment are listed on EPIC's insurance policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 339; Tr. at 358 (Falk).) Overall, of the hundreds of EPIC security guards who were employed by EPIC, only a minority of EPIC's security guards used EPIC vehicles to report to work sites. (Tr. at 401 (Falk).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At trial, contracts between EPIC and 60 clients were introduced into evidence. (Defs.' Exs. A to III.) 34 of the client contracts provide that an EPIC vehicle will be present during the security guard's shift. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Exs. B, GG &amp; EEE.) These vehicles are known as \"radio motor patrol\" (\"RMP\") vehicles (Tr. at 143 (Cullen) ), which clients may request for their security needs. At a client's request, RMPs are used for patrol or deterrence purposes and/or as a shelter for security guards (Tr. at 158-59 (Cullen) ). Thus, for these RMP sites, an EPIC security vehicle was required to be at the worksite. The security guard assigned to the RMP sites would report to EPIC's headquarters to pick up the RMP, fill out paperwork relating to the RMP, drive the RMP to the site and then return the vehicle to EPIC's headquarters (again filling out paperwork).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. at 201 (Cullen).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   EPIC only assigned to RMP sites security drivers with valid drivers' licenses, who were willing to drive. (Tr. at 181, 184 (Cullen).) RMP sites included,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Ray Catena car dealerships (Defs.' Exs. B &amp; VV), Alice Fiore (Defs.' Ex. H), Garden State Plaza Mall (Defs.' Ex. ZZ), Yankee Clipper (Defs.' Ex. BBB), Ardsley Country Club (Defs.' Ex. L), Northstar Contracting/Grey Stone Hospital (Defs.' Ex. NN) and Leesel Transportation Corp. (Defs.' Ex. II.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Client contracts for some other worksites indicated that an RMP was not required to be present on site (\"non-RMP sites\"). Therefore, security guards could commute directly to and from non-RMP sites; they did not have to report to EPIC's headquarters before or after their shift. (Tr. at 124 (Brown).) However, for at least some of those sites, EPIC provided employees with the option of using an EPIC vehicle to drive to the site (Tr. at 394 (Falk) ), even though an EPIC vehicle was not required onsite. Non-RMP sites included,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   Daytop Village (Defs.' Ex. III), the Red White &amp; Blue thrift store (Defs.' Ex. E) and 99 Evergreen. (Defs.' Ex. U.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   EPIC asserts that it offered to security guards the use of an EPIC vehicle to travel between EPIC's headquarters and worksites (both RMP and non-RMP) as a convenience, if they wanted to drive, and/or as one of \"several alternatives for them to get to work.\" (Tr. at 352, 375 (Falk).) However, because EPIC was required to have RMPs at the RMP sites, EPIC benefitted by having security guards drive the RMPs to those sites. Indeed, Henry Cullen, EPIC's scheduling manager, testified that it was \"easier\" for EPIC to have security guards transport vehicles to worksites, rather than the alternative of having supervisors transport vehicles between sites. (Tr. at 166 (Cullen).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Cullen admitted that EPIC benefitted from having security guards fill the RMP vehicles with gasoline when driving them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 210-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In April 2016, EPIC implemented a new policy to begin paying some security guards for travel time between EPIC's headquarters and their worksites.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Tr. at 355 (Falk).) Cullen testified that these payments for travel time only were available for travel to and from RMP sites. (Tr. at 189.) To calculate compensation for travel time, Cullen determined the amount of driving time for which a driver was eligible to be compensated; he did so by looking up worksites on Google Maps and using the estimate provided by Google Maps for the driving time between the worksite and EPIC's headquarters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   at 168-69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Cullen also testified about Vehicle Use Reports (\"VURs\"), which were paper forms filled out by security guards who drove EPIC's RMP vehicles, setting forth their driving times. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 175 (Cullen).) The VURs were destroyed, usually via shredding, after ninety days.

(Tr. at 348 (Falk).) He acted as manager of the administrative office at\n   EPIC, and as such, the payroll manager, scheduling manager and personnel manager reported to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 348-49.) He testified that, although he did not hire and fire EPIC security guards, he hypothetically could override a decision made by the personnel manager to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 349-50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Falk was the corporate representative who signed EPIC's interrogatory responses. (Pls.' Ex. 10.) In addition, he was the corporate representative who signed about half of EPIC's contracts with its clients for security services. (Tr. at 371 (Falk).)

The following findings relate to Plaintiffs as a group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Whenever a Plaintiff used an EPIC vehicle to travel to a work site, he or she first would report to EPIC's headquarters to pick up the vehicle. (Tr. at 24 (Williams).) When security guards arrived at EPIC's headquarters to pick up and drop off the vehicles, they were required to complete certain tasks, such as filling out paperwork and inspecting the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. at 26 (Williams); Tr. at 65-66 (Walker).) This took approximately 15 to 20 minutes each time. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. at 28 (Williams); Tr. at 107-09 (Brown).) Further, prior to returning the vehicle to EPIC's headquarters, Plaintiffs would re-fill the car with gasoline, which they understood to be a requirement of their jobs. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. at 108-09 (Brown).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs who used EPIC vehicles benefitted in several ways. Some Plaintiffs testified that the fact that they did not need to use their own personal vehicles to travel to and from work was a benefit to them; using an EPIC RMP vehicle rather than a personal vehicle meant they did not need to personally bear the costs of gasoline used or tolls paid for getting to and from the worksites.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. at 755-56 (Vicent).) One plaintiff, Saul Veliz, testified that when he used his personal vehicle to travel to one site, he would have to pay $40 to $50 per day for gasoline and tolls. ( Tr. at 701 (Veliz).) Thus, Veliz requested, and was granted permission, to use an EPIC vehicle so that he would not have to incur those costs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 702.) Moreover, some Plaintiffs testified that they used EPIC vehicles due to the long driving distances to some of the sites. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 746 (David); Tr. at 754 (Vicent).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The EPIC security guards also benefited by being covered by EPIC's insurance, in the instances where they got into accidents while driving to or from a worksite. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 759-60 (Vicent) (\"Q. This was another benefit because if you had your own vehicle [that got into the accident], then you would have been responsible yourself [for the insurance]? A. Right.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Some employees who did not own personal vehicles needed to use an EPIC vehicle\n   to drive to worksites, due to disruptions in mass transit. For example, certain Plaintiffs testified that travelling to worksites located in Far Rockaway, New York (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Daytop Village) was difficult, due to the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. at 56-57 (Williams); Tr. at 546-47 (Etienne).) Plaintiff Vicent candidly acknowledged that the EPIC vehicles were supplied to employees as a \"courtesy,\" and that he could have taken his own vehicle to certain worksites instead of an EPIC vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 754, 758.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Assessing all of the Plaintiffs' and opt-in Plaintiffs' written and live testimony, the Court finds that, for non-RMP sites, the travel time to and from those sites was equivalent to normal commuting time. The Court finds that the EPIC vehicles were provided to employees commuting to those non-RMP sites as a courtesy and conferred a benefit on those employees. The RMP vehicles were being used as part of EPIC's employees' normal commute to non-RMP worksites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   With respect to RMP sites, however, the Court credits the testimony of Plaintiffs and opt-in Plaintiffs regarding driving time to and from those sites. The Court finds that the time spent from the time the security guard reported to EPIC's headquarters to pick up the RMP vehicle to the time that the vehicle was returned to EPIC's headquarters, including time spent filling the EPIC vehicles with gasoline and inspecting the vehicle, was time required in the performance of security guards' duties for RMP sites. These employees were conferring a benefit on EPIC by delivering the RMPs to the worksites and filling them with gasoline. The EPIC vehicles were part and parcel of the work performed at the RMP sites since the vehicles were required for the motor patrolling that was done. Since the vehicles were required for EPIC's business purposes, they essentially were tools used at RMP sites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court makes the following conclusions of law after carefully considering the parties' written submissions, the arguments of counsel and the controlling law on the issues presented:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     For RMP Sites Only, Plaintiffs Are Entitled To Be Compensated For Travel Time\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Portal-to-Portal Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20254\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , provides that normal commute time to a work site is not usually compensable,\n   <em>\n    Kavanagh v.

The evidence offered a trial shows that Defendants acted in good faith and had objectively reasonable grounds for believing that driving time between EPIC's headquarters and worksites was not compensable. In support of this finding, the Court credits Dr. Lerner's testimony that he, as EPIC's CEO, took affirmative steps to monitor legal standards developments in labor law over at least the past twenty years, including attending conferences and subscribing to and utilizing research databases and newsletters. These efforts demonstrate a good faith effort on EPIC's part to comply with labor laws. In light of the fact that the issues surrounding how to properly compensate for driving time are not straightforward, EPIC had an objectively reasonable basis for its belief that it did not need to compensate for travel time between EPIC's headquarters and worksites. Further, the policy change EPIC implemented in April 2016 to pay security guards for driving time to and from RMP sites demonstrates EPIC was acting in good faith to comply with the law.

It is not clear why Plaintiffs chose to add Falk as a defendant when they amended their pleading, as opposed to naming Lerner, who was EPIC's CEO. While it is true that Falk was the corporate representative who signed EPIC's interrogatory\n   responses (Pls.' Ex. 10), and that Falk was a corporate representative who signed about half of EPIC's contracts with its clients for security services (Tr. at 371), those facts do not make him liable under the FLSA or the NYLL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Applying the four relevant factors, Plaintiffs only have made a showing as to one. That is, Plaintiffs obtained an admission from Falk that, even though he never hired or fired security guards, he had the hypothetical power to do so, since the personnel manager at EPIC reported to him. (Tr. at 349-50.) However, Plaintiffs have not shown that Falk supervised and controlled Plaintiffs' work schedules or conditions of employment, that he determined their rate and method of payment or that he maintained their employment records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gillian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204639842\">\n    2011 WL 4639842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.

The Court does so for two reasons. First, the Court finds Plaintiffs' testimony about driving times credible. Even where\n   the distance between EPIC's headquarters and a given job site is not long in miles, given the traffic in and around Manhattan, driving times can be quite lengthy. Second, because the VURs, which memorialized the Plaintiffs' actual driving times were destroyed by Defendants after this case was commenced, legal precedent supports the Court's approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Adrian Brown\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Brown was employed by EPIC as a security guard from February 2015 to December 2016.

Brown worked at the following worksites: (1) Avalon Bay Princeton;\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) William Floyd Parkway (Dutra Group); (3) Ray Catena; (4) Leesel Bus Depot; and (5) Ardsley Country Club. (Damages Spreadsheet at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also generally\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 93-100 (Brown).) Of these sites, Plaintiffs only assert that Avalon Bay Princeton, Ray Catena, Leesel and Ardsley Country Club were RMP sites. (Damages Spreadsheet at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Based upon the EPIC client contracts, the following were RMP sites: Ray Catena (Defs.' Ex. B); Leesel (Defs.' Ex. II) and Ardsley Country Club (Defs.' Ex. L). There is no contract in evidence relating to the Avalon Bay Princeton site (located at 253 Witherspoon Street) where Brown worked. (Damages Spreadsheet at 3; Catina Decl., ECF 188-1, \u00b6 6(ix).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   With respect to Avalon Bay Princeton, Plaintiffs point to an EPIC call-in sheet from February 5, 2015 where there is a notation with Brown's name for this site stating \"UNARMED UNIFORM SEC. OFF. W/RADIO MOTOR.\" (Call In Sheet, Defs.' Ex. JJJ, at 3441.) The Court finds that this document is evidence that Brown was required to drive an RMP to the Avalon Bay Princeton site on February 5, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Court also finds that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof to show that Brown was required to drive an RMP to this site on other days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The Court awards Brown the sum of $7,850.00 based upon unpaid minimum wages and overtime for his travel to and from RMP sites, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,210.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Jimmy Butler\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Butler worked at EPIC from approximately November 3, 2016 to December 17, 2017. (Butler Aff., ECF No. 144-1, \u00b6 1; Butler Decl., ECF No. 154-3, \u00b6 1.) Butler asserted that he worked at three worksites to and from which he was required to drive an EPIC vehicle: Restaurant Depot, Avalon Bay and Livingston Builder. (Butler Aff. \u00b6 5; Butler Decl. \u00b6 5.) However, the Damages Spreadsheet only seeks damages for his work at two sites: Avalon Bay and Livingston Builder. (Damages Spreadsheet\n   at 28.) This Avalon Bay site is not listed by Plaintiffs on their Damages Spreadsheet as an RMP site (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204147241\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), and Butler therefore is not entitled to recovery for his time spent traveling to and from Avalon Bay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Butler seeks recovery under the FLSA for overtime hours he spent traveling to and from the Livingston Builder site, which is alleged by Plaintiffs to be an RMP site. (Damages Spreadsheet at 28.) The Livingston Builder site was located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan (across town from EPIC's headquarters). There is no contract in evidence for the Livingston Builder site where Butler worked. (Catina Decl. \u00b6 6(xiv).) Rather, Livingston Builder is claimed by Plaintiffs to be an RMP site based on Butler's testimony that the vehicle was used by him as a shelter. ( Tr. at 670-71 (Butler).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Court does not find Butler to be credible. Although his Affidavit states that he \"patrolled the perimeter of the area\" with the vehicle (Butler Aff. \u00b6 9), Butler admitted on cross-examination that EPIC \"didn't ask [him] to\" patrol the site using the vehicle. ( Tr. at 671 (Butler).) The Court finds that Livingston Builder was not an RMP site, and thus does not award any recovery to Butler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Shakiema Cadora\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Cadora worked for EPIC from June 11, 2014 until December 30, 2015. (Cadora Aff., ECF No. 144-2, \u00b6 1; Cadora Decl., ECF No. 154-4, \u00b6 1). She was assigned to the Floyd Bennett Field worksite during her entire employment with EPIC, about 79 weeks. (Cadora Aff. \u00b6 3; Cadora Decl. \u00b6 6.) The EPIC client for whom Cadora provided security guard services was RAAD Construction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Damages Spreadsheet at 38-40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The EPIC contract with RAAD Construction does not require an RMP. (Defs.' Ex. D.) Plaintiffs base their assertion that Floyd Bennett Field required an RMP upon trial testimony by EPIC's Cullen. (Damages Spreadsheet at 38.) However, that testimony was based upon an EPIC call-in sheet for October 1, 2015 regarding Floyd Bennett Field, which related to different security guards, named Sharif Uddin and Jovan Williams. (Pls.' Ex. 8 at PT_3353 (\"UNARMED UNIFORM SEC. OFF. W/RADIO MOTOR\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 156-61.) There is a call-in sheet for the very same day (October 1, 2015) regarding Floyd Bennett Field which is specific to Cadora herself and states, \"LEV. 2 UNARMED UNIFORM SECURITY OFF.,\" without any mention of an RMP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pls.' Ex. 8 at PT_3396.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Court finds that Cadora is not credible. She testified at trial that she was required to drive to the Floyd Bennett Field site every single day. (1/7/19 Tr. at 39.) However, she acknowledged that some of her fellow EPIC guards at the Floyd Bennett Field site arrived by bus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.) Moreover, the language of her Declaration, which was dated November 29, 2018, suggests that she was not required to drive to the site every day. (Cadora Decl. \u00b6 7 (\"\n   <em>\n    On the days I was required\n   </em>\n   to drive an EPIC vehicle between EPIC's headquarters and Floyd Bennett Field ...\" (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In these circumstances, assessing Cadora's credibility and considering the record evidence, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof to show that Cadora was required to drive an RMP to the site where she worked. Thus, Cadora\n   is not entitled to any recovery in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Sharon Carr\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Carr worked at EPIC from October 18, 2013 to December 9, 2013. (Carr Aff., ECF No. 144-3, \u00b6 1; Carr Decl., ECF No. 154-5, \u00b6 1.) Carr worked at the following worksites: (1) Garden State Plaza\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Carr Aff. \u00b6 4; Carr Decl. \u00b6 6; Tr. at 261 (Carr) ); and (2) Seagirt Beach (a Dutra Group worksite).\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Carr. Aff. \u00b6 6; Tr. at 261 (Carr).) Garden State Plaza was an RMP site. (Defs.' Ex. ZZ.) Although there is no contract in evidence for the Dutra site where Carr worked (Catina Decl. \u00b6 6(v) ), Defendants admit that the Dutra site where Carr worked was an RMP site. (Defs.' Spreadsheet, ECF No. 188-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Court awards the sum of $1,040.00 to Carr based upon unpaid minimum wages and overtime for her travel to and from RMP sites, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $495.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Roger David\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   David worked for EPIC during the period January 30, 2014 to September 24, 2016. (David Aff., ECF No. 144-5, \u00b6 1; David Decl., ECF No. 154-6, \u00b6 1.) David worked at the following sites, among others: Selby Transportation, Rosenthal Jewish, Kennedy Catholic High School, an art gallery in Orangeburg, NY\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Big Apple Circus. (David Aff., \u00b6\u00b6 4-9; David Decl., \u00b6 5.) Selby Transportation, Kennedy Catholic High School and Big Apple Circus were RMP sites. (Defs.' Exs. O, HH &amp; II.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The contract for Rosenthal Jewish reflects that it is not an RMP site. (Def Ex. YY.) However, in their Damages Spreadsheet (at 30), Plaintiffs assert that it is an RMP site by referring to an EPIC call-in sheet from April 30, 2015 where there is a notation with David's name for this site stating, \"TEMP. UNIFORM SEC. SERVICE WITH R.M.P.\" (Call In Sheet, Defs.' Ex. JJJ, at 7473.) The Court finds that this document is evidence that David was required to drive an RMP to the Rosenthal Jewish site on April 30, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Court also finds that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof to show that David was required to drive to this site on other days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   There is no contract in evidence for the Phyliss Dodge site. (Catina Del. \u00b6 6(xvii).) Plaintiffs point to an EPIC call-in sheet from March 17, 2016 where there is a notation with David's name for this site stating, \"TEMP. UNIFORM SEC. SERVICE WITH R.M.P.\" (Call In Sheet, Defs.' Ex. JJJ, at 22974.) The Court finds that this document is evidence that David was required to drive an RMP to the Phyliss Dodge site on March 27, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Court also finds that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof to show that David was required to drive to this site on other days. In reaching this finding, the Court is mindful of David's trial testimony that he \"did not have to patrol the [Phylliss Dodge site] area in the Epic vehicle.\" ( Tr. at 735.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   David seeks damages in this case under the FLSA only. (Damages Spreadsheet at 30-31.) The Court awards him FLSA damages in the amount of $1,285.00 based upon unpaid overtime for his travel to and from RMP sites, plus prejudgment interest at the federal rate in the amount of $90.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n    <em>\n     Junior Etienne\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Etienne worked for EPIC for a few weeks during the month of February 2013. (Etienne Aff., ECF No. 144-6, \u00b6 1; Etienne Decl., ECF No. 154-7, \u00b6 1; Tr. at 529 (Etienne).) Etienne worked at only one site for EPIC, a beach site in Far Rockaway, New York for three weeks. (Etienne Aff. \u00b6 4; Etienne Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; Tr. at 546 (Etienne).) Although he testified that he did not remember the name, address or other identifying information about either the worksite or the client, the Damages Spreadsheet lists \"La May\" as Etienne's only worksite, for which he is seeking $56.25 in damages. (Damages Spreadsheet at 20.) Plaintiffs do not claim this is an RMP site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204147241\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Because Etienne did not travel to and from an RMP site, the Court finds that he is not entitled to recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    7.\n    <em>\n     James Foster\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Foster worked at EPIC from June 2013 to August 2014.

The only Avalon Bay contract in evidence relates to the site in Hackensack, New Jersey. (Catina Decl. \u00b6 6(iv).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the two Avalon Bay sites at which Hurst worked were RMP sites based upon certain call-in sheets. For Avalon Bay Watchung, Plaintiffs refer in the Damages Spreadsheet (at 13) to a call-in sheet for June 13, 2015 relating to Hurst with the notation, \"TEMP. UNIFORM SEC. SERVICE WITH R.M.P.\" (Defs.' Ex. JJJ at 9661.)

(Logan-Williams Aff., ECF No. 144-11, \u00b6 1; Logan-Williams Decl., ECF No. 154-12, \u00b6 1.) She worked at the following sites: Russo Development (Logan-Williams Aff. \u00b6 7; Logan-Williams Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.); Garden State Plaza Mall (where Whiting-Turner was the EPIC client) (Logan-Williams Aff. \u00b6 8; Logan-Williams Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6); Alice Fiore (Logan-Williams Aff. \u00b6 9; Logan-Williams Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6); and Reicon Group.

(Damages Spreadsheet at 10.) In total, he seeks damages under the FLSA in the amount of $405.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Forest Hill Gardens was an RMP site (Defs.' Ex. V), but EPIC kept an EPIC vehicle onsite. (Mitchell Aff. \u00b6 5; Tr. at 309 (Mitchell).) Thus, Mitchell stated in his affidavit that, on some days, he would use that vehicle onsite, and on those days, he commuted directly to Forest Hill Gardens from his home via public transportation. (Mitchell Aff. \u00b6 6.) However, on cross-examination, he testified that he reported to EPIC's headquarters and drove a vehicle for every shift he worked at Forest Hill Gardens. (Tr. at 314 (Mitchell) ), which directly contradicted his sworn affidavit. The Court finds that Mitchell is not a\n   credible witness since he directly contradicted his affidavit in open court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The Court finds that, since EPIC maintained a vehicle onsite, security guards were not required to transport an EPIC vehicle to the site. Thus, time spent driving to and from the Forest Hill Gardens site was not compensable, and Mitchell is not entitled to recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    14.\n    <em>\n     Michael Moulton\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Moulton worked for EPIC from April 2015 to March 2016. (Tr. at 549 (Moulton).) During that time, he was assigned to about six or seven sites, but only two of which required a vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 550, 563);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Moulton Aff., ECF No. 144-14, \u00b6 5.) The first was Impact Real Estate in Long Island City. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) This was an RMP site. (Defs.' Ex. CC.) The second site was a Ray Catena car dealership. (Moulton Aff. \u00b6 7.) This also was an RMP site. (Defs.' Exs. B &amp; VV.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Moulton seeks damages under the FLSA in the amount of $240.19. (Damages Spreadsheet at 21.) The Court awards him the sum of $241.00 based upon unpaid overtime for his travel to and from RMP sites, plus prejudgment interest at the federal rate in the amount of $20.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    15.\n    <em>\n     Jonathan Reece\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Reece worked for EPIC from 2009 to October 2013. (Reece Decl., ECF No. 154-15, \u00b6 1.) Reece worked at a Brickens Construction site in the summer of 2010. (Reece Aff., ECF No. 144-15, \u00b6 5.) This was an RMP site. (Defs.' Ex. P.) Reece also worked at the following sites that both sides agree are not RMP sites: 99 Evergreen (Defs.' Ex. U); Daytop Village (Defs.' Ex. III); and Castaways Yacht Club. (Defs.' Ex. R.) In addition, Reece worked at the Jacksonville Chapel site, which Plaintiffs assert was an RMP site. (Damages Spreadsheet at 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The EPIC contract with Jacksonville Chapel does not reflect that it is an RMP site. (Defs.' Ex. FF.) However, Plaintiffs assert that it is an RMP site based upon a call-in sheet. (Damages Spreadsheet at 25.) The call-in sheet to which Plaintiffs refer is dated June 28, 2015, and contains an entry that on that day Samuel Wright served as an \"UNARMED UNIFORM SEC. OFF. W/RADIO MOTOR.\" (Defs.' Ex. JJJ at 10397.) This entry is not evidence that Reece was required to drive an RMP to the Jacksonville Chapel site. Moreover, Reece's testimony at trial was that he worked at the Jacksonville Chapel site directing traffic, not using an RMP. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 647.) Thus, the Court finds that Reece is not entitled to damages for his travel to and from the Jacksonville Chapel site. The Court awards the sum of $1,890.00 to Reece based upon unpaid minimum wages and overtime for his travel to and from the Brickens Construction RMP site, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,450.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    16.\n    <em>\n     Warren Richardson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Richardson worked at Deepdale Gardens, a gated housing community, from August 2014 to January 2015. (Richardson Aff., ECF No. 144-16, \u00b6 5; Richardson Decl., ECF No. 154-16, \u00b6 5.) Plaintiffs' Damages Spreadsheet does not list Deepdale as an RMP site. (Damages Spreadsheet at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Richardson testified at trial that the site required an RMP, but also testified that EPIC kept a vehicle there on-site. (Tr. at 614 (Richardson).) Richardson testified\n   that such vehicle was \"mainly for show.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 614-15.) Another plaintiff, Veliz, whose testimony the Court credits, also testified that EPIC kept a vehicle on-site at Deepdale, which Veliz used to patrol. ( Tr. at 703 (Veliz).) Veliz further testified that that he drove to Deepdale in an EPIC vehicle for his own convenience. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 701-02.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Because an EPIC vehicle was kept on-site at Deepdale, the Court finds that Richardson was not required to drive an EPIC vehicle to the site. Thus, he is not entitled to recovery of any damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    17.\n    <em>\n     Israel Rivera\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Rivera seeks damages for his travel time to and from the following sites that both sides agree are RMP sites: Ardsley Country Club (Defs.' Ex L); Leesel Bus Depot (Defs.' Ex. II); Hylan Datacom (Defs.' Exs. AA &amp; BB); Northstar (Defs.\" Ex. NN); and Avalon Bay Hackensack (Defs.\" Ex. M).\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Rivera worked at the Louis Gargiulo and Baker Properties sites, which are both RMP sites. (Defs.' Exs. N &amp; KK.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The other sites where Rivera worked, which he asserts are RMP sites, are JCCA, Red Lobster, Avalon Bay Edgewater, Avalon Bay Princeton, RAAD and P. Judge &amp; Sons. (Damages Spreadsheet at 16-19.) As previously discussed, JCCA\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   and RAAD Construction are not RMP sites. Plaintiffs assert that Red Lobster is an RMP site by citation in the Damages Spreadsheet (at 16) to a call-in sheet that nowhere mentions Red Lobster. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. JJJ at 4389.) The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof to show that Red Lobster was an RMP site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   As stated earlier, the only Avalon Bay contract in evidence relates to the site in Hackensack, New Jersey. (Catina Decl. \u00b6 6(iv).) Plaintiffs suggest that Avalon Bay Edgewater is an RMP site based upon a call-in sheet from January 29, 2015 which reflects that Rivera served as a \"UNARMED UNIFORM SEC. OFF. W/RADIO MOTOR\" at that site on that day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defs.' Ex. JJJ at 3199.) This document does not reflect that an RMP was required at the Avalon Bay Edgewater site every day. Further, Plaintiffs suggest that Avalon Bay Princeton was an RMP site based upon a call-in sheet from March 8, 2015 which reflects that Rivera served as a \"UNARMED UNIFORM SEC. OFF. W/RADIO MOTOR\" at that site on that day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defs.' Ex. JJJ at 4905.) This document does not reflect that an RMP was required at the Avalon Bay Princeton site every day. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof to show that the Avalon Bay sites at which Rivera worked were RMP sites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   There is no contract in evidence for the P. Judge &amp; Sons site. (Catina Decl. \u00b6 6(iii).) Plaintiffs assert that P. Judge &amp; Sons was an RMP site based upon a call-in sheet from April 23, 2016 which reflects that Rivera served as a \"UNARMED\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   UNIFORM SEC. OFF. W/RADIO MOTOR\" at that site on that day. (Defs.' Ex. JJJ at 24682.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   This document does not reflect that an RMP was required at the P. Judge &amp; Sons site every day. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof to show that P. Judge &amp; Sons was an RMP site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The Court awards the sum of $3,600.00 to Rivera based upon unpaid minimum wages and overtime for his travel to and from RMP sites, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $900.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <strong>\n    18.\n    <em>\n     Winston Synaker, III\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Synaker seeks recovery of FLSA damages of $177.38 based upon his assertion that he was required to drive an EPIC vehicle between EPIC's headquarters and an Avalon Bay site. (Synaker Aff., ECF No. 144-18, \u00b6 4; Damages Spreadsheet at 36.) Defendants do not contest that the site where Synaker worked was an RMP site. (Defs.' Spreadsheet, ECF No. 188-3.) Thus, the Court awards the sum of $180.00 to Synaker based upon unpaid overtime for his travel to and from the site, plus $20.00 in prejudgment interest at the federal rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    19.\n    <em>\n     Saul Veliz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Veliz seeks recovery for his travel to and from the Judge Organization and Crystal Point sites during the period December 2012 to August 2013. (Damages Spreadsheet at 29.) Defendants acknowledge that Veliz worked at both sites and that they are both RMP sites. (Defs.' Spreadsheet, ECF No. 188-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The Court awards the sum of $2,550.00 to Veliz based upon unpaid overtime for his travel to and from RMP sites, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,300.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    20.\n    <em>\n     Jose Vicent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Vicent seeks damage only under the FLSA. (Damages Spreadsheet at 35.) Vicent worked at EPIC from the end of 2006 or beginning of 2007 to 2016. (Vicent Aff., ECF No. 152-1, \u00b6 1.) Vicent stated he worked at several sites that required him to drive from EPIC headquarters to the worksite.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Vicent Aff. \u00b6 5.) Vicent seeks damages for his time spent driving between EPIC's headquarters and the following worksites: Northstar, US Pipeline, Avalon Bay Watchung, Avalon Bay Vauxhall Road, RAAD, JCCA and Ardsley Country Club.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Damages Spreadsheet at 32-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Client contracts with Northstar, US Pipeline and Ardsley Country Club show those sites were RMP sites. (Defs. Exs. L, NN &amp; FFF.) As discussed above, the client contract with JCCA indicates it was not an RMP site. (Defs.' Ex. A.) Further, on cross-examination, Vicent conceded that JCCA was not an RMP-site: he testified he did not need to use the vehicle while performing his job duties; he would park it at the site and then perform his job duties in\n   a guard booth. ( Tr. at 750-51.) He testified that he would have taken his own personal vehicle to the JCCA site, if he had one. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 753.) In addition, as discussed above, the EPIC contract with RAAD Construction does not require an RMP (Defs.' Ex. D), and the Court finds that it was not an RMP site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Regarding the Avalon Bay Watchung site (for which Vicent seeks damages), on cross-examination at trial he testified that he took the EPIC vehicle because the site was far away, not because EPIC required him to drive the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 754.) Vicent claims that Avalon Bay Vauxhall Road is an RMP site based upon a call-in sheet for November 1, 2015 which reflects that Vicent served as a \"TEMP. UNIFORM SEC. SERVICE WITH R.M.P.\" at that site on that day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defs.' Ex. JJJ at 16448.) This document does not reflect that an RMP was required at the Avalon Bay Vauxhall Road site every day. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof to show that these Avalon Bay sites were RMP sites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Vicent brings his claims under the FLSA only. (Damages Spreadsheet at 35.) The Court awards the sum of $5,290.00 to Vicent based upon unpaid minimum wages and overtime for his travel to and from RMP sites, plus prejudgment interest at the federal rate in the amount of $350.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    21.\n    <em>\n     Hilburn Walker\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Walker worked at EPIC from June 2015 to August 2015. (Walker Decl. \u00b6 1; Tr. at 61 (Walker).) Plaintiffs seek damages for Walker's travel to and from four sites that Plaintiffs characterize as RMP sites. (Damages Spreadsheet at 2.) Defendants do not contest that these sites are RMP sites. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Spreadsheet, ECF 188-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The Court awards the sum of $1,505.00 to Walker based upon unpaid minimum wages and overtime for his travel to and from RMP sites, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $490.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   <strong>\n    22.\n    <em>\n     David Williams\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Williams worked at EPIC for approximately three weeks, beginning on February 6, 2013. (Tr. at 21.) He seeks damages of a few hundred dollars. (Damages Spreadsheet at 1.) Williams' testimony confirmed that the only worksite EPIC assigned him to was Daytop Village. (Tr. at 23.) Daytop Village was a non-RMP worksite. (Def Ex. III.) His responsibilities at Daytop included patrolling the site on foot; he was not required to patrol using a vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-38, 40.) The \"assignment sheet\" Williams received from EPIC, which informed him of his assignment to Daytop Village, provided instructions for how to get to the worksite via public transportation (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , by bus). (Tr. at 33; Pls.' Ex. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Williams testified that Far Rockaway, where Daytop Village was located, was adversely affected by damage from Hurricane Sandy. (Tr. at 53.) For example, only buses, not the subway, were running to that area following the hurricane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, when Williams reported to Daytop, he always drove a vehicle there, whether his own or EPIC's vehicle; he did not take public transportation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) To facilitate him getting to the site, EPIC offered a company vehicle for his use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Since Daytop Village was a non-RMP site, Williams is not entitled to recovery for his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   <strong>\n    23.\n    <em>\n     Samuel Wright\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Wright worked for EPIC from approximately March 2010 through December 16, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Offer of Proof, ECF No. 154-1, \u00b6 6.) Plaintiffs assert that the following sites were RMP sites: Judge Organization, Jacksonville Chapel, Avalon Bay Watchung, Avalon Bay Princeton, Ardsley Country Club and Whiting-Turner. (Damages Spreadsheet at 41-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Defendants agree that Judge Organization site was an RMP site. (Defs.' Spreadsheet, ECF No. 188-3.)
