They move to dismiss the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth, Claims for Relief against them in the Plaintiff's Second Consolidated Amended Complaint (SCAC) pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   TelexFree, Inc., (\"TelexFree\") was a pyramid scheme that operated from February 2012, to April 2014, and involved approximately two million participants world-wide, nearly one million of whom suffered a net financial loss. Several Plaintiffs filed actions in federal district courts across the United States seeking to recover\n   their losses against dozens of defendants, ranging from banks, payment processing companies, the principals of the fraudulent scheme, attorneys and accountants, such as PWC. Because the actions involved common questions of fact, the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation joined the actions into a Multi-District Litigation and ordered a transfer of actions to the District of Massachusetts for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In January of 2014 TelexFree hired PWC to perform accounting services for them. The complaint is silent about exactly which services PWC performed other than \"negligently\" providing advice relative to TelexFree's 1099 forms, and in responding to an inquiry by the Massachusetts Securities Division. The complaint is also spare in its references to PWC, assigning only 17 paragraphs to discussing PWC's role in the events that have given rise to the lawsuit. Specifically, the Plaintiffs allege that in January of 2014 TelexFree retained PWC to \"provide tax and financial consultation, including assistance with the development of International tax structures,\" and that PWC allegedly provided \"accounting and consulting services\". (SCAC \u00b6 577 and 578)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The complaint alleges that PWC \"advised TelexFree to prepare and issue IRS Form 1099.\" (SCAC \u00b6 579). Noteably there are no allegations about what advice PWC gave TelexFree, whether that advice was erroneous, or whether the Plaintiffs relied on PWC's advice about these forms. The complaint further alleges that PWC assisted TelexFree \"in responding the Massachusetts Securities Division's information requests\" (SCAC \u00b6 584).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must allege a claim that plausibly entitles the plaintiff to relief.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

Those associated individuals include among others the so called \"Licensed Professionals\", which includes attorneys, and accountants, including PWC. These \"Operational Defendants\" are alleged to have violated G.L. C. 93 \u00a7 12 and 69, but\n   there are no allegations in the SCAC identifying any conduct of PWC which is violative of these statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   PWC argues that \u00a7 69 of C. 93 does not create liability for such a broad class of what are secondary actors because \u00a7 69(d) states, \"no multi-level distribution company or\n   <em>\n    participant\n   </em>\n   in its marketing program shall ...\" The Defendants claim that there is no evidence that they \"participated\" in the multi-level marketing program. Section 69A of C. 93 describes the activities that \"participants may perform, such as participating in the distribution chain for goods or services offered by the company, recruiting new participants, paying or receiving commissions, bonuses, or finder's fee.\" There are no allegations in the SCAC that PWC did any of these things. Accordingly, the Defendant's Motion is granted as to the First Claim for Relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Second Claim for Relief: General Laws Chapter 93A \u00a7 2 and 11.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Plaintiffs allege that PWC violated M.G.L.

However, the allegations are made without any qualifying or backup factual allegations. Further, the Defendant argues that \u00a7 11 of G.L. C. 93A applies only between parties having a transactional business relationship, and that there are no allegations that such a relationship between PWC and the Plaintiffs existed. I agree (see\n   <em>\n    Cash Energy, Inc. v.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   did not devote much discussion to the theory of an aiding and abetting claim under c. 93A, but spoke at length of a statutory aiding and abetting claim under M.G.L.

Similarly, the\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   court was not deciding whether a party could aid and abet a Chapter 93A claim, but whether a party could aid and abet statutory violations of M.G.L.

That court held one could not aid and abet Chapter 149 and 151B violations because the legislature \"could have specifically provided for aiding and abetting liability in G.L.

Paragraph 1083 of the SCAC makes the generic allegations against the Operational Defendants for fraudulent misrepresentations as; providing false and misleading information on the nature of TelexFree business operation, misrepresenting financial statements, providing false and misleading information on the value of the ad central package, providing false and misleading information on the method and source from which income was derived, providing false and misleading information on the legality of TelexFree's business model, providing false and misleading information on the sustainability of the returns of the promoter, providing false and misleading information regarding the investigation into Brazil and the subsequent closure of TelexFree's Brazilain operations,\n   knowingly participating in false and deceptive information televised over the internet and other media, failing to comply with federal and state laws, and setting up TelexFree's computer servers in a foreign country with the intent to avoid prosecution and legal process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Since the Plaintiffs ninth claim for relief sounds directly in fraud it must be plead with particular clarity pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). The only specific examples of PWC's fraudulent conduct are: PWC negligently provided accounting and consulting services to TelexFree (SCAC \u00b6 577) and that PWC was retained several months after the Brazilain operation was shut down. The Complaint also alleges that PWC counselled TelexFree to issue fraudulent 1099 forms. These allegations do not contain the specificity referred by Rule 9 (b) and accordingly, the Defendant's Motion is granted as to the Ninth Claim for Relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Defendnat's Motion to Dismiss all counts against it is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     granted.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
