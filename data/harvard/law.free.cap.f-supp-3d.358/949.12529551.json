The court reasoned that the defendant did not waive the defense because it did not know about the assignment. The\n   <em>\n    Spinedex\n   </em>\n   court did not reach the issue that was later decided by\n   <em>\n    Brand Tarzana\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Eden Surgical Center\n   </em>\n   -whether a Plan needs to raise an anti-assignment provision during the claim administration process at all to avoid waiving it as a litigation defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff argues that\n   <em>\n    Spinedex\n   </em>\n   approvingly cited a Fifth Circuit opinion that found a plan was estopped from raising a non-assignment clause defense for the first time at trial, where the defendant never previously cited the anti-assignment clause during more than three years of claims processing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hermann Hosp. v.

However, this court declines to read\n   <em>\n    Spinedex\n   </em>\n   so expansively. Plaintiff's reading would overextend\n   <em>\n    Spinedex\n   </em>\n   's holding to reach beyond the factual scenario that court considered, and it would read the opinion's efforts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Hermann Hospital\n   </em>\n   as a broad adoption of Fifth Circuit precedent. Instead, this court reads\n   <em>\n    Spinedex\n   </em>\n   in concert with the subsequent Ninth Circuit decisions that are directly on point with the issue presented here. In doing so, the court notes that all three opinions rely on\n   <em>\n    Harlick\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Brand Tarzana\n   </em>\n   itself relies on\n   <em>\n    Spinedex\n   </em>\n   ; and Judge Bybee sat on the panels that decided both\n   <em>\n    Spinedex\n   </em>\n   in 2014 and\n   <em>\n    Eden Surgical Center\n   </em>\n   less\n   than four years later.
