Of America (\"Pohl\") moves for summary j. judgment on Count II (breach of implied warranty of merchantability) and Count III (breach of implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose) based upon the limitation of warranties language in its standard Terms and Conditions agreed to by Cleveland Marble.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF # 82) Plaintiff University Hospitals (\"UH\") moves for an order of partial summary judgment finding that the disclaimer of warranties in Pohl's Terms and Conditions is inconspicuous as a matter of law and denying Pohl's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Counts II and III of the Amended Complaint.. (ECF # 85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff UH filed this action against Defendant Pohl alleging claims of breach of express warranties under the UCC R.C. 1302.26, breach of implied warranty of merchantability under the UCC R.C. 1302.27, breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose under the UCC R.C. 1302.28 and negligent misrepresentation. All of these claims arise from the alleged failure of terra cotta panels supplied by Pohl and used in the construction of the Ahuja Medical Center located in Beachwood, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 22, 2007, UH entered into a contract with Gilbane Building Company (\"Gilbane\") to serve as the construction manager and contractor for the Project. (Id. at \u00b6 8) Gilbane entered into a written subcontract agreement with Cleveland Marble Mosaic Company (\"Cleveland Marble\") to purchase and install the HKS specified Terra Cotta Panels for the exterior cladding at the Project. (Id. at \u00b6 9). On October 29, 2008, Pohl submitted a revised proposal to Cleveland Marble to manufacture and deliver the HKS specified Faveton Bersal Terra Cotta Rainscreen Panel System. (Id. at \u00b6 10) A copy Pohl's Proposal is attached as Ex. 1 to the First Amended Complaint. Pohl's Proposal incorporates by reference Pohl's standard Terms and Conditions which were attached as Ex. 3 to the First Amended Complaint. (Id. at \u00b6 18)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The last section of Pohl's standard terms and conditions is the Warranties and Limitations provision that Pohl asserts to disclaim any implied warranties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Warranties and Limitations:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1. Unless otherwise stated in the quote, Pohl warrants that the products delivered hereunder will be free of defects in workmanship under proper and normal use for a period of 2 years from acceptance or 2 years 6 months from the date of shipment, whichever, comes first. Should any failure to comply with this warranty appear within this period, Pohl agrees, upon prompt notification thereof,...to correct the defect by either repairing the defective produce[sic], or at Pohl's discretion by replacement. The foregoing shall constitute the purchasers' exclusive remedy and fulfillment of seller's liability with respect to its products.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2. The foregoing warranties are exclusive and remedies provided for breach thereof are likewise exclusive. All other warranties whether expressed or implied, arising through the course of dealings, usage of trade or otherwise is excluded. There are no implied warranties of merchantability of fitness of purpose. Pohl shall not be liable for any consequential damages such as loss of profit or revenue, downtime, costs, costs associated with the removal or re-installation of its products or claims on[sic] third parties against the purchaser.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   3. Pohl has no liability for any and all costs ... expenses, judgements and losses for alleged infringements of any patents or... other proprietary rights, which results from the compliance with purchaser's designs, specifications or instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (ECF # 5, Ex. 1, p.6) Pohl argues that Plaintiff's claims for implied warranty of merchantability and implied warranty for a particular purpose are specifically excluded from the contract agreed to by Cleveland Marble. The parties acknowledge that under Ohio law both the implied warranties of merchantability and of fitness for a particular purpose may be excluded or modified if the exclusion or modification meets the criteria set forth in Ohio Rev. Code 1302.29(B) which requires in part that the exclusion be \"conspicuous.\" \"Conspicuous\" is defined in Ohio Rev. Code 1301.01(J). The parties disagree over whether Pohl's disclaimer of implied warranties here was \"conspicuous,\" as defined in R.C. 1301.01(J).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when the court is satisfied \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

R.C. 1302.29(B) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Subject to division (C) of this section, to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states for example, that 'There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   R.C. 1301.01(J)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   defines the term \"conspicuous\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A term or clause is conspicuous when it is so written that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to have noticed it. A printed heading in capitals (as: NON-NEGOTIABLE BILL OF LADING) is conspicuous. Language in the body of a form is 'conspicuous' if it is in larger or other contrasting type or color. But in a telegram any stated term is 'conspicuous'. Whether a term or clause is 'conspicuous' or not is for decision by the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The parties agree that under the terms of R.C. 1301.01(J), the decision regarding whether the limitations language at issue is conspicuous is a question to be decided by the Court. The Terms and Conditions document at issue consists of two pages which were at the end of a seven page document. The Terms and Conditions document has six parts each with a heading that is set off and bolded. The limitation language is contained in paragraph two of the last section entitled \"\n   <strong>\n    Warranties and Limitations\n   </strong>\n   .\" The heading is bolded and set off from the three paragraphs under it. The limitation language at issue here is contained in the second paragraph. The language of the limitation is in the same font and size as the rest of the body of the Terms and Conditions document. It is not bolded, capitalized, in a contrasting type of color or marked by symbols or other marks that would call attention to the language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Courts that have made \"conspicuousness\" determinations under R.C. 1302.29(B) and 1301.01(J) have found the limitation or exclusion \"conspicuous\" when there is a capitalized and bolded heading and the exclusion language itself is capitalized, bolded or otherwise set off by contrasting type, font, color, size, symbols or marks. For example, the Ohio Supreme Court determined that a warranty exclusion printed in capital letters under a capitalized and bolded heading \"\n   <strong>\n    WARRANTY\n   </strong>\n   \" while the bulk of the type of the contract is in regular type is conspicuous under R.C. 1302.29(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Chemtrol Adhesives, Inc. v.

The font of the Terms and Conditions is uniform throughout the document and while large enough to be readable, each of the paragraphs looks the same. As such, the document is more like the document in\n   <em>\n    AGF, Inc., v. Great Lakes Heat Treating Co.\n   </em>\n   , (8th Dist.

As such, nothing differentiated paragraph eleven from the other nineteen paragraphs and therefore paragraph 11 was inconspicuous and could not operate to exclude appellant's claim for consequential damages. The Terms and Conditions document here has six headings with twenty four separate paragraphs which are identical in the style of the print, font, color and approximate length. Nothing makes the\n   actual language of the disclaimer here found in the second paragraph under the heading Warranties and Limitations conspicuous. Based upon a review of the statutes and relevant cases, the Court finds that the language of the disclaimer here is not conspicuous as required in R.C. 1302.29(B) and defined by R.C. 1301.01(J).

Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, Gilbane and Cleveland Marble have assigned to UH all of their respective rights, obligations and causes of action under Ohio common law and the Uniform Commercial Code codified at R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1301.102 to 1301.310 and Chapter 1302 et seq. of the Ohio Revised Code.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    R.C. 1301.01(J) was renumbered to R.C. 1301.201(B)(10) and amended by the 129th General Assembly, HB 9, \u00a7 1, effective 6/29/2011. R.C. 1301.201(B)(10) defines \"conspicuous\" for contracts entered into after June 29, 2011 as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    \"Conspicuousness\", with reference to a term, means so written, displayed or presented that a reasonable person against which it is to operate ought to have noticed it. Whether a term is conspicuous or not is for decision by the court. Conspicuous terms include the following:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n    (a) A heading in capitals equal to or greater in size than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text or the same or lesser size;\n    <strong>\n     and\n    </strong>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    (b) Language in the body of a record or display in larger type than the surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font or color to the surrounding text of the same size, or set off from surrounding text of the same size by symbols or other marks that call attention to the language.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    As the contract at issue here was entered prior to June 29, 2011, the former version of the definition applies, although under either definition of \"conspicuous\" the Court has concluded that the result in this case would be the same.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
