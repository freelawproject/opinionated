Due to the pension fund's critical status, Defendant was obligated to make supplemental contributions under the rehabilitation plan. Ex. 5, ECF No. 18-5 (explaining the rehabilitation plan to employers). The parties dispute the amount of supplemental contributions owed between\n   September 2015 and April 2017. As explained below, the Court finds that Defendant was required to make supplemental contributions to the pension fund at the rate required by the MPRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Under the PPA, multi-employer pension funds undergo an annual certification process in which the plan's actuary assesses the financial health of the plan.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201085\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A). Plaintiffs' pension fund has been designated \"critical\" each year between 2009 and 2017. Because of the fund's critical status, the pension fund was required to develop a rehabilitation plan to improve funding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201085\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1085(a)(2). The rehabilitation plan was required to include reductions in future benefits and increases in future employer contributions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201085\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1085(e)(1)(B), (e)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The supplemental contributions required employers to make contributions above the existing base contribution established by contract as expressed as a percentage of the base contribution. The pension fund's rehabilitation plan allowed employers to choose between a Preferred and a Default Schedule for making supplemental contributions. Ex. 5, ECF No. 18-5 (letter to employers explaining rehabilitation plan). Defendant bargained for the Preferred Schedule in its CBA which was effective between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2014. CBA, Ex. 1, ECF No. 18-1, 25.3. Under the Preferred Schedule, Defendant's supplemental contribution rate increased to 37.6% of its base contribution as of April 1, 2013 and would have increased to 48.3% as of April 1, 2014 if the CBA had not expired. Declaration of Kisha Smith, ECF No. 18-7, \u00b6 26. However, on March 31, 2014, the CBA expired while the plan was still in critical status. The parties dispute the effect of the CBA's expiration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because the CBA expired while the plan was in critical status, Plaintiffs argue that rate of Defendant's supplemental contributions was set by the amendments to the PPA made in 2014 through the MPRA. Under the MPRA, a pension fund must continue to enforce an employer's obligation to contribute at the rates required under its previously-selected schedule if the parties fail to negotiate a contract in conformance with the rehabilitation plan within 180 days of the expiration of the parties' prior agreement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201085\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3)(C)(ii), (iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, Defendant had contracted to make supplemental contributions in accord with the rehabilitation plan's Preferred Schedule. While the pension fund was still in critical status, the CBA expired. Accordingly, under the MPRA, the pension fund was required to implement the Preferred Schedule on Defendant 180 days after the CBA's expiration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201085\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But, the CBA expired on March 31, 2014, approximately nine months prior to the MPRA's effective date of December 16, 2014. Plaintiffs ask that the Court begin applying the supplemental contribution rates required under the MPRA on January 1, 2015, which is after the MPRA's effective date and more than 180 after the CBA's expiration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Accordingly, from the expiration of the CBA to the end of the 2014 calendar year, the pension fund charged Defendant for supplemental contributions at the rate of 37.6% as required by Defendant's contractual selection of the Preferred Schedule. But, after January 1, 2015, Plaintiffs contend that Defendant's supplemental contribution rates are controlled by the MPRA. As such, from January 1, 2015 to January 1, 2016, the pension fund charged Defendant for supplemental contributions at the rate of 48.3% as required by the pension fund's implementation of the Preferred Schedule under the MPRA. Also based on the pension fund's implementation of the Preferred Schedule as required by the MPRA, the pension fund charged Defendant\n   for supplemental contributions at a rate of 59.8% between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2017 and at a rate of 72.1% between January 1, 2017 and January 1, 2018. Declaration of Kisha Smith, ECF No. 18-7, \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant argues that the increased rates for supplemental contributions required under the MPRA should not apply because the CBA expired prior to the MPRA's effective date. Because the MPRA was not in effect during the duration of the parties' contractual agreement, Defendant argues that to apply the MPRA to Defendant's September 2015 to April 2017 payments would have an impermissibly retroactive effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendant that the MPRA amendments are likely not retroactive amendments. However, the retroactivity of the MPRA is irrelevant as Plaintiffs do not request a retroactive application of the law. Plaintiffs do not seek the increased supplemental contribution rates prior to the enactment of the MPRA. Instead, Plaintiffs seek the increased supplemental contribution rates as of January 1, 2015, the first day of the plan year following the enactment of the MPRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"A statute does not operate 'retrospectively' merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute's enactment or upsets expectations based in prior law.\"\n   <em>\n    Landgraf v.

In that case, the Supreme Court applied the Prison Litigation Reform Act's (\"PLRA\") fee limits to limit attorneys' fees earned after the PLRA's enactment, but not to limit those fees earned before the enactment. The Supreme Court explained that attorneys conducting post-judgment monitoring before the PLRA's enactment had a reasonable expectation that they would be compensated at pre-PLRA rates, so the application of the PLRA fee-limit to those fees would have an impermissible retroactive effect.\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248619\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/343/\">\n    527 U.S. at 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248619\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/343/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But, Plaintiffs do not ask for such an application. Instead, they ask to apply the increased supplemental contribution rates only to payments occurring after the MPRA was enacted. Such application does not have a retroactive effect. With the enactment of the MPRA, Defendant was on notice of the increased supplemental contribution rates. If Defendant found the new terms unacceptable, Defendant could have withdrawn from the pension fund.

Accordingly, after January 1, 2015, Defendant was required to make supplemental contribution payments in accord with the rates set by the Preferred Schedule under the rehabilitation plan as mandated by the MPRA. Plaintiffs are entitled to collect these unpaid supplemental contributions under the PPA which provides that \"any failure to make a contribution under a schedule of contribution rates provided under [a rehabilitation plan contribution schedule] shall be treated as a delinquent contribution under [Section 515 of ERISA] and shall be enforceable as such.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201085\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3)(C)(iv) ; 29 U.S.C. 1145 (Section 515 of ERISA, requiring employers to make contributions under the terms of the pension fund's plan or other agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Genuine Disputes of Material Facts as to Damages Owed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Even if the MPRA is applicable, Defendant argues that the Court should not grant Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to damages because there remain\n   genuine disputes of material fact concerning damages owed for unpaid supplemental contributions between September 2015 and April 2017 and for damages owed from the pension plan's 2012-2013 audit. Defendant presents three primary arguments as to why there remain genuine disputes of material fact concerning damages owed. First, Defendant argues that the method by which Plaintiffs calculated damages is speculative and unclear. Second, Defendant contends that Plaintiffs provided inadequate proof of their measure for the damages. Finally, Defendant claims that Plaintiffs' 2012-2013 audit incorrectly identified Laura Bazile as a union employee subject to contributions. The Court is not persuaded by Defendant's arguments and will address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   First, Defendant claims that the method by which Plaintiffs calculated their damages is speculative and unclear. Specifically, Defendant faults Plaintiffs for failing to indicate what eligibility criteria the pension fund applied when determining whether or not Defendant made the required contribution payments. Defendant also faults Plaintiffs for not indicating what portions of an employee's pay the pension fund used as the basis for that person's pension fund contribution. According to Defendant, \"without any of this key information, it is impossible to know whether the Pension Fund is accurately assessing who is eligible for contributions and whether the proper portions of each eligible employee's pay are being used to calculate the contributions.\" Def.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 19, 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"While damages are not required to be proven with mathematical certainty, there must be some reasonable basis on which to estimate damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

In order to calculate the damages owed, Plaintiffs multiplied the number of hours reported in Defendant's remittance reports by the base rate for contributions as required under the applicable contract and the rate of supplemental contributions as required by the pension fund's rehabilitation plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.

Plaintiffs reviewed Defendant's own remittance reports.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.

Where the audit revealed that Defendant had underreported certain hours, the pension fund assessed interest and liquidated damages for delinquent contributions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. Considering Mr. Joseph's Declaration, the Court finds that Plaintiffs provided a reasonable methodology for calculating damages owed resulting from the 2012-2013 audit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The reasonableness of Plaintiffs' methodology is highlighted by the fact that Defendant cites no evidence establishing that Plaintiffs' method of calculating damages resulted in any errors. Plaintiffs based their damages calculations on Defendant's own reports and documents. Accordingly, Defendant possessed the necessary documentation to rebut Plaintiffs' damages calculation. But, instead of producing documents within its control showing that Plaintiffs' damages calculations are incorrect, Defendant relies solely on the Declaration of its counsel, David Jasinski, as \"evidence\" of error. In his Declaration, Mr. Jasinski states that \"[t]o the extent that Plaintiffs believe required contributions have not been made, the Pension Fund has improperly included, as part of the contribution calculus, certain earnings that should be excluded from the calculation and/or individuals who have not met the required threshold criteria.\" Declaration of David F.

R. Civ. Pro. 56(c)(4). Mr. Jasinski's Declaration does not meet this standard. Mr. Jasinski is Defendant's counsel and not a regular employee of Defendant. He provides no facts establishing personal knowledge as to Defendant's regular method for making pension fund contributions. Moreover, with the exclusion of Ms. Bazile which will be addressed below, Mr. Jasinski presents no facts to support his vague allegation that the pension fund improperly included earnings and individuals that should have been excluded from the contribution calculation. Because Mr. Jasinski's Declaration does not comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, and because it contains only unsupported allegations, the Court will not consider it as \"evidence\" of Plaintiffs' incorrect calculation of damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Serv.

Ex. 6, ECF No. 18-6. These reports show the wages which Defendant reported to the pension fund and the wages the pension fund determined were required based on tax forms, payroll documents, and other records.

But, Defendant failed to produce any such affirmative evidence. Defendant did not provide a contrary estimate of damages owed, nor did Defendant identify any specific errors in Plaintiffs' spreadsheets (with the exception of Ms. Bazile which will be discussed below). Without such evidence, Defendant has not met its burden to point to specific facts in the record that reveal a genuine issue suitable for trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

Declaration of Kisha Smith, ECF No. 18-7, Ex. B. In that spreadsheet, certain figures in the \"Hours or Salary Reported\" column do not contain numbers and instead contain \"####.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p324\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But, this omission was merely a formatting error which occurred when Plaintiffs converted the spreadsheet to a PDF for filing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Diana M.

Defendant concedes that from January 1, 2013 to January 30, 2013, Ms. Bazile was a union recreational employee covered by the CBA. But, Defendant claims that Ms. Bazile was promoted to a non-union recreational therapist position beginning January 31, 2013. Declaration of David F. Jasinski, Esq., ECF No. 19-2, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. And on October 24, 2013, Defendant claims that Ms. Bazile was again promoted to another non-union position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. Based on Ms. Bazile's promotions to non-union positions, Defendant claims that Plaintiffs erred in including Ms. Bazile as a union employee subject to contributions from March 2013 to December 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The only support that Defendant provides for this alleged error in Plaintiffs' audit is the Declaration of its counsel, Mr. Jasinski.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Res. To Pls.' Statement of Material Facts, ECF No. 19-1, \u00b6\u00b6 86-91 (citing only to Mr. Jasinski's Declaration). But, a Declaration used to oppose a motion for summary judgment must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated. Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56(c)(4). And, Mr. Jasinski's Declaration provides no foundation to support his allegation concerning Ms. Bazile. He does not state that he has personal knowledge as to Ms. Bazile's employment history nor does he provide any documents establishing her employment positions at the relevant times. The lack of documentation is especially concerning given that, as Ms. Bazile's employer, Defendant would have easy access to her employment records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court also notes that Mr. Jasinski's alleged \"facts\" concerning Ms. Bazile's employment history are confusing and unclear. Mr. Jasinski states that \"Plaintiffs\n   incorrectly identified Ms. Bazile as a union employee for the months of March 2013 through December 2013.\" Declaration of David F. Jasinski, Esq., ECF No. 19-2, \u00b6 17. Mr. Jasinski explained that such identification was incorrect because Ms. Bazile was promoted to a non-union position on January 31, 2013. But, if Ms. Bazile was promoted to a non-union position in January 2013, it is not clear why Defendant has not claimed that Plaintiffs erred by treating her as a union employee in February 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Moreover, Defendant and its counsel have been in possession of the audit findings regarding Ms. Bazile since at least September 9, 2016, but failed until now to raise the issue of Ms. Bazile being improperly identified as a union employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Andre Joseph, ECF No. 18-8, Ex. B. During Ms. Smith's deposition on January 12, 2018, Mr. Jasinski asked Ms. Smith why she thought that Defendant did not report Ms. Bazile's work hours to the pension fund for the months of March 2013 to December 2013. Declaration of Diana M. Bardes, ECF No. 20-1, Ex. C, 16-25. Mr. Jasinski posited that Defendant did not report Ms. Bazile's work hours for those months because she did not work during those months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25 (\"Is it possible that Ms. Bazile did not work in 2013 for the months of March through December?\"). Based on Mr. Jasinski's theory that Defendant failed to report Ms. Bazile's hours because she did not work, Plaintiffs supplied the Court with evidence showing that Ms. Bazile did in fact work during the months at issue. Declaration of Andre Joseph, ECF No. 18-8, Ex. E, Ex. F. It is only at the summary judgment stage that Mr. Jasinski has for some reason, unsupported by personal knowledge or documentation, changed his rationale for the failure to report Ms. Bazile's hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Lacking a foundation of personal knowledge and without any documentation to support his conclusory allegation, Mr. Jasinski states that Plaintiffs erred in identifying Ms. Bazile as a union employee from March 2013 to December 2013. The Court concludes that such \"evidence,\" unsupported by documentation or a foundation of personal knowledge, is insufficient to defeat Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Londrigan v.
