RELEVANT FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   George Boerner held a Menard's/Capital One credit card, for which he fell behind on payments after he lost his job. Between October 2016 and February 2017, Boerner received billing statements in the mail that contained information including the amount due and the payment due date. As is customary with credit card billing statements, Boerner was allowed to make partial payments, or \"minimum payments,\" on the debt. Boerner owed a total of $ 1,957.57 on the Menard's/Capital One credit card before it was finally turned off (\"charged off\") in early 2017. By February 2017, Boerner was required to pay $ 649.00 on the total owed balance. At some point following the charge off, the Menard's/Capital One credit card debt was sold. It passed through multiple financial institutions and ultimately arrived at LVNV, which retained the Messerli law firm to collect on the delinquent account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 19, 2017, Messerli sent Boerner's bankruptcy attorney a standard form letter stating that it represented LVNV in the collection of the debt, and, if appropriate, Boerner must dispute the validity of the debt within 30 days. (Docket # 40-2). Boerner does not recall seeing this letter and, to this day, is confused by the fact that it refers to HSBC Bank Nevada, a bank Boerner has never used. The letter does not contain any information regarding Boerner's opportunity to cure the default, nor does it mention that the debt stems from Boerner's Menard's/Capital One card. It does, however, list the last four digits of that credit card.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3501419\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/689/818/#p822\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Neither Boerner, nor his attorney, responded to this letter. On October 25, 2017, Messerli filed a summons and complaint against Boerner in Washington County Circuit Court, seeking to collect LVNV's debt (Case No. 17SC2061). On November 16, 2017, Boerner filed an answer with the state court, followed by an amended answer and counterclaims on December 15, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   LVNV is a long-term client of the Messerli firm, and Messerli is familiar with LVNV's business practices and accounts. When retained to collect a particular debt, Messerli receives consumer files from LVNV, as well as general demographic information about the debtor. State court complaints are drafted on a standard form template, which Messerli attorneys review \"at least annually.\" (Docket # 50 at 10-11). Messerli regularly trains its employees on legal compliance and industry developments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3501419\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/689/818/#p822\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Messerli attorneys use a file-tracking system to show work performed on each case. (Docket # 53 at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Messerli attorney working on behalf of LVNV in Boerner's case, James Kachelski, is listed as the attorney of record in several hundred cases throughout Wisconsin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state court complaint filed in Boerner's case was the result of Messerli's mass-produced, computer-assisted process, which Kachelski reviewed and signed before the complaint was filed. There is no way to know for certain how long Kachelski\n   actually spend reviewing the complaint,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, and the parties dispute how long Kachelski reviewed the complaint. Messerli's records contain two time stamps for this complaint, at 4:04 p.m. and 4:05 p.m. Boerner argues that this shows that the complaint was reviewed for one minute before it was sent to the assistant to be filed. Messerli argues that 4:04 p.m. is \"the time the code was placed on the file\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the review was completed,\" which is then followed by the time the file was sent to the assistant to be e-filed, and that all of the review was done\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the time stamps. (Docket # 50 at 12). In any case, the Defendants do not say how long Kachelski spent reviewing the complaint, or how long it would be reasonable to review the complaint under the circumstances. They only state that Kachelski's review, however long it was, was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It is undisputed that Kachelski reviewed the complaint on October 23, 2017, and the complaint was ultimately filed on October 25, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   There are no other entries from that period on the computer system for Boerner's case that can be attributed to any other attorney. The parties dispute how busy Kachelski's schedule was that week, including the number of hearings for which he made appearances. At some point after the complaint was filed, another attorney, Gina Ziegelbauer, became involved in Boerner's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    4. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The thrust of Plaintiff's argument is that LVNV unlawfully accelerated the maturity of his debt when LVNV filed suit against him without giving Plaintiff notice of his right to cure the default under the WCA, which, in turn, violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(2)(A) because LVNV falsely represented the legal status of the debt, i.e., that the debt was ready to be sued upon. Plaintiff also alleges that Messerli falsely represented that an attorney was meaningfully involved in the collections suit when, in fact, Kachelski was barely involved at all, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(3). In its July 25, 2018 order on Defendants' motion to dismiss, the Court determined that Boerner could proceed on his two FDCPA claims, one of which is predicated on facts underlying the WCA the violation, which the court determined was precluded from litigation in federal court due to its dismissal in the state court action. (Docket # 32 at 18-19). Defendants now seek summary judgment on each of Boerner's claims, as well as dismissal of the entire action. The Court addresses each FDCPA claim below, as well as Defendants' argument against emotional damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    4.1 FDCPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The FDCPA is, as its name suggests, intended to \"eliminate abusive debt collection practices.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)\"Broadly, it prohibits debt collectors from using 'any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.' \"\n   <em>\n    Schlaf v.

Stat. \u00a7 425.105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants first argue that LVNV had the right to sue Boerner because Boerner no longer had a \"right to cure\" where the credit card balance was entirely past due and fully owed. (Docket # 39 at 7). Defendants refer to\n   <em>\n    Rosendale State Bank v. Schultz\n   </em>\n   , which holds that if \"the customer defaults on an entire obligation, there is no right to cure.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8675111\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/123/195/#p199\">\n    123 Wis.2d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8675111\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/123/195/#p199\">\n    365 N.W.2d 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ct. App. 1985). Boerner counters that the amount was not \"fully owed\" because Boerner had been permitted to make partial payments on the account, and, as far as he knew, would be allowed to make these payments for years to come, until the debt was paid off. (Docket # 46 at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Boerner's position is supported by prior decisions in this district. In\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. LVNV Funding\n   </em>\n   , the court distinguished debts that are \"fully due\" from debts that involve \"installment payments,\" such as credit cards with minimum payments and a maximum credit amount.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20676401\">\n    2016 WL 676401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (E.D. Wis. Feb. 18, 2016). A right to cure default exists for installment payments such as those permitted for credit card debts.\n   <em>\n    Rosendale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8675111\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/123/195/#p199\">\n    123 Wis.2d at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8675111\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/123/195/#p199\">\n    365 N.W.2d 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20676401\">\n    2016 WL 676401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4. Defendants argue that because they purchased the debt from Capital One, \"there was no possibility Boerner could cure his failure to make regular monthly payments on his credit card debt. Boerner did not have (and never had) any type of continuing open and revolving credit relationship with LVNV that could have been restored from a defaulted status. LVNV Funding is not a creditor.\" (Docket # 39 at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   LVNV made a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , which the court struck down because \"LVNV, as assignee, stepped into the shoes of the original creditor\" when it purchased the debt. \"What [Capital One] and LVNV did regarding accounting and ownership of [Boerner's] Account after a default cannot change the nature of [Boerner's] credit relationship with [Capital One] and eliminate [his] rights under the WCA. Consumers should not lose their consumer rights based on a creditor's choice to sell or assign the debt.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20676401\">\n    2016 WL 676401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at 5. Accordingly, that court noted that the plaintiff \"was entitled to a right to cure before the debt was accelerated and a collection lawsuit was brought.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20676401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The debt in this case is also a credit card debt with minimum payments and a credit limit, such that Boerner could pay the installments over the course of several years. (Docket # 44 at 5-20). Based on Boerner's billing statements from Menard's/Capital One, the credit card statement amount was not treated as \"fully owed,\" but rather as a balance that could be paid off with \"minimum payments.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20676401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the WCA and\n   <em>\n    Rosendale\n   </em>\n   , Boerner would be entitled to an opportunity to cure the default before any acceleration or collection commenced. The fact that the debt changed hands does not change this. To echo\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , a debt-collector cannot step into a better position than its assignor where the consumer's rights are concerned. Therefore, the Court finds that Boerner \"was entitled to a right to cure before the debt was accelerated and a\n   collection lawsuit was brought.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20676401\">\n    2016 WL 676401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Next, Defendants argue that they were not obligated to give notice because the WCA is permissive.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20425.104\">\n    Wis.

Boerner counters that he has a right to such notice, and states that LVNV was a merchant within the scope of the WCA, but inexplicably shifts the burden to the Defendants to \"show that [a notice of right to cure default] was not required.\" (Docket # 46 at 5).

However, once they chose to pursue those actions, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20425.103\">\n    Wis.

Plaintiff argues that this is contrary to the purposes of the WCA. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , this district held that \"treating a monthly billing statement as both that and a notice of right to cure goes against the purposes of the WCA...An unsophisticated consumer would reasonably not know or understand the difference.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20676401\">\n    2016 WL 676401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.

In support of this contention, Defendants provide correspondence between the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (\"DFI\") and the Kohn Law Firm (which is not involved in this case), which, according to Defendants, concludes that right to cure requirements are preempted by federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Boerner makes many arguments seeking to exclude the letters. Evidentiary squabbling aside, there are two reasons why this argument fails. First, as a threshold issue, the Defendants have not complied with the requirements needed to establish such a safe harbor. Second, even if they had, the Wisconsin statute is clearly not preempted, and the Court would have determined any contrary findings from the DFI to be invalid for the reasons explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20426.104\">\n    Wis.

Though the text of the statute does not explicitly state that these approvals are individualized determinations, the\n   caselaw suggest that these letters are discrete permissions rather than broadly applicable decisions that carry the force of precedent. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Aker v. Americollect, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit determined that the safe harbor applied where the debt collector contacted the Administrator to request permission to add a percentage interest on medical debts, responded to the Administrator's request for additional information, and did not receive a disapproval for 60 days.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276926\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/397/#p399\">\n    854 F.3d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 399 (7th Cir. 2017). By contrast, in\n   <em>\n    Moore v. Always Towing &amp; Recovery Inc.\n   </em>\n   , this district determined that the safe harbor did not apply where a creditor used a previously approved DFI form because \"[t]he fact that a creditor uses the DFI form does not mean that the DFI administrator approved the way the creditor used it, nor does it trump the creditor's obligation to comply with the statute.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204233005\">\n    2018 WL 4233005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 n.1 (E.D.

Rather, the Kohn law firm submitted a request to the Administrator\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Defendants filed this case, and based their request on different facts involving a different set of parties. Defendants cannot simply rely on another law firm's request for the safe harbor to protect their actions retroactively.

Second, the law firm did not receive the debtor's file, only the information needed to determine delinquency and draft the letter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p635\">\n    at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, the review of the letters, even if conducted by an attorney, \"did not call for the exercise of professional judgment. The most substantive aspect of this review involved checking an internal database to determine whether a debtor had declared bankruptcy and running a [screening] computer check.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Fourth, the dunning letter was on a pre-written form letter that contained \"no individualized assessment of the individual debtor's circumstances or her liability,\" and was issued in an \"assembly-line fashion\" that \"betray[ed] the purely nominal nature\" of the law firm's participation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court found that the attorney's testimony that he spent two minutes reviewing one page containing forty accounts confirmed the \"ministerial nature\" of the review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Fifth, the firm was not authorized to resolve issues with the debtor, and routed almost all communication back to the creditor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the attorney never litigated on behalf of the creditor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The firm's efforts \"amounted to no more than a veneer of compliance with the FDCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p635\">\n    at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To be sure, certain factors weigh in Defendants' favor here. Messerli does actively litigate on behalf of LVNV in state court, and it seems that they do receive the entire client file. However, a number of other factors remain uncertain. First, it is unclear who determines which files LVNV sends to Messerli-i.e., whether LVNV only sends the delinquent accounts it wants litigated, or whether Messerli conducts some exercise of professional judgment to determine which claims to pursue. It is also unclear whether Messerli has a policy for sending notices of right to cure to eligible consumers, nor is it clear whether Messerli even makes such determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The record summarily states that a \"Messerli shareholder review[s] the documentation provided to determine\" the viability of a claim, (Docket # 50 at 11), but \"[i]n the instant case, on October 20, 2017, a legal assistant with Messerli reviewed Boerner's file for suit.\" (Docket # 42 \u00b6 8). The facts are unclear, and a reasonable jury could find that there was no professional judgment exercised regarding whether and how to pursue these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Second, it does not appear that Messerli attorneys exercise any professional judgment in the review of the complaint. Defendants argue that \"Messerli's expensive computer system...provides easy access to... account information allowing for an efficient review at the time of the summons and complaint review.\" (Docket # 50 at 14). Defendants do not describe what this \"efficient review\" entails, but note that although the client data is transferred electronically from LVNV to Messerli, \"the data imported from clients is still reviewed by Messerli attorneys.\" (Docket # 52 at 2). It is hard to see how a data review is meaningfully different from the \"ministerial review\" that the\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   court rejected, and a jury could reasonably find in favor of Boerner on this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Third, the pre-made, assembly-line fashion of the complaints, as well as the evidence of Kachelski's schedule could also confirm the \"ministerial nature\" of his review of these complaints. Additionally, although Messerli apparently\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   Boerner's file, there is no evidence that Kachelski reviewed this file in fashioning the complaint. Kachelski stated that he \"examined [Boerner's] file information in Messerli's Cogent program to review the Summons and Complaint for accuracy.\" (Docket # 42 at 2). The Court notes that \"reviewing the file information,\" i.e., reviewing data scraped from the file, is different from \"reviewing the file.\" Thus, a reasonable jury could find in favor of Boerner on these factors as well. Finally, Defendants make much of the fact that, at some point after the filing of the complaint, another attorney was assigned to manage the file. However, those facts fail to demonstrate whether any attorney was meaningfully involved at the outset of the complaint, when Boerner asserts that his rights were violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In the end, there are simply too many material facts at issue here to resolve on summary judgment. Although there was certainly some attorney involvement, it is unclear whether there was meaningful attorney involvement. Therefore, this is an issue that must be submitted to a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    4.1.2.1 Materiality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In order to be actionable, the misrepresentation must be material, i.e., it must influence an unsophisticated consumer's decision as to when and whether to pay a debt.\n   <em>\n    Hahn v. Triumph LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3381986\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/755/#p757\">\n    557 F.3d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 757-58 (7th Cir. 2009). Defendants argue that the only thing that affected when and whether Boerner would pay his debts was the fact that he lost his job and did not have any money-nothing in the complaint changed this. (Docket # 39 at 17). Yet there is evidence that Boerner would have been interested in curing the debt, if he could afford it, and if he were offered that opportunity. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket # 51-1 at 115:12, 18-19; 126:1-2). Instead, he and his wife focused their resources on litigating the matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, there is\n   evidence in the record that the complaint materially affected Boerner's decision to respond to the debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    4.2 Emotional Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The evidence before the Court on damages is relatively thin, but not so insubstantial as to warrant summary judgment in Defendants' favor. Parties seeking emotional damages \"must provide the court with a reasonably detailed explanation of the injuries suffered.\"\n   <em>\n    Crafton v. Law Firm of Jonathan B. Levine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828077\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/992/#p1003\">\n    957 F.Supp.2d 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1003 (E.D.

When \"the injured party's own testimony is the only proof of emotional damages, he must explain the circumstances of his injury in reasonable detail; he cannot rely on mere conclusory sentences.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9124786\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/330/919/#p929\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9124786\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/330/919/#p929\">\n    at 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Conclusory statements that receiving [a complaint] caused [him] stress... do not constitute a detailed explanation of [his] injuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Crafton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828077\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/992/#p1003\">\n    957 F.Supp.2d at 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted). \"The actual damages must arise from the false representation...-not the mere fact of [the lawsuit].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828077\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/992/#p1003\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Put another way, Boerner cannot claim damages just because he is being sued- rather, he must demonstrate that his damages stem from the alleged misrepresentation within the state court lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Boerner has met his burden of explaining the physical and mental effects of the LVNV lawsuit in sufficient detail for this stage of the litigation. He testified that he suffers a loss of appetite that resulted in him shedding ten pounds from an already frail frame (Docket # 51-1 at 118:10-11). He has increased his smoking to over a pack of cigarettes per day,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 118:2-3, and he experiences a chronic, low-grade headache as a result of the LVNV lawsuit,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 119:6-7, that intensifies in the evenings when he reviews the lawsuit materials,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 120:20-22. His hands shake from the nerves,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 114:12-16, and he has difficulty concentrating at work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100:19-21. He describes his anxiety about this lawsuit as all-consuming, if not in those terms. Boerner is a 71-year-old veteran who has an annual physical exam approximately every year, and, aside from that, does not go to a doctor unless he is \"almost dead.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 132:1. His last medical exam was in October, 2017, therefore there are no medical records documenting his stress.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:4. The weight and credibility of this evidence should go to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Moreover, Boerner's heightened stress appears to be directly related to the acceleration of the debt and the initiation of the state court lawsuit without the opportunity to cure the default. Defendants try to exploit Boerner's confusion between the state and federal court proceedings, and, at times, attempt to pin Boerner's stress on this federal lawsuit, which hardly makes sense. (Docket # 39 at 28). Boerner apparently believed that his deposition was for the LVNV state lawsuit, and was agitated because he believed that the LVNV state lawsuit would result in a garnishment of wages. (Docket 51-5 at 109:17-23, 110:2-5). He fears that the LVNV state court judgment will result in an unnegotiated garnishment that he cannot afford.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110:5. He is also concerned that such a garnishment will negatively affect his workplace reputation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 134:9-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    5. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, Defendants' motions for summary judgment on the FDCPA claims and the issue of emotional damages will be denied. In addition to their motions for summary judgment,\n   Defendants filed an uncontested motion to extend the trial schedule. (Docket # 54). However, when considered against the backdrop of the Court's comprehensive trial scheduling order issued on June 11, 2018 (Docket # 30), the motion becomes a non-starter and will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Messerli &amp; Kramer PA's and LVNV Funding LLC's motions for summary judgment (Docket # 38 and # 45) be and the same are hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   ; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' unopposed motion for extension of time (Docket # 54) be and the same is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    As of December 14, 2017, Boerner reports that Kachelski was an attorney of record in 590 cases in Dane County, 116 of which were \"open,\" meaning there was no judgment yet entered. Additionally, he was entered in 383 cases in Brown County, 45 of which were open; 449 cases in Waukesha County, 71 which were open; 329 cases in Racine County, 67 of which were open; and 2,909 cases in Milwaukee County, 607 of which were open.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Defendants also argue that Boerner's claim under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20427.104\">\n     Wis. Stat. \u00a7 427.104\n    </extracted-citation>\n    fails. (Docket # 39 at 13-14). The Court previously dismissed this state law claim (Docket # 32 at 17), and Boerner does not dispute this. (Docket # 46 at 15).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Defendants argue that \"open-ended accounts such as credit card accounts do not have a maturity...[so] there is no loan maturity date to accelerate with a credit card.\" (Docket # 50 at 4). Wis. Stat \u00a7 421.103 does not define the term \"accelerate.\" The Court understands \"acceleration\" to occur when a debt previously paid via installments, (be it a mortgage, where acceleration clauses are common, or a credit card balance, where such clauses are less common), is called due. In the case of a mortgage, a loan maturity date might be accelerated; in the case of a credit card balance, a final payment due date. In both cases, the borrower would be required to pay the principal balance and interest immediately. Additionally, the statute generally refers to acceleration of the \"maturity of a consumer credit transaction.\" Wis. Stat \u00a7 425.105. A loan can mature, or become due, at various points and under various conditions. The statute makes no reference to a \"fixed maturity,\" which would imply a date certain that the debt matures. In any event, even if the Defendants had not accelerated the debt, they did commence an action, so the statutes still apply.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Defendants also take issue with Boerner's use of the phrase \"accelerate the debt\" rather than \"accelerate the maturity date,\" but this is an acceptable turn of phrase.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Quorum\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208606258\">\n     2016 WL 8606258\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The Court is it not bound by the Wisconsin DFI's findings as they relate to federal law.\n    <em>\n     Orthopaedic Hosp. v.
