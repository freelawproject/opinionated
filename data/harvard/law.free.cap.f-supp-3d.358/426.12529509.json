[ECF 208]. The Foundation Defendants seek the dismissal of the action filed by Plaintiff Aetna Life Insurance Company (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Aetna Life\") premised on their contention that this Court must consider the non-diverse citizenships of the purported real parties-in-interest which destroy diversity jurisdiction over this matter. Plaintiff has opposed the motion. [ECF 211].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Subsequent to the parties' respective briefing on the Foundation Defendants' motion to dismiss, this Court directed Aetna Life to file a detailed list identifying: (1) the name of all self-insureds on behalf of whom Aetna Life seeks damages in this case and the citizenship of each of these entities for jurisdiction purposes; and (2) the names of the Aetna entities which paid the fully insured claims at issue in this case and the citizenship of these entities for jurisdiction purposes. [ECF 216]. The parties were also directed to address whether any claim belonging to any of the entities identified in Aetna Life's list can and/or should be severed from this matter pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 21 in order to preserve diversity jurisdiction. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Both parties complied with said Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The issues raised in the Court's Order and the Foundation Defendants' motion to dismiss have been fully briefed and are now ripe for adjudication. Pursuant to Rule 21 and for the reasons set forth, Defendant Huntingdon Valley Surgery Center (\"Defendant Huntingdon\") is dropped from this matter, as are all claims asserted by Aetna Life on behalf of the self-insureds for whom Aetna Life has not provided citizenship. As a result of this Court's ruling, diversity jurisdiction is maintained, and the Foundation Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 5, 2013, Aetna Life filed its initial complaint against Defendant Huntingdon Valley Surgery Center (\"Defendant Huntingdon\"), invoking diversity jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), as the basis for federal jurisdiction. Aetna Life is a Connecticut corporation with its principal place of business in Connecticut. Defendant Huntingdon is a Pennsylvania limited partnership with twenty-two limited partners in Pennsylvania and/or New Jersey. Thus, Defendant Huntingdon is deemed a citizen of both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. On December 2, 2013, Aetna Life filed an amended complaint (the operative complaint) which added the Foundation Defendants as parties. The Foundation Defendants are deemed citizens of Oklahoma. All parties agree that on the face of the amended complaint, complete diversity exists with respect to the actual entities named as parties to this litigation. However, as will be discussed below, diversity jurisdiction is destroyed if this Court is required to consider the citizenships of the numerous self-insureds on whose behalf Aetna Life asserts many of its claims since some of these self-insureds are citizens of Pennsylvania and/or New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the amended complaint, Aetna Life is a managed care company offering insurance and administrative services to employer and pension-sponsored health benefit plans and their members nationwide. It also provides administrative services to health plans that are self-funded by employers or other groups. For its \"fully insured\" plans, Aetna Life administers health benefit claims and bears the financial risk of paying claims. For its \"self-insured\" plans, Aetna Life pays claims from the employer's own assets and provides third-party administrative services, such as the processing of claims and the recovery of overpayments. In a fully-insured health plan, premiums are paid to an insurance company, like Aetna Life, in exchange for insurance coverage. In turn, the insurer directly pays covered claims. In a self-funded or self-insured health benefit plan, the organization itself assumes the risk of the cost of health care services for its employees, and typically contracts with an entity, like Aetna Life, to provide administrative services. Aetna Life, serving as a plan administrator, oversees and manages the self-funded plans. As the plan administrator, Aetna Life may advance funds to pay claims, but those funds are reimbursed by the plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the amended complaint, Aetna Life alleges that Defendants violated a Pennsylvania anti-kickback statute, committed insurance fraud, and tortiously interfered with contracts between Aetna Life and Defendant Huntingdon's physician-owners. Aetna Life's accusations stem from Defendants' alleged unlawful and fraudulent business policies and practices contrived and implemented by them to the financial detriment of Aetna Life\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and to its self-insureds.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Briefly, Aetna Life contends that Defendants established an \"out-of network\" scheme to pay kickbacks to physicians to induce their referral of patients to Defendant Huntington\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   rather than to less\n   costly in-network facilities in the same geographic area. Aetna Life contends that these allegedly fraudulent referrals violate Pennsylvania law and public policy interest in containing healthcare costs; and that Defendants unlawfully inflated healthcare costs payable by Aetna Life and/or its self-insureds when Defendants waived co-payments that Aetna Life's insureds were required to pay for services provided at an out-of-network facility, such as Defendant Huntingdon, without advising Aetna Life of the waiver, while at the same time, billing for the full costs of the provided services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Notably, over the course of this litigation, Aetna Life has acknowledged that the majority of the damages that it seeks in this litigation were actually incurred by Aetna Life's self-insureds, rather than by Aetna Life. In addition, some of the damages sought were suffered by other Aetna entities, rather than by Aetna Life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As noted, an appeal was taken on this matter, and a remand was ordered.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 5. Upon remand, the Foundation Defendants filed the underlying motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. [ECF 208]. Following the parties' briefing on the Foundation Defendants' motion to dismiss, Aetna Life was ordered to identify for diversity jurisdiction purposes: (1) all of the self-insureds on behalf of whom Plaintiff seeks damages in this case and the citizenship of each of these self-insureds; and (2) the Aetna entities which paid fully insured claims at issue in this case, and the citizenship of each such entity. [ECF 216]. The parties were also ordered to address whether any claim belonging to any of the self-insureds and/or Aetna entities identified could and/or should be severed from this matter. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response to the Order, Aetna Life identified ninety-five (95) entities which held citizenship in either Pennsylvania or New Jersey. None of the entities identified held citizenship in Oklahoma. Aetna Life has admittedly failed to identify the citizenship of ten to fourteen entities. Regardless, in light of Aetna Life's identification of self-insured entities with citizenship in either Pennsylvania or New Jersey, if the citizenship of these Pennsylvania and/or New Jersey self-insured entities is considered for the purpose of jurisdiction, this\n   Court would lack diversity jurisdiction over this matter because of the presence of Defendant Huntingdon, a citizen of both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. As such, this Court must determine whether the citizenship of these self-insureds must be considered for jurisdiction purposes and, if so, whether Rule 21 can and/or should be applied to save this Court's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It is well-settled that \"federal courts have an ever-present obligation to satisfy themselves of their subject matter jurisdiction and to decide the issue\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   ,\" if necessary.\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut.

Here, the Foundation Defendants make a factual attack. The Third Circuit explained a factual attack as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The factual attack, however, differs greatly for here the trial court may proceed as it never could under 12(b)(6) or Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Because at issue in a factual 12(b)(1) motion is the trial court's jurisdiction - its very power to hear the case - there is substantial authority that the trial court is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as to the existence of its power to hear the case. In short, no presumptive truthfulness attaches to plaintiff's allegations, and the existence of disputed material facts will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of jurisdictional claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Mortensen v.

In addition, the plaintiff has \"the burden of proof that jurisdiction does in fact exist.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3463066\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/294/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 891 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Benefit Life Co. v.

Under this standard, a district court has \"a free hand in evaluating jurisdictional evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 892.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In its motion to dismiss, the Foundation Defendants essentially argue a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because (1) Aetna Life is not the \"real party in interest,\" at least as to some of the claims asserted, and (2) that at least some of the real parties in interest are non-diverse, thereby, destroying diversity jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, as to the self-insured plans (the \"self-insureds\"), the Foundation Defendants argue that the real party in interest for diversity purposes is the employer or pension that sponsors the plan and actually pays the benefits, not Aetna Life\n   which merely administers the plan. Similarly, the Foundation Defendants argue that for the fully insured plans, Aetna Life is not the real party in interest for diversity purposes with respect to some of the claims asserted because those claims were paid by other Aetna affiliates and not by Aetna Life. In response, Aetna Life argues that it is the real party in interest under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17 because some of the claims are, in fact, its own, and because many (though not all) of the other purported real parties in interest have assigned their claims to Aetna Life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While both parties in this case tangentially mention the \"real party in interest\" standard of Rule 17(a), it is apparent from the parties' voluminous briefs and relevant caselaw cited that the actual dispute turns on the related question of whether Plaintiff Aetna Life is the \"real party to the controversy,\" rather than the \"real party in interest,\" for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. Rule 17 requires that \"[e]very action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(a). \"This means that an 'action must be brought by the person who, according to the governing substantive law, is entitled to enforce the right.\"\n   <em>\n    Oscar Gruss &amp; Son, Inc. v.

The United States Supreme Court has recognized, however, that while \"[t]here is a 'rough symmetry' between the 'real party in interest' standard of Rule 17(a) and the rule that diversity jurisdiction depends upon the citizenship of real parties to the controversy[,] ... the two rules serve different purposes and need not produce identical outcomes in all cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Navarro Sav.

That is, Aetna Life asserts that\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   is the real party in interest for purposes of the present matter because it was actually the payer of benefits with respect to some of its asserted claims in this litigation and, further, has obtained an assignment of rights from many (though not all) of the self-insureds on whose behalf it also asserts claims. In support of its argument,\n   Aetna Life relies on a provision included in its contracts with\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of its self-insureds,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [I]f it is determined that more than the appropriate amount has been paid, Aetna shall undertake good faith efforts to recover the erroneous payment. For the purposes of this provision, 'good faith efforts' means that Aetna will contact the responsible party twice via letter, phone, email, or other means to try to make the recovery. If those efforts are unsuccessful in obtaining recovery, Aetna may use an outside vendor, collection agency or attorney to pursue recovery. Except as stated in this section, Aetna has no other obligations with respect to the recovery of overpayments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While this contractual provision authorizes Aetna Life to act as an agent for its self-insureds to recover damages on their claims by, in some instances, initiating litigation, these provisions do not constitute assignment of the self-insureds' substantive rights and claims to Aetna Life such that the claims would belong to Aetna Life and not to the self-insureds. This Court finds that this provision does not transfer ownership of any claims otherwise belonging to the self-insureds to Aetna Life. It merely gives Aetna Life the right, but not the obligation, to hire attorneys to pursue overpayments on behalf of the self-insureds.

The Foundation Defendants, on the other hand, argue that this Court should not drop or sever any parties or claims but should rather dismiss the action in its entirety because of the lack of complete diversity between the originally named parties, once the citizenships of the other real parties in interest are considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This Court finds that Defendant Huntingdon, who has already been dismissed pursuant to Rule 41, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 161], is not a necessary or an indispensable party under the standards outlined above and, therefore, it can be dropped from this action in order to preserve this Court's jurisdiction. First, Defendant Huntingdon is not a necessary party to this litigation under Rule 19(a) because complete relief can be accorded to the remaining parties in Huntingdon's absence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1)(A). Further, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Defendant Huntingdon claims an interest relating to the subject of this action now that it has settled\n   with Aetna Life and been dismissed from this action, disposition of the case in Defendant Huntingdon's absence neither impedes its ability to protect that interest nor \"leave[s] an existing party subject to substantial risk of incurring double, multiple or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1)(B). Further, Defendant Huntingdon is not a necessary or indispensable party to this litigation because it is \"no more than an alleged joint tortfeasor\" accused of participating with the Foundation Defendants in the same fraudulent scheme.\n   <em>\n    In re Howmedica Osteonics Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275273\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/390/#p408\">\n    867 F.3d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 408 (3d Cir. 2017).

No compelling argument has been presented to show that either Defendant Huntingdon or the Foundation Defendants would suffer meaningful prejudice were this action to proceed in the absence of Defendant Huntingdon. Therefore, Defendant Huntingdon is not indispensable and can be dropped pursuant to Rules 19 and 21 in order to preserve this Court's diversity jurisdiction over this matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Aetna Life also argues that this Court should sever any claims brought by Aetna Life on behalf of those self-insureds whose citizenship remains unknown.

Clearly, complete relief can be accorded to the remaining parties in the absence of these self-insureds. Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1)(A). Further, the disposition of the case in these self-insureds' absence neither impedes their ability to protect their interest nor \"leave[s] an existing party subject to substantial risk of incurring double, multiple or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Because some of these self-insureds are citizens of Pennsylvania and/or New Jersey, complete diversity does not exist while Defendant Huntingdon remains in this action. Notwithstanding, this Court exercises its discretion to drop Defendant Huntingdon, as well as those self-insureds\n   for whom Aetna Life has not provided citizenship information, from this action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 19 and 21, in order to retain jurisdiction over this matter. Accordingly, the Foundation Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    In adjudicating the underlying motion, this Court has also considered the parties' respective supporting briefs and exhibits.
