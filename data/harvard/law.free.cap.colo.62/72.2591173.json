Kaus, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-15\">Plaintiff in error, as plaintiff below, alleged in his complaint that he was, and for several years had been a resident and citizen of Telluride, Colorado, engaged as a pharmacist and confidential clerk, and had enjoyed the business confidence of the community; that October 31, 1913, defendant (defendant in error) in a certain discourse and statement made by him in the city of Telluride, in the presence and hearing of divers persons, ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>lic\u00ediously spoke and published of and concerning plaintiff, tli\u00e9 false and malicious words following, to-wit: \u2018 \u2018 That he (plaintiff) was short in his (plaintiff\u2019s) accounts in the' slim of $515.00. Meaning thereby to falsely and maliciously charge the plaintiff with having stolen and embezzled from defendant the sum of $515.00.\u201d There are two other causes of action alleged; but this one is sufficient to present the questions herein involved. Defendant answered admitting the residence of plaintiff, denying on information and belief that he enjoyed the business confidence of the community; admitted that on or about the time alleged, he stated .to plaintiff, and possibly to others, that plaintiff was short in his accounts with defendant; but denied that he ever, at any time- stated to any person or persons that plaintiff was short in the sum of $515.00, and denied that any statement made by him concerning plaintiff\u2019s accounts was false or malicious, but avers that plaintiff was at the time defendant made the statement, and still is, short in his accounts with defendant. As a further defense, defendant alleged that during the absence of defendant from the city of Telluride he left plaintiff in charge of his drug and jewelry store, during which time plaintiff converted to his own use certain articles, and wholly failed either to pay for or to charge them to his own account, on the books of defendant, or in any way to account for their value, \u2014 the value of these articles being a part and parcel of the alleged shortage. That on or about April 5, 1913, plaintiff, with the authority and consent of defendant, loaned $10.00 to one L. C. Bailey from defendant\u2019s cash drawer, which amount was duly charged on defendant\u2019s books to Bailey; that thereafter, as defendant is informed and verily believes, plaintiff falsely represented to Bailey, that defendant had either charged him, plaintiff, with the money, or was holding him personally responsible for it, and by virtue of such false representa,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tion secured the payment of the amount from Bailey to plaintiff, who converted it to his own use; which $10.00 constitutes a part and parcel of the alleged shortage. The answer contains further allegations of defensive matter which our disposition of the case makes it unnecessary to consider. A reply was filed denying the allegations of new matter. After the issues were joined, defendant presented what is denominated a motion for judgment on the pleadings upon the grounds:</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-5\">I.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-6\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant,\u201d and under subheadings a, b, c, d and e, sets out the specific reasons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-7\">II.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-8\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s complaint fails to state a cause of action against the defendant, in that the words alleged to have been slanderously used by the defendant are not actionable perse: * *</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-9\">This motion wa-s sustained and judgment of dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s case duly entered by the court.

We have often held that the right to cure a defective complaint, if any defect exists, by amendment cannot be cut off by converting a motion of this kind into a general demurrer. Such a motion by defendant could not take the place of a general demurrer to the <em>complaint. </em>\u2014 Roberts <em>v. C. S. &amp; I. Ry. Co., </em>45 Colo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>189, 101 Pac. 59; <em>Shuler v. Allam, </em>45 Colo. 372, 376, 101 Pac. 350, and cases cited; <em>Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>51 Colo. 139, 119 Pac. 472; <em>Eppich v. Blanchard, </em>58 Colo. 139, 143 Pac. 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> The principal question presented by the record is as to whether the words, \u201cShort in his accounts,\u201d spoken of a clerical employe, are actionable <em>per se. </em>Defendant in error in discussing the subject claims the gist of the action is based upon the word \u201cshort,\u201d and proceeds to argue that such word is not actionable <em>per se. </em>No one would seriously contend that saying of another he was short, would be actionable <em>per se; </em>but for an employer to say of his clerk that he was \u2018 \u2018 short in his accounts,\u201d is quite another matter. The words must be taken and considered in their commonly accepted meaning; and there is no doubt that people generally would understand that the person to whom they were applied was guilty of wrongfully converting to his own use the funds or property of his employer. Taking this view, we must hold that used as they are charged to have been in this complaint, the words are actionable <em>per se. </em>In <em>Sunley v. Insurance Co., </em>132 Ia. 123, 109 N. W. 463, 12 L. R. A. (N. S.) 91, it is said in substance that the statement that an employe is \u2018 \u2018 short in his accounts, \u2019 \u2019 charges him with a criminal act, but if this were not so, it imputes to him dishonesty and unfaithfulness and is actionable <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">It would have been error to have granted a motion by defendant for judgment on the pleadings. We have held where issue has been joined by the filing of a complaint, answer and replication, and defendant then moves for judgment on the pleadings, the motion should not be granted unless the pleadings are not sufficient to sustain a different judgment notwithstanding any evidence which might be produced. The pleadings in such a case must show that in no event can plaintiff <em>recover. </em>\u2014 Rice <em>v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>Bush, </em>16 Colo. 489, 27 Pac. 720; <em>Mills v.
