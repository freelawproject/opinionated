Appellant and cross-appellee, Enzo Martinez (\u201cMartinez\u201d), a minor, by and through his parents,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleged that appellee and cross-appellant, The Johns Hopkins Hospital (\u201cthe Hospital\u201d), negligently failed to perform a timely Caesarean section, causing Martinez to suffer from cerebral palsy, retardation, and other disorders.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">After a two week trial, a jury awarded Martinez $4 million for lost wages, $25 million for future medical expenses, and $26 million for non-economic damages. The court entered judgment in favor of Martinez in the amount of $55 million. Thereafter, the Hospital filed a motion for new trial, to alter or amend judgment, and for remittitur. The trial court denied the Hospital\u2019s request for a new trial. The trial court further reduced the jury\u2019s award for lost wages from $4 million to $2,621,825, and reduced the jury\u2019s $26 million award for non-economic damages to $680,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Martinez filed a notice of appeal on September 18, 2012. The Hospital filed a cross-appeal on September 19, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Martinez presents one question for review, which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">1. Whether the circuit court erred by reducing the jury\u2019s non-economic damages award on the basis that Maryland\u2019s cap on non-economic damages is unconstitutional because it violates the separation of powers doctrine under the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The Hospital presents four questions for review, which we have reordered and rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">1. Whether the circuit court abused its discretion by precluding evidence regarding the standard of care applicable to nurse-midwives, and a midwife\u2019s breach of that standard of care while treating Ms. Fielding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">2. Whether the circuit court abused its discretion by admitting evidence that Ms. Fielding was never offered general anesthesia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">3. Whether there was sufficient evidence to support a jury award of $25 million for Martinez\u2019s future medical expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">4. Whether the circuit court abused its discretion by declining to annuitize the jury award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the circuit court erred in precluding evidence of the nurse-midwife standard of care, and in precluding evidence of a breach of that standard of care by a nurse-midwife while treating Ms. Fielding. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and remand for further proceedings. For guidance on remand, we shall also address whether the circuit court erred in admitting evidence regarding the offering of general anesthesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">On March 25, 2010, Ms. Fielding began labor with her first child, Martinez. Ms. Fielding elected to have a natural birth at home, with the assistance of Evelyn Muhlhan, a registered nurse midwife (\u201cMidwife Muhlhan\u201d), and a doula.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">Ms. Fielding (who was 10 days overdue) was in labor for 14.5 hours during the first stage of labor, and at least five hours more in the second stage of labor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The position of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>baby was occiput posterior.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This means that the baby\u2019s head was down; however, unlike the usual presentation, he was facing forward instead of inward, toward Ms. Fielding\u2019s spine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At 12:30 a.m., Midwife Muhlhan attempted to expedite delivery while at Ms. Fielding\u2019s home. First, Midwife Muhlhan applied fundal pressure<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to Ms. Fielding two or three times. Second, Midwife Muhlhan injected Ms. Fielding multiple times with Pitocin, a hormone that increases the strength and frequency of contractions. Third, misjudging the state of her labor, Ms. Muhlhan performed an episiotomy, which is a procedure performed upon immediate delivery in which the perineum is cut in order to enlarge the vaginal opening. Finally, Ms. Muhlhan directed Ms. Fielding to cleanse herself with a probiotic treatment, as an alternative to taking antibiotics, in order to prevent the potentially fatal transmission of Group B streptococcus bacteria (for which Ms. Fielding had tested positive), to the baby during labor and delivery. After providing these treatments, Midwife Muhlhan \u201cdecided it was time to go to the hospital.\u201d Midwife Muhlhan sutured the episiotomy and called an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Ms. Fielding arrived at the Hospital at 3:30 a.m. on March 26, 2010. Ms. Fielding was an unknown patient to the Hospital. The Hospital\u2019s labor and delivery team evaluated Ms. Fielding\u2019s status and the best way to deliver her baby. The team also applied a fetal heart rate monitor. The medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>records indicate that the descent level of the baby was assessed as +1 station<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> when Ms. Fielding arrived at the Hospital. The baby remained at +1 after they gave Ms. Fielding a chance to push a few times.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">At 3:45 a.m., Dr. Christopher Ennen, the treating physician, and Dr. Sherrine Ibrahim, the attending senior resident physician, determined that Ms. Fielding would be unable to deliver Martinez vaginally. Rather, the Hospital\u2019s physicians concluded that an \u201curgent\u201d Caesarean section was required.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Hospital\u2019s physicians determined that an \u201cemergency\u201d Caesarean section was not required because the fetal heart rate monitor indicated that the fetus was being adequately oxygenated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>The Hospital team took Ms. Fielding\u2019s medical history and drew blood for laboratory testing. The blood tests were sent to the Hospital\u2019s laboratory on a \u201cstat\u201d basis, meaning they were the \u201chighest\u201d priority and should be completed \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d The Hospital explained at trial that the blood testing was necessary in order to determine whether it would be safe to administer spinal/epidural anesthesia to Ms. Fielding during the Caesarean section procedure. The Hospital also administered IV penicillin to Ms. Fielding to reduce the risk of passing her Group B streptococcus bacteria on to Martinez. Further, the Hospital obtained Ms. Fielding\u2019s consent for spinal/epidural anesthesia, administered medications to reduce the strength of Ms. Fielding\u2019s contractions, and made other pre-delivery preparations.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Some of the laboratory test results were returned at 3:57 a.m. The tests showed a negative result for syphilis. At 4:14 a.m., the Hospital re-ordered the remaining blood tests, which related to Ms. Fielding\u2019s blood type and platelet count.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The remaining laboratory test results were returned at 4:52 a.m. The Hospital determined that, based upon the test results, it would be safe to use spinal/epidural anesthesia for Ms. Fielding\u2019s Caesarean section. The anesthesia was administered and Ms. Fielding was prepared for surgery. At 4:57 a.m., the Hospital transported Ms. Fielding to the operating room. Martinez was delivered at 5:40 a.m., and his condition at birth was poor. He now suffers from cerebral palsy, retardation, and other disorders.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Martinez, by and through his parents, filed a complaint alleging that the Hospital negligently failed to perform a timely Caesarean section. In short, Martinez argued that \u201chad [Martinez] been delivered by 4:15 a.m., as the standard of care required, he would not have suffered any injury.\u201d Further, Martinez argued at trial that the Hospital also \u201cfail[ed] to recognize ominous signs of fetal distress.\u201d Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>tinez contended that the Hospital should have converted to an emergency Caesarean section based on the status of Martinez\u2019s fetal heart rate monitor. Accordingly, Martinez concluded that the Hospital was also negligent in performing an urgent Caesarean section, rather than an emergency Caesarean section.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The Hospital argued that Midwife Muhlhan was solely responsible for Martinez\u2019s injuries, and, therefore, that Martinez\u2019s injuries \u201coccurred a number of hours prior to the delivery and prior to the arrival at Johns Hopkins.\u201d Additionally, the Hospital argued that the timing in performing the urgent Caesarean section was medically necessary in order to evaluate the effects of Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s treatment on Ms. Fielding. The Hospital posited that the delay in receiving blood tests was due, in part, to Ms. Fielding\u2019s lack of cooperation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, the Hospital maintained that an emergency Caesarean section was not required because the fetal heart rate monitor indicated that the fetus was being adequately oxygenated.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">After a two week trial, a jury awarded Martinez $4 million for lost wages, $25 million for future medical expenses, and $26 million for non-economic damages. The court entered judgment in favor of Martinez in the amount of $55 million. Thereafter, the Hospital filed a motion for new trial, to alter or amend judgment, and for remittitur. After a two day hearing, the trial court denied the Hospital\u2019s request for a new trial, and reduced the jury\u2019s award for lost wages from $4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>million to $2,621,825. The trial court further ruled that the Maryland cap on non-economic damages (\u201cthe Cap\u201d) was constitutional, and reduced the jury\u2019s $26 million award for non-economic damages to $680,000 in accordance with the Cap. Martinez noted this timely appeal, and the Hospital also noted its timely cross-appeal on the following day. Additional facts relevant to the issues on appeal are summarized below.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">A. Motion <em>in Limine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Martinez filed a pre-trial motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to exclude testimony regarding the standard of care applicable to Midwife Muhlhan, and Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s alleged breach of that standard of care while treating Ms. Fielding. The Hospital filed an extensive response, arguing that the midwife standard of care, and Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s breach of that standard of care, were relevant to the Hospital\u2019s defense. The Hospital\u2019s theory was that the Hospital was not negligent, nor was it a cause of any injury to Martinez. Rather, the Hospital contended, the injury was solely caused by Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s negligence before Ms. Fielding ever arrived at the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">In support of its opposition to the motion <em>in limine, </em>the Hospital attached an order from the Maryland Board of Nursing (\u201cthe Board\u201d), which suspended Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s certification and license to practice as a nurse-midwife. The order provided that the Board had never authorized Midwife Muhlhan to perform home deliveries, and concluded that Midwife Muhlhan had violated the Nurse Practice Act (\u201cNPA\u201d) based upon the care that she provided to Ms. Fielding and other patients. In particular, as to the care rendered to Ms. Fielding, the Board found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\">[Midwife Muhlhan] violated the NPA during her care of [Ms. Fielding] for reasons including, but not limited to, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-9\">i. Practicing as a CRNM in a home delivery setting without an approved Agreement that includes home births and practicing without a collaborating physician for homebirths.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>ii. Lack of documentation, including labor and delivery records and fetal monitoring strips, regarding the patient\u2019s intra-partum course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">iii. Failing to treat the patient\u2019s GBS per Center for Disease Control guidelines and lack of documentation that the patient declined and understood the risks of declining antibiotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">iv. Performing an episiotomy when the baby\u2019s head was not crowning and the baby was at +1 station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">v. Administering Pitocin intramuscularly to augment labor and failing to document any fetal monitoring after administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">vi. Using or directing the use of fundal pressure, which is not considered an acceptable practice to hasten vaginal delivery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Accordingly, as a result of the treatment that Midwife Muhlhan provided to Ms. Fielding and four other individuals, the Board suspended Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s certification and license to practice as a nurse-midwife.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Board took emergency action to suspend Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s license on the basis that \u201cthe public health, safety or welfare imperatively require[d] emergency action[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">Additionally, the Hospital attached to its response to the motion <em>in limine </em>an excerpt from Dr. Katz\u2019s deposition. Dr. Katz determined that when Ms. Fielding arrived at the Hospital, there was evidence of \u201cuterine tetany\u201d due to the Pitocin administered by Midwife Muhlhan. Dr. Katz explained that, as a result, there was no relaxation in between contractions. Relaxation between contractions is important, Dr. Katz testified, because this is when \u201cthere is re-establishment of blood flow and there is proper oxygen exchange.\u201d By contrast, Dr. Katz stated that \u201c[w]hen you have lack of relaxation, there is no opportunity for exchange to happen[,] or less opportunity, and that can very adversely affect fetal oxygen status.\u201d Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Katz concluded that because of the Pitocin injections administered by Midwife Muhlhan, there was an \u201cabsence of oxygen [to Martinez which] is what ultimately caused damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Dr. Katz further observed in his deposition testimony that Martinez had \u201ccephalic hematoma, which cannot be explained except by trauma ... and the cause of that, of course, is the trying to force a head that was in a unique form through a narrow pelvis<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> ... [and by] try[ing] to force it with oxytocin, excessive stimulation or by pushing on the fundus or by exposing it to five hours of second stage [labor] when it\u2019s not making progress.\u201d Further, Dr. Katz explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">[The] baby\u2019s head [was] in occipital-posterior being banged against a pelvis for several hours with somebody pushing on the top of the baby trying to push it out between the labia, so much so to deform it that reportedly it was crowning<footnotemark>[16]</footnotemark> .... And then [the baby went] all the way back up, not being delivered successfully ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Based upon this treatment, Dr. Katz concluded that injury was caused to Martinez \u201cduring those times when [Midwife Muhlhan was] hitting and beating up on this baby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Finally, Dr. Katz\u2019s deposition testimony provided that fundal pressure is no longer used in labor and deliveries, and that applying fundal pressuring during the second stage of labor in these circumstances constituted a breach of the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">After holding a hearing, the trial court granted Martinez\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>ruling that, \u201c[t]here cannot be testimony as to what the standard of care is for midwives or that this was a breach of the standard of care----\u201d In support of its ruling, the trial court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>----The issue here is the standard of care, whether or not, Hopkins breached the standard of care and whether that conduct caused [the injuries].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">Not somebody else\u2019s breach of a standard of care. Not somebody else\u2019s negligence. [The Hospital\u2019s] conduct [is what is relevant], because if [Midwife Muhlhan] breached the standard of care [but] caused no damage, then it\u2019s totally irrelevant.... [or it could be that] she didn\u2019t breach the standard of care, [but] caused the damage____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">... if you have testimony as far as causation. You have testimony that fundal pressure was applied at home, before she came to Hopkins, and if you have causation testimony----[t]hen why do you have to tell the jury that\u2014and that is a breach of standard of care, that\u2019s negligence to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\"># * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">I just\u2014I\u2019m concerned about the potential prejudice from the jury feeling there is a third-party here, who is not a party to the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Accordingly, the trial court concluded that, as to Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s conduct, only evidence regarding causation was relevant. The trial court, therefore, limited the Hospital to presenting evidence of: (1) the physical actions and conduct of Midwife Muhlhan; and (2) the reactions of the Hospital personnel when learning of this conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">B. Testimony Regarding Midwife Muhlhan</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">The following is a summary of the relevant testimony introduced at trial regarding the treatments used by Midwife Muhlhan.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">i. Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s Use of Pitocin</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">The Hospital asked its treating physician, Dr. Ennen, about his reaction when he learned that Ms. Fielding was given \u201ctwo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>to three injections intramuscular, or IM injections, of Pitocin at home.\u201d Dr. Ennen replied that his reactions were \u201c[s]urprise and shock.\u201d Dr. Ennen then explained that \u201cPitocin is something that we use in the hospital through an IV to\u2014in very carefully monitored doses to cause uterine contractions to be more frequent and/or stronger. It\u2019s never, in my experience that I know of, used as injections in the muscle in a non-monitored situation to cause labor to progress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The Hospital also offered testimony from Ms. Naomi Cross (\u201cNurse Cross\u201d), the nurse primarily responsible for Ms. Fielding\u2019s nursing care. However, upon Martinez\u2019s objection, the trial court precluded Nurse Cross from giving her firsthand account of how Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s actions affected her management of Ms. Fielding, or her experience with Pitocin. The trial judge did not elaborate on the basis for precluding this testimony.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The Hospital\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Katz, provided the following opinion on Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s use of Pitocin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">The Pitocin further aggravated the ability of the fetus to deal with the circumstances presented to it. And that was after the huge dose of Pitocin was given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">When asked to clarify what he meant by a \u201chuge dose,\u201d Dr. Katz explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">I assume that even if I take the lowest potential measurable dose that one can give by injection, it is 1,000 fold more than what you give in a hospital.... The concentration of Pitocin in the vial that is available commercially is one unit per milliliter. To give the jury an idea of what a milliliter is, we have in a small tablespoon\u2014correction, in a small teaspoon, we have about five milliliter. That will be approximately five units or 50,000 milliunits. In that little teaspoon. We in the hospital give usually one, two, five or 10 milliunits, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>thousands of milliunits. So you have an aurea difference here, even with the smallest syringe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Martinez\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Balducci, also addressed the use of Pitocin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">What I perceive here is the midwife had given a shot of IM or sub-q Pitocin____ And it sounds like they gave one milliunit, which is a very small dose, to enhance the contractions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The following exchange ensued during Dr. Balducci\u2019s cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\">Q: And the bottom line is that if you have that overstimulation situation [from use of Pitocin], it can cause lack of perfusion to the baby, and, therefore, lack of oxygen to the baby; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">A: That could occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-11\">Q: Can result in a severe lack of oxygen and, ultimately, neurological injury if it persisted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-12\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-13\">Q: Okay. You would agree that and understand why the Hopkins personnel were shocked or surprised, whatever word you want to use, when they got a history that she had two or three doses of IM Pitocin? You would agree with that, wouldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-14\">A: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be shocked. I mean, I think the midwives\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-15\">Q: Surprised? Can we agree on surprised?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-16\">A: Well, I think I\u2019ve seen midwives use this before in delivery centers, but they use small doses. They don\u2019t\u2014I still, to this day, don\u2019t know what the dose was. I\u2019m understanding the midwife said it was 1\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-17\">The trial judge sustained the Hospital\u2019s objection to Dr. Balducci\u2019s last comment and instructed the jury to disregard the statement. The Hospital\u2019s counsel then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-18\">Q: You would understand if the Hopkins personnel were surprised when she reported a history of the different doses of IM Pitocin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>A: Yeah, surprised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">Q: Okay. And that\u2019s because you\u2019re not aware of any physicians that are using that approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">Q: And you don\u2019t know if it was a minute or two later [when Midwife Muhlhan checked the fetal heart rate]. We just don\u2019t know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">A: Well, that\u2019s the way midwives will practice. If they hear 100, they\u2019ll turn her, and they\u2019ll recheck.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The trial court sustained the Hospital\u2019s objection to the last statement by Dr. Balducci.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Martinez\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Stokes, provided the following testimony regarding the use of Pitocin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-10\">Q: You\u2019re [sic] never given I-N [sic] Pitocin during the second stage of labor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-11\">A: I have not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-12\">Q: And you\u2019re not familiar with any obstetrician giving IN [sic] Pitocin in second stage labor, are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-13\">A: Not in recent years, but certainly, it was done in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-14\">Q: You\u2019re not familiar with any literature that advocates the use of I-N [sic] Pitocin during the second stage of labor, are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-15\">A: I\u2019m not familiar with any literature in the OB/GYN. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-16\">Q: .... You\u2019re not going to administer Pitocin except in a hospital setting with IV drip that you can control and constant electronic fetal monitoring to be able to observe and check the status of the fetus; is that correct, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av_\">A: That\u2019s the way obstetricians do it. It\u2019s not the way midwives do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-18\">Upon the Hospital\u2019s objection, the trial court then instructed the jury to disregard Dr. Stokes\u2019 last statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>THE COURT: All right.

Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s Use of Fundal Pressure</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">One of the Hospital\u2019s witnesses, Dr. Lauren Krill, testified that, \u201c[a]s a second year resident, like I said, I didn\u2019t realize that fundal pressure is something that somebody would actually do.\u201d Dr. Ibrahim, a resident physician at the Hospital, testified that Mr. Fielding told her he was \u201cuncomfortable with some of the things that were going on at home. And he demonstrated to me that the\u2014someone had used fundal pressure \"with two hands pushing on his wife\u2019s chest.\u201d Finally, the Hospital\u2019s obstetrical expert witness, Dr. Katz, testified that, \u201cYes, I think fundal pressure under these circumstances plays a role [in Martinez\u2019s injury].... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">On the other hand, however, the trial court stopped Dr. Katz from testifying the instant he uttered the word \u201cdeviation\u201d when referring to Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">Q: When did, is it your opinion, with that hypothetical I gave you, that the injury occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">A: Yes, it happened during the pushing phase of Mrs. Fielding, when the contractions were associated with substantial deviations and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">THE COURT: Stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">Martinez\u2019s expert witnesses testified as follows on cross-examination regarding the use of fundal pressure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-11\">A: Forceful fundal pressure with contractions is not something I would do. But the bottom line here is it didn\u2019t make any difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-12\">Q: Okay, okay.

Testimony Regarding the Hospital\u2019s Offering of General Anesthesia</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The following is a summary of the relevant testimony regarding whether the Hospital \u201coffered\u201d Ms. Fielding general anesthesia as an alternative to other forms of anesthesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Martinez\u2019s counsel asked its first obstetrical expert witness, Dr. James Balducci, whether the Hospital \u201cever offered [Ms. Fielding] general anesthesia.\u201d The Hospital objected, and the trial court initially overruled the objection. The Hospital explained to the trial judge that the objection was due to the fact that Martinez had not alleged a claim founded upon informed consent. Thereafter, the trial court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Martinez\u2019s second obstetrical expert witness, Dr. Richard Stokes, was asked whether Ms. Fielding\u2019s medical records indicated that she should not receive general anesthesia. Dr. Stokes interjected that the \u201coption [of general anesthesia] was never offered to the patient.\u201d Additionally, Dr. Stokes testified that the Hospital \u201cdid not offer the option of being put to sleep, which would have gotten her baby out a whole lot sooner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">When Ms. Fielding testified, Martinez\u2019s counsel asked whether she was \u201cever given a choice between general anesthesia versus a combined spinal-epidural.\u201d The Hospital objected, and the trial court overruled the objection. Thereafter, Ms. Fielding testified: \u201cNo. I was never given that option.\u201d In a subsequent bench conference, the Hospital again explained its argument regarding informed consent. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">THE COURT: There won\u2019t be an argument. There won\u2019t be an argument about informed consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-10\">[MARTINEZ\u2019S COUNSEL]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-11\">[THE HOSPITAL\u2019S COUNSEL]: I just wanted to make sure that you understood there was [a] reason [for the objection].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>THE COURT: No. I kind of wondered what it was.

Dr. Katz testified: \u201cI don\u2019t believe she was given, or should have been given [the choice of which anesthesia].\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">In closing argument, Martinez\u2019s counsel stated that the Hospital \u201ccould have converted to general anesthesia at any time they wanted[.]\u201d Moreover, Martinez\u2019s counsel explained: \u201cThey want to say, oh my God, the risks. It\u2019s a one percent risk. There is a risk for anything.\u201d Martinez\u2019s counsel further stated during closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">You\u2019re supposedly the number one hospital in the world, but can\u2019t get blood for an hour and 14 minutes, and is now too intimidated to use general anesthesia with a one percent risk? Ask any mother in that situation---What would any mother, any reasonable mother in that circumstance do? We\u2019ve got nine women on this jury. You all know what you would do. You would say give me the general anesthesia____ She wasn\u2019t even given the option because they were just going to wait.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">The Hospital did not object to Martinez\u2019s closing arguments. The jury was instructed on general negligence, and was not instructed on informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">D. Motion for New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">The trial court held a post-trial hearing on the Hospital\u2019s motion for new trial, to alter or amend judgment, and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>remittitur. The trial court considered various issues, including the preclusion of evidence regarding the midwife standard of care, the admission of evidence regarding the Hospital\u2019s offering of anesthesia to Ms. Fielding, the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury verdict, and the Hospital\u2019s request to annuitize the jury award. Ultimately, the trial court rejected each of the Hospital\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">In considering the first issue, the trial court ruled that the exclusion of midwife standard of care evidence did not deny the Hospital a fair trial. In particular, the trial judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">[T]he defense was not prevented and did, in fact, present evidence that the midwife\u2019s conduct was dangerous under the circumstances, why it was dangerous under the circumstances that it caused the damages, and how it caused the damages. Defense was free to vigorously argue that the midwife\u2019s conduct was the proximate cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">They were, however, prevented from characterizing the conduct as \u201cnegligent.\u201d Telling the jury that a nonparty is negligent as opposed to how the conduct affected what happened to the plaintiff would have been prejudicial and not relevant to the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Regarding the second issue, the trial judge observed that the testimony regarding whether general anesthesia was \u201coffered\u201d would \u201cnot be admissible if it goes to informed consent.\u201d The trial judge, however, ruled that the challenged evidence was admissible to show that Ms. Fielding had not refused general anesthesia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">On the issue of informed consent, the defense presented evidence that the mother was very uncooperative, combative, resisting, and making management generally, more difficult of her. The challenged evidence was therefore not admitted as an informed consent issue, but it was relevant to show that they were not waiting for blood work because of the mother\u2019s refusal or anything that the mother did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az6\">The trial judge also recognized that Martinez\u2019s closing argument was improper and \u201cexceed[ed] the directions that I had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>given from the bench on the issue of informed consent.\u201d The trial judge, nevertheless, pointed out that the Hospital did not object to Martinez\u2019s closing argument. Accordingly, the trial judge explained that, \u201chad an objection been made, I was prepared to sustain the objection and give a curative instruction to the jury.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court denied the Hospital\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">I.

Martinez, therefore, contends that the jury award for non-economic damages should not have been reduced from $26 million to $680,000. The Hospital posits that it is well settled under Maryland law that the Cap is constitutional.

Exclusion of Evidence Regarding the Midwife Standard of Care and the Granting of Martinez\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The Hospital argues that the trial court erred by precluding evidence of the midwife standard of care and Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s alleged breach of the applicable standard of care. Martinez posits that this argument is not preserved for appellate review, and, regardless, the trial court properly excluded the evidence in question. In particular, Martinez argues that the trial court\u2019s resolution of the motion <em>in limine </em>was not \u201cclearly intended to be the final word on the matter\u201d because the court did not \u201cinstruct [the Hospital] ... not to proffer the evidence again during trial.\u201d We agree with the Hospital that this issue is preserved for our review because the trial court made a final ruling on the motion <em>in limine. </em>We further hold that the trial court erred by excluding evidence of the midwife standard of care, and Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s breach of that standard of care while treating Ms. Fielding.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This error denied the Hospital a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">i.

Several cases have addressed whether a ruling on a motion <em>in limine </em>is final. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 356-57, 535 A.2d 445 (ruling on a motion <em>in limine </em>is final where \u201cthe trial judge resolves the[ ] motions <em>[in limine] </em>by clearly determining that the questionable evidence will <em>not </em>be admitted, and by instructing counsel not to proffer the evidence again during trial----\u201d); <em>Simmons, </em>313 Md. at 38, 542 A.2d 1258 (citing <em>Prout, </em>311 Md. at 358, 535 A.2d 445) (ruling on a motion <em>in limine </em>is final when the trial judge has \u201cdirected defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>counsel to avoid raising the issue during his cross-examination of the witness\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 38, 535 A.2d 445 (holding that a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion <em>in limine </em>was a final ruling when \u201c[t]he trial judge unconditionally ruled that he would not \u2018let anybody tell this jury what this man\u2019s thought processes are\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling constituted a final ruling on the motion <em>in limine. </em>The trial judge granted Martinez\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>and expressly stated that \u201c[t]here cannot be testimony as to what the standard of care is for midwives or that this was a breach of the standard of care----\u201d Martinez points out that the ruling was not final because the trial court stated it would reconsider if \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s witnesses[ ] open the door.\u201d However, the trial judge\u2019s \u201copening the door\u201d caveat was raised only due to a question by Martinez\u2019s counsel seeking clarification of the ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">[MARTINEZ\u2019S COUNSEL]: [The Hospital\u2019s counsel] are not permitted to create opening the door [ ] themselves on cross, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">THE COURT: Right. I mean, you may open it through cross examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">[MARTINEZ\u2019S COUNSEL]: Right. I understand. But they can\u2019t ask the question directly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\">THE COURT: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">The Hospital\u2019s counsel then asked for further clarification. Counsel gave examples of what they could ask during cross-examination, but noted that they could not ask, \u201cis it a violation of standard of care?\u201d The trial judge replied, \u201c[c]orrect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">In sum, just as in <em>Prout, </em>the trial judge determined that the evidence at issue would not be admitted. Similarly, as in <em>Simmons, </em>the trial court directed defense counsel to avoid raising the issue during cross-examination. Accordingly, the trial judge made a final ruling on the motion <em>in limine, </em>and the Hospital was left with nothing to do at trial but follow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>court\u2019s instructions. We, therefore, hold that the issue is preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">ii. Relevancy of Midwife Standard of Care</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">We now turn to the substantive question whether the Hospital was properly precluded from presenting evidence of the midwife standard of care, or Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s breach of that standard of care while treating Ms. Fielding. The Hospital argues that the midwife standard of care testimony was relevant for two reasons. First, the testimony was relevant to the Hospital\u2019s defense that Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s negligence solely caused Martinez\u2019s brain damage before Ms. Fielding ever arrived at the Hospital, and, therefore, the Hospital was not a cause of injury. The Hospital argues that this is because \u201c[njegligent and grossly negligent medical treatment ... is much more likely to cause injury than non-negligent medical treatment.\u201d Second, the Hospital contends, it was relevant to explaining why the Caesarean section took place when it did. The Hospital alleged that it had to undertake additional evaluations to determine the effect of the Midwife\u2019s negligence on the fetus and the mother before performing the Caesarean section.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Martinez argues that the trial court did not err because the Hospital\u2019s causation defense was not contingent upon a finding that Midwife Muhlhan violated the standard of care. Rather, if the jury were to find that Midwife Muhlhan was \u201cthe sole cause of [Martinez\u2019s] injuries, the jury was obligated to find for the Hospital regardless of whether her conduct was negligent or completely innocent.\u201d Accordingly, Martinez concludes that the standard of care testimony was irrelevant, and the trial judge did not err in precluding the testimony. On the record before us, we hold that the evidence of the midwife standard of care, and Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s breach of that stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>dard of care material to causing Martinez\u2019s injury, is relevant to the Hospital\u2019s defense that it was not negligent and not a cause of injury.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The trial court limited the Hospital to presenting evidence of: (1) the physical actions and conduct of Midwife Muhlhan; and (2) the Hospital\u2019s immediate reactions when learning of this conduct.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The trial judge precluded any evidence that Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s midwifery did not meet the applicable standard of care, or that Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s actions were negligent. In making its ruling, the trial judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaq\">Not somebody else\u2019s breach of a standard of care. Not somebody else\u2019s negligence. [The Hospital\u2019s] conduct [is what is relevant], because if [Midwife Muhlhan] beached the standard of care [but] caused no damage, then it\u2019s totally irrelevant____ [or it could be that] she didn\u2019t breach the standard of care, [but] caused the damage----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">We begin by examining the rationale employed by the trial court. First, the trial judge determined that the standard of care evidence was not relevant because Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s breach of her standard of care would not excuse the Hospital\u2019s breach of its standard of care. Critically, this rationale necessarily presumes that the Hospital breached its standard of care. The Hospital\u2019s defense, however, was that it was not negligent, and did not cause any injury to Martinez. Second, the trial judge observed that Midwife Muhlhan could have breached her standard of care but caused no damage, or caused damage without breaching the standard of care. In either case, the trial judge reasoned that the standard of care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>related to the midwife would be irrelevant. While the trial judge\u2019s inferences are reasonable, his rationale does not recognize the other obvious possibility; namely, that Midwife Muhlhan breached her standard of care, and that the breach was the sole cause of Martinez\u2019s injuries. This was precisely the defense advanced by the Hospital at trial. Thus, the relevant inquiry on appeal is whether evidence of a non-party\u2019s negligence is relevant to a defendant\u2019s complete denial of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Maryland courts have seemingly not decided whether a party may defend itself with evidence of a non-party\u2019s negligence. Courts in other jurisdictions, however, have considered the issue related to a non-party\u2019s negligence, and have deemed such evidence admissible. <em>See, e.g., Jefferson v. Lyon Sheet Metal Works, </em>376 S.W.3d 37, 45 (Mo.Ct.App.2012), <em>reh\u2019g and/or transfer denied </em>(June 28, 2012) (\u201cThe trial court erred in prohibiting [defendant] from presenting its defense and advocating [third party\u2019s] negligence at trial.\u201d); <em>Owens v.

United States, </em>887 F.Supp. 728, 743 (D.N.J.1995) (\u201cDefendants will be allowed to introduce evidence of [non-party\u2019s] negligence in an effort to prove that it was the sole proximate cause of [plaintiffs] injuries.

With no one allowed to show what part the [non-party\u2019s] conduct played, the jury would be left to wonder whether anyone other than the defendant <em>could </em>have caused [the] plaintiffs injuries. Thus, the defendant ... was entitled to show that the [non-party\u2019s] negligence was the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ai-\"><em>Archambault, </em>287 Conn, at 32-33, 946 A.2d 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">We are persuaded by the logical and well-reasoned rationale of our sister jurisdictions. Here, the Hospital was entitled to try to convince the jury that not only was it <em>not </em>negligent and <em>not </em>the cause of Martinez\u2019s injuries, but that Midwife Muhlhan <em>was </em>negligent and <em>did </em>cause the injuries. There was a void of evidence that left a logical hiatus in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>story because the jury was not allowed to hear what role Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s conduct played. This void was amplified by the fact that this was a medical malpractice case involving obstetrical medicine and treatment decisions. The Hospital\u2019s defense was contingent upon showing that Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s use of intra-muscular Pitocin injections, fundal pressure, and/or attempting home delivery after 41 gestational weeks solely caused Martinez\u2019s injuries. Surely it was far from self-evident to the lay jury whether this treatment caused injury.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Accordingly, because the Hospital was precluded from presenting any evidence that Midwife Muhlhan breached the standard of care and was therefore negligent, it follows that the jury was left to wonder whether anyone other than the Hospital\u2014the sole <em>defendant\u2014could </em>have caused Martinez\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">For these reasons, we hold that evidence of the midwife standard of care, and Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s breach of that standard of care, if any, during her treatment of Ms. Fielding, were relevant to the Hospital\u2019s defense. The trial judge, therefore, erred in precluding this evidence. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-402; <em>Schneider, supra, </em>206 Md.App. at 447, 49 A.3d 333 (citing <em>Simms, supra, </em>420 Md. at 724, 25 A.3d 144) (\u201cTrial judges do not, however, have discretion to admit irrelevant evidence.\u201d). By precluding such evidence, the jury was given a materially incomplete picture of the facts, which denied the Hospital a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">a. Impact of Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s Status as a Non-Party</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Martinez asserts several arguments against our reliance on other jurisdictions in reaching our holding. First, Martinez contends that the cases addressing evidence of a nonparty\u2019s negligence are distinguishable because the Hospital is merely seeking to \u201cavoid responsibility for its strategic decision not to add [Midwife] Muhlhan as a third-party defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>dant.\u201d The Hospital, in turn, alleges that Martinez chose not to name Midwife Muhlhan as a defendant because she was uninsured, and, therefore \u201cjudgment-proof.\u201d We hold that the reasons for not joining an individual as a defendant have no bearing on the legal issue of the admissibility of evidence of a non-party\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">The Connecticut Supreme Court has held that the reasons for not joining a party as a defendant have \u201cno bearing on the legal issue before this court, namely, whether a defendant may introduce evidence of a nonparty employer\u2019s negligence as the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries under a general denial.\u201d <em>Archambault, </em>287 Conn, at 41, 946 A.2d 839. In that case, a plaintiff argued that evidence of a non-party\u2019s negligence should have been excluded because the defendant \u201ccould have attempted to keep [the non-party] in the case.... [and] could have filed an apportionment complaint against [the non-party] following [the non-party\u2019s] dismissal from the case rather than attempting to proceed under a general denial to adduce evidence of [the non-party\u2019s] alleged negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40, 946 A.2d 839. Moreover, the plaintiff pointed out that the defendant \u201cinstituted a postverdict indemnification claim against [the non-party] pursuant to which the trial court awarded [defendant] a prejudgment remedy in the amount of $8,590,000....\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Connecticut Supreme Court, however, rejected these claims, observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">We are unpersuaded. The fact that [defendant] could have taken other actions to compel [the non-party\u2019s] continued involvement in the case, which may or may not have been appropriate or effective, has no bearing on the legal issue before this court, namely, whether a defendant may introduce evidence of a nonparty employer\u2019s negligence as the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries under a general denial. The fact that [defendant] instituted an indemnification claim against [the nonparty] similarly has no bearing on the issue before this court. We therefore conclude that the plaintiffs arguments have no merit and that [defendant] is entitled to a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 40-41, 946 A.2d 839. <em>See also supra, </em>discussing cases from other jurisdictions that have addressed the \u201cempty chair\u201d defense without regard as to why an individual was not a party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">We are persuaded by the rationale of our sister jurisdictions, and hold that the parties\u2019 reasons for not joining Midwife Muhlhan as a defendant have no bearing on the evidentiary issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">b. Impact of Contributory Negligence Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Martinez also argues that the cases we rely on from other jurisdictions are inapposite because those jurisdictions have adopted comparative negligence, whereas Maryland follows a system of contributory negligence. Accordingly, Martinez argues that evidence relating to Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s negligence, or lack thereof, did not make it any more or less likely that the Hospital was negligent, nor did it make it any more or less likely that the Hospital caused Martinez\u2019s injuries. The Hospital contends that such a distinction is of no consequence because, although the cases cited originated in comparative negligence jurisdictions, the cases \u201caddress[ed] sole proximate causation defense[s] in contexts where apportionment is completely irrelevant.\u201d We are not persuaded by Martinez\u2019s argument. Critically, the cases we rely on from comparative negligence jurisdictions involved actions in which the principles of comparative negligence expressly did not apply. Moreover, the cases all address actions where, as here, a defendant asserted a complete denial of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Under a system of comparative negligence, \u201c[consideration of the negligence of both parties and non-parties to an action is essential for determining liability commensurate with degree of total fault.\u201d <em>Bofman v. Material Serv. Corp., </em>125 Ill.App.3d 1053, 1064, 81 Ill.Dec. 262, 466 N.E.2d 1064 (1984). In states that have adopted comparative negligence, apportioning of liability is permitted as to each tortfeasor\u2019s \u201cproportionate share of the injury suffered.\u201d <em>Archambault, </em>946 A.2d at 854-55 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>By contrast, Maryland allows a plaintiff to secure \u201ccomplete relief\u2019 from a single defendant tortfeasor, who remains jointly and severally liable with all other defendant tortfeasors for the whole of any negligently caused injuries. <em>See, e.g., Service Transport Inc. v. Hurricane Exp., Inc., </em>185 Md.App. 25, 39-40, 968 A.2d 620, <em>cert. denied, </em>409 Md. 49, 972 A.2d 862 (2009).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The question for the jury is simply whether the defendant was \u201ca\u201d cause of injury. <em>See </em>Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions, MPJI-Cv 19.10 (2003) (\u201cFor the plaintiff to recover damages, the defendant\u2019s negligence must be a cause of the plaintiffs injury.\u201d). \u201cThe fact that another individual also tortiously contributes to the plaintiffs injury does not alter the independent, concurring tortfeasor\u2019s responsibility for the entirety of the injury which he or she actually and proximately caused.\u201d <em>Consumer Protection Division v. Morgan, </em>387 Md. 125, 182, 874 A.2d 919 (2005) (quoting <em>Woods v. Cole, </em>181 Ill.2d 512, 519, 230 Ill.Dec. 204, 693 N.E.2d 333 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">First, we observe that although the cases cited originated in comparative negligence jurisdictions, comparative negligence principles did not apply in many of the cases. For example, under New Jersey\u2019s comparative negligence system, assessment of liability is limited to those who are parties to a suit. <em>Straley, </em>887 F.Supp. at 742. Accordingly, in New Jersey, a non-party\u2019s \u201cnegligence cannot be considered by the jury on the issue of comparative negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For this reason, in <em>Straley, </em>because an alleged joint tortfeasor was not a party to the suit, the non-party\u2019s \u201cnegligence [could] not be considered by the jury on the issue of comparative negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the <em>Straley </em>court acknowledged that, \u201c \u2018there is a considerable difference between having the jury assess and determine [defendants\u2019] percentage of negligence [as com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>pared to a non-party] and the defendants arguing [the non-party\u2019s] negligence as the [sole] cause of the accident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the court held that the evidence of the non-party\u2019s negligence was admissible because it was relevant to the defendant\u2019s complete denial of liability. <em>Id. </em>at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In the other cases we cited <em>supra, </em>apportionment of fault was not implicated because the defendants chose to assert a defense of complete denial of liability rather than filing a statutory claim for apportionment. In those cases, because the defense was that a non-party\u2019s \u201cnegligence was the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries so as to escape liability altogether----the legal principles of apportionment set forth in the foregoing statutes and case law do not apply ... because [defendant\u2019s] claim does not require consideration of apportionment.\u201d <em>Archambault, </em>287 Conn. at 39-40, 946 A.2d 839. <em>See also Owens, </em>84 S.W.3d at 548-49 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">In particular, the <em>Owens </em>court addressed a defendant\u2019s decision not to seek apportionment of liability under Missouri\u2019s comparative negligence statute. The court rejected the argument that \u201c \u2018any other person\u2019s negligence absolutely ceased to be an issue\u2019 when Dr. Dougherty did not seek apportionment of fault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548. Rather, the court explained that \u201cthere is a distinction between sole cause and apportionment of fault---- [t]he issue ... is not apportionment, but the alleged negligence of [the defendant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted). Accordingly, the court held that even though comparative negligence did not apply, the defendant nevertheless had a \u201cright to contend that the negligence of someone else, even a non-party, was the sole cause of the incident in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548-49. For this reason, the court concluded that, \u201c[w]hile there was evidence to support a submission of Dr. Dougherty\u2019s negligence, Dr. Dougherty had the right to have the jury consider the evidence and his contention that the negligence of others was the sole cause of Decedent\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549. The court granted a new trial in light of the \u201cunavoidable fact [ ] that the jury was specifically instructed not to consider an issue that Dr. Dougherty had a right to have considered.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Archambault, </em>a Connecticut defendant chose not to \u201cfile[] an apportionment complaint against [a non-party] ... [and instead] attempted] to proceed under a general denial to adduce evidence of [the non-party\u2019s] alleged negligence.\u201d <em>Archambault, </em>287 Conn. at 40, 946 A.2d 839. The Connecticut Supreme Court held that, \u201cthe issue in the present case is whether the defendant may introduce evidence that a nonparty employer\u2019s negligence was the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries so as to escape liability altogether. Accordingly, the legal principles of apportionment ... do not apply....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39-40, 946 A.2d 839. The court recognized, however, that, \u201cif there was any question that the [non-party]\u2019s negligence was <em>not </em>the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries\u201d the defendant would be \u201cheld liable for all, rather than some proportionate share, of the plaintiffs damages\u201d where no apportionment claim is filed. <em>Id. </em>at 40, 946 A.2d 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><em>Archambault </em>is particularly illustrative of our basis for concluding that the cases cited from other jurisdictions are persuasive, despite the fact that they originated in comparative negligence jurisdictions. When apportionment of liability is not implicated, a defendant\u2019s liability in a comparative negligence state mirrors a defendant\u2019s liability under Maryland\u2019s contributory negligence system. For example, in <em>Archambault, </em>because the defendant did not seek apportionment, the defendant would be held 100 percent liable for the plaintiffs injuries if the defendant was found to be \u201ca\u201d cause of injury. For this reason, evidence of a non-party\u2019s negligence was deemed relevant to the defense that the defendant was not \u201ca\u201d cause of injury, because a non-party was the sole cause of the plaintiffs injury. Likewise, in the instant case, the Hospital\u2019s defense was that it was not \u201ca\u201d cause of injury because Midwife Muhlhan was solely responsible for Martinez\u2019s injuries. If the Hospital\u2019s defense was successful, it would not be liable to Martinez.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> On the other hand, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Hospital was found to be even \u201ca\u201d cause of injury, the Hospital would be liable for 100 percent of Martinez\u2019s injuries, regardless of any injury caused by Midwife Muhlhan.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Martinez also argues that our focus on the complete denial of liability is misplaced. In particular, Martinez cites <em>McDonnell </em>for the proposition that the \u201cissue of whether a defendant is entitled to argue to the jury that the nonparty physician was negligent is separate and distinct from the issue of whether a defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on the defense of sole proximate cause.\u201d <em>McDonnell, </em>249 Ill.Dec. 636, 736 N.E.2d at 1085-86. \u201c[Ejvidence of the nonparty\u2019s negligence is not required to justify the sole proximate cause instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Martinez concludes that this undercuts our reliance on case law from other jurisdictions in holding that evidence of a non-party\u2019s negligence is relevant to a defendant\u2019s complete denial of liability in a negligence action. We disagree. The court in <em>McDonnell </em>explained that a defendant may assert a complete denial of liability as a defense, but is not <em>required </em>to present evidence of another party\u2019s negligence in order to invoke that defense. This has no bearing on whether evidence of a non-party\u2019s negligence is <em>relevant. </em>Moreover, the many cases cited <em>supra </em>have clearly held that evidence of a non-party\u2019s negligence <em>is </em>relevant when a defendant asserts a complete denial of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Accordingly, because comparative negligence and apportionment of fault were not implicated in the cases cited from other jurisdictions, and because the cases involved actions in which defendants asserted a complete denial of liability, we see no reason to distinguish the rationale of our sister jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">iii. Probative Value-Unfair Prejudice of Midwife Standard of Care</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Next, Martinez argues that even if the evidence at issue is deemed relevant, the probative value is \u201cvastly outweighed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>potential for unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, and waste of time____\u201d We disagree. Indeed, the probative value of the evidence of the midwife standard of care, and Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s breach of that standard of care, if any, during her treatment of Ms. Fielding, outweighs any potential for unfair prejudice, confusion, or waste of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">We review a trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-403 under the abuse of discretion standard. \u201cWhen weighing the probative value of proffered evidence against its potentially prejudicial nature, an abuse of discretion in the ruling may be found where no reasonable person would share the view taken by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Consol. Waste Indus. v. Std. Equip. Co., 421 </em>Md. 210, 219, 26 A.3d 352 (2010) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Maryland Rule 5-403 provides that relevant evidence \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-403. Maryland Rule 5-401 defines \u201crelevant evidence\u201d as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Here, the trial court precluded the evidence at issue on the basis that it was \u201cprejudicial and is not relevant to the case.\u201d The trial judge\u2019s concern for prejudice was due to the \u201cpotential prejudice from the jury feeling there is a third-party here, who is not a party to the action.\u201d We reiterate that the issue of admissibility of a non-party\u2019s negligence is an issue of first impression in Maryland. The trial judge seemingly found the evidence prejudicial for the very same reason we deem it relevant. As discussed <em>supra, </em>when a defendant asserts a complete denial of liability, the jury <em>should </em>be made aware of an alleged non-party tortfeasor, in order to provide a complete story to the jury. Accordingly, we necessarily conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in precluding the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>due to the perceived prejudice resulting from the jury\u2019s awareness of a non-party.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Martinez also alleges other grounds for prejudice and confusion. In particular, Martinez cites cases which have held that a different standard of care applies to obstetricians and midwives, and that other jurisdictions have precluded obstetricians from offering standard of care testimony regarding midwifery practices. <em>See, e.g., Postell v. Hankla, </em>317 Ga.App. 86, 728 S.E.2d 886, 889 (2012); <em>McElhaney ex rel. McElhaney v. Harper-Hutzel Hosp., </em>269 Mich.App. 488, 711 N.W.2d 795, 800 (2006); c.f. <em>Cox v. M.A. Primary and Urgent Care Clinic, </em>313 S.W.3d 240, 256 (Tenn.2010) (discussing rationale for applying different standard of care to physician assistants than applied to physicians). Accordingly, Martinez maintains that the \u201cadmission of separate, distinct standard[s] of care could easily confuse jurors, especially when the verdict sheet and instructions would make no reference to the midwife\u2019s breach of the standard of care because she was not a party and her negligence, if any, was neither a necessary nor sufficient predicate to the Hospital\u2019s defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The Hospital counters that the differing standards of care for physicians and midwives actually supports the admission of the excluded testimony. In the Hospital\u2019s view, the differing standards of care underscores the Hospital\u2019s need to show the jury Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s \u201cgross violations of the standard of care because the outrageousness of her treatment methods was far from clear to a lay jury. This was especially true here because [Martinez\u2019s] witnesses and attorneys repeatedly told the jury that there was no dispute that <em>hospitals </em>do not use fundal pressure and IM Pitocin to create the false impression that some competent midwives do use these methods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">We are not persuaded by Martinez\u2019s arguments. Although Martinez cites authority to suggest that different standards of care would apply to midwives and obstetricians, Martinez presents no authority to support its contention that it would be <em>prejudicial or confusing </em>to present evidence of differing standards of care to a jury. We fail to see how explaining to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>jury that two different standards of care apply to two different medical professionals would be unduly confusing. \u201cJurors generally are presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions.... \u201d <em>Dillard v. State, </em>415 Md. 445, 465, 3 A.3d 403 (2010) (citations omitted). Similarly, the prejudice Martinez would face is not the type of prejudice contemplated by Maryland Rule 5-403. \u201cThe fact that evidence prejudices one party or the other, in the sense that it hurts his or her case, is not the undesirable prejudice referred to in Rule 5-403.\u201d <em>Odum v. State, </em>412 Md. 593, 615, 989 A.2d 232 (2010). Rather, \u201c[probative value is outweighed by the danger of \u2018unfair\u2019 prejudice when the evidence produces such an emotional response that logic cannot overcome prejudice or sympathy needlessly injected into the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation and quotation omitted). Accordingly, we hold that the probative value of the evidence of the midwife standard of care, and Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s breach of that standard of care, if any, during her treatment of Martinez, outweighs any potential for unfair prejudice, confusion, or waste of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">iv. Harmless Error</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Finally, Martinez argues that any error attributable to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence was harmless. In support, Martinez cites the testimony provided by various Hospital witnesses regarding causation. Martinez concludes that evidence of the midwife standard of care would have provided a <em>\u201cde minimus </em>boost to [the Hospital\u2019s] theory of defense ... [which] suggests that the Hospital was not prejudiced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The Hospital contends that it was unfairly prejudiced because it could not \u201cpresent expert witness testimony that Midwife Muhlhan breached the applicable standard of care for patient safety when she: (1) allowed Ms. Fielding to attempt home delivery past 41 weeks and labor through prolonged first and second stages; (2) administered intramuscular Pitocin in an uncontrolled setting as many as three times; and (3) applied fundal pressure to try to force the baby\u2019s head through the birth canal.\u201d Accordingly, the Hospital con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>eludes, the jury had a materially incomplete picture of the case. Moreover, the Hospital asserts that Martinez exploited the trial court\u2019s ruling \u201cto give the jury the false impression that Midwife Muhlhan did her job competently, but that the Hospital simply does not understand that midwives practice differently than obstetricians in hospitals. The Hospital was entitled to respond.\u201d We agree with the Hospital that the preclusion of evidence was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Our sister jurisdictions have consistently held that when a defendant was precluded from presenting evidence of a non-party\u2019s negligence, the defendant was entitled to a new trial. <em>See, e.g., Petre, supra, </em>356 Ill.App.3d at 66-67, 291 Ill.Dec. 867, 824 N.E.2d 1117 (remanding for new trial and holding that \u201cdefendants will [] be allowed to assert an empty chair defense and admit evidence of the [non-party] physicians\u2019 alleged postoperative negligence on the issue of proximate cause\u201d); <em>Archambault, </em>287 Conn, at 41, 946 A.2d 839 (holding that because the trial court erred in precluding the defendant from presenting evidence of a non-party\u2019s negligence, the defendant \u201cis entitled to a new trial\u201d); <em>Owens, </em>84 S.W.3d at 548-49 (holding that \u201c[w]hile there was evidence to support a submission of [defendant\u2019s] negligence, [the defendant] had the right to have the jury consider the evidence and his contention that the negligence of others was the sole cause of Decedent\u2019s death\u201d and granting a new trial in light of the \u201cunavoidable fact [ ] that the jury was specifically instructed not to consider an issue that [the defendant] had a right to have considered.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">We reiterate the well-reasoned holding of <em>Archambault </em>that a defendant is entitled to \u201ctry to convince the jury that not only did it <em>not </em>cause [the] plaintiffs injuries, but someone else <em>did. </em>A void of evidence concerning the [non-party\u2019s] conduct would leave a logical hiatus in the story presented to the jury. With no one allowed to show what part the [nonparty\u2019s] conduct played, the jury would be left to wonder whether anyone other than the defendant <em>could </em>have caused [the] plaintiffs injuries.\u201d <em>Archambault, supra, </em>287 Conn, at 32-33, 946 A.2d 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Here, there was a logical hiatus in the story presented to the jury.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Moreover, Martinez\u2019s arguments and testimony at trial buttressed the prejudice to the Hospital. Indeed, in opening statements, Martinez\u2019s counsel described Midwife Muhlhan as a \u201cCertified Nurse-Midwife\u201d who \u201chad been practicing for over 40 years.\u201d Martinez\u2019s counsel explained that Midwife Muhlhan had previously delivered Ms. Fielding\u2019s sister\u2019s baby, which was \u201ca wonderful experience.\u201d Further, Martinez\u2019s counsel informed the jury that Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s actions were \u201ccompletely appropriate\u201d when she broke Ms. Fielding\u2019s water. Martinez\u2019s counsel further argued that Midwife Muhlhan gave Pitocin because she \u201cwanted to get this baby delivered as safely and quickly as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">At trial, Martinez\u2019s experts provided opinions about the practice of midwives. For example, Dr. Balducci testified he did not understand why the Hospital personnel were shocked when they learned that Midwife Muhlhan had administered Pitocin, observing that \u201cI think I\u2019ve seen midwives use this before in delivery centers.... \u201d Dr. Balducci also opined on the differences between hospital practice and midwifery practice, observing, \u201c[w]ell, that\u2019s the way midwives will practice.\u201d Dr. Stokes similarly clarified that his testimony pertained only to obstetrics, stating: \u201cThat\u2019s the way obstetricians do it. It\u2019s not the way midwives do it.\u201d Although the trial court sustained objections to the testimony about midwives,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the Hospital argues that the curative instruction was not sufficient. The trial judge informed the jury that, \u201cyou\u2019re to disregard the comment about what midwives do or don\u2019t do. That\u2019s not an issue in this case.\u201d In the Hospital\u2019s view, the trial court\u2019s instruction \u201ceffectively told the jury that the Hospital\u2019s central theory of the case\u2014that the damage was done by the midwife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>before </em>Ms. Fielding and her baby arrived at the Hospital\u2014was \u2018not an issue in this case.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">During closing arguments, Martinez\u2019s counsel derided the Hospital\u2019s \u201cshock\u201d at Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s conduct, suggesting that her actions, including fundal pressure and administration of Pitocin, were perfectly appropriate. In particular, Martinez explained that: \u201cYou know what Pitocin\u2019s for. It\u2019s to increase contractions. Why? Because consistent with what mom said, she wasn\u2019t really having strong contractions at home. That\u2019s why they gave it to her.\u201d Martinez concluded that both the administration of Pitocin and the fundal pressure \u201cdidn\u2019t cause her any pain, anything like that. It was not a big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The Hospital also points out that by limiting the Hospital to merely reciting the facts of Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s conduct and its immediate reactions when learning of it, the jury could have formed a false impression that Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s treatment was benign. Moreover, the Hospital asserts that negligent care is more dangerous and likely to cause injury than non-negligent care. Thus, Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s negligence would have significantly added credibility to the Hospital\u2019s defense that Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s negligence injured Martinez before he ever reached the Hospital. The Hospital concludes by observing that a jury is not likely to be particularly moved by testimony that the defendant blames someone else, unless there is proof that the other person actually did something that should not have been done. In our view, these implications further support our holding that the trial court erred in precluding the hospital from introducing evidence related to the standard of care with Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s treatment of Ms. Fielding.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">In sum, the effect of the trial court\u2019s ruling was that Martinez was permitted to argue to the jury that Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s treatment of Martinez was appropriate. The Hospital, however, was precluded from arguing that Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s actions were negligent. Consequently, the only evidence of negligence before the jury was the alleged negligence of the Hospital. It follows, therefore, that the jury was left to wonder whether anyone other than the Hospital <em>could </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>have caused Martinez\u2019s injuries. In our view, the jury was provided a materially incomplete picture, and the Hospital was unnecessarily constrained in presenting its defense that Midwife Muhlhan was the sole cause of Martinez\u2019s injuries. Accordingly, we hold that the error here had a \u201csubstantial likelihood of causing an unjust verdict.\u201d <em>See Isley v. State, </em>129 Md.App. 611, 619, 743 A.2d 772 (2000). The Hospital, therefore, is entitled to a new trial.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">B. Informed Consent</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Next, the Hospital argues that Martinez was improperly permitted to introduce evidence that the Hospital did not offer general anesthesia to Ms. Fielding. In the Hospital\u2019s view, any testimony suggesting that physicians should have \u201coffered\u201d general anesthesia\u2014as opposed to another type of anesthesia\u2014constitutes an informed consent claim. By contrast, Martinez argues that \u201cthe failure to offer treatment required by the standard of care states a claim in ordinary malpractice, not informed consent.\u201d Additionally, Martinez contends that the testimony at issue was \u201crelevant to rebutting [the Hospital\u2019s] express and implied claims that Ms. Fielding was to blame for any delay in delivering Martinez and that she had rejected general anesthesia.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Regardless, Martinez contends that the Hospital\u2019s argument is not preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">We address the merits of the informed consent issue in order to provide guidance for future proceedings on remand.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the challenged evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">\u201cSimply stated, the doctrine of informed consent imposes on a physician, before he subjects his patient to medical treatment, the duty to explain the procedure to the patient and to warn him of any material risks or dangers inherent in or collateral to the therapy, so as to enable the patient to make an intelligent and informed choice about whether or not to undergo such treatment.\u201d <em>Sard v. Hardy, </em>281 Md. 432, 440, 379 A.2d 1014 (1977) (internal citations omitted). \u201cThis duty to disclose is said to require a physician to reveal to his patient the nature of the ailment, the nature of the proposed treatment, the probability of success of the contemplated therapy and its alternatives, and the risk of unfortunate consequences associated with such treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440, 379 A.2d 1014 (internal citations omitted). However, the doctrine of informed consent does not apply in emergencies. <em>Id. </em>at 445, 379 A.2d 1014 (\u201cthe physician\u2019s duty to disclose is suspended where an emergency of such gravity and urgency exists that it is impractical to obtain the patient\u2019s consent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The \u201claw is settled that \u2018[a] party cannot allege one cause of action and introduce evidence to prove another and different one.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zeller v.

This is because \u201cclaims of informed consent and medical malpractice are \u2018separate, disparate theories of <em>liability....\u2019\u201d Id. </em>at 484-85, 49 A.3d 359 (citing <em>McQuitty v.

Campagnolo, </em>332 Md. 226, 240-41, 630 A.2d 1145 (1993)). In <em>Reed, </em>the plaintiff pursued an informed consent action arising from a physician\u2019s failure to offer prenatal testing that would have revealed complications pertaining to the plaintiffs unborn child. <em>Id. </em>at 229-30, 630 A.2d 1145. On appeal, the Court considered whether the plaintiff alleged an informed consent claim, or whether the cause of action sounded only in ordinary negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 240-41, 630 A.2d 1145. Ultimately, the <em>Reed </em>Court concluded that the question of \u201cwhether the defendants had a duty to offer or recommend the tests is analyzed in relation to the professional standard of care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241, 630 A.2d 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Here, Martinez\u2019s complaint alleged that the Hospital breached its standard of care by failing to timely perform an \u201curgent\u201d Caesarean section or by failing to later convert to an \u201cemergency\u201d Caesarean section when the fetal heart rate allegedly changed. <em>See </em>Factual and Procedural Background, <em>supra. </em>Spinal/epidural anesthesia is appropriate for an urgent Caesarean section, whereas general anesthesia is used for an emergency Caesarean section. <em>See </em>footnote 10, <em>supra. </em>An emergency Caesarean section is only performed when the life of the mother or baby (or both) is in imminent danger. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number><em>See </em>footnote 10, <em>supra. Sard v. Hardy </em>makes clear that informed consent does not apply in emergencies. <em>See Sard, supra, </em>281 Md. at 445, 379 A.2d 1014. Thus, if the circumstances here called for an emergency Caesarean section, as Martinez was asserting, there was no obligation to obtain Ms. Fielding\u2019s informed consent. Rather, if an emergency Caesarean section was required, the Hospital was obligated to administer general anesthesia immediately and deliver the baby. Accordingly, evidence of whether Ms. Fielding was <em>offered </em>general anesthesia is not relevant to whether the Hospital breached its standard of care by allegedly failing to convert to an emergency Caesarean section.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Our review of the record shows that the testimony at trial regarding general anesthesia focused on whether Ms. Fielding was <em>offered </em>general anesthesia. Martinez concluded in closing argument that the question for the jury was whether a reasonable mother would have agreed to undergo general anesthesia in order to save her child. In particular, Dr. Stokes testified on direct examination that the <em>\u201coption </em>[of general anesthesia] was never <em>offered </em>to the patient.\u201d (Emphasis added). Additionally, Dr. Stokes testified that the Hospital \u201cdid not <em>offer </em>the option of being put to sleep, which would have gotten her baby out a whole lot sooner.\u201d (Emphasis added). Martinez\u2019s counsel asked Ms. Fielding whether she was \u201cever given a <em>choice </em>between general anesthesia versus a combined spinal-epidural.\u201d Ms. Fielding testified: \u201cNo. I was never given that <em>option.\u201d </em>During cross-examination of Dr. Michael Katz, Martinez\u2019s counsel asked: \u201c[W]as Ms. Fielding, the patient, ever given the <em>choice </em>of which anesthesia?\u201d (Emphasis added). Finally, in closing argument, Martinez concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">They want to say, oh my God, the risks. It\u2019s a one percent risk. There is a risk for anything.... Ask any mother in that situation.... What would any mother, any reasonable mother in that circumstance do? We\u2019ve got nine women on this jury. You all know what you would do. You would say give me the general anesthesia.... She wasn\u2019t even given the option....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>In sum, the evidence presented by Martinez focused on whether Ms. Fielding\u2014the patient\u2014was given a <em>choice </em>of anesthesia and whether a <em>reasonable patient </em>would have accepted the <em>risks </em>of such treatment in order to save her child. Since the Hospital had no obligation to obtain informed consent to administer general anesthesia for an emergency Caesarean section, evidence of whether Ms. Fielding was <em>offered </em>general anesthesia had no relevance to Martinez\u2019s negligence claim.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Moreover, the evidence was prejudicial because it was improperly used to conflate the negligence issue with an unpled informed consent claim.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We reiterate that \u201cwhether the plaintiff patient had given informed consent to [a] procedure generally is irrelevant and earrie[s] a great potential for the confusion of the jury in an action wherein only medical malpractice is pleaded.... \u201d <em>Schwartz, </em>206 Md.App. at 485, 49 A.3d 359 (internal quotations omitted). <em>See also Cobbs v.

Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 601 A.2d 102 (1992) \u201cexpressly rejected [the] constitutional argument!]\u201d that the Cap \"infringes upon [the] right to a jury trial ... and we reaffirm that decision today\u201d); <em>Murphy, </em>325 Md. at 366, 601 A.2d 102 (holding that \u201cthe limitation upon recoverable noneconomic tort damages under [the Cap] ... does not amount to a restriction upon access to the courts\u201d). Based upon the Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions upholding the Cap, we have previously rejected the same separation of powers argument advanced by Martinez. <em>See, e.g., Edmonds v. Murphy, </em>83 Md.App. 133, 150, 573 A.2d 853 (1990), <em>aff'd sub nom., </em>325 Md. 342, 601 A.2d 102 (1992) (\"[W]e hold that [the Cap] does not violate the separation of powers doctrine embodied in Article 8.\u201d); <em>Univ. of Md.

Malory, </em>143 Md.App. 327, 355, 795 A.2d 107 (2001) (\u201c[W]e were presented with [the constitutionality of the Cap under a separation of powers analysis] in <em>Murphy </em>and ... our holding in that case is controlling.\u201d); <em>Owens-Coming v.

For clarity, we observe that the evidence relevant to the Hospital\u2019s defense is evidence of any material breach of the midwife standard of care that caused or contributed to Martinez's injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\">. The parties also argue at length whether the \"door was opened\u201d at trial for the Hospital to present standard of care evidence regarding the midwife. Because we hold that the standard of care evidence was independently relevant, we need not address this alternative theory of admissibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b706-9\">. In light of our holding that the evidence is admissible because it is relevant to the Hospital's complete denial of liability, we need not address whether the precluded evidence was relevant to the Hospital\u2019s explanation for the timing of the Caesarean section. We also observe that this argument was not briefed in detail by the parties. Although this alternative relevancy argument is raised in the Hospital\u2019s brief, both parties focus primarily on the relevancy of the evidence to the Hospital\u2019s complete denial of liability-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b706-10\">. <em>See </em>Factual and Procedural Background, <em>supra, </em>regarding a detailed synopsis of the testimony at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\">. <em>See also infra, </em>Part C(iv), discussing the further amplification of this void in light of Martinez\u2019s arguments at trial that Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s treatment was appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b713-5\">. Martinez also argues that he suffered a single indivisible injury, and therefore the Hospital remained jointly and severally liable for its negligence even if Midwife Muhlhan was also negligent and contributed to Martinez\u2019s injuries. <em>See Morgan, </em>387 Md. at 179-80, 874 A.2d 919 (discussing the \"single injury rule\" and joint and several liability amongst tortfeasors).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b715-5\">. Indeed, Martinez recognizes that the Hospital would not be liable if \u201c[Midwife] Muhlhan was found to be the sole cause of [Martinez]'s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>injuries.\u201d In that case, Martinez concludes, \"the jury [would have been] obligated to find for the Hospital____\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\">. <em>See supra, </em>Part C(i), discussing the void created by the preclusion of evidence of the midwife standard of care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b721-7\">. <em>See supra, </em>Factual and Procedural Background, Part C(i) (citing the testimony at trial about midwives and the objections that were sustained).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\">. Because we are reversing and remanding for a new trial based on the error in granting the motion <em>in limine, </em>we need not address the issue associated with the trial judge\u2019s denial of the motion for new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b723-9\">. The trial court explained that it allowed the informed consent evidence to prove that Ms. Fielding\u2019s lack of consent was not the reason the Caesarean section procedure was delayed. The record, however, is devoid of any testimony suggesting that Ms. Fielding had refused general anesthesia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b723-10\">. <em>See supra, </em>Part II (A), remanding for further proceedings due to the trial court\u2019s preclusion of evidence regarding the midwife standard of care, and Midwife Muhlhan\u2019s breach of that standard of care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b727-5\">. We observe that evidence regarding whether or not the Hospital performed an emergency Caesarean section would be relevant to Martinez\u2019s claim that the Hospital breached its standard of care by failing to convert to an emergency Caesarean section. Critically, however, Martinez\u2019s line of questioning, and the testimony elicited from witnesses, went far beyond this scope.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b727-6\">. In a negligence action, the question is whether the <em>defendant </em>breached his or her duty of care. <em>See McQuitty, supra, </em>410 Md. at 25-26, 976 A.2d 1020. By contrast, in an informed consent action, the jury considers the choice of treatment, and any associated risks, from the perspective of the <em>reasonable patient.
