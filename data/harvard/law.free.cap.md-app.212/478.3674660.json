On September 22, 2009, the Montgomery County Council approved the \u201cGerman-town Employment Area Sector Plan\u201d (\u201cthe Sector Plan\u201d), which the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (\u201cthe Planning Commission\u201d) adopted on October 15, 2009.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Sector Plan is \u201ca comprehensive amendment to the approved and adopted 1989 Germantown Master Plan\u201d that \u201cestablishes a vision that will transform Germantown\u2019s central employment corridor into a vibrant town center and mixed-use uptown districts.\u201d Under the \u201careawide recommendations\u201d of the Sector Plan, which apply to the \u201croughly 2,400-acre area in the employment and Town Center areas of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Germantown,\u201d are several \u201cprinciples\u201d which \u201c[t]he design guidelines to implement this Sector Plan and all development must address.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The Sector Plan\u2019s recommendations for the \u201cSeneca Meadows/Milestone District\u201d\u2014a 390-acre area bordered by Ridge Road/MD 27 to the north, Germantown Road/MD 118 to the south, 1-270 to the west, and North Frederick Road/MD 355 to the east and includes the area at issue in this case\u2014state: (1) \u201cConcentrate a limited amount of street level retail near the transit station. Big box retailers,<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> if proposed, <em>should </em>have active storefronts with multiple entrances and small retail uses facing Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive\u201d;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) \u201cStreet level retail <em>must </em>conform to the plan\u2019s urban design guidance.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>On May 18, 2010, the Montgomery County Council approved Sectional Map Amendment G-887, which implemented the zoning recommendations contained in the Sector Plan. More specifically, the Sectional Map Amendment rezoned land located in the Seneca Meadows/Milestone District from an 1-3 zone (Technology and Business Park zone) to a TMX-2 zone (Transit Mixed Use zone).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Montgomery County Zoning Ordinance (\u00a7 59-C-14.213 of the Montgomery County Code) states that \u201c[development under the TMX zone must be consistent with the recommendations of the applicable master or sector plan.\u201d (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">On June 30, 2010, Seneca Meadows Corporate Center VII, LLP filed an application for approval of Site Plan No. 820100140. On July 16, 2010, Minkoff Development Corporation filed an application for approval of Preliminary Plan Amendment 11998004A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As described by the Planning Board, the Site Plan was for the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axs\">construction of a 150,000 SF grocery store,<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> 28,570 SF of general office, 4,300 SF of professional office, and 56,570 SF of retail/ restaurant uses ... on 21.0 acres in the TMX-2 zoned land, located in the northwest quadrant of the intersection of Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive ... within the [Sector Plan],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">and the purpose of the Preliminary Plan Amendment was to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6S\">create two lots (Lots 11 and 12) and two recorded parcels for future dedication (Parcels K and L) approximately 21 acres, 4.4 acres, 1 acre, and 1.9 acres, respectively, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>TMX-2 Zone; located in the southwest quadrant of the intersection of Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive ... within the [Sector Plan].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">According to Mr. Pringle, the two applications \u201care related and dependent on one another since [the] preliminary plan creates lots at the site while [the] site plan identifies the types of buildings on these lots.\u201d On October 24, 2010, the Montgomery County Planning Department (\u201cthe Planning Department\u201d) recommended approval by the Planning Board of both applications, subject to certain conditions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">On November 2, 2010, Mr. Pringle submitted written comments urging \u201cthe [Planning] Board to disapprove the Preliminary Plan Amendment and Site Plan for the Seneca Meadows property\u201d because they are not \u201cin conformance\u201d with the Sector Plan. More specifically, he asserted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">\u2022 \u201cThis big-box \u2018destination\u2019 shopping center proposed by the Site Plan directly contradicts the basic purpose and goals of the Sector Plan\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">\u2022 \u201cThe Site Plan undermines the Sector Plan\u2019s vision for a transit-oriented community centered around the future [transit] station at Seneca Meadows\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">\u2022 \u201cThe Site Plan\u2019s proposed parking design violates the Sector Plan\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">\u2022 \u201cThe concentration of retail proposed in this Site Plan does not conform to the Sector Plan\u2019s vision for German-town\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">\u2022 \u201cThe design for the big box store proposed by this Site Plan contradicts the Sector Plan requirements for street-frontage\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\u2022 \u201cThe Site Plan includes a stormwater management design that contradicts the Sector Plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">On November 4, 2010, following a hearing on the proposed Site Plan and Preliminary Plan Amendment, the Planning Board approved both applications, subject to certain conditions. The Planning Board issued, on December 22, 2010, Resolution 10-157 approving the Site Plan and Resolution 10-156 approving the Preliminary Plan Amendment. Resolution 10-157 states that the Site Plan is \u201cconsistent\u201d with the Sector Plan. As to the Sector Plan\u2019s language that \u201c[b]ig box retailers, if proposed, should have active storefronts with multiple entrances and small retail uses facing Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive,\u201d the resolution states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">The proposed retail is a few blocks east of the proposed transit station. The Planning Board finds that the location on the Subject Property is consistent with the Sector Plan\u2019s recommendation for retail \u201cnear the transit station.\u201d The Planning Board applied the Sector Plan\u2019s recommendation for \u201cBig Box retailers\u201d to the Wegman\u2019s grocery store. It is important to understand that the land use recommendations in master plans do not, and cannot specify all development possibilities, particularly a commitment to a particular design detail until the physical limitations of a site are understood. There are many site specific reasons why locating the retail uses on Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive was not feasible for this Property. First, development of this site under the new Environmental Site Design features of the new Stormwater Management Regulations requires the Applicant to essentially use every green area to take in water. This site drains naturally to the intersection of Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive. One of the low points for this site happens to be at the corner of Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive where the Sector Plan has called for retail frontage. Second, the grades at that intersection make it difficult to front buildings there, and in order to accommodate the topographical limitations of the site, these buildings have been fronted on an interior street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The orientation of buildings and layout of the internal street network were heavily considered in this Application. The Applicant did front retail buildings on Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive consistent with the Sector Plan\u2019s recommendations where the topography is flat enough. The Applicant sited two buildings as an entrance to the development on Observation Drive that act as a gateway into the site. Likewise a separate building has been fronted on Seneca Meadows Parkway at the opposite entrance point to the site. For the rest of the development, the Applicant ultimately established a primary internal main street with smaller blocks that are pedestrian oriented as envisioned by the Sector Plan. Views and pedestrian relationships along each frontage street have been designed to begin the transformation of this environment to the urban form recommended in the Sector Plan. Due to constraints of the Subject Property, the Planning Board finds that the retail\u2019s frontage on an internal network of streets relatively near the proposed transit station is consistent with the Sector Plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">As to the Sector Plan\u2019s recommendation that \u201c[sjtreet level retail must conform to the plan\u2019s urban design guidance,\u201d the resolution states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">The Sector Plan also calls for street level retail to conform to its design guidance. The urban design recommendations of the Sector Plan include the call for street-oriented development, public amenities including plazas and gathering places, and the creation of vibrant pedestrian spaces. The application consists of a street network of smaller internal streets that will fulfill the Sector Plan\u2019s recommendation for urban form better than fronting retail along Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive at this location. Grading, drainage, and existing conditions do not currently promote the location of retails fronts on Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive. Future development phases that will occur to the west of the Subject Property will be better able to utilize Seneca Meadows Parkway itself for street activation. However, locating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>retail on Observation Drive and Seneca Meadows Parkway at this point in the development in this area will not likely translate into viable retail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Resolution 10-156 states that \u201cthe Preliminary Plan substantially conforms to the Master Plan.\u201d As to the Sector Plan\u2019s recommendations regarding big-box retailers and \u201curban design guidance,\u201d Resolution 10-156 includes statements nearly identical to those in Resolution 10-157.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Mr. Pringle petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. After a hearing, and reasoning that the Planning Board \u201chad before it substantial evidence to conclude that the respective applications before it for preliminary plans and site plan approval were consistent with the recommendations contained in the [Sector Plan] and that the ... [Planning] Board made specific findings of fact,\u201d the court affirmed the Planning Board\u2019s approval of both resolutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Mr. Pringle, citing the language of the Montgomery County Zoning Ordinance that \u201c[development under the TMX zone <em>must be consistent </em>with the recommendations of the applicable master or sector plan,\u201d characterizes the Sector Plan recommendations as \u201cbinding\u201d on the Shops at Seneca Meadows development plan and, therefore, the Planning Board\u2019s \u201clegal conclusion that it has latitude in applying the requirements of the Sector Plan to the resolutions is not entitled to deference .... \u201d (Emphasis added). On that premise, he argues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">The record lacks substantial evidence to support the [Planning] Board\u2019s decision that the resolutions conformed to the Sector Plan\u2019s requirement that the Shops at Seneca Meadows have active store fronts with multiple entrances and smaller retail uses facing Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">According to Mr. Pringle, \u201cthe resolutions cite to evidence that acknowledges the development\u2019s shortcoming in meeting this requirement\u201d of the Sector Plan. More specifically, he points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>to the resolutions\u2019 recognition that some store fronts and smaller retail uses do not face Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive <em>{e.g., </em>\u201c[t]he application consists of a street network of smaller internal streets that will fulfill the Sector Plan\u2019s recommendation for urban form better than fronting retail along Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive at this location.\u201d). In sum, he contends that the Planning Board\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute! ] legal error and the Court should reverse the [Planning] Board\u2019s approval of the resolutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">As to the Sector Plan\u2019s recommendation regarding big-box retailers, the Planning Board responds that \u201cthe Sector Plan states that a development with a big box retailer should have these things, not must,\u201d which \u201cis far from the strict mandatory requirement that [Mr. Pringle] asserts the recommendation requires.\u201d But, even if the recommendation is mandatory, \u201cthere is substantial evidence in the record to support the Planning Board\u2019s finding of consistency with this recommendation.\u201d Minkoff responds that \u201c[t]here was substantial evidence of record to support the ... [Planning] Board\u2019s findings\u201d and that \u201cthere was obvious planning logic behind the [Planning] Board\u2019s rationale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In reviewing the decision of an administrative agency, our role \u201c \u2018is essentially to repeat the task of the circuit court; that is, to be certain that the circuit court did not err in its review.\u2019 Thus, we review the decision of the administrative agency, not the decision of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Cinque v. Montgomery County Planning Bd., </em>173 Md.App. 349, 359, 918 A.2d 1254 (2007) (citations omitted). We will review that decision to ascertain: (1) whether there is an \u201cerror of law,\u201d and (2) whether \u201csubstantial evidence supports [the] factual findings....\u201d <em>Long Green Valley Ass\u2019n v. Prigel Family Creamery, </em>206 Md.App. 264, 274, 47 A.3d 1087 (2012) (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">As to legal conclusions, appellate courts</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQk\">owe less deference ... to \u201cthe legal conclusions of the administrative body and may reverse those decisions where the legal conclusions reached by that body are based on an erroneous interpretation or application of zoning statutes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>regulations, and ordinances relevant and applicable to the property that is the subject of the dispute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASb\"><em>Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v.

As to factual findings,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxJ\">[i]n applying the test for substantial evidence, the reviewing court \u201cdecides whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d The reviewing court defers to the agency\u2019s factual findings, if supported by the record. The reviewing court, moreover, \u201cmust review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and to draw inferences from that evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><em>Employees\u2019 Ret.

This of course is a judgmental process involving a mixed question of law and fact, and great deference must be accorded to the agency.

Anne Arundel Cnty., </em>73 Md.App. 301, 308-09, 533 A.2d 1325 (1987) (alterations in <em>Gray) </em>(citation omitted). Here, we must determine, as a matter of law, how closely the development must hew to the Sector Plan recommendation stating that \u201c[b]ig box retailers, if proposed, <em>should </em>have active storefronts with multiple entrances and small retail uses facing Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive,\u201d and then determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the agency\u2019s decision that the development is consistent with the Sector Plan. (Emphasis added). This is, as we see it, a mixed question of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">We have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>A plan may serve as a mere guide or it may have greater effect. In most cases, planning documents have been referred to as general guides and recommendations advisory and not regulatory, in nature.... On the other hand, the Court of Appeals has found statutory language giving plans greater effect, in the context of regulating subdivision development. The Court of Appeals has held that a plan had binding effect and could serve as a basis for a planning board to refuse to approve a proposed subdivision when it was not compatible with the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><em>Archers Glen Partners, Inc. v. Garner, </em>176 Md.App. 292, 312-13, 933 A.2d 405 (2007) (internal citation omitted). Where, as here, \u201cthe local government has enacted a statute, ordinance, or regulation that links planning and zoning, \u2018the status of comprehensive plans [is elevated] to the level of true regulatory device.\u2019 \u201d <em>Greater Baden-Aquasco Citizens Ass\u2019n, </em>412 Md. at 101, 985 A.2d 1160 (quoting <em>Mayor and Council of Rockville v. Rylyns Enters., Inc., </em>372 Md. 514, 530, 814 A.2d 469 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">We agree with Mr. Pringle\u2019s assertion that the Sector Plan is \u201cbinding\u201d on the Seneca Meadows development in the sense that the proposed development \u201cmust be consistent\u201d with the Sector Plan recommendations. But we are persuaded that the recommendation in the Sector Plan on which Mr. Pringle specifically relies (\u201cBig box retailers, if proposed, <em>should </em>have active storefronts with multiple entrances and small retail uses facing Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive.\u201d) is clearly aspirational rather than mandatory.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Courts in Maryland and other jurisdictions addressing the regulatory effect of the word \u201cshould\u201d have reached the same conclusion. This Court quite recently addressed the issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>Miller v. City of Annapolis Historic Pres. Comm\u2019n, </em>200 Md.App. 612, 28 A.3d 147 (2011).

In rejecting the Millers\u2019 argument that the \u201cthe Commission had improperly banned the use of fiberglass,\u201d the Court stated that the \u201cguidelines direct that contemporary materials \u2018should\u2019 be avoided. They do not provide that the materials \u2018shall\u2019 be avoided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638-39, 28 A.3d 147.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">In reaching that conclusion, the Court found</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A91\">the analysis in <em>Caudill v.

Other cases have also interpreted the word \u201cshould\u201d as indicating a mere recommendation. <em>See McKinley v.

Specifically, in its Site Plan approval, the Planning Board found that the natural drain location of the site (at the corner of Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive where the Sector Plan has called for retail frontage) and the grades <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>of that intersection made \u201clocating the retail uses on Seneca Meadows Parkway and Observation Drive ... not feasible,\u201d and that, due to those \u201cconstraints,\u201d \u201can internal network of streets relatively near the proposed transit station is [still] consistent with the Sector Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Mr. Pringle offers a simple solution to the perceived problem\u2014reject approval of a big-box retailer at this location. We are not persuaded that plan consistency would necessarily require rejecting a big-box retailer at a site that would otherwise permit it simply because site-specific restraints made the Plan recommendations not feasible at a particular location. In finding that the application was consistent with the Sector Plan, the Planning Board concluded that \u201cthis Application will transition the Seneca Meadows/Milestone District towards implementing the Sector Plan\u2019s vision.
