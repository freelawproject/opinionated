At the close of evidence appellant moved unsuccessfully for a judgment of acquittal. After conviction and sentencing, appellant noted this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Appellant presents five questions for our review; they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">I. Was the application of Ejection] L[aw] \u00a7 16\u2014201(1)(7) to [appellant] [constitutionally vague?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">II. Was the jury verdict inconsistent in counts three (3) and five (5)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">III. Was the court\u2019s instruction to the jury on aiders and abettors clearly erroneous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">IV. Did the trial court err when it refused to allow [appellant\u2019s] experts to testify that [in their opinions] the call, its content and the lack of authority line were the responsibility of the campaign and not [appellant\u2019s] []?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">V. Was the court\u2019s sentence forbidding [appellant\u2019s] participation in politics illegal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">For the reasons that follow, we answer no to each question and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">In the days immediately preceding the November 2, 2010 statewide elections, senior members of the Bob Ehrlich for Maryland Campaign met to discuss strategy. The discussion among Paul Schurick, Greg Massoni, and Bernie Marczyk,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pertained to, <em>inter alia, </em>how to influence African-American voter turnout in Baltimore City and Prince George\u2019s County. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The Ehrlich Campaign retained appellant\u2019s businesses, Politics Today and Universal Elections, to provide consulting services. In that capacity, appellant received a telephone call from Paul Schurick inquiring how the Campaign could decrease voter turnout in the aforementioned jurisdictions. Appellant responded that a robocall would best fit the Campaign\u2019s designs.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">To effect the plan, appellant and his employee, Rhonda Russell, retained the services of a company named Robodial.org. Robodial.org owns and operates software that places recorded phone calls\u2014known as \u201crobocalls\u201d\u2014and records logistical data about them. Ms. Russell set up an account with Robodial.org and uploaded a list of phone numbers for residents in each county who were selected to receive the robocall.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On election day, appellant dictated the call\u2019s language and Ms. Russell sent a test message to appellant, Paul Schurick, and Greg Massoni. The call stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">Hello. I\u2019m calling to let everyone know that Governor O\u2019Malley and President Obama have been successful. Our goals have been met. The polls were correct and we took it back. We\u2019re okay. Relax. Everything is fine. The only thing left is to watch it on TV tonight. Congratulations and thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Ms. Russell inquired why the message lacked an authority line, and appellant responded that the client did not want one. After appellant gave her the \u201cgreen light,\u201d Ms. Russell uploaded the contents of the message to Robodial.org.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Shirley Malloy, a resident of Prince George\u2019s County, testified to receiving the robocall on the evening of November 2, 2010. At the time the call was placed to her, the polls were still open. Ms. Malloy testified that the call raised her suspicions because the President was not a candidate on any ballot in Maryland at that time. Peter Vandermeer, a Baltimore City resident, received the same call. The suspicious nature of the call prompted him to vote, and to inform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Board of Elections about the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Appellant was soon indicted on charges that he \u201cdid knowingly and willfully cause to be published and distributed campaign material that did not include the name of the campaign finance entity and the treasurer responsible for said publication and distribution, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 13-401 and 13-602(a)(9) of the Election Law Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland against the peace, government and dignity of the State.\u201d The indictment also alleged that the robocall and authority line omissions constituted voter fraud in violation of EL \u00a7 16-201(a)(6),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that appellant conspired with Paul E. Schurick to commit all of these acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The jury found appellant guilty only of conspiracy to violate the authority line requirement of EL \u00a7 13-401, and the court sentenced appellant to a one-year term of imprisonment, with all but two months suspended. The court ordered appellant to serve three years of probation upon release from confinement, on the condition that appellant refrain from \u201cworking in any capacity in election campaigns[,] whether it\u2019s in a voluntary status or paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">This case presents us with a sad tale. Appellant and his collaborators callously attempted to manipulate members of the electorate in an effort to dissuade predominantly African-American voters from exercising their constitutional right to vote in a gubernatorial election. As we will explain, <em>infra, </em>the current appeal presents no grounds to reverse his conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">Appellant\u2019s first question presented, whether \u201cEL 16\u2014201(1)(7)\u201d is constitutionally vague, is puzzling for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>number of reasons. First, a subsection \u201c(1)(7)\u201d does not exist in EL \u00a7 16-201, and appellant is seemingly unaware that his indictment was amended to charge him under \u00a7 16-201(a)(6),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which in any event was not the basis of appellant\u2019s <em>conviction. </em>Third, the body of appellant\u2019s brief nowhere addresses protection from vague laws under the Due Process Clause. <em>See F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2307, 2317, 183 L.Ed.2d 234 (2012). Instead, he seems to have mistaken vagueness for his First Amendment defense, and then further confused matters by arguing <em>not </em>that EL \u00a7\u00a7 13-401 and 13-602(a)(9) unconstitutionally suppress protected speech, but that his speech actually <em>did not fall within </em>the (allegedly unconstitutional) scope of these sections.</p>\n<p id=\"A92\">At the heart of appellant\u2019s tangled arguments is his fundamental confusion about the dual nature of his crime: the robocall not only misrepresented the course of the election, it also failed to disclose the source of funds used to create and broadcast the message. While appellant was charged with voting fraud under EL \u00a7 16-201(a)(6), he was convicted only of failure to include an authority line under EL \u00a7\u00a7 13-401 and 13-602(a)(9).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Appellant cites<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a 1995 Maryland Attorney General\u2019s opinion discussing <em>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n, </em>514 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>334, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995), to argue that EL \u00a7\u00a7 13-401 and 13-602(a)(9) do not apply to him because he is not a \u201cperson\u201d but, rather, a \u201cpolitical consultant.\u201d As noted above, however, appellant confuses the question of whether he is a \u201cperson\u201d as intended by the legislature\u2014which he plainly is<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2014with the question of whether his speech was protected from the statute by the First Amendment, which it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The <em>McIntyre </em>court struck down an Ohio statute that prohibited the distribution of anonymous political literature by all private citizens. 514 U.S. at 348-53, 115 S.Ct. 1511. But appellant was not convicted of being a private citizen who distributed anonymous campaign materials, he was convicted of distributing <em>funded campaign materials that failed to disclose their source, </em>a requirement specifically upheld by <em>Citizens United v. Fed. Election Comm\u2019n, </em>558 U.S. 310, 366-67, 130 S.Ct. 876, 175 L.Ed.2d 753 (2010):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the ability to speak, but they \u201cimpose no ceiling on campaign-related activities,\u201d <em>[Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 64, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) ], and \u201cdo not prevent anyone from speaking,\u201d <em>[McConnell v. Fed. Election Comm\u2019n, </em>540 U.S. 93, 201, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003) ] (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The Court has subjected these requirements to \u201cexacting scrutiny,\u201d which requires a \u201csubstantial relation\u201d between the disclosure requirement and a \u201csufficiently important\u201d governmental interest. <em>Buckley, supra, </em>at 64, 66, 96 S.Ct. 612 (internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>quotation marks omitted); <em>see McConnell, supra, </em>at 231-232, 124 S.Ct. 619.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\">In <em>Buckley, </em>the Court explained that disclosure could be justified based on a governmental interest in \u201cprovid[ing] the electorate with information\u201d about the sources of election-related spending. 424 U.S. at 66, 96 S.Ct. 612. The <em>McConnell </em>Court applied this interest in rejecting facial challenges to BCRA \u00a7\u00a7 201 and 311. 540 U.S. at 196, 124 S.Ct. 619. There was evidence in the record that independent groups were running election-related advertisements \u201c \u2018while hiding behind dubious and misleading names.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 197, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting [disclosure <em>McConnell v. Fed. Election Comm\u2019n, </em>251 F.Supp.2d 176, 237 (D.D.C.2003) <em>(\u201cMcConnell I </em>\u201d) ]). The Court therefore upheld BCRA \u00a7\u00a7 201 and 311 on the ground that they would help citizens \u201c \u2018make informed choices in the political marketplace.\u2019 \u201d 540 U.S. at 197, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <em>McConnell I, </em>supra, at 237); <em>see </em>540 U.S. at 231, 124 S.Ct. 619.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Whether it is a matter of statutory interpretation or First Amendment protections, the line that appellant attempts to draw between a \u201cperson\u201d and a \u201cpolitical consultant\u201d is illusory. Appellant was a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of EL \u00a7\u00a7 13-401 and 13-602(a)(9), and it is precisely his role as a consultant <em>directing the use of campaign funds </em>that excludes him from the First Amendment\u2019s protection of anonymous speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">II. Inconsistent Verdicts</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Appellant complains also that we must reverse his conviction because it is legally and factually inconsistent to be convicted of conspiracy but acquitted of the completed crime. Appellant failed to preserve his point for review by objecting prior to the jury\u2019s discharge, <em>McNeal v. State, </em>426 Md. 455, 466, 44 A.3d 982 (2012); <em>Price v. State, </em>405 Md. 10, 40, 949 A.2d 619 (2008) (Harrell, J., concurring), but preservation is frankly of little concern here, for appellant is simply wrong. A conviction for conspiracy may lie without conviction of the underlying offense. <em>Townes v. State, </em>314 Md. 71, 75, 548 A.2d 832 (1988); <em>Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 758-61, 506 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>580 (1986); <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 312, 336, 752 A.2d 653 (2000), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>363 Md. 130, 767 A.2d 844 (2001); <em>Jones v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 370, 376-77, 259 A.2d 807 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">III. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Appellant next argues that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">Each charge in this case is a misdemeanor. When a person embraces a misdemeanor, that person is a principal as to that crime, no matter what the nature of the involvement. In other words, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt an offense charged was committed, and that the defendant willfully and knowingly incited, encouraged, aided or assisted in the commission of that charged offense, then he is guilty of that offense.<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Under Maryland Rule 2-520(c), the \u201ccourt may instruct the jury, orally or in writing or both, by granting requested instructions, by giving instructions of its own, or by combining any of these methods.\u201d We have stated that the \u201cstandard of review for jury instructions is that so long as the law is fairly covered by the jury instructions, reviewing courts should not disturb them.\u201d <em>Tharp v. State, </em>129 Md.App. 319, 329, 742 A.2d 6 (1999). On review, we \u201cmust determine whether the requested instruction was a correct exposition of the law, whether that law was applicable in light of the evidence before the jury, and finally whether the substance of the requested instruction was fairly covered by the instruction actually given.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Appellant\u2019s argument on this point again demonstrates a basic misunderstanding of criminal law. He rightly acknowledges that, for misdemeanor crimes, aiders and abettors are held criminally liable to the same degree as principals. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>See Handy v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 239, 250-51, 326 A.2d 189 (1974). But appellant then goes on to argue that he was not charged as an aider or abettor, and so the foregoing instruction should not have been given. This argument confuses the propriety of his charging documents with that of the given instructions, neither of which are in question here. His misdemeanor charges needed not distinguish principal from accessory liability, <em>see Seward v. State, </em>208 Md. 341, 346, 118 A.2d 505 (1955). Because he was criminally liable as an accessory, <em>Handy, </em>23 Md.App. at 250-51, 326 A.2d 189, and the instruction was legally accurate, <em>Bellamy v. State, </em>403 Md. 308, 334, 941 A.2d 1107 (2008), it was given properly and provides appellant no relief from his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">IV. Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Appellant\u2019s next assignment of error is the court\u2019s refusal to allow him the benefit of expert testimony. Under Maryland Rule 5-702, \u201c[ejxpert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d \u201cIn making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The court is vested with, wide discretion in determining the admissibility and propriety of expert testimony. <em>Rollins v. State, </em>392 Md. 455, 499-500, 897 A.2d 821 (2006). <em>Accord Wise v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 127, 135, 751 A.2d 24 (2000) (\u201c[The] trial court has broad discretion to rule on the admissibility of expert testimony and its decision to admit or exclude such testimony is rarely reversed.\u201d); <em>Sippio v. State, </em>350 Md. 633, 648, 714 A.2d 864 (1998). \u201c[Ajbuse of discretion occurs where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court or when the court acts without reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u201d <em>Hajireen v. State, </em>203 Md.App. 537, 552, 39 A.3d 105 (2012). The \u201ctrial court abuses its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>discretion when its ruling either does not logically follow from the findings upon which it supposedly rests or has no reasonable relationship to its announced objective.\u201d <em>Ingram v. State, </em>427 Md. 717, 726-27, 50 A.3d 1127 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">According to appellant\u2019s proffer, his experts \u201cwould state that the responsibility for the [robojcall and the authority line was that of the campaign and not of a political consultant such as [appellant.]\u201d By denying him the benefit of expert testimony, appellant argues that \u201cthe resulting prejudice to [appellant] was the loss of the testimony which [ ] [would have] set before the jury [the notion] that the authority line failure in the robocall was not his responsibility, but that of the campaign and Mr. Schurick.\u201d Appellant\u2019s attempt to pass the buck, however, cannot succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Appellant argues that \u201c[the court] made no determination as to the qualifications of the experts, nor whether there was a sufficient factual basis to support the expert testimony.\u201d The court, appellant highlights, \u201creflexively isolated one portion of the requirement under Rule 5-702 and denied the testimony.\u201d By process of elimination, it appears that appellant focuses on the court\u2019s application of Rule 5-702\u2019s second prong, <em>viz., </em>\u201cthe appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject.\u201d Appellant characterizes political consulting as a new frontier, insinuating that the court denied his use of expert testimony because \u201chistorically, judges have denied expert opinions based upon ignorance concerning the principles of other disciplines.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But this is merely an unsubstantiated assertion. It does not establish error. We conclude, therefore, that appellant failed to satisfy his burden of identifying the specific manner in which the court abused its discretion. <em>Worthen v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 20, 42, 399 A.2d 272 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Although the discussion, <em>supra, </em>is sufficient for us to affirm the court\u2019s decision with respect to the admissibility of expert testimony, we agree with the State that \u201c[t]he proffered testimony [amounted to] nothing more than the legal conclusions of the [] experts concerning the scope of the [appellant\u2019s] responsibility under the relevant statutes.\u201d Although an expert opinion as to an ultimate issue of fact is admissible pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-704, an expert\u2019s opinion on a matter of law is inadmissible. <em>Waltermeyer v. State, </em>60 Md.App. 69, 81, 480 A.2d 831 (1984). Even if appellant was entitled to the benefit of expert testimony, his experts could not have testified, as desired, to the ultimate legal issue of responsibility for the robocall.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Y. The Condition of Probation</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Lastly, appellant challenges the special condition of his probation prohibiting him from \u201cworking in any capacity in election campaigns[,] whether it\u2019s in a voluntary status or paid.\u201d He argues that \u201cbanning him from politics, and thusly his right to make a living is excessive and violates his [constitutional right to free association^] to contracts!.,] and access to political speech.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Probation, in the first instance, is a \u201cdiscretionary matter\u2014a matter of grace, not entitlement.\u201d <em>Wink v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 677, 682, 547 A.2d 1122 (1988). Probation is an \u201cact of clemency bestowed by the court.\u201d <em>Hudgins v. State, </em>292 Md. 342, 347, 438 A.2d 928 (1982). The \u201cmalefactor [] may be free as long as he conducts himself in a manner consonant with established communal standards and the safety of society.\u201d Scott <em>v. State, </em>238 Md. 265, 275, 208 A.2d 575 (1965). When imposing probation conditions, \u201c[a] judge is vested with very broad discretion in sentencing criminal defendants, and is accorded this broad latitude to best accomplish the objectives of sentencing\u2014punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation[,]\u201d and is \u201climited only by constitutional standards and statutory limits.\u201d <em>Poe v. State, </em>341 Md. 523, 531, 532, 671 A.2d 501 (1996). However, \u201ca condition to the granting of probation which compels a defendant to give up a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>fundamental or constitutional right is not in and of itself unconstitutional or invalid.\u201d <em>People v. Lewis, </em>77 Cal.App.3d 455, 463, 143 Cal.Rptr. 587 (1978); <em>U.S. v. Schave, </em>186 F.3d 839, 843 (7th Cir.1999) (\u201c[A] court will not strike down conditions of release, even if they implicate fundamental rights, if such conditions are reasonably related to the ends of rehabilitation and protection of the public from recidivism.\u201d). Such a condition \u201ccannot stand [only] if it is not related to the crime of which defendant has been convicted and if it has no reasonable relation to future criminality.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>77 Cal.App.3d at 463, 143 Cal.Rptr. 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Although there is a paucity of authority for this proposition in Maryland, reported decisions from our sister states recognize the propriety of prohibiting certain types of employment as a special condition of probation. <em>See e.g., People v. Caruso, </em>174 Cal.App.2d 624, 647, 345 P.2d 282 (1959), <em>cert. denied, </em>363 U.S. 819, 80 S.Ct. 1259, 4 L.Ed.2d 1517 (1960) (finding no abuse of discretion where condition of probation required the defendant to \u201cremain out of the automobile business\u201d even though the \u201cautomobile business is the only one which he knows\u201d in car dealership fraud case); <em>State v.

In <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973), the Supreme Court rejected a facial challenge to an Oklahoma statute prohibiting certain state employees from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7q\">soliciting contributions for partisan candidates, political parties, or other partisan political purposes; becoming members of national, state, or local committees of political parties, or officers or committee members in partisan political clubs, or candidates for any paid public office; taking part in the management or affairs of any political party\u2019s partisan political campaign; serving as delegates or alternates to caucauses or conventions of political parties; addressing or taking an active part in partisan political rallies or meetings; soliciting votes or assisting voters at the polls or helping in a partisan effort to get voters to the polls; participating in the distribution of partisan campaign literature; initiating or circulating partisan nominating petitions; or riding in caravans for any political party or partisan political candidate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">413 U.S. at 616-17, 93 S.Ct. 2908.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Maryland\u2019s interest in protecting the state from a person convicted of an election offense is at least as strong as Oklahoma\u2019s interests in <em>Broadrick, </em>which brings the sentencing court\u2019s probation conditions within that case\u2019s ambit. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>importantly, appellant\u2019s profession\u2014campaign consultant\u2014is not one subject to State licensing requirements. There being no other legitimate control over his political activities, we leave in place the court\u2019s narrowly tailored, rational special condition that appellant not work in \u201cany capacity in election campaigns\u201d during the term of his probation. <em>See Towers v. State, </em>92 Md.App. 183, 194, 607 A.2d 105 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

Rule 8-605.1.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-15\">. Of the persons listed, only Senior Aid Paul Schurick is material to this appeal. Schurick\u2019s own case arising out of these and additional allegations was tried separately. For the purposes of appellant\u2019s conspiracy conviction, Schurick was appellant\u2019s coconspirator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\">. Appellant\u2019s businesses had previously compiled these lists for Democratic Party candidates in Baltimore City and Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-10\">. The indictment originally charged appellant with violations of the phantom section \"16-201(1)(7),\u201d but was later amended to charge appellant properly under EL \u00a7 16~201(a)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\">. This subsection prohibits \"conduct that results or has the intent to result in the denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race, color, or disability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\">. As noted in the description of appellant\u2019s charges, EL \u00a7 13-602(a)(9) provides that \"[a] person may not publish or distribute, or cause to be published or distributed, campaign material that violates\u201d the authority line disclosure requirements of EL \u00a7 13-401, and \u00a7 13-602(b)(l) further provides that any \u201cperson\u201d who does is guilty of a criminal misdemeanor. By contrast, EL \u00a7 16-201(a)(6) goes beyond mere failure to disclose the source of campaign funds and provides that a person may not \"influence or attempt to influence a voter's decision whether to go to the polls to cast a vote through the use of force, fraud, threat, menace, intimidation, bribery, reward, or offer of reward!.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b365-11\">. We use this word loosely, as appellant\u2019s brief referred only to \"Md. Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 110 (1995),\u201d which we presume is <em>80 </em>Md. Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 110 (1995). At argument, counsel referred to \u201can Ohio case\u201d but did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>not have a citation for it and was apparently unaware that it was, in fact, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n, </em>discussed above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\">. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines the word \"person\u201d to include a \"human being,\u201d which appellant does not deny he is. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 525 (2nd pocket ed.1996). Maryland has adopted a broad definition of the term person. <em>See </em>Article 1, \u00a7 15 (2011 Repl.Vol.) (\"Unless such a construction would be unreasonable, the word person shall include corporation, partnership, business trust, statutory trust, or limited liability company.\u201d); Maryland Rule l-202(t) (Defining a person as, <em>inter alia, </em>\"any individual.... \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[8]\">\n<p id=\"b368-10\">8. Appellant\u2019s brief does not quote the instructions as given, but instead quotes an accomplice liability instruction of unknown origin that does not refer to misdemeanors, either as charged or in general.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">. Contrary to appellant's assertions about the novelty of political consultants in our electoral system, he advises us that \"the first political consultants arose from California in the 1930's.\u201d We suspect that most courts have become familiar with the species in the last eighty plus years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\">. If there is any question as to whether the scope of the trial court\u2019s probation exceeded these strictures or is vague, appellant has not raised it. <em>See Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 608, 93 S.Ct. 2908 (statutory prohibitions were \u201cset out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with, without sacrifice to the public interest\u201d). Appellant presented only the most basic, general attack on the court\u2019s sentence, and to accept his arguments as valid is to deny the sentencing court any power to restrict <em>public </em>political participation, which is against the holding of <em>Broadrick.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
