Appellant raises two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">\u2022 \u201cDid the motions judge err in denying the motion to suppress?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">\u2022 \u201cDid the trial court improperly admit prejudicial hearsay?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">SUPPRESSION HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">\n<em>Factual And Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">At the September 6, 2011 hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to \u201csuppress all evidence obtained by police authorities as the result of an illegal search and seizure,\u201d Scott Mapes testified that he was the owner of a shopping plaza located on Maugans Avenue in Maugansville, Maryland. Mapes entered into a commercial lease with appellant to rent 18020 Maugans Avenue (\u201cthe property\u201d) from April 15, 2009 through April 30, 2010. According to Mapes, the property was to be used for appellant\u2019s business, in which appellant \u201cand his partner<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> would go to law offices or doctor\u2019s office and scan ... paperwork and ... digitize it and keep it on hard drives.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mapes described the lease as being for \u201cone year and then it went on month to month after that.\u201d The terms of the lease include, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-13\">\u2022 rent was due on the first day of each month;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u2022 non-payment of rent for a period of five days past the first day of the month \u201cshall constitute an event of default\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">\u2022 \u201c[u]pon the occurrence of any event of default a party at any time thereafter <em>may </em>give written notice to the other specifying such event of default and stating that this Lease shall expire on the date specified in such notice\u201d (emphasis added);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\u2022 \u201c[a]ll notice or demands of any kind which either may be required or may desire to serve on the [Tenant] under the terms of this Lease may be served on the [Tenant] (as an alternative to personal service) by leaving a copy of such demand or notice at the [property], or by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to: (a) Tenant at the Demised Premises .... Service shall be deemed complete at the time of the leaving of such notice as aforesaid or within two (2) days of mailing same\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">\u2022 the \u201c[landlord shall have access to the [property] ... during the Tenant\u2019s regular business hours for the purpose of inspecting the same and making repairs, or for a period of six (6) months prior to the expiration of the terms of this Lease, to show the property to prospective tenants or purchasers\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">\u2022 the \u201cTenant shall observe and comply with all laws, ordinances and regulations of public authorities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Mapes testified that he did not receive a rent payment on August 1, 2010. On August 3, he left voicemail messages on appellant\u2019s cellphone and on appellant\u2019s partner\u2019s cellphone regarding the past due payment. He testified further: \u201cAnd then a few days later I called both numbers [again] and both are disconnected. A[nd], I sent e-mail. And I asked one of the tenants next door if they\u2019d seen [appellant\u2019s] vehicle and they said they hadn\u2019t. Ah, I assumed he was cleared out and gone.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to Mapes, telephone and email were \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>way we communicated\u201d and the \u201cmethods that ha[d] always worked in the past\u201d to contact appellant when he was late with a rent payment. \u201cQuite often\u201d Mapes would receive payment \u201cthe next day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Mapes did not receive any payment or communications from appellant or his partner. On August 13, Mapes, believing the lease had \u201cexpired\u201d and that he was in possession of the property\u2014but acknowledging that he had not notified appellant via postal mail or personal service of any default on the lease\u2014attempted to enter the property. Discovering that \u201cthe lock had been changed,\u201d he \u201cdrilled the lock\u201d and entered the property, the interior of which he described as \u201cthrashed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Once inside, he observed \u201clots of pot,\u201d and called the police. Sheriffs Deputy Matthew Bragunier responded to the call, and, after Mapes \u201cinvited\u201d Deputy Bragunier inside to view the marijuana, the deputy called for backup. Agent Bryan Glines of the Narcotics Task Force (\u201cNTF\u201d) later arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Mapes testified that he \u201cimmediately\u201d consented to the officers entering the property and \u201callowed\u201d them \u201caccess to [the] premises.\u201d He explained to them that the tenant had left, and that he had \u201ctaken possession\u201d of the property. He signed a consent form after the \u201csecond officer\u201d arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Deputy Bragunier testified that, when he responded to Mapes\u2019s call, the door to the property was already open<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u201cMapes was fidgeting with the locks____\u201d From outside the property, Deputy Bragunier did not see any contraband, but he smelled an \u201coverwhelming, strong\u201d scent of unburnt marijuana. According to Deputy Bragunier, Mapes \u201cidentified himself as the landlord, the owner of the strip mall\u201d and \u201cinvited\u201d the deputy onto the property. When they</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag6\">entered the threshold, room one, I noticed a bunch of ... buckets full of potting soil with broken stems. Ah, ... as we went down the hallway I looked in room number two. Saw numerous, ah, sapling, little youngling (sic) marijuana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>plants. That\u2019s when I immediately exited the premises and contacted NTF.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Agent Glines and his supervising sergeant, Sergeant Kerns, responded. Agent Glines testified that \u201cas soon as I arrived I spoke with Deputy Bragunier\u201d who indicated that he had entered the property and \u201csaw what he believed to be marijuana plants.\u201d Agent Glines called the \u201cattorney in [his] office,\u201d who advised him to have Mapes \u201csign a consent to search form.... \u201d The following colloquy ensued between appellant\u2019s counsel and Agent Glines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">Q. Did you have an opportunity to speak with the landlord?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">Q. Did you understand him to be the landlord, not the tenant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\">Q. Did he advise you that he forced entry into the ... building?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-11\">A. Ah, I knew he made entry, I wasn\u2019t sure ... if he forced entry. I don\u2019t recall if he advised me on how he made entry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-12\">Q. And you ... took the consent from the landlord,<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> as opposed to the consent from the tenant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-13\">A. Correct. Ah, speaking with the landlord, he advised that the lease ha[d] ... expired. Therefore, the property was owned by the owner of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">At the conclusion of the testimony, the prosecutor, on the merits of the suppression motion, stipulated that \u201cif the landlord could legally enter the premises, then the police could [too]. And if the landlord could not, then it was not an okay entry\u201d by the police. Contending that Mapes indeed could \u201clegally enter [the] property,\u201d and thus could also \u201cinvite the police in to inspect what he had seen,\u201d the prosecutor high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>lighted certain provisions of the lease, such as the landlord\u2019s right to inspection, and appellant\u2019s alleged breach of other provisions of the lease, including the payment of rent and the duty to comply with all laws. The prosecutor also argued that appellant had abandoned the property, or that the lease, due to nonpayment, had \u201cdefaulted\u201d and \u201cexpired,\u201d either of which gave Mapes \u201cthe right to repossess the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">While also countering that neither the landlord\u2019s right of inspection nor the tenant\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the law permitted Mapes to enter the property on August 13, appellant\u2019s counsel principally asserted that, \u201c[a]bsent written notice,\u201d Mapes \u201cdid not have the ability to legally enter\u201d the property. \u201cAnd if he did not have the ability to legally enter\u201d the property, \u201cthen based on the [stipulation] with the State, the officers did not have the ability to legally enter\u201d the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The motions court found that appellant had standing to challenge the search because he had a \u201cmonth to month lease that began by agreement of the parties after the expiration of the year and one half month written lease. And ... there [were] never eviction proceedings or anything else to remove him from his leasehold.\u201d The motions court also found that appellant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">had an expectation of privacy in his leased premises under the written lease, which converted to a month to month tenancy after the one year and half a month. At some point thereafter he may have abandoned [the property] ... by not doing anything when he got back into the country from Cairo and Paris in September of 2010, seeing the \u201cFor Lease\u201d sign and going away. ... <footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">I don\u2019t find that he abandoned the property any time until then. It sounds like it was his expectation that Mr. Springer was going to pay the rent or somehow this lease would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>continue in some way. And just because the rent wasn\u2019t paid on August [1], when the lease provisions give him a grace period and have to be written notice before ... the defect in the failure to pay rent can be cured by some other means. Ah, all those things lead me to believe that as of August [13], he thought he had a leased premises ... even though he was in Paris or Cairo [at that time].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Notwithstanding its finding that appellant had standing and an expectation of privacy in the property, the court denied the motion to suppress. First, it observed that Mapes, in entering the property, was \u201cnot a State agent. He [wa]s not acting for the police.\u201d Thus, \u201cwhether he technically violated the terms of the lease or not, I don\u2019t think matters to whether or not this was a Fourth Amendment intrusion by the police.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Second\u2014and although the prosecutor had argued that Mapes had <em>actual authority </em>to consent to the search by the police and stipulated that the State was not relying on apparent authority\u2014the court found that the officers acted reasonably in relying on Mapes\u2019s <em>apparent authority:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">... [A] warrant wouldn\u2019t have been a bad idea. It wouldn\u2019t have hurt anything. But based on what Mr. Mapes said, based on his <em>apparent authority </em>to invite the police in, based on his reasonable belief that he had a right to enter and the police\u2019s therefore reasonable belief that they had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>right to enter I don\u2019t find this was an unreasonable search and seizure by Deputy Bragunier or by Officer Glines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">... [B]y the time the State got involved [they weren\u2019t] on a fishing expedition or snooping in. They were being le[d] into a commercial residence by the landlord who had a reasonable reason to enter the premises and had a reasonable reason to ask the police to accompany him. That when the police were in there they lawfully could seize anything that they saw or smelled in plain view or scent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The Court of Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">[The] review of a Circuit Court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence under the Fourth Amendment is limited, ordinarily, to information contained in the record of the suppression hearing and not the record of the trial. When there is a denial of a motion to suppress, we are further limited to considering facts in the light most favorable to the State as the prevailing party on the motion. In considering the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, we extend great deference to the fact-finding of the suppression hearing judge with respect to the weighing and determining first-level facts. When conflicting evidence is presented, we accept the facts as found by the hearing judge unless it is shown that his findings are clearly erroneous. Even so, as to the ultimate conclusion of whether an action taken was proper, we must make our own independent constitutional appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-10\"><em>State v.

State, </em>391 Md. 289, 334, 893 A.2d 1018 (2006). \u201c[A]uthority to consent to a search requires a considered judgment of both factual circumstances and legal issues,\u201d <em>United States v. Kim, </em>105 F.3d 1579, 1582 (9th Cir.1997), <em>i.e., </em>the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Abeokuto, </em>391 Md. at 334, 893 A.2d 1018. The consent of the owner of the property searched may serve to validate a property search (\u201cactual authority\u201d). <em>State v. Rowlett, </em>159 Md.App. 386, 395, 859 A.2d 303 (2004) (internal citations omitted). Generally speaking, however, a landlord cannot consent to the search of his tenant\u2019s property <em>when the lease is still valid. See Chapman v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 610, 616, 81 S.Ct. 776, 5 L.Ed.2d 828 (1961); 31 A.L.R.2d 1078, *4 (\u201cIn the few eases in which the person consenting to the search was the lessor of the person invoking the constitutional immunity, it has been uniformly held that the landlord\u2019s consent will not, of itself, render the search legal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The consent of a third party having either \u201ccommon\u201d or \u201capparent\u201d authority over the property may also serve to validate a property search. <em>Rowlett, </em>159 Md.App. at 395, 859 A.2d 303 (internal citations omitted). We have explained the difference between the two:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">Common authority to consent to a search is not derived \u201cfrom the mere property interest a third party has in the property\u201d searched; rather, such authority rests \u201con mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes.\u201d And if a person with common authority over the premises consents to a search of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>premises, that consent is \u201csufficient to validate [the] search.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 396, 859 A.2d 303 (internal citations omitted). Apparent authority exists when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">the facts available to the officer at the time of the search would \u201c \u2018warrant a man of <em>reasonable </em>caution\u2019 \u201d to believe that \u201cthe consenting party had authority over the premises,\u201d then the consenting party has apparent authority over the premises and may lawfully consent to a search of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The Supreme Court has rested the constitutional validity of apparent authority on reasonableness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">It is apparent that in order to satisfy the \u201creasonableness\u201d requirement of the Fourth Amendment, what is generally demanded of the many factual determinations that must regularly be made by agents of the government\u2014whether the magistrate issuing a warrant, the police officer executing a warrant, or the police officer conducting a search or seizure under one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement\u2014is not that they always be correct, but that they always be reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">We see no reason to depart from this general rule with respect to facts bearing upon the authority to consent to a search. Whether the basis for such authority exists is the sort of recurring factual question to which law enforcement officials must be expected to apply their judgment; and all the Fourth Amendment requires is that they answer it reasonably. The Constitution is no more violated when officers enter without a warrant because they reasonably (though erroneously) believe that the person who has consented to their entry is a resident of the premises, than it is violated when they enter without a warrant because they reasonably (though erroneously) believe they are in pursuit of a violent felon who is about to escape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>Illinois v.

More specifically, counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>contended that the record does not reveal whether the officers asked Mapes \u201cto see the lease,\u201d \u201cto see the authority,\u201d or \u201cwhat the terms of the lease were?\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, the motions court \u201cdrew\u201d its conclusion regarding <em>apparent authority </em>\u201cout of \u2018whole cloth\u2019 \u201d because the parties were focused on <em>actual authority </em>during the motions hearing. He argues that, in the interests of fairness, the court could not \u201call of a sudden rule in a manner that is contrary to any of the arguments or any of the evidence that was already presented.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Assuming that apparent authority could not support the entry onto the premises, appellant also argues that Mapes\u2019s drilling of the lock and entering onto the property were a violation of the terms of the lease, and, thus, Mapes did not have the actual authority to consent to the police\u2019s entry onto the property.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The State responds that \u201c[t]he alleged violation of the lease agreement has no effect on the constitutionality of the search later conducted by law enforcement\u201d because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">Based on the information available to him at the time, [Deputy Bragunier] reasonably believed that Mr. Mapes was the property owner in valid possession of the premises and had the authority to consent to the search. Later, when Agent Glines arrived, he was presented with the same information in addition to Deputy Bragunier\u2019s observations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>made during the initial search. Both officers acted reasonably by relying on the consent of a property owner who appeared to have rightfully retaken possession [of] the property following [appellant\u2019s] abandonment of the property and violation of the lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">Because the officers[\u2019] reliance on Mr. Mapesf\u2019s] consent was based on information presented to them that would warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that [Mapes] had the authority to give consent, the search was reasonable and not violative of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">At oral argument, the State argued that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">\u2022 during the motions hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel \u201chad and took the opportunity to [question] both of the officers and also Mr. Mapes about what he told the officers, ... which plays directly into\u201d an apparent authority analysis;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">\u2022 Mapes also had actual or common authority to consent to the search; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">\u2022 \u201cthe officers responding to the scene are entitled to accept the representations of the person who called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>them,\u201d without examining the actual provisions of the lease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">We are not persuaded that the court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress based on Mapes\u2019s apparent authority to consent to the officers\u2019 entry into the premises. Moreover, we are persuaded that the record adequately supports a finding that the officers\u2019 reliance on his apparent authority was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">First, while Mapes did not provide written consent for the search until after Deputy Bragunier had already entered the property, Mapes testified that he \u201cimmediately\u201d consented to the officers entering the property and \u201callowed\u201d them \u201caccess to [the] premises.\u201d \u201cIt is well established ... that a valid consent to search may be oral.\u201d <em>Manzi v.

Agent Glines testified that Mapes \u201cadvised that the lease ha[d] ... expired. Therefore, the property was owned by the owner of the property.\u201d The door to the property was wide open when the officers arrived and they did not know that appellant had drilled the locks. There was no indication that a tenant was still occupying the premises.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Even if Mapes lacked actual authority to consent to a search of the property, under the circumstances presented in this case, the officers acted reasonably in relying on Mapes\u2019s representations that he had rightfully \u201ctaken possession\u201d of the property and could therefore grant the officers valid consent to enter. Appellant has not pointed out any \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d that would, in our view, require the officers to make \u201cfurther inquiry\u201d into Mapes\u2019s authority to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Nor could it be argued that the officers\u2019 belief in Mapes\u2019s apparent authority was based on a mistake of law on their part, for, although \u201can investigator\u2019s erroneous belief that landlords] are generally authorized to consent to a search of a tenant\u2019s premises could not provide the authorization necessary for a warrantless search.\u201d <em>Moore v.

State, </em>101 Md.App. 303, 646 A.2d 1050 (1994), appellant avers that, in overruling these objections, \u201cthe trial court improperly admitted prejudicial hearsay\u201d because \u201cthe reasons for the police officers\u2019 appearance at the ... property were not \u2018relevant to a material issue in the case\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>but conveyed to the jury the message that [ajppellant\u2019s guilt was a foregone conclusion----\u201d The State responds that, because the statements were not offered as \u201csubstantive evidence\u201d to prove the presence of marijuana on the property, but, rather, were offered to explain \u201cthe circumstances\u201d which brought the officers to the scene to investigate,\u201d the statements \u201cwere not offered for the truth of their content,\u201d and thus were not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u201c \u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Md. Rule 5-801(c). A statement that \u201cis not offered for the truth of the matter asserted ... is not hearsay and it will not be excluded under\u201d Rule 5-802. <em>Stoddard v. State, </em>389 Md. 681, 689, 887 A.2d 564 (2005). That said, however, \u201cextrajudicial [non-hearsay] statements which explain police conduct, but nonetheless directly implicate the defendants, are excluded typically as overly prejudicial.\u201d <em>Morris v. State, </em>418 Md. 194, 226,13 A.3d 1206 (2011). Ordinarily, we review a trial judge\u2019s determination on the admission of evidence for abuse of discretion, <em>Hopkins v. Maryland, </em>352 Md. 146, 158, 721 A.2d 231 (1998), but whether evidence is hearsay is an issue of law reviewed <em>de novo. Parker v.

At trial, the State had insisted \u201cthat the information was \u2018not offered for the truth of the matter asserted\u2019 but was only offered as \u2018to why [the detective] went where he went,\u2019 \u201d as part of the State\u2019s attempt to \u201c \u2018lay out the course of the investigation[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309-10, 646 A.2d 1050. This Court disagreed, stating: \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>only possible import of such testimony was to convey the message that the confidential informant 1) knew who committed the crime, 2) was credible, and 3) implicated [Zemo].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306, 646 A.2d 1050. In holding this to be not \u201cmaterial\u201d to the case in-chief, we characterized it as the product of \u201ca sustained and deliberate line of inquiry that ... had no other purpose than to put before the jury an entire body of information that was none of the jury\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe jury ... has no need to know the course of an investigation unless it has some direct bearing on guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310, 646 A.2d 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Here, the objected-to statements of Deputy Bragunier and Agent Glines were not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u2014that there was a \u201cmarijuana grow\u201d\u2014but, rather, to explain <em>briefly </em>what brought the officers to the scene in the first place. This was not a \u201csustained and deliberate\u201d line of questioning like that in <em>Zemo </em>which we held to have served \u201cno legitimate purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306, 646 A.2d 1050. Nor, as in <em>Zemo, </em>was it intended to put before the jury the testimony of someone who was not testifying in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In addition, these objected-to statements were cumulative to other statements which were <em>not </em>objected to: Mapes\u2019s testimony that he observed \u201c[a] lot of marijuana growing in every room\u201d when he entered the property, which caused him to call the police, and Agent Glines\u2019s testimony that, in providing backup to Deputy Bragunier, the deputy had \u201c[s]tated that he responded to a call where there w[ere] possible marijuana plants.\u201d Thus, even if the objected-to statements were inappropriate and should not have been admitted, we perceive no undue prejudice and are satisfied that they \u201cdid not ultimately affect the jury\u2019s verdict given the cumulative nature of the[se] similar statements.\u201d <em>Yates v. State, </em>429 Md. 112, 124, 55 A.3d 25 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Finally, even if the officers\u2019 statements were admitted in error, their admission was, under the circumstances, harmless error. \u201c[E]rror in admitting [alleged] hearsay is subject to a harmless error review.\u201d <em>Webster v. State, </em>151 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Md.App. 527, 553, 827 A.2d 910 (2003) (citing <em>Baker v. State, </em>332 Md. 542, 560, 632 A.2d 783 (1993)). \u201cThe harmless error rule \u2018embod[ies] the principle that courts should exercise judgment in preference to the automatic reversal for \u2018error\u2019 and ignore errors that do not affect the essential fairness of the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barksdale v. Wilkowsky, </em>419 Md. 649, 657-58, 20 A.3d 765 (2011) (quoting <em>Williams v. State, </em>394 Md. 98, 120, 904 A.2d 534 (2006) (Raker, J., dissenting)). To prevail in a harmless error analysis, the beneficiary of the alleged error must satisfy the appellate court \u201cthat there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). \u201c \u2018To say that an error did not contribute to the verdict is ... to find that error unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question, as revealed by the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bellamy v.

Jurors were presented with the signed lease connecting [appellant] to the premises, photographs of the premises showing the marijuana plants and grow operation, [and] a marijuana \u201cGrower\u2019s Guide\u201d and packaged marijuana seized from the premises. Mr. Mapes testified to leasing the commercial space to [appellant]. Deputy [Bragunier] testified to his observations as the first police officer to respond to the premises. Agents Glines and Toston, of the [NTF], gave detailed accounts of their observations and described the equipment and materials found on the premises which were connected with the grow operation. Forensic scientist Jeffrey Kercheval identified the seized plant material positively as marijuana.

Warrantless searches are <em>per se </em>unreasonable \u201conly in the sense that the police must secure a warrant unless they can demonstrate that the case fits within one of a number of specific exceptions that the Court has fashioned.\u201d Debra Livingston, <em>Police, Community Caretaking, and the Fourth Amendment, </em>1998 U Chi Legal F 261, 267 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\">. Appellant, citing <em>Greenstreet v. State, </em>392 Md. 652, 898 A.2d 961 (2006), and <em>Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 939 A.2d 689 (2008), acknowledges in his motion for reconsideration that a court is not bound by stipulations on a matter of law and that the judgment of the circuit court can be upheld on any ground supported by the record. Appellant contends that, based on the State\u2019s reliance on <em>actual authority </em>at the motions hearing, he was denied the opportunity to adduce evidence or to question the witness on <em>apparent authority. </em>Therefore, a finding of apparent authority was not adequately supported by the record. The State, in its opposition to the motion for reconsideration, responds that the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 reliance on Mapes\u2019s apparent authority to consent was explored by questions asked in appellant's examination of Mapes and both Deputy Bragunier and Agent Glines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b321-8\">. Because we hold that apparent authority <em>did </em>support the entry onto the premises, we do not analyze appellant\u2019s argument regarding actual authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b322-11\">. The State has not argued that, by virtue of Deputy Bragunier smelling unburnt marijuana emanating from the property, there were \"exigent circumstances\u201d supporting a warrantless entry. <em>See, e.g., Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 584, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980) (\"Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.\u201d). Moreover, the information available to the deputy was that the property had been vacated, and thus, could be secured had a warrant been necessary. The Court of Appeals has recognized that, in some cases, \"the mere observation of ... a crime may provide its own exigency\" when the police \"observe the perpetrator actively so engaged\u201d in the commission of that crime. <em>Dunnuck v. State, </em>367 Md. 198, 217, 786 A.2d 695 (2001). \"[A] crime is considered as being committed in the presence or view of an officer when any of his senses,\u201d including those of sight, smell and sound, \"afford him knowledge that it is being committed.\u201d <em>Griffin v.

In this case, appellant could not be observed because he was not present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\">. At oral argument, appellant's counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">Deputy Bragunier, you can be sure, knew, when he arrived on the premises\u2014had probably served many orders to quit the premises or ejectment notices, I mean any Deputy does that as part of his routine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>duties.

This argument rests on a tenant\u2019s failure to pay rent, but the failure to pay rent was not the only reason Mapes communicated to the officers as to why he was in possession of the property. He also indicated that the lease had expired and he had taken possession of the property after he believed the tenant had left. Deputy Bragunier testified that Mapes indicated that appellant \"had failed to pay rent and he made entry into the building,\u201d but it would not be particularly unusual for a tenant to leave a leased premises with rent owing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[14]\">\n<p id=\"b325-20\">14.
