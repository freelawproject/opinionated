At issue was the termination of an agreement between the Allegany Education Board and the Washington County Board of Education (\u2018Washington Education Board\u201d), which provided approximately forty students, who resided in Allegany County, the opportunity to attend schools in Washington County. Appellants allege that the Allegany Education Board\u2019s decision violated the Md.Code (1978, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2012 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 4-121 of the Education Article<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> [hereinafter \u201cEdu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>cation Article \u00a7 4-121\u201d]. The Circuit Court for Allegany County affirmed the State Education Board\u2019s ruling. Appellants noted an appeal, and present two questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">I. Was the decision of the Allegany County Board of Education in violation of \u00a7 4-121 of the Education Article, and thus properly subject to reversal by the State Board and/or the lower court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">II. Was the decision of the Allegany County Board of Education arbitrary or capricious and violative of sound educational policy, thereby mandating reversal by the State Board and/or the lower court?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">On August 1, 2000, the Allegany Education Board voted to close a school in the most eastern region of its county,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and to consolidate students from the closing facility to nearby institutions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To address the parents\u2019 apprehension regarding the consolidation, the Allegany Education Board and the Washington Education Board entered into an agreement, which allowed students, who resided in Little Orleans, Allegany County, Maryland to attend secondary schools in either Cumberland, Maryland in Allegany County or Hancock, Maryland in Washington County. Many students opted to attend school in Allegany County, while others decided to attend the Washington County schools. \u201cThe students who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>attended school in Washington County were counted as Washington County students for the purpose of calculating state aid to schools. The Allegany [Education Board] paid the transportation costs for all of said students.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">On February 28, 2011, the superintendent of Allegany County Public Schools, David Cox (\u201cMr.Cox\u201d), drafted letters to the parents whose children opted to attend school in Washington County, stating (parenthesis omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">... For the 2011-2012 school year[,] Allegany County Public Schools face a reduction in state funding of over $6.5 million due to our declining enrollment and loss of state revenues. As a result, we must consider the termination of our contract with Washington County Public [S]chools to continue providing some $191,000 of Allegany County revenue for approximately 40 students to attend Washington County Public Schools. This arrangement also costs Allegany County Public Schools about $400,000 in lost state revenue. As you can see, this arrangement costs [Allegany County Public Schools] about $600,000 per year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">We recognize the impact that this consideration would have on your child(ren) and on students who are in their secondary years of study, and do not take that lightly. We wish that this consideration were [sic] not necessary. The cuts in state funding will all be finally determined by the General Assembly, and the final impact and recommended arrangements will not be known until then.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Thereafter, the Allegany Education Board extensively debated the issue, and held a public hearing for parents, students, and the community to assert their viewpoints regarding the possible termination of the agreement, answer countless questions, and provide information to impacted families. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>June 3, 2011, Mr. Cox again corresponded with the parents via letter, indicating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">At the June 1, 2011 meeting of the Allegany County Board of Education, the Board voted to phase out the tuition support program that currently supports residents in the Little Orleans community to attend middle and high school in Washington County. Allegany County residents who are students in the 10[th]\u201412[th] grades at Hancock High School in the 2011-2012 school year will receive tuition support. It is the intent of the Board to allow these students to complete their high school experience at Hancock High School over the next three years, contingent on available funding. Transportation will be provided to Hancock High School at least for one more year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">Students who are in grades Pre-K through 9[th] grade for the 2011-2012 school year who live in the Little Orleans community are districted to attend Flintstone Elementary, Washington Middle School, and Fort Hill High School, as some have chosen even while we have supported the Washington County choice. We welcome all the children of Little Orleans to Washington Middle and Fort Hill High School and will plan an orientation session for a better transition experience....<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">On June 29, 2011, appellants requested that the State Education Board review the Allegany Education Board\u2019s decision pursuant to the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCO-MAR\u201d) 13A.01.05.02.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>On July 27, 2011, the Allegany Education Board filed a motion for summary affirmance,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requesting that the State Education Board summarily affirm its decision pursuant to COMAR 13A.01.05.03D.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, a \u201cSave Orleans Students\u201d group requested that the Circuit Court for Allegany County issue a temporary restraining order and an interlocutory injunction, which would permit Little Orleans residents to continue schooling in Washington County. The court ruled in favor of the Allegany Education Board, denying both the temporary restraining order, as well as the injunction on August 23, 2011. The group noted an appeal to our Court, but the action was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">On October 25, 2011, the State Education Board granted review and determined that (1) Education Article \u00a7 4-121 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>included the word \u201cmay,\u201d so there was no requirement of a cross-boundary school attendance and (2) \u201c[i]t [was] incumbent on local boards when making decisions to consider the validity of all expenditures and to weigh and balance the needs of all students in th[o]se tough fiscal times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">On November 22, 2011, appellants filed a petition for judicial review. On November 29, 2011, the Allegany Education Board filed its response. On February 24, 2012, both parties filed a joint motion for extension of time to file their briefs, which was granted. On March 23, 2012, appellants filed an appeal in the Circuit Court for Allegany County pursuant to Md.Code (1984, 2009 RepLVol., 2012 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-222(a) of the State Government Article, for judicial review of the State Education Board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On April 13, 2012, the Allegany Education Board filed its response.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Following a hearing on June 21, 2012, the trial court issued a memorandum and order on July 9, 2012, affirming the State Education Board, where it concluded that appellants did not support their assertion that Education Article \u00a7 4-121 was not discretionary, and that the State Education Board did not err in finding that the Allegany Education Board\u2019s decision was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Appellant noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The doctrine that an individual has a Maryland constitutional right to judicial review regarding an administrative action is mostly predicated on Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Jackson v.

Hence, our Court will affirm the agency\u2019s decision if it was predicated on substantial evidence from the record, and not erroneous as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 665, 972 A.2d 328 (quoting <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v.

Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ., </em>358 Md. 129, 137-38, 747 A.2d 625 (2000) regarding the hierarchy of Maryland\u2019s education system, explaining as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>The State government structure for primary and secondary education is the State Department of Education, created by [Education Article] \u00a7 2-201 \u201cas a principal department of the State government.\u201d The Department consists of (1) the State Board of Education, which is the head of the Department [ (Education Article] \u00a7 2-102) ..., (2) the State Superintendent of Schools, who is a member of the Governor\u2019s Executive Council [ (Education Article] \u00a7 2-303(d)) and serves, in essence, as the chief executive officer of the Department, and (3) the other professional, administrative, and clerical employees employed by the Department, who are State government employees for budgetary and personnel purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">For each county, the [General Assembly] has created a county department of education that, in structure, generally mirrors that of the State Department of Education.

However, through analyzing this issue, we also intend to determine whether Education Article 4-121(c) compels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>an agreement between adjoining counties and whether the statute provides affected students and parents the right to enforce such an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Appellants assert that Education Article \u00a7 4-121 \u201cprovides that students affected by these particularly unique geographic circumstances must be afforded the ability to attend a school that is more \u201cnear\u201d to their communities in a neighboring county free of charge as part of their right.\u201d (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). The Allegany Education Board maintains that Education Article \u00a7 4-121 is discretionary because it \u201cclearly indicates that the school boards in the adjacent counties may provide for an agreement concerning cross-county attendance.\u201d (emphasis added) (internal quotations omitted) (underline omitted). The Allegany Education Board also avers that the statute neither provides students nor their parents the right to compel counties to enter into an agreement regarding cross-boundary school attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">A question regarding statutory interpretation is a legal question, which we review <em>de novo.

Education Article \u00a7 4-121 permits residents who reside in one county to enroll in an adjoining county\u2019s school, provided that the two adjoining counties reached an accord relating to joint attendance of the non-residents.

Thereby, it was not unreasonable for the Allegany Education Board to believe that it would be complying with the General Assembly\u2019s intent, even when faced with the decision to terminate its agreement, in light of fiscal restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">We recognize that the subsections of Education Article \u00a7 4-121 cannot be considered in isolation, and that overall, must be examined in conjunction with other provisions. Md.Code (1978, 2008 RepLVol., 2012 Cum.

A county superintendent of schools may [have] provide[d] for certain exceptions.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Legis. Servs., Revised Fiscal Note, H.B. 364 (1997). Since 1997, Education Article \u00a7 7-101 has always included the \u201cmay allow\u201d language regarding the county superintendent allowing non-resident students to enroll in an adjoining county\u2019s school. <em>See </em>H.B. 364 (Third Reading File Bill), 411th Gen Assem. Reg. Sess. (Md.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">As demonstrated, Education Article \u00a7 4-121\u2019s statutory language is consistent with the broad purposes of the provisions dealing with the same subject, and is clearly reflective of the General Assembly\u2019s intent. Furthermore, with the failed enactment of House Bills 335 and 1447, this is additional evidence that the recent General Assembly wanted to remain in compliance with the previous General Assembly in not compelling the county education boards to enter into agreements to require mandatory cross-boundary school enrollment. Additionally, the statute does not include any language that would provide affected students or parents with the authority to enforce such an agreement. Instead, the General Assembly provided the county education boards with discretion to decide whether they desired to allow students to attend an adjoining county\u2019s school.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">In <em>Clinton et ux. v.

However, as a result of unforeseen circumstances, the plaintiffs were unable to relocate. <em>Id. </em>at 669, 556 A.2d 273. Despite this, the plaintiffs\u2019 children continued their schooling in Howard County. <em>Id. </em>The defendant, the Howard Education Board (\u201ccounty board\u201d), offered the plaintiffs countless \u201cresidency\u201d deadlines, but the plaintiffs failed to comply. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the county board attempted to discontinue the childrens\u2019 enrollment at its school. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The plaintiffs filed an action against the county board and sought an injunction, which the trial court originally granted. <em>Id. </em>However, before the trial court issued its amended order, the county board moved to dismiss the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 670, 556 A.2d 273. Thereafter, the county board filed a counterclaim for approximately $6,340, relating to the childrens\u2019 tuition. <em>Id. </em>The trial court dismissed the complaint, and ordered the plaintiffs to pay approximately $4,900. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs noted an appeal, and the Court of Appeals granted <em>certiorari </em>before our Court examined the issues. <em>Id. </em>at 670-71, 556 A.2d 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">On appeal, the Court analyzed the county board\u2019s policy, which provided the following in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">[A]ll qualified school age minor persons whose parents do not have an established bona fide residence in Howard County or those majority aged students who themselves have not established bona fide residence in Howard County shall be considered non[-]resident students.

Accordingly, because the State Education Board never determined the issues, the Court vacated the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 679, 556 A.2d 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Beyond <em>Clinton, </em>we have not found any Maryland cases concerning cross-boundary school attendance. While it is one of first impression in Maryland, other jurisdictions have considered whether their statutes require county education boards to allow students to attend schools in a non-resident school district.

The statute did not, however, provide for an exception relating to the entire district\u2019s financial well-being. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, although the Court acknowledged possible financial concerns, it was not a statutory reason to deny open enrollment applications for non-resident students. <em>Id. </em>at 622. The Court affirmed the superintendent\u2019s ruling. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In <em>Johnson v. Burmaster, </em>307 Wis.2d 213, 744 N.W.2d 900, 902 (Ct.App.2007), a virtual charter school was established in Northern Ozaukee, Wisconsin. Children from across the state registered, but were taught in their homes by means of internet and postal mail. <em>Id. </em>The virtual school was financed via \u201copen-enrollment transfer payments\u201d from the students\u2019 residential districts to the defendant, Northern Ozaukee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>school district. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs, individual citizens and an education council, filed a complaint against the Northern Ozaukee school district, alleging that operating the virtual school was a violation of Wisconsin\u2019s statute. <em>Id. </em>at 903. Both parties filed their respective motions for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 903-04. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion, and the plaintiffs appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">On appeal, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals examined \u201cwhether a non[-]resident pupil enrolled in [the virtual school] trigger[ed] the open-enrollment statute\u2019s provisions, including a shift in funding from the resident school district to the Northern Ozaukee [s]chool [district.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 906. To determine this issue, the Court researched the statute, which allowed a student to \u201c \u2018attend a public school [ ... ] in a non[-]resident school district.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The parties disputed the meaning of \u201cattend,\u201d arguing whether it constituted \u201cphysical\u201d or \u201cnon-physical\u201d presence. <em>Id. </em>The Court determined that although the students \u201cattended\u201d the virtual school, they engaged in online learning and resources from their homes. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the Court reversed the grant of summary judgment, and ordered the trial court to declare that the defendants violated the education statute and to \u201cenjoin [the education department] from making pupil transfer payments based upon non[-]resident students enrolled in [the virtual school].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In <em>McMomw v. Benson, </em>238 Wis.2d 329, 617 N.W.2d 247, 251-52 (Ct.App.2000), the plaintiff\u2014student desired to finish the last two years of his secondary education in a non-resident school district. He submitted his application to the nonresident district, but it was denied. <em>Id. </em>at 252. The plaintiff appealed to the defendant-superintendent (\u201csuperintendent\u201d), who affirmed the school district\u2019s decision because of class size guidelines. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff then filed a petition for judicial review to the trial court. <em>Id. </em>The trial court reversed, and found that there was no substantial evidence that there was an issue with available space, and concluded that the superintendent\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious. <em>Id. </em>The superintendent then noted an appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>On appeal, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals discussed the class sizes of the grade that the plaintiff sought, and found that two of the six curriculum courses were beyond the maximum capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 254. However, the Court noted that this did not hinder the school district\u2019s decision to permit other students to continue their education at the non-resident school. <em>Id. </em>The superintendent argued that pursuant to the statute, current non-residents received first priority. <em>Id. </em>The Court disagreed, stating that the statute provided that, \u201cwhen there are more applicants <em>than spaces available, </em>the pupils accepted shall be determined on a random basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255 (citation omitted) (emphasis in original). Because the statute was clear and unambiguous, the Court reversed the superintendent\u2019s ruling, indicating that \u201cit [was] arbitrary and unreasonable to make an exception to the class size guidelines to admit three students into the 11th grade, but deny [the plaintiffs] admission without a valid reason.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In addition to examining eases in Wisconsin, we also analyze cases in other jurisdictions. In <em>Storm M.H. ex rel. McSwain v. Charleston County Bd. of Trustees, </em>400 S.C. 478, 735 S.E.2d 492, 494 (2012), a student, a resident of Berkeley County, South Carolina, applied for admission into a prestigious magnet school in Charleston County, South Carolina. The student was accepted, but was required to establish residency to comply with school policy. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff\u2014mother contacted the Charleston County school district\u2019s general counsel, and alleged that the following South Carolina law permitted the student to attend the magnet school, stating (spacing added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">Children ... shall be entitled to attend the public schools of any school district, without charge, only if qualified under the following provisions of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">(a) Such child resides with its parent or legal guardian;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">(b) The parent or legal guardian, with whom the child resides, is a resident of such school district; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">(c) The child owns real estate in the district having an assessed value of three hundred dollars or more; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>(d) The child has maintained a satisfactory scholastic record in accordance with scholastic standards of achievement ...; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-4\">(e) The child has not been guilty of infraction of the rules of conduct promulgated by the trustees of such school district. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 495, n. 3. The general counsel agreed, but indicated that the plaintiff needed to purchase land in the student\u2019s name to fully comply with all of the elements. <em>Id. </em>Despite this, the defendant, the district\u2019s board of trustees (\u201ctrustees board\u201d), held otherwise, stating that Charleston County residency was required. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, and the trustees board filed its motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 496. The trial court concluded that the trustees board\u2019s \u201cresidency\u201d policy was unlawful as a violation of state law. After both parties noted their respective appeals, the student purchased property in Charleston County. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">On appeal, the trustees board maintained that state law provided it with discretion to govern educational matters, including school attendance and admission guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 497. The plaintiff avowed that the \u201cstatutes entitle[d] a child to attend a public school, without charge, if the child either reside[d] or own[ed] real estate within the school district in which the school [was] located.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">This \u201cresident only\u201d criterion [ran] afoul of [the state statute] because any child meeting the threshold established by this provision, either as a resident or a property owner of the subject school district, [was] entitled to attend that district\u2019s schools. Thus, while we agree with the [b]oard that [the statute] [did] not necessarily confer a child the right to attend a particular school within a school district, [the Charleston County school district] may not utilize this provision to revoke admission to a child qualifying to attend a district\u2019s school merely because a child qualifie[d] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>attend school in the district by virtue of property ownership rather than residence....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 489. Because the student comported with all the abovementioned elements and was accepted into the magnet school, the Court affirmed the grant of declaratory judgment in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 499-500</p>\n<p id=\"AIP\">In <em>Pat v. Stanwood School Dist., </em>41 Wash.App. 707, 705 P.2d 1236, 1237 (1985), the plaintiffs\u2014parents filed an action against the defendant\u2014school district (\u201cschool district\u201d) because it denied the request for their child to attend an adjoining county\u2019s school. An administrative law judge reviewed the decision <em>de novo, </em>and concluded that the school district should have granted the release. <em>Id. </em>at 1238. However, the superintendent ignored the administrative law judge\u2019s recommendation, and denied the release because it surmised that the plaintiffs failed to comply -with the county\u2019s policy requirements. <em>Id. </em>The policy stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">1. There exists a special hardship or detrimental condition of a financial, educational, safety or health nature affecting the student or the student\u2019s immediate family, provided that the hardship or condition is likely to be significantly alleviated as a result of the transfer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">2.

Students in grades eleven and twelve who move into the district may complete their high school program in the former district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1237. The plaintiffs filed a petition for judicial review, and the trial court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">On appeal to the Washington Court of Appeals, that Court discussed the plaintiffs\u2019 lifestyle and family affairs. <em>See generally id. </em>at 1237-38. The student resided near the boundary line of both counties. <em>Id. </em>at 1237. She \u201cwould have to spend an hour and a half longer on the bus each day if she attended school in [her residential county] than if she went to school [in the adjoining county].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The mother did not drive, and the plaintiffs were apprehensive regarding the student traveling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>by bus. <em>Id. </em>at 1238. \u201cIf [the student went] to school in [her residential county,] it [would] be difficult for her father to spend much time with her or to assist her with her homework.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the plaintiffs had relatives in the nearby county who also attended the student\u2019s desired school. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">As a result, the Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">[N]one of these problems individually would constitute a special hardship or detrimental circumstance.

[ (citation omitted) ]. The superintendent erred in denying the [plaintiffs\u2019] request for release.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In <em>Ramsdell v. North River School Dish No. 200, </em>104 Wash.2d 264, 704 P.2d 606, 608 (1985), the plaintiffs\u2014parents requested a release for their children to attend a non-resident secondary school. The plaintiffs claimed that their residential school was inadequate, and that their children could be exposed to diverse viewpoints in the adjoining county\u2019s school. <em>Id. </em>The defendant-county board (\u201ccounty board\u201d) denied the request, indicating that \u201c \u2018the [b]oard feels your ease does not meet the state or local school guidelines for releases, nor can it be considered a hardship case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs appealed, and the administrative law judge found that a more prestigious educational curriculum did not establish \u201cspecial hardship or detrimental condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Again, the plaintiffs appealed, and the superintendent affirmed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The plaintiffs sought judicial review, and the trial court reversed the superintendent\u2019s ruling, finding that even though the plaintiffs failed to establish \u201chardship,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 children should attend the schools which met their best educational interest. <em>Id. </em>at 609. The county board appealed, and the Washington Court of Appeals transferred the action to the Washington Supreme Court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The plaintiffs averred that \u201cthere [was] a state granted constitutional right for [their children] to attend [the nonresident school].\u201d The county board nevertheless contended that the resident school was a fully-certified school district, and that the plaintiffs failed to establish their <em>prima fade </em>case. <em>Id. </em>The Washington Supreme Court analyzed its statute, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\">[S]chool district boards of directors may, in receipt of reasonable compensation, make agreements with non[-]resident parents for their children to be released to the district\u2019s schools.

The Court indicated that \u201cwithout concrete evidence of inadequateness, special need or unique circumstances, we decline to rule that disparity among school districts entitles parents to transfer their children into different school districts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611. Accordingly, the Court determined that the trial court erred in its ruling, and reinstated the superintendent\u2019s decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In <em>Cord-Charlotte School Dist. No. 8 v. Independence County Bd. of Education, </em>271 Ark. 217, 608 S.W.2d 12 (1980), <em>aff'd Newark School Dist. et al. v. Cord-Charlotte School Dist. No. 8 et al., </em>278 Ark. 110, 644 S.W.2d 258 (1983), a county education board suggested that two unincorporated communities\u2019 schools, Cord Elementary School and Charlotte High School, in Independence County, Arkansas be consolidated. As a result of the closure of the schools to construct a larger facility, the parents desired to register their children elsewhere. <em>Id. </em>In 1979, the Newark, Arkansas school district (\u201cNewark district\u201d) permitted Cord-Charlotte, Arkansas residents to attend school in its district. <em>Id. </em>As a result, the plaintiff, the Cord-Charlotte school district (\u201cCord-Charlotte district\u201d), sought an injunction from an Arkansas district court, requesting that the court prohibit the Newark district from accepting its residents for school attendance. <em>Id. </em>at 12-13. While this ease was pending, the parents received permission from the defendant, the Independence County school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>board (\u201ccounty board\u201d), to allow their children to enroll in Newark. <em>Id. </em>at 13. Thereafter, the district court transferred the case to an Arkansas trial court, who affirmed the county board\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>The Cord-Charlotte district appealed to the Arkansas Supreme Court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The Arkansas Supreme Court examined a state statute, which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">From and after the passage of this act (March 3, 1937) no county court (county board of education) shall make an order transferring any school child or children from one (1) district to another until and unless the consent of the Board of Directors of the district to which such child or children are sought to be transferred has been secured in writing, such written consent to be filed in the office of the [cjounty [c'Jlerk or the county from which such child or children are to be transferred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-6\"><em>Id. </em>Predicated on the statute, the Court concluded that each district\u2019s approval was needed to enforce the acceptance of non-resident students in Newark county schools, so the Court affirmed the injunction. <em>See id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In addition to state law, we researched federal law that discussed cross-boundary school enrollment as it relates to the instant case. In <em>Rogowski v. New Hartford Cent. School Dist., </em>730 F.Supp. 1202, 1206 (N.D.N.Y.1990), <em>aff'd </em>914 F.2d 240 (2nd Cir.1990), the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York (\u201cNew York District Court\u201d) determined whether the plaintiff\u2014student had a property right in continuing her education in a non-resident school district. As a result of juvenile delinquency matters, the plaintiff relocated from Utica, New York to New Hartford, New York to reside with a relative. <em>Id. </em>at 1203. During her ninth grade year, the plaintiff enrolled in a New Hartford school, and visited her parents during weekends, school vacations, and throughout the week. <em>Id. </em>At the commencement of her tenth grade year, the school\u2019s faculty challenged the plaintiffs residence. <em>Id. </em>at 1203-04. After several inquiries, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the faculty Informed the plaintiff that her enrollment was terminated because of her \u201cnonresidency\u201d status. <em>Id. </em>at 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The plaintiff filed an action in the trial court, and it issued an order that required the New Hartford school to continue her enrollment until the defendant, the Hartford Education Board (\u201ccounty board\u201d), held a hearing. <em>Id. </em>Despite the plaintiffs submission of exhibits and testimony during the hearing, the county board determined that she was not a resident. <em>Id. </em>Neither party filed for administrative review, but the plaintiff again challenged the county board\u2019s determination in the trial court. <em>Id. </em>The trial court held that the county board\u2019s determination was arbitrary and capricious, and vacated its ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 1204-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the New York District Court, alleging a deprivation of property rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1205. The county board filed a motion for summary judgment, which the New York District Court partially granted. <em>Id. </em>The Court discussed the state statute, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">[A] person over five and under twenty-one years of age who has not received a high school diploma is entitled to attend the public schools maintained in the district in which such person resides without the payment of tuition, [ (citation omitted) ], and that [n]on [Presidents of a district [ ... ] may be admitted into the school or schools of a district [ ... ] upon the consent of the [ ... ] board of education, upon terms prescribed by such [ ... ] board[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1205-06. After analyzing the statute, the Court noted that the plaintiff improperly interpreted New York law because it did not provide her with an unrestricted right to enroll in any New York public school. <em>Id. </em>at 1206. Furthermore, the New York legislature purposefully provided the local education boards with the authority to enforce residency requirements, as well as the power to control the policies relating to the admittance of nonresident students. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court concluded that the plaintiff did not possess a property right to attend school in New Hartford, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>granted the county board\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 1206-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">After analyzing our sister states who have discussed the issue, we acknowledge that Wisconsin, Washington, New York, and Arkansas have either incorporated permissive language by the means of using \u201cmay\u201d into their statutes, and/or required the county education boards\u2019 or school districts\u2019 consent before a non-resident could register for an out-of-county school.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In the instant case, the Allegany Education Board closed one of its schools, and consolidated those students into nearby institutions. It responded to the affected parents\u2019 concerns, so it entered into an agreement with the Washington Education Board, permitting its Little Orleans residents to receive their education at a Washington County school, which was in close proximity to the Little Orleans community. However, after longterm compliance with the agreement, the Allegany Education Board decided to terminate the contract because of a setback concerning budgetary and financial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Appellants contend that because their children were highly impacted by Allegany Education Board\u2019s decision, Education Article \u00a7 4-121 provides that the students have the right to attend a school in closer proximity to their residences. We disagree. As we previously indicated, Education Article \u00a7 4-121 provides that county education boards of the two counties may offer joint maintenance and support, as well as determine the policies regarding cross-boundary school enrollment. As a result of this language, the General Assembly did not require or command that the county boards perform these activities. If the General Assembly wanted to oblige the county boards to enter into arrangements, it would have incorporated mandatory language, such as \u201cshall\u201d or \u201cmust.\u201d Instead, the General Assembly provided the county boards with discretion and authority regarding allowing students to obtain schooling in non-residential educational institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>We do recognize the terrain and roadways in the northwestern part of Maryland may cause some concern regarding travel issues, as appellants allege that \u201cit is anticipated that the Little Orleans students would be bussed for up to one hour and five minutes each way.\u201d However, the Supervisor of Transportation, Jay Walbert, provided a signed affidavit that the express bus ride time from Little Orleans to Fort Hill High School and Washington Middle School in Allegany County was recorded at thirty-five minutes. From Little Orleans to Washington County\u2019s Hancock Middle and High School, the transportation staff recorded a time of twenty-two minutes. Thereby, there was only a thirteen minute difference regarding the transportation between attendance in Allegany County schools and Washington County schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Appellants, similar to the parents in the <em>Pat </em>case, are also concerned that the travel distance and time will affect the students\u2019 participation in after school programs, homework, and studying. However, we note that not every parent chose to permit their children to attend school in Washington County during the impending consolidation. Many opted to send their children to an Allegany County school. Thus, we perceive that transporting the children and having them return home in a timely fashion is plausible. Furthermore, it is not unreasonable to believe that some of those children engage in extracurricular activities and perform their homework assignments. Thus, these concerns regarding driving distance and participation in after school activities are matters that other Allegany County parents confront during any given school day.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We conclude that the Allegany County Board acted in good faith by permitting the tenth to twelfth grade students to continue their education until graduation. We also perceive that Mr. Cox\u2019s correspondence regarding the termination of the decade long agreement was a good faith effort to continuously inform the parents of the termination of the agreement. Although appellants surmise otherwise, it was not unreasonable that Allegany County Public Schools encountered financial setbacks and loss of state revenues with the economical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>issues that our state and country have faced over the past years. Therefore, we agree with the Allegany County Board that \u201cit would be patently unreasonable to conclude that the school choice option should be etched in stone and remain in perpetuity just because one board of education made a decision many years ago to provide school choice under the circumstances that existed at that time. The argument of the [ajppellants does not take into consideration the passage of time and the fact that the local board is now presented with a different set of facts and influences to guide its decision.\u201d Hence, the State Education Board\u2019s conclusion was not contrary to law, arbitrary, or capricious. Accordingly, we affirm its determination, as well as the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ALLEGA-NY COUNTY IS AFFIRMED.
