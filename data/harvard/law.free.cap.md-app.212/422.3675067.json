Space-saver presents four questions for our review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we have consolidated, rephrased and renumbered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">1. Did the trial court err in finding that the Employment Agreement was not an at-will contract, but rather a for-cause lifetime contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">2. Did the trial court err in awarding damages where compensation, in the form of either salary or commissions, was not set in the Employment Agreement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Employment Agreement is neither an at-will contract nor a contract for lifetime employment, and that Adam, under the circumstances of the case, could only be terminated for-cause. We shall affirm the award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">Nineteenth century Russian literary critic Ivan Kireevsky chided that, \u201c[i]n the West, brothers make contracts with brothers.\u201d Harold J. Berman, <em>The Weightier Matters of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>Law, </em>in <em>Solzhenitsyn at Harvard </em>(Ronald Berman ed., Ethics and Public Policy Center 1980). In this case, siblings and half-siblings saw the need to contract with each other, and the result was, in the words of the trial court, \u201ca family fractured by business problems.\u201d This Court is called upon to sort out the essential nature of those contracts, with SpaceSaver arguing that Adam\u2019s employment contract was at-will, and Adam contending that it was a \u201clifetime contract\u201d terminable only for-cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">To be sure, lifetime employment contracts are like exotic, rare birds that have been identified and described in their occasional flights into Maryland, although they have rarely nested in our appellate jurisprudence. Their somewhat illusory nature was expressed by former University of Iowa football coach Hayden Fry when he said: \u201cI thought I had a lifetime contract. Then I found out the other day that if I have a losing season, they\u2019re going to declare me legally dead.\u201d Ray Yasser, <em>A Comprehensive Blueprint for the Reform Of Intercollegiate Athletics, </em>3 Marq. Sports L.J. 123, 148 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The background facts are not in dispute. SpaceSaver is a Washington, D.C. corporation with 53 full or part-time employees. Its corporate office is in Kensington, Maryland. SpaceSaver sells and installs tracked shelving and storage systems for business and governmental organizations with large storage needs. It was formed by Jack and Alice Schmidt in 1973. A Voting Trust Agreement gives each of the Schmidts\u2019 three children, Carla Adam, Amy Hamilton and David Craig,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a 1/3 capital stock interest in the company.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Erik Kloster, a business advisor to SpaceSaver, was the original trustee. He appointed Adam, Hamilton, and Craig as additional trustees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 1995, all three of the Schmidts\u2019 chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>dren were employed by SpaceSaver in executive capacities and served on its board of directors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Controversies among them led to the 2006 drafting of identical (except for name and title) \u201cExecutive Employment Agreements\u201d for each of the Schmidts\u2019 three children, along with a \u201cStock Purchase Agreement.\u201d These documents were drafted by Albert Ellentuck, Spacesaver\u2019s corporate attorney.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">At issue in this case is Adam\u2019s Employment Agreement, which she signed as the \u201cEmployee\u201d and which Craig signed as the \u201cPresident\u201d on behalf of SpaceSaver. It includes the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">\u2022 Section 2.1 (\u201cCompensation and Benefits: Base Salary\u201d):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ath\">Employee shall be paid an annual base salary in an amount specified on Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof.... <footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> Any increases or decreases in Employee\u2019s Base Salary for years beyond the first year of Employee\u2019s employment shall be reflected on an amended Exhibit A, and shall be in the sole discretion of Company management, and nothing herein shall be deemed to require any such change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">\u2022 Section 3 (\u201cDuties and Performance\u201d):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">The Employee acknowledges and agrees that she is being offered a position of employment by the Company with the understanding that the Employee possesses a unique set of skills, abilities, and experiences which will benefit the Company, and she agrees that her continued employment with the Company, whether during the term of this Employment Agreement or there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>after, is contingent upon her successful performance of her duties as noted above, or in such other position to which she may be assigned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">Section 3.2 (\u201cSpecific Duties\u201d):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">The employee shall have the title of Managing Director, and shall have the following duties:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">1) Create and manage a well balanced executive management team to ensure long term success and provide the ability for planning, organizing, control and leadership.

The employee may terminate her employment at any time during the course of this agreement by giving three (3) months notice in writing to the President of Company....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">4.2 Termination by the Company For Cause. The Company may, at any time and without notice, terminate the Employee for \u201ccause.\u201d Termination by the Company of the Employee for \u201ccause\u201d shall include but not be limited to termination based on any of the following grounds: (a) insubordination or refusal to perform duties of employee\u2019s position as directed by the President of Company and affirmed by a majority of the Directors; (b) fraud, misappropriation, embezzlement or acts of similar dishonesty; (c) conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude; (d) illegal use of drugs or excessive use of alcohol in the workplace; (e) intentional and willful misconduct that may subject the Company to criminal or civil liability; (f) breach of the Employee\u2019s duty of loyalty, including the diversion or usurpation of corporate opportunities properly belonging to the Company; (g) willful disregard of Company policies and procedures; (h) material breach of any of the terms herein; and (i) material nonperformance or negligence in Employee\u2019s performance of her duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">4.3 Termination by Death or Disability. The Employee\u2019s employment and rights to compensation under this Employment Agreement shall terminate if the Employee is unable to perform the duties of her position due to death, or disability as defined above....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">\u2022 Section 6 of the Employment Agreement includes non-compete and non-solicitations clauses during and for two years after employment with SpaceSaver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">\u2022 And, section 8.2 (\u201cGeneral Provisions: Amendments and Termination: Entire Agreement\u201d): \u201c[t]his Agreement may not be amended or terminated except by a writing executed by all of the parties hereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Article 4 (\u201cOption to Purchase Shares\u201d) of the Stock Purchase Agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>In the event any of the Shareholders has committed any Prohibited Act (as defined below) in relation to the Company (\u201cDesignated Shareholder\u201d), the other Shareholders may elect to purchase all or a portion of the shares of the Designated Shareholder.... A prohibited Act is defined for these purposes as one or more of the following: (1) fraud, misappropriation, embezzlement or acts of similar dishonesty; (2) conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude; (3) illegal use of drugs or excessive use of alcohol in the workplace; (4) intentional and willful misconduct that may subject the Company to criminal or civil liability; (5) breach of duty of loyalty, including the diversion or usurpation of corporate opportunities properly belonging to the Company, (6) willful disregard of Company policies and procedures; (7) material breach of any of the terms herein, and (8) termination for whatever reason of said Shareholder\u2019s employment with the Corporation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The Stock Purchase Agreement also includes provisions for the sale of stock upon the death or disability of a shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Craig resigned as President of SpaceSaver and as a director on January 19, 2007. On March 28, 2008, he sold half of his SpaceSaver stock to Adam, and the other half to Hamilton.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>In February 2009, the board elected Hamilton as President and Chief Executive Officer of SpaceSaver, and Adam as Secretary and Treasurer. Adam\u2019s Employment Agreement also lists her title as Managing Director of SpaceSaver\u2014 reporting to the President\u2014while her amended complaint states that she is also Vice President of Special Projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Subsequently, a bitter dispute arose between Adam and Hamilton regarding their compensation, roles, and responsibilities within the company. On April 12, 2009, Hamilton sent a letter to Adam which:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">\u2022 indicated that, at a February 20, 2009 meeting, the board had elected to remove Adam from her sales responsibilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">\u2022 stated that Adam\u2019s \u201cduties and authority as Secretary and Treasurer ... are limited to the authority spelled out in the By-laws,\u201d and that Hamilton had assigned Adam \u201cno other duties\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">\u2022 warned Adam that if she \u201cfail[ed] to follow\u201d these \u201cdirectives,\u201d Hamilton would \u201cseek to have the Board reduce [her] compensation by 50%,\u201d or \u201cseek to have [her] terminated <em>for cause </em>as an employee of SpaceSaver----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az2\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">On May 22, 2009, Adam wrote Hamilton claiming that, because Hamilton had committed various \u201cProhibited Acts\u201d under the Stock Purchase Agreement\u2014including the \u201cmisappropriation of funds,\u201d \u201cbreach of duty of loyalty,\u201d and \u201cwillful disregard of Company policies and procedures\u201d\u2014Adam was \u201cexercising [her] right\u201d under article 4 of the Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire Hamilton\u2019s SpaceSaver stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">On May 28, 2009, Hamilton wrote Adam denying Adam\u2019s assertions, alleging that Adam had committed these \u201csame actions,\u201d and indicating her intent to acquire Adam\u2019s Space-saver stock. The letter concluded: \u201cplease be advised that your employment by the Company is hereby terminated---Such termination of your employment also constitutes a prohibited act by you under article 4 of the Stock Purchase Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>In June 2009, Adam brought legal action in a suit that resulted in an agreement whereby Adam received, based on her salary immediately preceding Hamilton\u2019s May 28, 2009 letter, $10,000 per month in compensation from SpaceSaver.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">On January 28, 2010, Hamilton wrote to Adam that \u201cSpace-saver ... has made the decision to end your employment,\u201d and SpaceSaver stopped paying Adam. On August 6, 2010, Hamilton wrote Adam \u201cin regard to\u201d the January 28, 2010 letter and any legal action potentially taken by Adam:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atq\">in the event it should be determined that your termination was invalid and that you are still an employee of the Company, please be advised that as an employee your salary was presumptively reduced to zero as of the date of termination and continues to be at such zero amount, pursuant to the authority of [the] employment agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Adam filed a complaint on April 9, 2010 against SpaceSaver and Hamilton in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, and, on July 30, 2010, she filed an amended complaint. Count I (\u201cBreach of Contract\u201d) of the amended complaint alleges that Adam was terminated from SpaceSaver without cause<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in violation of the Employment Agreement and requests $450,000 in compensatory damages based on \u201clost salary, wages, com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>missions and benefits\u201d in addition to the rehiring of Adam, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, \u201c[a]nd for such other and further relief as the Court may deem appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">On June 27, 2011, Adam filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment contending that section 4 of the Employment Agreement established that she could only be terminated for-cause, and that section 8.2 of the Employment Agreement \u201cmakes clear that the term of employment is her life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">SpaceSaver filed an Opposition to Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment in which, pointing to section 3 of the Employment Agreement, it denied that it guaranteed Adam lifetime employment, but that, even had it done so, the Employment Agreement lacked the \u201cadditional consideration\u201d necessary for a lifetime employment contract. SpaceSaver also denied, pointing to the word \u201cmay\u201d in section 4.2, that it was restricted to terminating Adam for-cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">At a hearing on the motions for summary judgment, the parties, although disagreeing to its meaning, agreed that: (1) the Employment Agreement was \u201cunambiguous,\u201d (2) there were no material disputes of fact, and (3) the sole question before the court was whether the Employment Agreement was at-will or for-cause. Both motions for summary judgment were denied. In disagreeing that the Employment Agreement was \u201cunambiguous,\u201d the motions court pointed out that \u201ca contract such as this which is silent as to the term [or duration] of the employment relationship is presumed to establish an at-will relationship, terminable for any reason or no reason at all,\u201d which conflicted with the for-cause language of the Employment Agreement. The court stated that \u201cextrinsic evidence\u201d was necessary in order to discern the intent of the parties to the Employment Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">After a three day trial, the trial court,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> referring to the testimony of Craig and Adam regarding their intentions as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>signers of the Employment Agreement,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> found that the Employment Agreement \u201cmodified\u201d what had been formerly an \u201cat-will relationship\u201d so as to make it a \u201clifetime contract\u201d and that Adam could only be unilaterally terminated for cause, death, or disability. According to the court, the for-cause provision would be superfluous if the Employment Agreement was at-will: \u201cwhy in the world would you have to worry about [cause] if you had an at-will contract?\u201d Finding a \u201cclear breach\u201d of the Employment Agreement, the court awarded Adam $255,868.20 in damages from the date of her termination through the date of trial\u2014$198,000 from wages ($10,000 per month in salary x 16.5 months) and $57,868.20 in commissions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A judgment was entered in favor of Adam in the amount of $255,868.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Under Rule 8-131(c), we review the judgment of the trial court \u201con the evidence\u201d following a bench trial under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. But, \u201c[t]he interpretation of a written contract is a legal question subject to <em>de novo </em>review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>by the appellate courts.\u201d <em>Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 447, 727 A.2d 358 (1999). The Court of Appeals has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANh\">Maryland courts follow the law of objective interpretation of contracts, giving effect to the clear terms of the contract regardless of what the parties to the contract may have believed those terms to mean:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">\u201c[A court is to] determine from the language of the agreement itself what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have meant at the time it was effectuated. In addition, when the language of the contract is plain and unambiguous there is no room for construction, and a court must presume that the parties meant what they expressed. In these circumstances, the true test of what is meant is not what the parties to the contract intended it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant. Consequently, the clear and unambiguous language of an agreement will not give away to what the parties thought that the agreement meant or intended it to mean.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><em>Towson Univ. v. Conte, </em>384 Md. 68, 78, 862 A.2d 941 (2004) (quoting <em>Calomiris, 353 </em>Md. at 436, 727 A.2d 358).

Lifetime employment, <em>if </em>binding the employee, may impact his \u201cchances of improving his condition,\u201d <em>Pitcher v. United Oil &amp; Gas Syndicate, </em>174 La. 66, 139 So. 760, 761 (1932), and prevent him from \u201cquitting] at any time without being liable for breach of contract damages[.]\u201d <em>Lubore v.

On the other hand, binding the employer to \u201cprovide a job for so long as the employee wishes to continue\u201d without \u201cimposing a] corresponding obligation upon the employee,\u201d Williston &amp; Lord, \u00a7 54:39, is a \u201cheavy burden to place upon an employer\u2019s shoulders.\u201d <em>Greene v. Oliver Realty, Inc., </em>363 Pa.Super. 534, 555, 526 A.2d 1192 (1987). A lifetime employment contract for a high level employee, moreover, is \u201cgenerally inconsistent with corporate law because such a contract denigrates the legal rights of stockholders to change the management of a corporation.\u201d Mazaroff &amp; Horn, \u00a7 3.02[5]; <em>see Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel.

If corporate officers could enter into contracts giving persons of their selection employment for life, the directors might be deprived of their authority.\u201d). Here, of course, employees under the Employment Agreements were the beneficial holders of all the stock and directors of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">According to Williston &amp; Lord, a lifetime employment contract would ordinarily also require \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cadditional\u201d consideration to be valid, \u00a7 54:39, such as \u201cwhere the employee affords the employer a substantial benefit other than the services that the employee was hired to perform, or where the employee undergoes substantial additional hardship other than the services that he or she was hired to perform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 54:40; <em>see also </em>60 A.L.R.3d 226, \u00a7 2a (\u201c[M]any courts take the position that a contract of employment purporting to be permanent in nature or for life is valid and enforceable when it is supported by consideration additional to services.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have not decided that a contract for lifetime employment is valid if supported by additional consideration. <em>See Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co., </em>198 Md. at 533, 84 A.2d 870 (\u201cWe assume, without deciding, that where an employee has given consideration in addition to the services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>incident to the employment, a contract for permanent or life employment is valid....\u201d). Nor have they decided exactly what additional consideration might suffice. <em>See id. </em>at 533, 84 A.2d 870 (\u201cthe mere giving up of a job, business or profession by one who decides to accept a contract for alleged life employment\u201d would not suffice); <em>Pullman Co. v.

Thus, we affirm in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>part and reverse in-part the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the Employment Agreement.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\n<em>Damages: Salary &amp; Commission</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">SpaceSaver alleges: (1) the trial court erred in awarding damages based on a $120,000 per year salary where the Employment Agreement \u201ccontains no salary provision,\u201d and \u201cthe record below contains no evidence that the parties ever agreed to a salary for Adam,\u201d and thus \u201cthe trial court stated no legally cognizable basis to award damages\u201d; and (2) the trial court erred in awarding commissions where Adam \u201csued <em>only </em>on the\u201d Employment Agreement, \u201cwhich does not provide any right to commissions.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Adam, pointing to the testimony of Ellentuck that the parties agreed upon a salary of $120,000, states that \u201c[t]he record negates [Spacesaver\u2019s] contention\u201d that there was <em>\u201cno evidence </em>to support the trial court\u2019s finding of an agreement between the parties as to ... an annual salary for [Adam] of $120,000 per year.\u201d In further response, she refers us to the amended complaint, which states that she is seeking compensatory damages based on \u201clost salary, wages, <em>commissions </em>and benefits.\u201d (Emphasis added).

On appeal, SpaceSaver does not argue, as it did in its Opposition to Motion for Partial Summary Judgment And Cross-Motion For Summary Judgment and during the motions hearing, that the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in section 4.2 of the Employment Agreement (\"The Company may, at any time and without notice, terminate the Employee for \u2018cause.\u2019 \u201d) did not restrict SpaceSaver to terminating Adam for-cause.

SpaceSaver also contends that the motions court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment because the Employment Agreement clearly does not \u201cprovide for lifetime employment,\u201d and thus it cannot be a for-cause contract. Ultimately, this focuses on the same issue as Adam\u2019s other primary appeal point: was the Employment Agreement a for-cause contract?
