Wash. State Plumbing and Pipefitting Indus. Pension Plan, </em>433 F.3d 1091 (9th Cir.2006). In this case of first impression, we are asked to resolve contentions relating to the entry of a domestic relations order and the existence of an equitable remedy in the form of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>constructive trust when a party to a divorce fails to obtain a qualified domestic relations order prior to the pre-retirement death of a former spouse, when that former spouse remarries and\u2014prior to pre-retirement death\u2014designates his or her surviving spouse as sole beneficiary of his/her pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Lori A. Robinette, appellant, appeals from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Frederick County granting summary judgment and awarding a constructive trust and partial pension benefits to her deceased husband\u2019s former spouse, Luan Hunsecker, appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">On appeal, appellant presents two questions for our review: <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">I. Did the circuit court err by entering an order for the alienation of pension benefits after the death of the plan participant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">II. Did the circuit court err by creating a constructive trust to alienate pension benefits after the death of the plan participant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">For the reasons outlined below, we answer both questions in the negative, and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">The essential facts pertinent to this appeal are undisputed. On June 6, 1981, appellee, Luan Hunsecker (\u201cMs.Hunsecker\u201d), was married to the decedent, Roger Robinette (\u201cMr.Robinette\u201d). During their marriage, Mr. Robinette was employed by Montgomery County Public Schools (\u201cMCPS\u201d) and a par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>ticipant in its pension plan. After nearly seventeen years of marriage, Ms. Hunseeker and Mr. Robinette executed a voluntary separation agreement on April 16, 1998. Pursuant to that agreement, Ms. Hunseeker transferred and assigned all her rights, title, and interest in the marital home, with the proviso that the proceeds of any sale would be the \u201csole and exclusive property\u201d of Mr. Robinette. In addition, Ms. Hunsecker further conveyed all her rights, title, and interest in a boat and trailer the couple owned, and she released and discharged any claims for <em>pendente lite </em>and indefinite alimony. Following their agreement, a judgment of divorce was entered by the Circuit Court for Frederick County, Maryland, providing that the terms of the voluntary separation agreement would be incorporated, but not merged, into the judgment of absolute divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Most notably, paragraph eight of the separation agreement provided that the judgment of divorce, issued on August 3, 1998, would serve as a qualified domestic relations order (\u201cQDRO\u201d) in the pension benefits and death (\u201csurviving spouse\u201d) benefits provided to Mr. Robinette through his employ with MCPS.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the provision stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\"><em>PENSION: </em>[Mr. Robinette] is a participant in a pension plan through his employment with [MCPS]. The parties agree that [Ms. Hunseeker] shall be the alternate payee of the aforesaid pension and that the parties\u2019 judgment of divorce shall be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as defined by the Retirement Equity Act of 1984, as from time to time amended. [Ms. Hunsecker\u2019s] equitable interest in [Mr. Robinette\u2019s] pension is hereby declared to be fifty percent (50%) of the \u201cmarital share\u201d of said pension benefit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the marital share being that fraction of the benefit whose numerator shall be the number of months of the parties\u2019 marriage during which the benefits were accumulated, which number shall be determined as of the date of this Agreement, and whose denominator shall be the total number of months during which the benefits were accumulated prior to the time when payment of such benefits shall commence. [Ms. Hunsecker] shall receive fifty percent (50%) of the aforesaid marital share of any benefits made from the pension to [Mr. Robinette], including any death benefits if, as and when such payments are made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">(emphasis in original). This provision, however, was never enrolled in a QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">After their divorce, Mr. Robinette continued working for MCPS. He remarried on June 25, 2000, to Lori A. Robinette (\u201cMs.Robinette\u201d). Throughout their nine years of marriage, Mr. Robinette continued working for MCPS until his untimely death on October 2, 2009. Ms. Robinette was named as the personal representative of Mr. Robinette\u2019s small estate, which she administered without publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Upon learning of Mr. Robinette\u2019s passing, Ms. Hunsecker attempted to obtain a portion of the pension benefits from MCPS on May 12, 2010, pursuant to the separation agreement that she had entered eleven years earlier. Her efforts proved unsuccessful because MCPS had never received a QDRO to indicate Ms. Hunsecker as the partial beneficiary of Mr. Robinette\u2019s pension benefits. Mr. Robinette had named Ms. Robinette the beneficiary of record with MCPS on September 2, 2008. As a consequence, Ms. Hunsecker was denied any portion of the pension benefits, and she was apprised that Mr. Robinette\u2019s pension was being paid to Ms. Robinette.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Thereafter, Ms. Hunsecker instituted a cause of action in the Circuit Court for Frederick County, Maryland, against Ms. Robinette on January 20, 2011, seeking the establishment of a constructive trust on grounds of Ms. Robinette\u2019s unjust enrichment. The parties filed a joint stipulation of facts on October 14, 2011. On that same day, Ms. Hunsecker addition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ally moved for summary judgment, arguing that she had a superior equitable title to Mr. Robinette\u2019s pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Ms. Robinette responded in opposition on November 3, 2011, filing her own motion for summary judgment, arguing three points. First, Ms. Robinette attested that Ms. Hunsecker had failed to obtain a QDRO prior to Mr. Robinette\u2019s death, and, as a consequence was precluded from asserting any interest to Mr. Robinette\u2019s pension pursuant to Title I of ERISA. Second, she argued that Ms. Hunsecker\u2019s claim of unjust enrichment was inapplicable because the parties \u201chave no privity whatsoever, whether contractual or quasi-contractual.\u201d Third, Ms. Robinette argued that the creation of a constructive trust was an improper method of acquisition of Mr. Robinette\u2019s pension and that she maintained higher equitable call.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">After hearing argument of counsel on November 17, 2011, and taking each parties\u2019 motions <em>sub curia, </em>the circuit court entered summary judgment in favor of Ms. Hunsecker on January 4, 2012, granting her a constructive trust in a portion of Mr. Robinette\u2019s pension and death benefits and further ordered the issuance of a posthumous QDRO, consistent with the separation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Ms. Robinette subsequently noted her timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Md. Rule 2\u2014501(f) provides that a trial court \u201cshall enter [summary] judgment in favor or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d We review a trial court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>by conducting our own independent review of the record and deciding the same legal issues as the trial court. <em>Haas v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>396 Md. 469, 478-79, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>914 A.2d 735 (2007). When, as in this case, there are no disputed facts related to the trial court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment, our only task is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s decision was legally correct. <em>Id. </em>at 479, 914 A.2d 735. <em>See also Gonsalves v. Bingel, </em>194 Md.App. 695, 708, 5 A.3d 768 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">(A) Did the Circuit Court Err by Entering a Domestic Relations Order for the Alienation of Pension Benefits After the Death of the Plan Participant?</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Ms. Robinette first contends that the circuit court erred by entering a domestic relations order for the alienation of pension benefits that had already vested in the pre-retirement pension plan participant\u2019s designee upon the death of the pension plan\u2019s participant. In response, Ms. Hunsecker argues that \u201c[t]he [cjourt could ... enter a QDRO since Mr. Robinette was a participant in the MCPS Retirement Plan, a governmental retirement plan that is exempt from the provisions of \u2018ERISA.\u2019 \u201d We find Ms. Hunsecker\u2019s argument more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">In considering Ms. Robinette\u2019s first assignment of error, we preliminarily begin with an overview of the applicability\u2014or, in this case, the inapplicability\u2014of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>(1999) (\u201cERISA\u201d), to pension plans. <em>See, e.g., Potts v. Potts, </em>142 Md.App. 448, 454-55, 790 A.2d 703 (2002). ERISA was first enacted in 1974 in order to remedy long-standing abuses and deficiencies in the private pension system. <em>See generally </em>H.R.Rep. No. 533, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in, </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4639. <em>See also </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>\u201cThese deficiencies included inadequate vesting provisions, insufficient assets to assure payment of future benefit obligations, and premature termination of under-funded benefit plans.\u201d <em>Rose v. Long Island R.R. Pension Plan, </em>828 F.2d 910, 913 (2d Cir.1987) (citations omitted). Thus, ERISA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>purpose is to \u201cto provide better protection for beneficiaries of employee pension and welfare benefit plans abounding in the private workplace.\u201d <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 30, 566 A.2d 767 (1989) (discussing the history and intent of ERISA) (emphasis added), <em>quoted in Eller v. Bolton, </em>168 Md.App. 96, 106-107, 895 A.2d 382 (2006). <em>See also </em>Albert Feuer, <em>WHO IS ENTITLED TO SURVIVOR BENEFITS FROM ERISA PLANS?, </em>40 J. Marshall L.Rev. 919, 923 (2007) (\u201cERISA was a response to the protests on behalf of many employees and their beneficiaries who had been deprived of anticipated pension and welfare benefits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">ERISA is comprised of four titles. Title I of ERISA, 29 U.S.C., \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>contains various substantive and procedural requirements with which covered plans must comply. These include standards for vesting, funding and fiduciary responsibility as well as the survivorship provisions and anti-alienation provisions under which Ms. Robinette <em>initially </em>claimed as her sole right to Mr. Robinette\u2019s pension and death benefits. Title II of ERISA is codified in the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq., </em>and contains requirements pertaining to the qualifications of pension plans for favorable tax treatment. Title III, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 et seq., establishes ERISA\u2019s administrative and enforcement provisions. Title IV, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301 et seq., contains the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\u201cPBGC\u201d), guaranteeing the payments of benefits by plans which terminate with insufficient assets to pay those benefits to their participants and designees.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Under Title I, it is well settled that a core ERISA concern is the \u201cERISA command\u201d that pension plans subject to ERISA\u2019s provisions make payments to the beneficiary who is \u201cdesignated by a participant or by the terms of [the] plan.\u201d <em>Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, </em>532 U.S. 141, 147, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264 (2001); <em>Morales v. Trans World Airlines Inc., </em>504 U.S. 374, 383, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992). <em>See Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 30, 566 A.2d 767; <em>Eller, </em>168 Md.App. at 106-07, 895 A.2d 382. In fact, ERISA \u00a7 205, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055\u2014the spousal survivor provision\u2014mandates that pension benefit plans provide spouses with specified survivor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>benefits. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1055(b)(1)(A). Thus, such benefits and benefit designations must be part of all covered ERISAgoverned pension plans. <em>See id. See also </em>Feuer, <em>supra, </em>40 J. Marshall L.Rev. at 655. In addition, Section 1055 provides two specific avenues through which surviving spouses may attain a portion of the participants\u2019 pension benefits. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1055(d) &amp; (e).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These two avenues depend on the status of the participant before the date on which the annuity begins. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1055(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Specifically, \u201cin the case of a vested participant who does not die before the annuity starting date, the accrued benefit payable to such participant shall be provided in the form of a qualified joint and survivor annuity[.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ]\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1055(a)(1). In the alternative, if \u201ca vested participant ... dies before the annuity starting date and ... has a surviving spouse, a qualified preretirement survivor annuity<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> shall be provided to the surviving spouse of such participant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1055(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>To be sure, a participant\u2019s former spouse <em>may </em>be treated as a beneficiary under the plan and additionally regarded as a surviving spouse, eligible to receive surviving spouse benefits. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055(f)(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nonetheless, this designation can <em>only </em>occur when no conflict of law arises between a State\u2019s domestic relations law and ERISA\u2019s preemption clause or general anti-alienation provision. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a) (stating that ERISA \u201cshall supercede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\u201d); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1) (providing that \u201c[e]ach pension plan shall provide that benefits] under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\u201d). To clarify the intersection of state domestic relations law with ERISA, and the potential conflict arising between these laws, Congress amended ERISA in 1984 through its enactment of the Retirement Equity Act (P.L. 98-397, 98 Stat. 1433) (\u201cREA\u201d) to improve the delivery of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\">... retirement benefits and provide for greater equity under private pension plans for workers and their spouses and dependents by taking into account changes in work patterns, the status of marriage as an economic partnership, and the substantial contribution to that partnership of spouses who work both in and outside the home, and for other purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Pub.L. No. 98-397; 98 Stat. 1426 (1984) (emphasis added). As a result, the REA provides the requisite clarification that state-court-ordered assignments of plan benefits to former spouses and dependents were permitted. <em>Tr. of Dr. Guild of America-Producer Pension Benefits Plans v. Tise, </em>234 F.3d 415, 419 (9th Cir.2000) (citing Senate Judiciary Committee, S.Rep. No. 98-575 at 1 (1984), 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2547) (other citations omitted); <em>Rivers v. Central and South West Corp., </em>186 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.1999) (noting that the REA amended ERISA\u2019s marriage requirements to resolve contentions among the courts with regard to the application of the former surviving spouse provisions); <em>Eller, </em>168 Md.App. at 107, 895 A.2d 382; <em>Potts, </em>142 Md.App. at 455-56, 790 A.2d 703 (citations omitted). Nevertheless, REA\u2019s amendments to ERISA explicitly provide that the former spouse of the plan participant can only replace the participant\u2019s current spouse and be treated by the private pension plan as the surviving spouse pursuant to a QDRO. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(F).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Hopkins v. AT &amp; T Global Information Solutions Co., </em>105 F.3d 153, 155 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">A qualified domestic relations order, or QDRO, is a subset of domestic relations orders<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that recognize the right of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>alternate payee to receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a pension plan\u2019s participant under the respective pension plan. <em>Eller, </em>168 Md.App. at 107 (relying on 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(i)(I)). Section 1056(d) of ERISA sets the parameters by which a domestic relations order (\u201cDRO\u201d) would be deemed \u201cqualified,\u201d specifically providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA\">(C) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of [a QDRO] only if such order clearly specifies\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">(i) the name and last known mailing address (if any) of the participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">(ii) the amount or percentage of the participant\u2019s benefits to be paid by the plan to each such alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">(iii) the number of payments or period to which such order applies and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">(iv) each plan to which such order applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-9\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1056(d)(3)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">Section 1056(d)(3)(D) prohibits qualification of a domestic relations order that \u201crequirefs] a plan to provide any type or form of benefit ... not otherwise provided under the plan,\u201d \u201crequire[s] the plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value),\u201d or \u201crequire[s] the payment of benefits to an alternate payee which [is] required to be paid to another alternate payee under another order previously determined to be a [QDRO].\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(D) <em>et seq. </em>Admittedly, Maryland has not previously addressed the meaning of this section within the context of an alternate payee seeking a participant\u2019s pre-retirement death benefits posthumously. <em>But see Eller, </em>168 Md.App. at 132-33, 895 A.2d 382 (concluding that \u201c[b]ecause a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>amendment of the QDRO relates back to the time prior to the [former spouse\u2019s] death ... [the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>amendment of the QDRO] will not fail for naming [former spouse] as the alternate payee, even though she is now deceased[,]\u201d as a method to provide benefits to the former spouse\u2019s estate). Like <em>Eller, </em>however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>we turn our attention to the United States Circuit Courts of Appeal to engage in a discussion of some key cases to determine the permissibility of posthumous QDROs. <em>See, e.g., Eller, </em>168 Md.App. at 119, 895 A.2d 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit first considered the permissibility of posthumously issued QDROs in <em>Samaroo v. Samaroo, </em>193 F.3d 185 (3d Cir.1999). There, Louise Robichaud-Samaroo (Ms. Robichaud) sought to obtain the pension benefits of her former and deceased husband, Winston Samaroo, relying on a property settlement agreement that had been incorporated into the parties divorce decree. <em>Id. </em>at 186-87. The agreement specifically provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">(d) Pensions, Profit Sharing and Bell System Savings Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">Savings Plan\u2014(1) Husband has a vested pension having a present value, if husband were to retire at this time, of $1,358.59 per month. At the time of husband\u2019s retirement and receipt of his pension he agrees to pay to wife one half of said monthly amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 187 (quoting the joint property agreement of the Samaroos). Neither the decree nor the property settlement agreement, however, mentioned any right of Ms. Robichaud to Mr. Samaroo\u2019s survivor\u2019s annuity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Thereafter, Mr. Samaroo died while still actively employed by AT &amp; T. <em>Id. </em>Admittedly and at the time of his death, Mr. Samaroo did maintain a management pension plan with AT &amp; T. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, because Mr. Samaroo did not live to an age where he would qualify to receive pension payments, there were no pension payments that ever became payable to him. <em>Id. </em>As a consequence, \u201cthe benefit expressly mentioned in the divorce settlement agreement never came to fruition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plan, however, did provide a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (\u201cQPSA\u201d),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which would have been available to the surviving spouse of any plan participant who passed after vesting but before retiring. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>As a result, Ms. Robichaud sought to obtain the QPSA benefits from the plan. <em>Id. </em>The plan, however, denied her claim for the QPSA because the divorce decree made no mention of any entitlement to such right, and \u201cin the absence of a surviving spouse or a QDRO designating a former spouse as such, there was simply no [QPSA] payable in respect of Samaroo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, Ms. Robichaud brought a civil action against the plan in New Jersey Superior Court, Chancery Division, to amend the final judgment of divorce <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to convey her a right to fifty percent of the QPSA. <em>Id. </em>at 188. The plan removed the action to federal court and filed a counter-claim, seeking declaratory relief. <em>Id. </em>The federal District Court remanded the portion of the removed case that involved the terms of the divorce, but retained jurisdiction of Ms. Robichaud\u2019s claim against the Plan for the retirement benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Notwithstanding Ms. Robichaud\u2019s testimony that \u201cneither Winston ... [n]or [she] thought about the survivor rights to th[e] pension,\u201d the New Jersey state court held that the Plan did not have standing to object to alteration of the divorce decree. <em>Id. </em>It noted that \u201cWinston Samaroo\u2019s estate did not oppose Robichaud\u2019s request to amend the decree <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>since conveying the survivorship rights once Samaroo was dead did not cost the estate anything, but undid the effect of Samaroo dying without a survivor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Following the state court\u2019s ruling, Ms. Robichaud and the Plan filed cross-motions for summary judgment in the federal District Court, requesting an examination of the statutory requirements for a QDRO under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(C) and (D). <em>Id. </em>189. The District Court found that the amended divorce order satisfied the specificity requirements of section 1056(d)(3)(C), but not the substantive requirements of section 1056(d)(3)(D). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">On appeal, the Third Circuit concluded that the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>domestic relations order did not qualify as a QDRO if it required the plan to provide any type of benefits not otherwise provided by the plan or to provide increased benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Subsequent to the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Samaroo, </em>the United States Circuit Court for the Ninth Circuit was met with a similar inquiry in <em>Tr. of Directors Guild of America-Producer Pension Benefits Plans v. Tise, </em>234 F.3d 415 (9th Cir.2000). There, Yvonne Curry (\u201cMs.Curry\u201d), the designated beneficiary of the pension plan of her deceased, domestic partner, Charles Myers (\u201cMr.Myers\u201d), appealed the District Court\u2019s summary judgment distributing the majority of Mr. Myers\u2019 plan proceeds to the mother of his children Suzanne Tise (\u201cMs.Tise\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 417. Before Mr. Myers\u2019 death in 1995, three parties had emerged to assert competing claims regarding the proceeds of his pension plan: Ms. Curry, his designated beneficiary; Ms. Tise, who had obtained state-court child support orders; and the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The basis of Ms. Tise\u2019s claim was premised on Mr. Myers\u2019 dereliction of the child support orders she had obtained for the two children born out of their relationship in 1981. <em>Id. </em>As a result of Mr. Myers\u2019 dereliction, Ms. Tise returned to the state court, to secure an order to show cause barring the Myers\u2019 pension plan from disbursing any proceeds from Myers\u2019 pension plan. <em>Id. </em>Although the order did not name the Myers\u2019 plan, the plan received a copy of the order in December of that year. <em>Id. </em>at 418. Shortly thereafter, the plan received an additional notice of levy from the IRS. <em>Id. </em>Met with two claims to Mr. Myers\u2019 pension, the plan notified Ms. Tise that Mr. Myer\u2019s pension was to become payable soon and that other parties were asserting entitlements to the plan proceeds. <em>Id. </em>In this notice, the plan asked Ms. Tise if it was her intention to obtain a QDRO pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In response, Ms. Tise immediately returned to the state court to obtain a writ of execution against the plan for the amount Mr. Myers\u2019 still owed in child support pursuant to the original 1981 judgment. <em>Id. </em>The state court ordered a writ of execution to issue, and in December 1994, Ms. Tise secured an order alleging that the plan had failed to comply with the writ of execution and enjoining the plan from distributing Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Myers\u2019 plan proceeds until a QDRO could be obtained. <em>Id. </em>Unfortunately, Ms. Tise suffered a minor setback when the state court subsequently concluded that the plan had not been properly joined in the proceedings against Mr. Myers. <em>Id. </em>Following this ruling, she took steps to join the plan to the proceedings and moved for an order declaring her entitled to a QDRO on March 30,1995. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Meanwhile, Mr. Myers died on February 12, 1995. <em>Id. </em>According to the terms of his pension plan, all death benefits would be received by his designated beneficiary, Ms. Curry, who he had appointed only two months prior to his death. <em>Id. </em>Now faced with three claims, the pension plan filed an inter-pleader complaint in the United States District Court. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Tise moved for a stay of the interpleader action while she returned to the state court to secure a QDRO, which was granted by the District Court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Ms. Tise secured a QDRO from the state court, styled \u201cOrder re: QDRO for Child Support Arrears, Interest Accrued, Thereon and Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs Relating to Enforcement of Child Support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419. The state court determined that Ms. Tise was entitled to $326,438.85 in child support and attorneys\u2019 fees and issued an order <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to the order of October 11, 1991. <em>Id. </em>at 419. Thereafter, Ms. Tise presented her order to the District Court, which reallocated the proceeds of Mr. Myers\u2019 pension. As a result, both Ms. Curry and Mr. Myers\u2019 plan appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">On appeal, the Ninth Circuit commenced its discussion with an overview of ERISA as amended by the REA, which resulted in the court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cbecause a QDRO only renders enforceable an already-existing interest, there is no conceptual reason why a QDRO must be obtained before the plan participant\u2019s benefits become payable on account of his retirement or death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419-20. Thus, the court reasoned the several features of ERISA \u201cerect no such requirement,\u201d for the potential alternate payee. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>First, </em>for all the detail of the QDRO requirements, ERISA nowhere specifies that a QDRO must be in hand before benefits become payable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\"><em>Second </em>and more significantly, the statute specifically provides for situations in which no valid QDRO issues until after benefits become payable. Once the pension plan is on notice that a domestic relations order has issued that may be a QDRO, the plan may take a reasonable period to determine whether the order is a QDRO and therefore creates obligations for the pension plan. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(G)(ii). While the plan is making this determination, it must segregate the benefits that would be due to the alternate payee under the terms of the DRO during the first 18 months that those benefits would be payable if the DRO is ultimately deemed a QDRO. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(H)(v). This benefit-segregation requirement obviously assumes that benefits may already be payable during the period the plan is determining whether the DRO is a QDRO.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">Third, Congress expressly contemplated that further state court proceedings might ensue during the 18-month QDRO determination period, through which the alternate payee could attempt to cure any defects in the original DRO and obtain an enforceable QDRO. There is no reason it should take any plan administrator 18 months to puzzle over the domestic relations order initially presented to the plan in order to determine whether it is a QDRO, and Congress did not intend to sanction such administrative lassitude. Rather, the evident purpose of the 18-month period was to provide a time in which any defect in the original DRO could be cured. The statute therefore provides that the alternate payee may, within the 18-month period, present the plan administrator in lieu of the original court order, with a \u201cmodification thereof.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(H)(ii). If the plan administrator determines before the expiration of the 18-month fund segregation period that the modified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>court order is a valid QDRO, the alternate payee is entitled to payment of benefits. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\"><em>Fourth, </em>the statute also specifies with particularity the circumstances in which the putative alternate payee loses the right to hold up the payment of benefits to the participant or his designated beneficiary. After the 18 months have elapsed, if the DRO\u2019s status is still in doubt the plan must pay the segregated funds to the person who would otherwise have been paid. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(H). If the plan thereafter determines that the alternate payee\u2019s DRO is a QDRO after all, the plan must begin to pay the pension benefits to the alternate payee as directed by the order, although the plan is not required to pay the alternate payee retrospectively. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(H)(iv). Only after the requisite 18 months have passed, that is, is it possible for a designated beneficiary to have a right to any part of a participant\u2019s pension plan proceeds that cannot be displaced by the QDRO.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><em>Tise, </em>234 F.3d at 421-22 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Consequently, the court concluded that ERISA \u201cplainly contemplates\u201d circumstances in which the event triggering the vesting of benefits (when the benefits become payable from the pension plan to the named beneficiary) before the pension plan determines that a QDRO is qualified and whether it will be obligated to make payments to an alternate payee. <em>Id. </em>at 422. Therefore, it established that ERISA \u201cnecessarily permits an alternate payee who has obtained a state law DRO before the plan participant\u2019s retirement, death, or other benefit-triggering event to perfect the DRO into a QDRO thereafter (subject to the 18-month period after which any previously-due benefits are payable to the original beneficiary).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422-23. The court further reasoned that Ms. Tise\u2019s aggressive attempts to protect her interest in Mr. Myers\u2019 pension \u201cin the face of vigorous resistance by the Plan,\u201d by converting the DRO into a QDRO in state court, fell squarely within the REA\u2019s purpose of improving the delivery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>of retirement benefits and providing greater equity to the plans workers, spouses, and dependents. <em>Id. </em>at 423. <em>See also </em>Pub.L. No. 98-397; 98 Stat. 1426 (1984). Thus, because Ms. Tise had placed the plan on <em>notice </em>of her interest in Mr. Myers\u2019 pension plan proceeds before his death, the Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201cthe fact that he died before issuance of QDRO is immaterial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The cases cited above are not controlling, but we do find them instructive, as they provide evidence that a posthumous QDRO <em>may </em>be permissible dependent upon the circumstances leading to the QDRO\u2019s issuance. <em>Compare Samaroo v. Samaroo, </em>193 F.3d 185 (3d Cir.1999) <em>with Tr. of Directors Guild of America-Producer Pension Benefits Plans v. Tise, </em>234 F.3d 415 (2000). As a consequence, we acknowledge four considerations in determinating whether a posthumous QDRO permissibly entitles an alternate payee to all or a portion of an ERISA qualified pension:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">(1) Was notice provided to the pension plan of the potential alternate payee\u2019s interest in the pension benefits prior to the participant\u2019s death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">(2) How aggressively did the potential alternate payee assert his or her interest before the participants death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">(3) Is the posthumous QDRO being issued <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to only correct a clerical error that was made in a previous DRO that was not qualified by the plan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">(4) Is there another beneficiary\u2019s rights infringed by the enforcement of the alternate payee\u2019s QDRO; and, if so, are the equities balanced?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Indeed, these four considerations are contemplated by Title I of ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">Even so, it is a bedrock principle that ERISA expressly preempts state law (outside the exceptions provided by a QDRO) by making the regulation of pension plans falling under ERISA\u2019s governance a matter of exclusive federal interest. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a) (stating that ERISA \u201cshall supercede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\u201d); 29 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>\u00a7 1144(c)(1) (noting that the term \u201cstate law\u201d includes all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other state action having the effect of law of any state). <em>See Eid v. Duke, </em>373 Md. 2, 12, 816 A.2d 844 (2003) (acknowledging Congress\u2019 intention to create a <em>broad </em>preemption provision in the statute). To be sure, ERISA does maintain a savings clause, limiting preemption by stating that \u201cnothing in this [title] shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or securities.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A), <em>cited in Conn. General Life Ins. Co. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, State of Md., </em>371 Md. 455, 464, 810 A.2d 425 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Nonetheless, ERISA\u2019s \u201cbroad preemption provision was intended to eliminate possibly conflicting or inconsistent state and local regulations of employee benefits,\u201d <em>Eid, </em>373 Md. at 12, 816 A.2d 844, and \u201cto afford employers the advantages of a uniform set of administrative procedures governed by a single set of regulations.\u201d <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co., Inc. v.

Duke, </em>373 Md. 2, 816 A.2d 844 (2003). There, writing for the court, Judge John C. Eldridge noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">[h]aving preempted state law, ERISA provides specific remedies that are available in federal courts.

The agreement also required that Mr. Pettit maintain a $200,000 life insurance policy in favor of Betty and to transfer to Betty ownership of several life insurance policies issued by Connecticut Mutual, American Mutual, and Prudential. <em>Id. </em>at 860. The life insurance policy through MetLife, however, was not mentioned in their agreement nor incorporated into the divorce decree. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Met with these competing claims, MetLife brought an inter-pleader action to determine the proper disposition of the insurance proceeds. <em>Id. </em>at 859. Thereafter, Betty filed a cross-claim against Patricia, seeking a constructive trust against the disputed proceeds. <em>Id. </em>The parties subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>Noting that Betty had failed to obtain a QDRO\u2014the method ERISA provides for a divorced spouse to <em>enforce </em>his or her property rights within an ERISA plan\u2014the District Court concluded that Betty\u2019s claim was preempted because it was based upon state law that related to an employee benefit plan. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the District court denied Betty\u2019s motion for summary judgment and awarded the proceeds to Patricia. <em>Id. </em>As a consequence, Betty noted an appeal to the Fourth Circuit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">On appeal, the Fourth Circuit engaged in an analysis of ERISA\u2019s section 1144(a). It found that from the text of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a), \u201cit is clear that the life insurance policy qualifies as a welfare plan, and it is thus an employee benefit plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 861. As a consequence, it found \u201cno trouble determining that the constructive trust claim, which [was] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>based upon the terms of a property settlement agreement entered to effect a property division upon divorce, meets the ERISA definition of state law,\u201d and was, likely \u201csubject to preemption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Stiltner v. Beretta U.S.A Corp., </em>74 F.3d 1473, 1480 (4th Cir.1996), and <em>Elmore v. Cone Mills Corp., </em>23 F.3d 855, 863 (4th Cir.1994) (en banc)).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">After concluding that the constructive trust derived out of a potentially conflicting state law claim, it engaged in an analysis of ERISA\u2019s construction to determine whether the claim for a constructive trust related to Mr. Pettit\u2019s employee benefit plan. <em>Id. </em>Applying the standard developed by the Supreme Court in <em>Egelhoff, </em>532 U.S. at 147, 121 S.Ct. 1322, and <em>Shaw, </em>463 U.S. at 97, 103 S.Ct. 2890, it concluded that a constructive trust claim against a plan beneficiary obviously maintains a direct effect and connection with an ERISA plan. <em>Pettit, </em>164 F.3d at 862. Further, the court additionally noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">... [I]t is once again worth noting that ERISA, by its own terms, provides a method for a former spouse to secure an interest in plan benefits. <em>See, e.g., Hopkins v. AT &amp; T Global Info. Solutions Co., </em>105 F.3d 153, 157 (4th Cir.1997) (noting that a former spouse\u2019s interest in pension plan benefits \u201ccan be protected simply by obtaining a QDRO\u201d). Under \u00a7 1144(b)(7), QDROs, as defined by \u00a7 1056(d)(3), are specifically excepted from preemption. See 29 U.S.C.[] \u00a7\u00a7 1144(b)(7), 1056(d)(3) (West 1985 &amp; Supp.1998). Two strong inferences flow from the QDRO exception. First, Congress understood that such state law domestic proceedings may \u201crelate to\u201d a plan such that the enforcement of a provision requiring payment from employee pension or welfare benefits would, absent the exception, be preempted. <em>See Boggs v. Boggs, </em>520 U.S. 833, 117 S.Ct. 1754, 1763, 138 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>L.Ed.2d 45 (1997) (noting that \u201cQDRO\u2019s, unlike domestic relations orders in general, are ... exempt from ERISA\u2019s general preemption clause\u201d). Second, and more important to the question at hand, Congress meant to make a QDRO the acceptable method for a divorced spouse to attach an interest in a former spouse\u2019s benefit plan. ERISA thus maintains its own enforcement mechanism for aggrieved former spouses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 863 (footnotes omitted). In affirming the District Court, the Fourth Circuit reasoned that, if permitted to stand, Betty\u2019s constructive trust claim against the pension plan, based upon a marital dissolution agreement, \u201cwould directly conflict with ERISA\u2019s goal of providing a nationally uniform plan administration and reduce the QDRO provisions to a meaningless footnote in the preemption context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 864. Therefore, it concluded that because Betty\u2019s constructive trust claim \u201cinterferes with Congress\u2019! ] clear objectives and conflicts with the plain language of ERISA, it must fall victim to the ERISA preemption provision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In instant case, Ms. Hunsecker admittedly entered into a voluntary separation agreement with her husband that provided an interest in his pension as well as death benefits. That agreement was integrated into the circuit court\u2019s judgment of absolute divorce. That judgment, therefore, constitutes a DRO pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii). Nonetheless, Ms. Hunsecker sat on the judgment of divorce for eleven years without asserting any interest in Mr. Robinette\u2019s pensions. She presented no evidence that she made any effort to notify the pension of her potential interest, and sought to enforce an interest only after learning of her former-husband\u2019s death. In addition, the record fails support any inference that the Mr. Robinette\u2019s pension plan turned a blind-eye to any effort by Ms. Hunsecker to enforce her interest, because she never asserted her interest until after Mr. Robinette\u2019s death. Thus, it would appear that if Ms. Hunsecker\u2019s claim for entry of a QDRO posthumously or for a constructive trust were \u201crelated to\u201d the pension plan, it would be preempted <em>if Mr. Robinette\u2019s employee benefit plans are covered by ERISA. </em>During argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ment before this Court, however, the parties agreed that Mr. Robinette\u2019s plan was not subject to ERISA. We agree with the parties and the explanation of how we reached that conclusion is appropriately provided <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In that regard, one generally must determine whether Mr. Robinette\u2019s employee benefit plans are covered or exempt from ERISA\u2019s broad preemptive ability. The employee benefit plans covered by and exempt from ERISA are set forth in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003, which, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">(a) In general.

There, Richard Rose, a participant in the Long Island Railroad\u2019s pension plan, failed to elect a survivor-ship option, which would have provided survivorship benefits, to his wife (\u201cMs.Rose\u201d) prior to his pre-retirement death. <em>Id. </em>at 912. As a consequence, Ms. Rose\u2019s application for the issuance of the survivor benefits was denied by the Board of Managers and Joint Board on Pension Applications for survivorship benefits. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, Ms. Rose commenced an action for survivor benefits and other relief in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleging that the railroad company had violated section 205 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1055,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> requiring that all retirement plans covered by ERISA provide benefits to the surviving spouse of a employee who dies prior to retirement. <em>Id. </em>The District Court concluded that the railroad plan was exempt from compliance with ERISA\u2019s vesting provisions because it was a \u201cgovernmental plan,\u201d and dismissed Ms. Rose\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">On appeal, the Second Circuit began its discussion by tracing the history of Congress\u2019 decision to exempt public/government plans from ERISA\u2019s Title I requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 913-14. After concluding that a retirement plan is except from Title I requirements if it meets the requirements of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003(32), the court subsequently considered the defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>nition of the undefined term of \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d and its applicability to the Long Island Railroad Company, an initially private company ultimately acquired by the Metropolitan Transit Authority of New York, by looking toward the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd. v.

Adopting the <em>Hawkins County </em>Court\u2019s test, the Second Circuit explained that \u201c[t]he NLRB guidelines are a useful aid in interpreting ERISA\u2019s governmental exemption, because ERISA, like the National Labor Relations Act, \u2018represents an effort to strike an appropriate balance between interests of employers and labor organizations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 916 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Thereafter, the court initially applied the test to the Long Island Railroad\u2019s parent company, Metropolitan Transit Authority, and concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">[u]nder the <em>Hawkins County </em>analysis, the [Metropolitan Transit Authority (therein referenced as the \u201cMTA\u201d) ] is clearly a political subdivision of the state because it satisfies both the alternate NLRB criteria.

The court subsequently considered whether the Long Island Railroad was an \u201cagency\u201d or \u201cinstrumentality\u201d of the government. <em>Id. </em>at 917-18. It noted that \u201c[l]ike the term \u2018political subdivision,\u2019 the terms \u2018agency* and \u2018instrumentality\u2019 are not defined in ERISA, nor are there any regulations under ERISA which interpret\u201d the terms. <em>Id. </em>at 917.

Notwithstanding this caveat, the court found the NLRB test appropriate to the matter before it and subsequently turned to the test\u2019s application by the Supreme Court, by the court\u2019s sister circuits, and by its own application within the context of labor and employment cases. <em>Id. </em>at 548-49.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Following this discussion, the court outlined the required steps to be considered in an NLRB test analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag\">[W]e would first determine, <em>based on the record, </em>if the entity had been created directly by the state or a political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>subdivision, such as a city, so as to constitute a department or arm of the government. If it had not been, we would then determine, <em>based on the record, </em>if the entity was administered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or the general electorate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 550 (emphasis added). The court noted, however, that in that instance, because neither the parties nor the trial court had used the NLRB test, it was required to look at the facts on which the trial court had relied and the facts reargued by the plaintiffs on appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Thereafter, the court concluded that hospital was not a governmental agency or instrumentality after considering several factors. <em>Id. </em>at 550-52. First, although the city had initially created the hospital, ownership of realty by a government and the subsequent lease of that realty to a nonprofit corporation, \u201cwithout more, does not prove the corporation was created by the state so as to constitute a department or administrative arm of the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550. Second, the court acknowledged that while ten community council-appointed members had incorporated the corporation, it was not created as \u201ca department or arm of the government,\u201d because the corporation had replaced the city as operator of the hospital. <em>Id. </em>at 551. Third, the court noted that the city had not maintained control over the hospital\u2019s board because it did not maintain removal power and did not maintain any power to appoint or reappoint members of the hospital\u2019s board. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the court recognized that the hospital had maintained separate payrolls, health insurance plans, and pension plans that were apart from the city\u2019s control or establishment. <em>Id. </em>at 552. Therefore, the court ultimately concluded that because the hospital was not a government subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, its employee benefit plan could not be characterized as a government plan under the NLRB analysis and, therefore, the federal court could not exercise jurisdiction pursuant to ERISA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In contrast, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has applied an \u201cemployer-relationship\u201d test as laid out in <em>Alley v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>984 F.2d 1201 (D.C.Cir.1993). The employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>er-relationship test, used to determine whether a federally chartered savings and loan association constituted a government entity, requires an analysis of whether the entity relates to its employees as a private business or treats them as government workers. <em>Id. </em>at 1206. (finding that the Federal Asset Disposition Association (\u201cFADA\u201d), formed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, was not a governmental entity because its employees \u201cwere outside the civil service system, and were not subject to personnel rules or restrictions on salaries and benefits imposed generally on federal employees\u201d).

Hamilton, </em>106 Md.App. 632, 666 A.2d 867 (1995). There, Gary Hamilton (\u201cGary\u201d) and Sharon Starleper (\u201cSharon\u201d) entered into a voluntary separation agreement prior to the circuit court\u2019s judgment of absolute divorce in 1984. <em>Id. </em>at 634, 666 A.2d 867. At that time, Gary owned a life insurance policy issued by one of the State Farm insurance companies. <em>Id. </em>As a consequence, Paragraph 10 of the separation agreement provided that Gary would \u201ckeep his current State Farm life insurance policy in effect to be used for the support, maintenance and education of the [parties\u2019 son, Justin,] in the event of [Gary\u2019s] death[; and, that] said fund [would] be administered by [Sharon], and, if [Gary] so desire[d], another party as trustee.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">When the parties executed the voluntary separation agreement and the divorce was granted, Gary\u2019s insurance policy designated Sharon as the primary beneficiary and Justin as a successor or contingency beneficiary. <em>Id. </em>at 635, 666 A.2d 867. Nevertheless, when Gary remarried in 1991, he listed his second wife (\u201cSandra\u201d) as the primary beneficiary of the State Farm policy, keeping, however, Justin as the successor or contingent beneficiary. <em>Id. </em>Gary, Sandra, and her son from an earlier marriage lived together until shortly before Gary\u2019s death in April of 1994. <em>Starleper, </em>106 Md.App. at 635, 666 A.2d 867. Sandra used $20,000 of the $29,887 in Gary\u2019s life insurance benefits to purchase a home. <em>Id. </em>Notably, however, \u201cSandra received a letter from Sharon\u2019s attorney, informing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>her, for the first time, of a claim by Justin to the insurance proceeds[,]\u201d on the day before settlement on the home. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Gary\u2019s ex-wife, Sharon, filed a complaint against Sandra, seeking the imposition of a constructive trust on the remaining insurance proceeds and on Sandra\u2019s new home, up to the amount of the insurance proceeds used to purchase the home, on behalf of Justin and herself. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court rejected Sharon\u2019s argument, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">By accepting the insurance money from State Farm after her husband\u2019s suicide, [Sandra] breached no duty to anyone, therefore, the retention of that sum and the use of that money to secure the purchase of real estate was not wrongful. Accordingly, imposing a constructive trust upon [Sandra\u2019s] home, the remaining money or other acquisition derived from the insurance payment would be contrary to the existing law of our State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\"><em>Starleper, </em>106 Md.App. at 636, 666 A.2d 867 (additions in original) (quotation marks omitted). Sharon subsequently noted an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In assessing whether the equity court could impose a constructive trust upon the proceeds of Gary\u2019s life insurance policy \u201cin the hands of a substituted beneficiary,\u201d Chief Judge Alan M. Wilner (later, Judge Wilner of the Court of Appeals), observed that \u201cnearly all of [our sister jurisdictions] have concluded that imposition of a constructive trust is a proper means of enforcing agreements to maintain insurance for designated beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638, 666 A.2d 867. Judge Wilner additionally noted the rationale for imposing a constructive trust on insurance proceeds in this kind of case, explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">\u201c[m]any cases have dealt with situations similar to the present one, wherein a deceased party to a divorce permitted a life insurance policy to lapse by failing to pay the premiums, or changed the beneficiary to the policy, contrary to the requirements of the marital settlement agreement. ... In such cases, the agreement requiring the insured to maintain a particular beneficiary on a policy gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>that beneficiary vested rights in the proceeds of that policy. Accordingly, courts have imposed constructive trusts on the proceeds of the deceased\u2019s life insurance because the marital settlement agreement gives the former spouse or children named as beneficiaries in the binding agreement a superior equitable interest in the life insurance proceeds over later named beneficiaries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><em>Starleper, </em>106 Md.App. at 639-40, 666 A.2d 867 (quoting <em>Perkins v. Stuemke, </em>223 Ill.App.3d 839, 166 Ill.Dec. 103, 585 N.E.2d 1125, 1127 (1992)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Judge Wilner cautioned, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap2\">[t]he factual circumstances in these cases often vary. The language of the marital agreement differs, as does the nature of the violation by the decedent. Sometimes, he or she allows the policy to lapse entirely; sometimes the policy is replaced with a new policy having different terms or beneficiaries; sometimes, as here, the policy is maintained but the beneficiary is changed. Because a constructive trust is an equitable remedy, the court must consider all of the relevant circumstances in deciding whether it is an appropriate remedy in a given case. As is the rule generally with respect to equitable remedies, a constructive trust is not a matter of right, <em>ex debito justitiae, </em>but rests in the discretion of the court, to be imposed or denied according to the circumstances of the case....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 640, 666 A.2d 867 (citing generally, <em>Wimmer, supra). </em>Because we concluded that consideration of all the circumstances was a test to be first addressed by the circuit court, we remanded the case in order for the court to undertake such an examination and advised the court that wrongdoing is \u201cnot a necessary precondition\u201d to the imposition of a constructive trust. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Much like the issue in <em>Starleper, </em>the imposition of a constructive trust on benefits already issued by the pension plan is a case of first impression. As a consequence, we draw our guidance from the courts of other jurisdictions. <em>Cf. Starleper, </em>106 Md.App. at 638-39, 666 A.2d 867. To that end, while not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>directly on point, we find the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Ohio\u2019s opinion in <em>McGraw v.

The entry of the parties\u2019 divorce decree\u2014signed by both Kerry and Jenifer as well as by their respective counsels\u2014stipulated to the following allocation of Kerry\u2019s Navy pension:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">...

Therefore, he argued that the \u201cobligation\u201d he owed to Jenifer as an unsecured creditor should be discharged.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In contrast, Jenifer argued that, because the property was divided through the divorce decree, her portion of the Navy pension \u201cnever bec[a]me property of [Kerry\u2019s] estate and thus [his] obligation cannot be subject to discharge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The Bankruptcy Court agreed with Jenifer. <em>McGraw, </em>176 B.R. at 151. In rendering its disposition, the court found that \u201c[w]hen the [d]omestie [Relations court awarded a portion of [Kerry\u2019s] pension to [Jenifer], she became the equitable owner of 36/6 <em>% </em>of the pension fund and that percentage became her sole and separate property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, the court concluded that \u201cwhen a [government pension plan participant] fails to turn over property divided under a domestic relations court order, that property may be subject to a constructive trust or equitable lien in favor of the [participant\u2019s former] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>spouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Bush v.

While the Bankruptcy Court acknowledged that it \u201cshould not impose a constructive trust on property in favor of a particular creditor since nowhere in the Bankruptcy Code does it say, \u2018property held by the debtor subject to a constructive trust is excluded from the debtor\u2019s estate[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>(citing <em>In re Omegas Group, Inc., </em>16 F.3d 1443 (6th Cir.1994)), it recognized that when a court of competent jurisdiction ordered property divided between spouses prior to a debtor\u2019s bankruptcy petition, \u201cthe [pension participant] at best could hold only legal title to that property awarded to the [former] spouse.\u201d <em>McGraw, </em>176 B.R. at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Admittedly, the court cautioned, much like Judge Wilner in <em>Starleper, supra, </em>106 Md.App. at 640, 666 A.2d 867, that the imposition of a constructive trust \u201c \u2018should not be impressed cavalierly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Omegas Group, Inc., </em>16 F.3d at 1451). Nonetheless, the court reasoned that \u201c[i]t could be argued [that] ... where there is a valid [d]omestic [Relations [c]ourt order predating the bankruptcy, there has in fact been a judicial determination by a court in a separate proceeding that the [government pension participant\u2019s] property is held for the benefit of another.\u201d Thus, the court noted that any \u201cequities to be weighted ... must be weighed in light of the divorce decree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152. Therefore, the court imposed a constructive trust to protect Jenifer\u2019s interest in the pension benefits. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">As Ms. Hunsecker points out, several other bankruptcy courts that have addressed the issue of a former spouse\u2019s equitable title to a government plan\u2019s benefits have concluded, relying on state law, that imposition of a constructive trust is a proper means of enforcing legal agreements or judicial orders to maintain the former spouse\u2019s interest in the pension benefits. <em>See In re Combs, </em>435 B.R. 467, 477-78 (Bankr.E.D.Mich.2010) (concluding that \u201ceach month when [the participant] receives his monthly pension payments, he holds a portion of the benefits in as a constructive trustee for the benefit of the former spouse\u201d); <em>Brown v. Pitzer, </em>249 B.R. 303 (Bankr.S.D.Ind.2000) (noting that a government pension is not gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>erned by ERISA and, relying on state law to determine the former spouse\u2019s pension interest, and concluding that participant, \u201cin equitable effect,\u201d was acting as constructive trustee to the former spouse\u2019s portion of the benefits); <em>In re Naydan, </em>162 B.R. 204 (Bankr.W.D.Ark.1993) (concluding that a state court\u2019s imposition of a constructive trust on a government participant\u2019s entire estate does not contravene bankruptcy law; and, because the participant had no equity in the property it could therefore not be discharged); <em>Resare v. Resare, </em>142 B.R. 44 (Bankr.D.R.1.1992) (concluding that a portion <em>of </em>the participant\u2019s military pension vested as his former spouse\u2019s sole and separate property upon entry of the divorce decree); <em>In re Kinder, </em>133 B.R. 151 (Bankr.W.D.Mo.1991); <em>In re Dahlin, </em>94 B.R. 79 (Bankr.E.D.Va.1988) (noting that the wife\u2019s interest in husband\u2019s military pension \u201cbenefits became the sole and separate property of [the wife] and the [husband] only received benefits as trustee\u201d). We therefore return to Maryland\u2019s law to determine what, if any, interest Ms. Hunsecker maintains in Mr. Robinette\u2019s MCPS pension benefits. <em>See, e.g., In re Combs, </em>435 B.R. at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Section 8-105(a)(2) of the Family Law Article provides that a \u201ccourt may enforce by power of contempt or as an independent contract not superseded by the divorce decree the provisions of a deed, agreement, or settlement that contain language that the deed, agreement, or settlement is incorporated but not merged into a divorce decree.\u201d Md.Code (1984, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-105(a)(2) of the Family Law Article. <em>See Janusz v.

Ms. Hunsecker and Mr. Robinette reached this agreement only after she transferred and assigned all her rights, title, and interest in the marital home, providing the proceeds of any sale would be the \u201csole and exclusive property\u201d of Mr. Robinette. In addition, Ms. Hunsecker further conveyed all her rights, title, and interest in a boat and trailer the couple owned, and she released and discharged any claims for <em>pendente lite </em>and indefinite alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">As a consequence, we find no difficulty in holding that the evidence was sufficient for the trial court to conclude that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>constructive trust arose out of Mr. Robinette\u2019s failure to designate Ms. Hunsecker as his alternate payee irrespective of the parties failure to acquire a QDRO prior to Mr. Robinette\u2019s death. \u201cIt is enough that the \u2018conscience\u2019 of a court of equity would be traumatized if the legal title holder were allowed to deprive the beneficial owner of that which in good conscience belongs to the beneficial owner.\u201d <em>Hartsock, supra, </em>21 Md.App. at 118, 318 A.2d 237 (quoting <em>Beatty, </em>supra).
