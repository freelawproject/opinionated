VEI Catonsville, LLC (VEI) seeks our review of a declaration rendered by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County that an appraisal of the property at issue complied with the dictates of the \u201cAgreement Regarding Right of First Refusal and Option to Purchase.\u201d VEI maintains that the chancellor erred by declaring that an appraisal of the property at issue did not adhere to the requirements of the Option. Appellee, Einbinder Properties, Inc. (Einbinder) disagrees, and moves to dismiss VEI\u2019s appeal, urging, in the alternative, that we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">We decline Einbinder\u2019s invitation to dismiss VEI\u2019s appeal, but shall affirm the chancellor\u2019s declaration for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Background <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">On March 18, 1997, Circuit City Stores, Inc., a \u201cnational retailer of consumer electronics,\u201d the predecessor on the lease to VEI, entered into a commercial ground lease (Lease) with Joseph Y. Einbinder,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contracting to rent approximately 7.657 acres of land (Property) in Baltimore County for an initial term of twenty years, with six five-year renewable terms. The Property is known as 6026-6030 Baltimore National Pike and, at the time of the lease, had been the site of the Westview Cinema. The theater has since been razed and replaced by retail establishments\u2014\u201cHH Gregg, Vitamin World and Staples.\u201d The Lease contained a separate \u201cAgreement Regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ing Right of First Refusal and Option to Purchase.\u201d The \u201coption to purchase\u201d includes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\"><em>Option to Purchase. </em>Landholder does hereby grant to CC the exclusive and irrevocable option to purchase the interest of Landholder in the property on and subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The agreement also established the method by which the purchase price would be determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">The purchase price (\u201cPurchase Price\u201d) payable upon the closing shall be the greater of FOUR MILLION FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND AND NO/ 100 DOLLARS ($4,428,000.00) <em>or the appraised value of the Property </em>subject to adjustments at closing as more fully set forth in subparagraph 2(d) below, which appraisal shall take into account (i) CC\u2019s right of first refusal, (ii) the extension rights granted to the holder of the leasehold estate in the Property, and (iii) the absence of a brokerage commission to be paid by Landholder, and <em>which appraisal shall not take into account the value of the leasehold improvements then-existing on the Property, </em>and which appraisal shall be conducted by an independent M.A.I. appraiser having at least fifteen (15) years experience in the field of commercial real estate and whose primary area of expertise is Baltimore County, Maryland reasonably satisfactory to Landholder and CC. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Circuit City filed for bankruptcy protection and, \u201con or about\u201d March 17, 2009, \u201csold and assigned its interest as Lessee under the Lease to Vanguard Commercial Development, Inc.\u201d On August 10, 2009, Vanguard in turn assigned its interest in the lease to VEI.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">In April, 2010, pursuant to the Option\u2019s requirement that they secure the services of an independent appraiser, the parties retained Ronald Lipman, a real estate consultant and appraiser, \u201cto appraise the Property in accordance with the Option.\u201d Lipman submitted his appraisal of the Property on May 5, 2010. In the cover letter that accompanied the appraisal, Lipman outlined the \u201cappraisal methodology\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The classic method for valuing vacant land is the sales comparison approach, wherein transactions involving properties considered similar to the subject are obtained, analyzed and adjusted to the subject property, utilizing a common denominator of value. In the appraisal of commercial sites similar to the subject, price per sq. ft. is the typical common denominator with, however, consideration of the amount of frontage the property enjoys on the commercial corridor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\">If not for language contained in the Agreement Regarding Right of First Refusal and Option to Purchase, we would utilize the sales comparison approach exclusively. However, in paragraph 2 of that document, the appraiser is instructed to \u201ctake into account\u201d Circuit City\u2019s right of first refusal, extension rights granted to the holder of the leasehold estate and the absence of a brokerage commission to be paid by the Lessor/Seller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">We interpret consideration of the leasehold estate\u2019s extension rights to mean that the existing land lease should be \u201ctaken into account\u201d. For this reason, we have also considered valuation of the leased fee (reversionary) estate <em>(i.e. </em>the right to the triple net income stream and the property reversion at the end of the lease) because of its influence on the \u201cvalue\u201d of the land in the context of this assignment. We would normally expect a well written lease to have been more explicit, but we believe that this alternative interpretation of the option language may also be relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">Therefore, we will consider both the sales comparison and the income approaches, the latter addressing value of the leased fee estate. In that valuation, we will estimate market value of the lessor\u2019s position. This is typically accomplished by use of direct capitalization wherein the ground lease income stream is translated into value by use of a market-abstracted capitalization rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Lipman submitted two figures based on separate valuation methods and explained this approach in his cover letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>As a result of our investigation and by virtue of our experience, it is our opinion that, utilizing the sales comparison approach, market value of the subject property as of April 27, 2010 was $6,050,000 based on a sq. ft. rate of $22.50 applied against the subject\u2019s usable area (269,223 sq. ft.). It is further our opinion that, as of that same date, market value of the leased fee position of the subject property was $7,450,000 utilizing the current NNN rent, deducting modest expenses and applying a capitalization rate of 7.0%. Lipman warned that there could be \u201cno possible correlation\u201d of the two values:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\">If the lease and the accompanying purchase option clearly stated that the unimproved land value, free and clear of the ground lease, with no references thereto, were the determinate of value in the context of the options then we would estimate value based exclusively on the sales comparison approach, <em>ie. </em>SIX MILLION FIFTY THOUSAND (6,050,-000) DOLLARS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">If, on the other hand, the option to purchase would have clearly instructed the appraiser to value the leased fee estate or Lessor\u2019s reversionary interest, in consideration of the land lease, our value would be based exclusively on the leased fee, <em>ie. </em>SEVEN MILLION FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ($7,450,000) DOLLARS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">He explained the discrepancy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">M. Ronald Lipman has read numerous documents relating to real estate transactions over his 50 years of appraisal and consulting activity. Unfortunately, the purchase option in this matter is imprecise, vague and subject to interpretation. It simply states that the appraiser should \u201ctake into account\u201d ... the extension rights \u201cgranted to the holder of the leasehold estate in the Property,\u201d a nuance which is not necessarily a clear reference to leased fee value, but nonetheless, forces one to consider it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">There is a lack of clarity in the purchase option document and the reference to \u201cextension rights\u201d benefitting the leasehold estate. We have struggled in our effort to under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>stand the intent of the instructions and could understand reading it either of the two ways described above. In our position as appraisers, we do not believe that we have the ability to interpret it, nor the legal background to do so. And we understand that the two of you cannot agree on the appropriate (or legal) interpretation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">Accordingly, the two values reported above represent our response to the appraisal function we were engaged to perform. We believe that resolution of the issue is up to the two of you or, if required, the Courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">Current conditions in the financial markets are in substantial disarray and their impact on real estate values are, at this time, difficult to measure. This valuation is based on the best information available at the time of analysis. As this uncertain environment continues to evolve there may be factors, currently unknown, which will impact property value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">On June 4, 2010, VEI filed an action seeking a declaration that the appraisal did not comply with the terms of the Option. VEI also sought a declaration that the purchase price for the subject Property should be set at $4,428,000.00. On September 24, 2010, Einbinder lodged a counterclaim, seeking a declaration that the option is unenforceable or, in the alternative, that the option has expired. Finally, Einbinder sought the alternative declaration that the purchase price for the Property should be $7,450,000 minus a 2.5% brokerage commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">On March 2, 2011, at the end of the second day of testimony, the chancellor ruled in favor of Einbinder. The chancellor, explaining his ruling from the bench, concluded that the appraisal complied with the requirements of the option. It also determined that the correct purchase price was $7,450,000, reduced by the aforementioned brokerage commission and denied relief on Einbinder\u2019s counterclaim. The chancellor also ordered VEI to settle within 180 days. On March 3, 2011, the chancellor filed a written order that reflected this ruling. VEI moved for a stay and also urged the chancellor to alter or amend the judgment. The chancellor denied both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>avenues of relief. VEI\u2019s subsequent motion for a stay pending appeal was granted and denied in part; VEI was ordered to post a supersedeas bond in the amount of $8,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">This appeal followed. We shall set forth additional facts as required to address the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Einbinder avers that we should summarily dismiss VEI\u2019s appeal. Einbinder initially maintains that VEI \u201chas waived its right to its appeal by ... voluntarily closing on the Property at the price set by the Circuit Court,\u201d and contends that there exists \u201cno longer an existing controversy!.]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Einbinder further asserts that \u201cthis Court cannot, as a matter of law, provide VEI an effective remedy,\u201d a fact that would militate against appellate review. Einbinder points to the fact that VEI chose not to post a supersedeas bond to stay enforcement of the chancellor\u2019s judgment, pursuant to which VEI was directed to close on the Property within 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">We are not persuaded that VEI\u2019s actions have ended this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">The \u201cright to appeal may be lost by acquiescence in, or recognition of, the validity of the decision below from which the appeal is taken or by otherwise taking a position which is inconsistent with the right to appeal.\u201d <em>Rocks v. Brosius, </em>241 Md. 612, 680, 217 A.2d 581 (1966). <em>Accord, Dietz v. Dietz, </em>351 Md. 683, 689, 720 A.2d 298 (1998); <em>Osztreicher v.

The \u201cdoctrine of acquiescence\u2014or waiver\u2014 is that \u2018a voluntary act of a party which is inconsistent with the assignment of errors on appeal normally precludes that party from obtaining appellate review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Ford, </em>433 Md. 426, 462, 71 A.3d 105 (2013) (quoting <em>Bd. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number><em>Physician Quality Assurance v. Levitsky, </em>353 Md. 188, 200, 725 A.2d 1027 (1999) (further citation omitted)). This \u201cdoctrine of waiver is also known as \u201cestoppel,\u201d acceptance of benefits creating mootness, and acquiescence in judgment.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>433 Md. at 462, 71 A.3d 105 (quoting <em>Downtown Brewing Co. v.

Hecht Company, </em>257 Md. 121, 124-26, 262 A.2d 518, 520-21 (1970); that no appeal lies from a consent decree, <em>Mercantile Trust Co. v. Schloss, </em>165 Md. 18, 24, 166 A. 599, 601-02 (1933); and that after an invocation of the benefits accruing under an order of court, a party will not be heard to assail its validity. <em>Stewart v. McCaddin, </em>107 Md. 314, 318-19, 68 A. 571, 573 (1908). This general rule of preclusion enunciated in the Brosius case has been variously characterized as an \u201cestoppel,\u201d <em>Dubin v. Mobile Land Corp., </em>250 Md. 349, 353, 243 A.2d 585, 587 (1968), a \u201cwaiver\u201d of the right to appeal, <em>id. </em>at 353, 243 A.2d at 587; <em>Bowers v.

Brosius, supra; Stewart v. McCaddin, supra </em>at 318, 68 A. at 573. We think the label applied to the rule is less important than its essence\u2014that voluntary act of a party which is inconsistent with the assignment of errors on appeal normally precludes that party from obtaining appellate review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\"><em>Franzen v.

The Court agreed with the \u201cproposition, entertained by practically all jurisdictions, that payment tendered after the issuance of execution on a judgment is clearly coerced[,]\u201d and that an appellant\u2019s failure to secure a \u201cstay or other supersedeas pending appeal is normally held to have no effect on the voluntariness determination[.]\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>290 Md. at 69-70, 427 A.2d 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We consider the recent opinion by the Alaska Supreme Court in <em>Leisnoi, Inc. v. Merdes &amp; Merdes, P.C., </em>307 P.3d 879, 2013 WL 386373 (Alaska 2013), to be instructive. This case involved a dispute between Leisnoi, an Alaska Native corporation, and a law firm that had represented it in a matter under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The law firm successfully represented Leisnoi in litigation that would continue for more than a decade. Leisnoi disputed the fee arrangement, but an arbitrator ruled in the law firm\u2019s favor and the latter obtained a judgment for the unpaid legal fees. Leisnoi made payments until 2002, when it went into default. The law firm did not seek a writ of execution on the judgment until 2008. Leisnoi opposed the firm\u2019s efforts to collect its legal fees, but suffered a setback when a trial court in January 2010 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>granted the firm\u2019s motion to execute. Following the trial court\u2019s order, Leisnoi paid the firm the outstanding balance and also appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">On appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court, the law firm argued that Leisnoi waived its right to appeal by voluntarily satisfying the judgment against it. The firm cited to decisions from other jurisdictions for the proposition that, \u201cwhen a judgment debtor voluntarily satisfies the judgment in full, he waives any right to appeal.\u201d Leisnoi explained why it should prosecute its appeal by citing to its \u201climited options\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">Leisnoi replies that it had limited options in response to Merdes\u2019s [the law firm\u2019s] pursuit of execution upon the judgment: It could do nothing and allow Merdes to collect the judgment; it could seek a stay of enforcement of the judgment by posting a supersedeas bond; or it could pay the judgment. Leisnoi characterizes the first two options as so undesirable\u2014based on both the potential \u201cembarrassment\u201d and disruption of its business associated with involuntary collection procedures and the high cost of posting a supersedeas bond\u2014that it had no choice but to pay the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\"><em>Leisnoi, </em>307 P.3d at 885, 2013 WL 386373, *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The Alaska court, viewing this issue as a matter of first impression, conducted an extensive survey of applicable decisions from other jurisdictions before concluding that a judgment debtor does not forfeit the right to appeal by paying a judgment and then seeking to overturn the judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">We agree with the U.S. Supreme Court that \u201c[t]here can be no question that a debtor against whom a judgment for money is recovered may pay that judgment and bring a writ of error to reverse it, and if reversed can recover back his money.\u201d As the Sixth Circuit explained,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">[A] defeated party\u2019s compliance with a ... [trial] court ruling does not bar him from appealing unless his compliance has made it impossible for the appellate court to grant effective relief. This is true even if the defeated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>party has failed to avail himself of an opportunity to obtain a stay of the proceedings or a supersedeas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><em>Leisnoi, Inc., </em>307 P.3d at 886, 2013 WL 386373 (quoting <em>Uyeda v.

Mandel, </em>402 Md. 109, 126, 935 A.2d 671 (2007). We believe that VEI could reasonably conclude that, in view of the chancellor\u2019s order, its options were limited and that, on this record, its decision to go to settlement was not \u201cvoluntary\u201d for purposes of the acquiescence rule. On this record, we are unable to conclude that VEI is barred from appealing the chancellor\u2019s order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">VEI does not fare as well on the merits, however.

VEI cites to the appraiser\u2019s acknowledgment that there was \u201ca reasonable point at which the value of those improvements contribute ... sufficiently to make one select a capitalization rate ... that reflects the security of the income stream.\u201d VEI also points out that Lipman\u2019s appraisal chose a \u201cvery low capitalization rate solely because the lease is \u2018guaranteed\u2019 by the value of the improvements.\u201d (internal quotations omitted). It follows, VEI insists, that the \u201cvalue of the improvements ... played a central role in determining the appraised value of the Propertyf.]\u201d VEI emphasizes that the \u201cOption prohibited Mr. Lipman from considering in any manner, specifically or otherwise, the value of the leasehold improvements in determining the appraised value of the property.\u201d VEI challenges Lipman\u2019s application of the income approach and calculation of a capitalization rate, or \u201ccap rate,\u201d as an approach explicitly prohibited by the Option. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the appraisal thus ran afoul of the Option\u2019s prohibition of any consideration of the value of the then existing improvements, YEI urges that we reverse the chancellor\u2019s decision and remand with directions that a new appraisal be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Einbinder disagrees with the premise of VEl\u2019s argument, <em>viz. </em>that the appraiser\u2019s use of the \u201cincome approach\u201d violated the terms of the Option. Instead, Einbinder urges that VEI ignores the basic distinction in the appraiser\u2019s analysis\u2014that the existence of the improvements and, not their specific value, was considered in the appraisal. We believe that Einbinder\u2019s argument is more tenable and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Chancellor\u2019s Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The chancellor ruled in favor of Einbinder, explaining his decision in detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">JUDGE STRINGER: Now, in this declaratory judgment action, the Court is being asked to declare the rights of the parties under the terms of an option to purchase, which has been incorporated into the ground lease, I believe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">JUDGE STRINGER: ... Now, with respect to this option to purchase which is the subject of this case, I do not find the contract to be ambiguous____The dispute arose over the application of the provisions of the option in the valuation of the property. I also find that the contract is sufficiently definite [and] I find that in this case, the option which provides a method to determine the purchase price, is sufficiently definite and, therefore, I believe that the option to purchase is enforceable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">As a preface to his discussion, the chancellor first outlined the Option\u2019s relevant terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">Now, the option provides that the purchase price shall be the greater of $4,428,000.00 or the appraised value of the property subject to adjustments at closing which are set forth in subparagraph 2(d) and the appraisal shall take into account (i) Circuit City\u2019s right of first refusal, (ii) the extension rights granted to the holder of the leasehold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>estate in the property and (iii) the absence of a brokerage commission to be paid by the landlord and it provides further that the appraisal shall not take into account the value of the leasehold improvements then existing on the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The chancellor then set forth the pertinent issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">The issue has become whether Mr. Lipman\u2019s report valued the property as provided in the option and took into account, in particular, (ii) the extension rights granted to the holder of the leasehold estate in the property but not take into account the value of the leasehold improvements then existing on the property as required by the terms of the option.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">He concluded that the appraisal complied with the terms of the Option and explained why alternative appraisal methods were less appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">Mr. Lipman gave, submitted a report with two different values, done by two different methods.... Mr. Lipman testified that to do the appraisal by the sales approach would ignore the extension rights granted under the provisions of the option[.] ... Mr. Lipman couldn\u2019t ... do an appraisal by the sales method and consider the extension rights granted under the ground lease and which was required by the option and since the option requires consideration of those extension rights, the sales valuation by Mr. Lipman has not complied with the conditions provided in the option.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The chancellor specifically approved of the employment of the income valuation approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">Now, Mr. Lipman also provided a value using an income approach to appraise the property. There seems to be an issue that arose regarding the valuation of the property versus the interest of the landholder and YEI was zeroing in on the language in the option with respect to the provision providing for the purchase price which required the \u201cappraisal value of the property\u201d and I believe that VEI was raising the question about whether Mr. Lipman\u2019s appraisal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>valued the property versus merely valuing the landholder\u2019s interest in the property. The testimony from Mr. Lipman and Mr. Duncan was that the income approach is a recognized method of appraising property and Mr. Lipman provided a value of the property taking into account the extension rights granted to the holder of the leasehold and these-were questions I specifically asked because I wanted answers to, both Mr. Lipman and Mr. Duncan testified that the income method provided a standard recognized method of valuation of the property and did so taking into account the extension rights to the holder of the leasehold as provided or required in the option. In other words, Mr. Lipman\u2019s income appraisal or his appraisal by the income approach, did exactly what the option required him to do. He valued the property and his appraisal took into account all three of those considerations, Circuit City\u2019s right of first refusal, the extension rights granted to the holder of the leasehold estate in the property and the absence of the brokerage commission, which I\u2019ll get to a little later. But he definitely took into consideration the extension rights granted to the holder of the leasehold estate in his valuation of the property which is why he did use the income approach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The chancellor was not convinced by YEI\u2019s contention that Lipman\u2019s appraisal method necessarily must have accounted for the value of the improvements, contrary to the dictates of the option:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">VEI has also argued that Mr. Lipman\u2019s income approach violates the terms of the option because the cap rate is dependent upon the value of the leasehold improvements which is prohibited or, or the option provides that the value of the leasehold improvements shall not be taken into account. Mr. Lipman testified that the fact that there were improvements that existed on the property secured the rental income stream because tenants would not walk away or not be, would not be likely to walk away from the improvements that they had paid to build.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Instead, the chancellor credited Lipman\u2019s explicit assurances that such value had not been considered in rendering the appraisal. He emphasized his decision to credit Lipman\u2019s explanations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">But he was clear in his testimony that he did not consider the value of those improvements. Mr. Rosenberg emphasized Mr. Lipman\u2019s statement in his report, which no criticism of that, Mr. Rosenberg is a very good lawyer and picked up on something that Mr. Lipman had said in his report and had apparently repeated in his deposition which states that he considered the value of the improvements but Mr. Lipman explained that he did not consider a specific value of the improvements to be added to his opinion on the overall valuation of the property. The value of the buildings did not enter his valuation, rather it was the existence of those improvements that were merely a risk factor in determining the cap rate. Mr. Lipman did not select a cap rate based on the value of the improvements. It was merely their existence that was apparently incorporated in the cap rate and the e-mails that were introduced into evidence showed that Mr. Lipman recognized he was not to consider the value of the improvements as part of his opinion on value and the option provisions, I should say the option provision, does not prohibit Mr. Lipman from considering the existence of the improvements, rather the option prohibits him from \u201ctaking into account the value of the leasehold improvements then existing on the property and Mr. Lipman did not take into account the value of those leasehold improvements nor did he consider the rental income from those improvements, from the subleases.\u201d In other words, he did not consider the rent from Staples or H.H. Gregg or Vitamin World. I think this is important with respect to, I know Mr. Rosenberg raised the question, well, now he\u2019s saying this in Court when in his report, one line in the report, page twenty-three, said something else but to be fair, looking at his report and, in particular, the whole section that he devoted to analyzing what cap rate to use, I think the report corroborates that he did not consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the value of the improvements in determining the cap rate and I refer to Mr. Lipman\u2019s report, pages twenty-four through twenty-six when he details how he selected the cap rate and decided on the appropriate cap rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The chancellor further noted that, while Mr. Lipman \u201cdoes mention some improved properties,\u201d he confines the \u201creferences to the character of those properties, which are somewhat similar to the subject lease.\u201d The chancellor emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">Mr. Lipman does not compare the value of the improvements on the subject property to any other properties and doesn\u2019t even mention the value of the improvements on the subject property and those three pages where he details how he arrived at a cap rate. Although there was, he considered a number of factors, there was no mention of the value of the improvements in how he arrived at the cap rate. Mr. Lipman never valued the improvements and didn\u2019t assume a value of the improvements on the subject property and Mr. Lipman also testified that if he did consider the value of the improvements, his appraisal would have been significantly greater. I also note the purpose of the provision, the provision, again, not to take into account the value of the leasehold improvements in, on which all experts agree, all three experts agreed on the purpose for that provision. It was because with the option to purchase the property, the leasehold owner or the tenant who paid to build the improvements would not have to pay for them twice. In other words, the tenant would not have to pay the landowner to buy buildings that the tenant had paid to build and I find that Mr. Lipman\u2019s income valuation complies with the plain language of the option. His income valuation complies with all the terms and conditions of the option and it\u2019s consistent with the purpose of the option, that the tenant not have to pay the landholder for buildings that the tenant paid to build, therefore, I find that Mr. Lipman\u2019s appraisal using the income approach complies with, well, the testimony was that it complied with the standards of appraisal of property in the industry, he\u2019s qualified, he has the necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>experience and he was chosen by the parties. The Court, therefore, determines that the purchase price under the option to purchase to be $7,450,000.00 reduced by two and a half percent which, by my math, comes to $7,263,750.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbK\">The chancellor rejected Einbinder\u2019s counterclaim in which it asserted that the option had expired and was no longer in effect. Instead, he reinstated the parties to the positions they were in at the time of receipt of the appraisal. Pursuant to this premise, the chancellor ordered that \u201cVEI has between ninety to one hundred and eighty days to go to settlement and close on the purchase of the property and that\u2019s what I will order, that VEI has, I will prepare a written Order and from the date of that Order, VEI has between ninety to a hundred and eighty days to go to settlement, close on the purchase of the property and the price shall be $7,263,750.00.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In assessing the value of commercial real estate, appraisers generally rely on three methods for valuation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">The comparable sales approach estimates market value by looking to recent voluntary sales transactions involving properties similar to the subject property, and adjusts for any differences between each comparable property sold and the subject property. 7A P.J.

We are mindful of VEI\u2019s insistence that the appraisal indeed accounted for the value of the improvements, for, as VEI maintains in its opening brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">Mr. Lipman underscored the profound impact the value of the improvements had on his appraisal of the Property by selecting a capitalization rate which was similar to the rates used to value leases with such creditworthy corporate tenants as Walgreens, McDonald\u2019s, and Starbucks. Mr. Lip-man admitted that he did not know what the creditworthiness of VEI was and that he gave \u201cno weight\u201d to VEI\u2019s creditworthiness. Instead, as the Appraisal plainly states, Mr. Lipman selected a very low capitalization rate solely because the lease is \u201c \u2018guaranteed\u2019 by the value of the improvements.\u201d Mr. Lipman explained at trial that \u201cthe reason that this is an important consideration is that the selection of a cap rate is influenced by the security for the income stream that you\u2019re capitalizing.\u201d Mr. Lipman also testified that the value of the improvements was significant enough to secure the income stream and was much greater than $500,000, stating that \u201ccommercial buildings, in this type of location are worth many times that <em>[ie., </em>$500,000] so that\u2019s another ridiculously low number.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">Although Mr. Lipman stated that he did not value the improvements but instead relied on \u201csimply their existence,\u201d he acknowledged that there is \u201ca reasonable point at which the value of those improvements contribute ... sufficiently to make one select a capitalization rate ... that reflects the security of the income stream.\u201d Recognizing that this point had been reached in this case, Mr. Lipman testified that \u201cthis is a highly secure income stream and highly secured income stream deserves a lower rate of return.\u201d Terry Dunkin, who testified as an expert for Einbinder, agreed, stating that because \u201cthe amount of risk in collecting the rent\u201d from VEI \u201cis minimal,\u201d this \u201cis a very secure situation and, therefore, the interest rate is very low.\u201d The value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the improvements, therefore, played a central role in determining the appraised value of the Property because, as Mr. Lipman testified, \u201cthe lower the cap rate, the higher the value given the same income stream.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Notwithstanding, during vigorous examination by VEI\u2019s counsel, Lipman clarified language in the appraisal report that suggested he had valued the improvements on the Property in contravention of the Option.

State, </em>421 Md. 332, 353, 26 A.3d 918 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Nor are we persuaded that references to the <em>existence </em>of the improvements as one factor in assessing the income potential of the property, would entail a consideration of the <em>value </em>of the improvements, a factor that the option dictated should not be considered. There is a basic distinction between the discrete value of specific improvements on commercial property and the role such property plays in adding value to the income stream. VEI, and Circuit City before it, paid to construct the improvements on the property. The cost of the brick and mortar should not be borne anew and that idea is not in dispute. But the presence of improvements may constitute an income multiplier and its potential to enhance the income stream is one hallmark of the overall value of commercial property whose role it is to produce income.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">It bears emphasis that it is the \u201ccost to reproduce method,\u201d an approach not employed here, pursuant to which the value of improvements plays a key role in property valuation. As noted by the Court in <em>Cordish, </em>\u201c[u]nder the cost to reproduce method, market value is the cost to build the same building or improvement on the land on which the property at issue is located.\u201d <em>Cordish, </em>427 Md. at 5, 45 A.3d 273 (citation omitted). In other words, the \u201ccost approach [is] that which is predicated on the concept that the total value of improved property is equivalent to the market value of the land plus the cost of the improvements.\u201d Julius L. Sackman, <em>The Limitations of the Cost Approach </em>(1968), in Readings in Real Property Valuation Principles, <em>ante, </em>at 225. Had Lipman intended to account for the cost value of the improvements, he would likely have utilized the cost approach to value the Property. In this case, Lipman offered one appraisal pursuant to the sales comparison method. When faced with the requirement that he consider Circuit City\u2019s right of first refusal, extension rights and the absence of a brokerage commission, Lipman virtually was compelled to employ the income approach, essentially the sole remaining valuation par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>adigm. Indeed, the record supports the conclusion that the use of this method did not violate the Option.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">We hold, first, that, for purposes of maintaining its right to appeal, VEI did not acquiesce in the chancellor\u2019s ruling by going to settlement on the Property. We also conclude that the chancellor correctly determined that the appraisal rendered by Lipman conformed to the dictates of the Option agreement in that it did not account for the value of the improvements; the chancellor did not err by declaring that the valuation methodology based on the \u201cincome approach\u201d conformed to the requirements of the Option.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\">. There is essentially no serious factual dispute, although a challenge to the credibility of the appraiser is implicit in VEI's argument. The background factual recitation that is necessary to address the issue before us is primarily based on the parties\u2019 \"Stipulation of Facts.\u201d Testimony from the two days of hearings will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\">.

The Court held that Franzen's appeal was nevertheless barred, because there was no final judgment or complete adjudication of the rights of the parties to that action, such that there were none of the factors that would constitute legal coercion\u2014no judgment lien or right of execution. That case involved both actions at law and a related action for equitable relief. According to the Court, \"[p]re-final judgment payment is a settlement of a claim in advance of a judicial determination, from which, of course, no appeal will lie.\u201d <em>Franzen v. Dubinok, </em>290 Md. 65, 74-75, 427 A.2d 1002 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b341-10\">. Einbinder also asserts that VEI \u201ccannot obtain\u201d the relief it seeks on appeal as a matter of law, <em>viz., </em>that this Court vacate the chancellor\u2019s ruling and direct a new appraisal. In view of our disposition of this case, we do not address this specific preservation argument. We note in passing that a ruling in favor of VEI on appeal would not necessarily entail a complete reversal of the chancellor's ruling and require a new appraisal. The chancellor and, even this Court in the appropriate instance, could have fashioned such equitable relief as deemed appropriate, short of requiring a new appraisal. <em>Cf. Howard v.
