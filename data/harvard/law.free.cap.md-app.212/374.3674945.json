Some of the vehicles, parked on a nearby street and in an alleyway, were impeding if not blocking traffic; others, parked in a fenced lot and on the lawn of an adjacent property owned by Dehn Motor Sales, LLC, were leaking fluids, posing both a fire and chemical hazard. Mohamed, Dehn Motor Sales, LLC, and a related entity<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (whom we shall hereafter collectively refer to as \u201cDehn Motor\u201d) then brought a replevin action in the District Court of Maryland for the return of the towed vehicles, which ended when the parties reached an agreement that the vehicles would be returned to Dehn Motor, subject to the condition that it not bring them back to the locations from which they had been towed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Following the resolution of the District Court replevin action, which was almost three years after the date the cars were towed, Dehn Motor<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against, among others, the two officers who had ordered that the vehicles be towed, Officer Joseph A. Shultz, Jr., and Sergeant Anthony Proctor,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging violations of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the United States Constitution, although no timely notice of claim had been provided pursuant to the Local Government Tort Claims Act (\u201cLGTCA\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Officer Schultz and Sergeant Proctor thereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Dehn Motor\u2019s claims were barred, first, by its failure to comply with the LGTCA, second, by its failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and third, by the officers\u2019 qualified immunity. We shall affirm not only on each of those grounds, but on a ground rejected by the circuit court, as the officers, contrary to what that court held, were engaged in a community caretaking function when they had the vehicles in question removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Farzan Mohamed was the operator and part owner<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of Dehn Motor Sales, LLC, a used car business, located on the corner of East Patapsco Avenue and Fourth Street in Baltimore City. The business encompassed three adjacent lots: a sales lot at 330 East Patapsco Avenue, a fenced vacant lot at 3554 Fourth Street, and a single family residence at 3550 Fourth Street. In 2003, the Baltimore City Police Department began receiving complaints from citizens about \u201cuntagged,\u201d \u201cunregistered,\u201d and unattended vehicles parked on the street and in an alleyway that bordered Dehn Motor\u2019s business. Those cars were reported to be blocking and inhibiting traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Responding to those complaints, Officer Joseph A. Schultz, Jr., \u201con numerous occasions,\u201d went to Dehn Motor\u2019s business. Each time, upon arrival, he instructed Mohamed or one of his employees to move the cars. Usually the cars were moved, but, when they were not, Officer Schultz issued parking tickets for each of the unmoved cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">But the complaints continued unabated. In March of 2005, upon being instructed by his supervisor to \u201ctak[e] care of the problem,\u201d Officer Schultz then went to the car lot and observed that the alley was blocked, that cars without tags were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>parked on the street, and that cars were on the lawn of the house at 3550 Fourth Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">As Mohamed was not there when he arrived, the officer informed an employee of the car lot about the complaints and told him to \u201cget this cleaned up ... by Monday.\u201d If it was not, the officer warned, he would bring \u201ceverybody\u201d back with him, including the \u201cEnvironmental Crimes Unit\u201d (\u201cECU\u201d), \u201ctransit and traffic,\u201d and \u201cinspectors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">When Monday arrived, Officer Schultz, upon personally confirming that the vehicles had not been moved as directed, left and then returned to the location of Dehn Motor\u2019s business with Sergeant Anthony Proctor,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> his supervisor, and personnel from the ECU, transit and traffic, and zoning, along with tow trucks. Upon arrival, the officers allowed Mohamed to move the vehicles blocking the alleyway that could be moved. The others were towed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">At that time, the officers also observed vehicles parked on the front and side lawns of the house on the lot at 3550 Fourth Street. Among other things, those vehicles were purportedly blocking access to that building.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As Officer Schultz described it, the cars were \u201cjammed in there\u201d and parked \u201call the way up to [the] other property line.\u201d In fact, the officers, said Schultz, \u201chad to literally climb over these cars to get to\u201d all of the vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Officer Shultz was then informed by an ECU officer that the cars surrounding the house posed a hazard, as \u201cfluids\u201d from the vehicles were \u201cseeping right into the ground.\u201d Fearing that the cars were also creating a \u201chorrific\u201d fire hazard because of the gasoline in their tanks and because they blocked the fire department\u2019s access to the house, and recalling that only a \u201cweek or two before\u201d there had been a fire in Dundalk \u201cwhere four houses burned down, under the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>means,\u201d Officer Schultz and Sergeant Proctor had the cars surrounding the house towed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Officer Schultz further observed, within the fenced lot located at 3554 Fourth Street: \u201chalf cars,\u201d \u201ccars with the motor sticking out,\u201d \u201ccars sitting on top of other cars,\u201d \u201cengine parts,\u201d \u201ctransmissions,\u201d and \u201cmotors\u201d and was informed by \u201czoning\u201d personnel that Dehn Motor only had a permit for \u201can auto dealership and light mechanical work, not for a body shop and heavy mechanical work\u201d and certainly not for a \u201cjunkyard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Upon closer examination of the fenced lot, the officers found that the cars were \u201cleaking fluids,\u201d which were \u201cleaching into the ground.\u201d Officer Shultz could \u201csee the fluids leaking out of the motors ... [and] antifreeze coming out of the radiators.\u201d When ECU detectives advised Sergeant Proctor that the \u201ccars presented] an immediate ... chemical and fire hazard to the community\u201d and that their removal \u201cwould resolve the hazardous situation,\u201d he had the vehicles towed to \u201cremove the hazard.\u201d The officers were also concerned, according to Officer Schultz, that the fluids that were \u201crunning into the soil in that area,\u201d were also \u201cgoing down the storm drains\u201d as well, expanding the threat of the hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Before leaving this scene, police department personnel provided Dehn Motor with a list of the vehicles towed from the street, alleyway, lawn, and fenced lot. The list showed that a total of sixty-one vehicles had been towed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Dehn Motor thereafter requested and received an administrative hearing as to each of three cars that had been towed, to contest the removal by police of that particular vehicle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As a result of those hearings, it was determined that two of the vehicles should be returned to Dehn Motor and that it would not have to pay any towing or storage fees as to those vehicles, but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>it would have to pay such fees for the return of the third vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">While those hearings were pending, on April 19, 2005, eighteen days after the cars had been towed, Dehn Motor filed an action for replevin in the District Court seeking the return of the vehicles. Named as defendants in that suit were the Director of the Baltimore City Department of Transportation, Alford Foxx; the \u201cActing Tow Manager\u201d for the Baltimore City Department of Transportation, Richard Hooper; and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore. The suit ended when the parties agreed that the vehicles would be returned to Dehn Motor, who would not have to pay the towing and storage fees, but in return, Dehn Motor agreed that it would not return the vehicles to the locations from which they had been towed. The District Court signed an order dated March 12, 2008, reflecting that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Circuit Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">After the District Court replevin action had concluded, Mohamed, Dehn Motor, LLC, and the businesses Mohamed operated at that site<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> filed a complaint, sixteen days later, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against, among others,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Officer Schultz and Sergeant Proctor\u2014neither of whom had been named in the replevin action. The suit alleged, for the first time, violations of Articles 19, 24, and 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Ultimately, Dehn Motor and the officers filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The circuit court promptly mailed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>notice to the parties informing them that a hearing on the motions would be held on February 4, 2011, and that any response to those motions must be filed by January 7, 2011,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but neither side filed a response by that date. On January 25, 2011, the circuit court sent to the parties a reminder of the date on which the hearing would be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">On February 3, 2011, the day before the hearing was to be held on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment and almost thirty days after the court\u2019s deadline for a response had passed, Dehn Motor filed a response to Officer Schultz and Sergeant Proctor\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The next day, the court began the hearing on the cross-motions by inquiring as to why Dehn Motor\u2019s response had been filed so late. When the court found the explanation offered by Dehn Motor\u2019s counsel unpersuasive, it struck the response.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The circuit court, after hearing argument, denied Dehn Motor\u2019s motion for summary judgment but granted the summary judgment motion of Officer Schultz and Sergeant Proctor. The court found that Dehn Motor had not complied with the notice requirement of the LGTCA, declaring that the replevin suit Dehn Motor filed in the District Court \u201cwas not notice to anyone ... that there was a claim against these two officers, a claim for money damages\u201d and thus that Dehn Motor had failed to comply with the LGTCA. In so holding, the court disposed of Dehn Motor\u2019s claims under the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">It then turned to Dehn Motor\u2019s federal constitutional claims and held that it had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The seizure of the vehicles was lawful, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>court opined, because the officers were acting pursuant to Article 19, \u00a7 50-2;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Article 19, \u00a7 50-11;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Article 31, \u00a7 6-3;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Article 31, \u00a7 <em>SIS', </em><footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and Article 31, \u00a7 31-8<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> of the Baltimore City Code whose constitutionality had not been challenged, because the response that had addressed those provisions had been struck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>by the court for untimeliness. The court further held that, even if the provisions of the Baltimore City Code did not bestow upon the officers the legal authority to tow the vehicles, the officers nonetheless were protected by qualified immunity from any federal claims against them for that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Having found that the Baltimore City Code authorized the officers\u2019 actions, the court then addressed the officers\u2019 claim that the seizure of Dehn Motor\u2019s vehicles was lawful under the community caretaking function. The court disagreed, stating that it did not think that the officers were acting pursuant to their community caretaking role because that function involved activities by the police such as responding to car accidents or checking houses for possible burglaries, and not the kind of action taken by police in the case at bar. Following the subsequent denial of its motion to alter or amend, Dehn Motor noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">As this is an appeal from the grant of summary judgment in favor of the officers, we turn to Maryland Rule 2-501, the rule governing summary judgment. Subsection (f) of that rule provides that, upon a party\u2019s motion for summary judgment, a court \u201cshall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Because there was no dispute below as to any material fact, we proceed to the question of whether the officers were \u201centitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d To answer that question, we conduct a review de novo of the legal determinations made by the circuit court, which are the subject of this appeal. <em>Frazier v. Castle Ford, Ltd., </em>200 Md.App. 285, 294, 27 A.3d 583 (2011), <em>aff'd in part, </em>430 Md. 144, 59 A.3d 1016 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Dehn Motor contends that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on the grounds that the replevin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>action it filed in the District Court did not comply with the notice requirement of the LGTCA.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Dehn Motor insists that, in accordance with the LGTCA, its replevin action did provide sufficient notice to the City of the \u201ctime, place and cause of [Dehn Motor\u2019s] injury\u201d and gave the City an adequate opportunity to investigate the incident and prepare for any other claim that might be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">As a consequence, we begin our discussion by addressing, first, the question of what does the notice provision demand, and, second, the question of whether Dehn Motor\u2019s replevin action satisfies that mandate. To begin with, we note that section 5\u2014304(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (\u201cCJP\u201d) sets forth the LGTCA\u2019s notice requirements. That section requires a notice of the claim under the LGTCA be given within 180 days of the injury alleged. Specifically, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\"><em>Notice </em>Required.\u2014Except as provided in subsections (a) and (d) of this section, an action for unliquidated damages may not be brought against a local government or its employees unless the notice of the claim required by this section is given within 180 days after the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">To whom the notice is to be given is set out in CJP \u00a7 5-304(c)(3)(i), which requires that, as for the City of Baltimore, notice is to be given to the City Solicitor. As for the form and content of the notice, CJP \u00a7 5\u2014304(b)(2) states that \u201c[t]he notice shall be in -writing and shall state the time, place, and cause of the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The notice provision of the LGTCA is a \u201ccondition precedent to maintaining an action directly against a local government or its employees,\u201d <em>Hansen v. City of Laurel, </em>420 Md. 670, 682, 25 A.3d 122 (2011), but, strict compliance with that provision is not required. A notice, may, if it substantial<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>ly complies with the notice requirement, \u201csatisfy the statute where the purpose of the notice requirement is fulfilled.\u201d <em>Moore v. Norouzi, </em>371 Md. 154, 168, 807 A.2d 632 (2002). The purpose of the notice requirement, the Court of Appeals has said, is to apprise a municipality \u201c \u2018of its possible liability at a time when it could conduct its own investigation, <em>i.e., </em>while the evidence was still fresh and the recollection of the witnesses was undiminished by time, sufficient to ascertain the character and extent of the injury and its responsibility in connection with it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167-68, 807 A.2d 632 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Williams v. Maynard, </em>359 Md. 379, 389-90, 754 A.2d 379 (2000)). To fulfill that purpose, the notice must set forth the \u201c \u2018facts and circumstances giving rise to the claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faulk v. Ewing, </em>371 Md. 284, 299, 808 A.2d 1262 (2002) (quoting <em>Condon v. Univ. of Maryland, </em>332 Md. 481, 496, 632 A.2d 753 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In the instant case, the District Court replevin action did not forewarn, as a notice of claim must, that an action for unliquidated damages may follow; in fact, it suggested the contrary: Dehn Motor\u2019s replevin claim was only against the City. More importantly, the only issue raised by the replevin action was the return of the vehicles, the towing fees that had been charged, and any damages for the temporary detention of the vehicles. There was no reason to suspect from the replevin action\u2014which Dehn Motor claims was comparable to a notice of claim\u2014that Sergeant Proctor and Officer Schultz were potential parties. Nor was there any reason to believe, from the nature of the action, that constitutional claims were waiting in the wings. The matter was thereafter settled by the return of the vehicles and the lifting of towing and storage fees, in exchange for the promise by Dehn Motor not to return the vehicles to the locations from which they had been towed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The relief sought by Dehn Motor in the replevin suit was the return of its towed vehicles, without having to pay the towing and storage fees, as well as damages for the seizure and detention of the vehicles. No other injuries were alleged. Nor could they have been as a replevin action entails very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>limited relief, namely, the return of the vehicles and damages caused by the detention of the vehicles. <em>Koch v. Mack Int\u2019l Motor Truck Corp., </em>201 Md. 562, 572, 95 A.2d 105 (1953) (stating that \u201cdamages in replevin actions are for the detention of the chattel\u201d). Moreover, the replevin complaint gave no warning, expressed or implied, that the officers might be future defendants in a more substantial and thus more threatening action in an altogether different court involving constitutional claims and that the City could also face additional and substantial damage claims, far greater than those that could be advanced in a replevin action. While the replevin suit requested limited damages, the circuit court action demanded $500,000 in compensatory damages and $1,000,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In sum, the failure to provide a separate notice of a claim of unliquidated damages had troubling consequences. If, in addition to filing their replevin complaint in the District Court, Dehn Motor had sent a notice of claim to the Baltimore City Solicitor, the City would have been on notice that Dehn Motor might file an additional and significantly larger lawsuit. Provided with such notice, the City would have been on notice of the need to conduct a more extensive investigation, and would have probably provided the officers with counsel during the replevin proceeding at which they were called as witnesses or the officers would have obtained counsel on their own. Moreover, the City agreed to settle the replevin action unaware that another larger suit would follow, and, had it been put on notice of that, it would have probably requested, we presume, that Dehn Motor release it and its employees from liability for any future claims arising from the towing of Dehn Motor\u2019s vehicles. Thus, instead of aiding the City in preparing for a possible future suit, as is the purpose of the notice requirement, the replevin suit hindered that preparation by misleadingly suggesting that the City only faced an action of a limited nature. If it was on notice of an \u201caction for unliquidated damages,\u201d it was a notice of a deceptively small amount of such damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Because the replevin action did not adequately inform the City \u201cof its possible liability\u201d in an action for unliquidated damages, Dehn Motor did not substantially comply with the notice requirement of the LGTCA. <em>Moore, </em>371 Md. at 167-68, 807 A.2d 632. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the officers as to Dehn Motor\u2019s state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Dehn Motor contends that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on the grounds that it had failed to state a constitutional claim upon which relief could be granted under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Once Officer Schultz and Sergeant Proctor moved for summary judgment, it was incumbent upon Dehn Motor to \u201cbring forth evidence of a genuine dispute as to a material fact in order to proceed to trial.\u201d <em>Scroggins v. Dahne, </em>335 Md. 688, 691, 645 A.2d 1160 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the circuit court struck Dehn Motor\u2019s response to that motion on the grounds that it was filed the day before the hearing and almost a month after the day it was due, there was no written opposition to Officer Shultz and Sergeant Proctor\u2019s claim that the Baltimore City Code authorized them to have the vehicles towed for the court to consider.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Nonetheless, at the hearing on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the court asked Dehn Motor\u2019s counsel what his response was to the officers\u2019 reliance on the Baltimore City Code in their joint motion, but no response specifically addressing that query was forthcoming. In the absence of a response, the circuit court found that the officers \u201cwere acting under the provisions of the City Code\u201d when they towed the vehicles in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The code provisions cited by the officers prohibited the obstruction of streets and alleys,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> authorized the towing of obstructing vehicles,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and permitted the removal of vehicles stored on private property in violation of zoning laws.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Given the failure of Dehn Motor to dispute the officers\u2019 claim that they acted pursuant to the Baltimore City Code, the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment as to Dehn Motor\u2019s Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims. Moreover, that court, we observe, could have also granted summary judgment as to those federal constitutional claims on a ground which it rejected, namely, namely, that the vehicles were towed pursuant to the officers\u2019 community caretaking function.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The circuit court dismissed that claim, not because it did not believe the uncontroverted testimony of Officer Schultz and Sergeant Proctor that they had the vehicles towed because they posed an immediate chemical and fire hazard, but because the court did not think that community caretaking encompassed such an action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Community caretaking is \u201can umbrella that encompasses at least three other doctrines\u201d: (1) the emergency aid doctrine, (2) the automobile impoundment/inventory doctrine, and (3) the public welfare doctrine. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>409 Md. 415, 430, 975 A.2d 877 (2009). The emergency aid doctrine allows police officers \u201cto act without a warrant when they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>reasonably believe a person needs immediate attention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 975 A.2d 877. It \u201cis justified because the motivation for the intrusion is to preserve life rather than to search for evidence to be used in a criminal investigation.\u201d <em>Stanberry v. State, 343 </em>Md. 720, 742-43, 684 A.2d 823 (1996) (quoting <em>State v. Carlson, </em>548 N.W.2d 138, 141 (Iowa 1996)). The public welfare doctrine \u201cencompasses a non-investigative, non-criminal role [that the police havel to ensure the safety and welfare of our citizens.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>409 Md. at 437, 975 A.2d 877 (quoting <em>Williams v. State, </em>962 A.2d 210, 218 (Del.2008)). It may be invoked \u201c[w]hen the police act to protect the public in a manner outside their normal law enforcement function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 975 A.2d 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The emergency aid doctrine and the public welfare doctrine \u201coften overlap\u201d as both invoke the role of police officers in promoting and securing the safety of citizens. <em>Id. </em>at 432, 975 A.2d 877. When such a duty arises, the standard for assessing the lawfulness of police conduct under the Fourth Amendment is whether, absent a warrant, the police \u201cpossessed a reasonable basis for doing what they did,\u201d or, in other words, \u201cwhether there [was] evidence which would lead a prudent and reasonable official to see a need to act.\u201d <em>State v. Alexander, </em>124 Md.App. 258, 277, 721 A.2d 275 (1998) (quoting 3 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure \u00a7 </em>6.6(a), at 391 (3d ed.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In the instant case, the officers were acting as community caretakers when they had Dehn Motor\u2019s vehicles towed. Their purpose in doing so, as the undisputed facts showed, was to safeguard the community from the immediate and significant fire and chemical hazards that the cars posed. Officer Schultz described the fire hazard as \u201chorrific,\u201d recalling how a fire had destroyed four houses under similar circumstances a week or two earlier. He testified that the cars were towed because of \u201cthe fire hazards [and] the environmental hazards that were immediate.\u201d Sergeant Proctor, moreover, was informed by the ECU detectives that the \u201ccars presented] an immediate ... chemical and fire hazard to the community\u201d and that \u201cthe removal of the vehicles would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>resolve the hazardous situation.\u201d He had the cars towed to \u201cremove the hazard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The testimony of Officer Schultz and Sergeant Proctor clearly established that they were acting to remediate hazardous conditions that posed an immediate and significant threat to the community and that they had reasonable grounds to believe that those conditions existed based on what they personally observed and based on what the ECU detectives had advised after reviewing the situation. Lest any doubt remain that the officers were acting in a \u201cnon-investigative, non-criminal role,\u201d we need only recall that the officers permitted Mohamed to move any vehicles that blocked the alleyway that could be moved, even though they were parked in violation of the City Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Because the purpose of the officers was to \u201censure the safety and welfare of our citizens,\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>409 Md. at 437, 975 A.2d 877, and \u201cthere [was] evidence which would [have led] a prudent and reasonable official to [have seen] a need to act,\u201d <em>Alexander, </em>124 Md.App. at 277, 721 A.2d 275, the officers acted reasonably in having the vehicles towed to remove the immediate chemical and fire hazards. Consequently, the circuit court did not err in granting the officers\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Dehn Motor\u2019s Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims because, in addition to granting it on the grounds that the officers were acting lawfully pursuant to the Baltimore City Code, it could have and should have also granted their motion on the grounds that they were acting as community caretakers when they had Dehn Motor\u2019s cars towed.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Finally, we also affirm the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to Dehn Motor\u2019s federal constitutional claims because the officers were protected from such claims by the qualified immunity they had when they had Dehn Motor\u2019s vehicles towed. \u201cQualified immunity shields government officials from civil damages liability unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.\u201d <em>Reichle v. </em>Howards, - U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2088, 2093, 182 L.Ed.2d 985 (2012). To be clearly established, \u201cexisting precedent must have placed\u201d the constitutional right \u201cbeyond debate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 2080, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011)). Furthermore, that right must not be a \u201cbroad proposition,\u201d but rather be \u201cparticularized\u201d such that the \u201ccontours of the right are clear to a reasonable official.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2094 (quotation marks omitted). Finally, qualified immunity applies whether the mistake by the official is one of law, fact, or a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 129 S.Ct. 808, 815, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The next question is whether the police were required to obtain a warrant or court order before towing the vehicles, which were located on Dehn Motor\u2019s property, but which presented an immediate hazard to the community. Dehn Motor claims they were, citing four cases which it insists clearly established that the police could not tow vehicles, parked on their owner\u2019s property, without a warrant or court order, namely: <em>Duncan v. State, </em>281 Md. 247, 378 A.2d 1108 (1977); <em>One 1995 Corvette VIN </em># <em>1G1YY22P585103433 v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>353 Md. 114, 724 A.2d 680 (1999); <em>Huemmer v. Mayor and City Council of Ocean City, </em>632 F.2d 371 (4th Cir.1980); and <em>De Franks v. Mayor and City Council of Ocean City, 777 </em>F.2d 185, 187 (4th Cir.1985). But none of these cases suggest that it was necessary for officers to obtain a warrant or court order before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>towing vehicles which posed an immediate threat to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">In <em>Duncan, </em>while the police were investigating a reported shoplifting complaint, they received a call from a homeowner who reported that two men had parked a car on the homeowner\u2019s lawn and then left. 281 Md. at 250-51, 378 A.2d 1108. The police, upon arriving at her home, noted that the vehicle parked on the homeowner\u2019s lawn matched the description of the car associated with the shoplifting complaint and began to search for the two men who had left it there. The officers found and arrested Cornell Smith and Sherman Duncan. When the two men denied any connection with the parked car, the officers proceeded to search the car \u201cto verify ownership\u201d and \u201csecure\u201d it. <em>Id. </em>at 252, 378 A.2d 1108. In the trunk of that vehicle, they found plastic trash bags filled with clothing. The clothing still had tags on. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">When Smith and Duncan\u2019s motions to suppress the clothing were denied and Smith was convicted of theft and Duncan was convicted of receiving stolen goods, they noted an appeal. Although this Court affirmed their convictions, the Court of Appeals took a different view. It reversed, holding that the search of the vehicle was not lawful, because the police did not have the authority to seize the vehicle. The Court reasoned that, since the car was on private property and \u201cnot impeding traffic or threatening public safety and convenience,\u201d the officers were not authorized to seize the car. <em>Id. </em>at 259, 378 A.2d 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">But the instant case is clearly distinguishable from <em>Duncan. </em>Unlike in <em>Duncan, </em>the vehicles towed by Officer Schultz and Sergeant Proctor were \u201cthreatening public safety\u201d and, therefore, <em>Duncan </em>does not establish that the police, acting as community caretakers, could not have lawfully towed Dehn Motor\u2019s cars without a warrant or court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Nor does <em>One 1995 Corvette, </em>clearly establish a requirement that police must obtain a warrant or court order before towing vehicles. In that case, Weldon Connell Holmes was stopped by police because they had observed what they believed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>a drag transaction take place between him and another individual. Holmes was arrested \u201con drug-related charges\u201d and his car, where he had been seated when the suspected drug transaction had occurred, was seized by the police who then instigated a forfeiture proceeding. When Holmes objected to the introduction of drugs that had been found in the car, on the grounds that they had been obtained in an illegal search, the trial court excluded that evidence and dismissed the forfeiture proceeding. 353 Md. at 116-17, 724 A.2d 680. But, when the case reached the Court of Appeals, the only issue before that Court was whether the exclusionary rule applied to civil forfeiture proceedings, an issue which is not now before us. Moreover, <em>One 1995 Corvette, </em>had nothing to do with towing a vehicle that posed a hazard to the community and hardly established that Sergeant Proctor and Officer Schultz had to obtain a warrant or court order before towing Dehn Motor\u2019s vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Finally, Dehn Motor also cites two cases from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in support of its shaky proposition that the officers needed a warrant or court order to tow its cars, from its property, when they posed a peril to the community. They are: <em>Huemmer v. Mayor and City Council of Ocean City </em>and <em>De Franks v. Mayor and City Council of Ocean City, </em>both of which dealt with an Ocean City parking ordinance. The ordinance at issue in those two cases allowed a property owner to have a vehicle towed if it was illegally parked on his property. To retrieve the car, its owner had to pay towing and storage charges without having an opportunity to contest the validity of the tow.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In <em>Huemmer, </em>the Fourth Circuit held that Ocean City\u2019s ordinance was \u201cmanifestly defective\u201d because it did not allow for \u201cnotice and a hearing to establish whether or not the initial removal of the vehicle was rightful or wrongful.\u201d 632 F.2d at 372. Thereafter, Ocean City amended that ordinance to require that the owner of a towed vehicle be given notice, within one working day of the tow; that he be given a hearing, if he requested one, on the validity of the tow; and that such a hearing was to take place within twenty-four hours of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>hearing request. In <em>De Franks, </em>the Fourth Circuit held that Ocean City\u2019s post-tow notice and hearing satisfied constitutional requirements. 777 F.2d at 187. Neither of these cases remotely suggest that officers must obtain a warrant or court order before towing vehicles that pose a danger to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.
