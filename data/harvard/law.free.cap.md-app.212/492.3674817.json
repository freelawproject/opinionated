He suffered from numerous mental illnesses and before that day had been admitted to MGH for psychiatric treatment at least four times. He was examined by a nurse and an ER doctor, given a sedative, and was awaiting a psychiatric evaluation. Before the evaluation took place, he walked through the ER to a back door, and left the hospital. Clad only in a hospital gown, he walked in the cold weather in the direction of his house. When he got to the Howard Street Bridge, he saw police cars and two police officers slowly approaching him. He jumped off the bridge, fracturing his pelvis, left wrist, right arm, and right leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>In the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Crise sued MGH for medical negligence, alleging that steps should have been taken to monitor him so he would not have left the ER.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The case went to trial, with the first day devoted to jury selection. The next morning, the court entered judgment in favor of MGH on its own initiative, under Rule 2-502, on the ground that MGH did not owe Crise a legal duty of care. Specifically, the court ruled that MGH had no legal authority to keep Crise in the hospital, and his malpractice claim depended upon MGH\u2019s having such authority. Crise filed a motion for reconsideration or a new trial, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">On appeal, Crise presents one question for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">Did the lower court err in ruling that [MGH] owed [him], its patient, no duty of care unless it had the legal authority to detain him?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the ruling was in error. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Crise, now age 30, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 17. In the intervening years, he also was diagnosed at various times with schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, and depression. He has been admitted voluntarily to numerous Maryland hospitals for psychiatric treatment. At the time pertinent to this case, he was living with his mother, Mary Joanell Crise (\u201cMs. Crise\u201d), and his teenage sister, Mary Crise (\u201cMary\u201d), at a house in the Remington neighborhood of Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">Before the events giving rise to this litigation, Crise had been admitted to the psychiatric unit at MGH at least four times, most recently in June of 2008. On that occasion, Ms. Crise took Crise to the MGH ER because he had been \u201cnon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>compliant with treatment\u201d and was \u201cbecoming increasingly psychotic.\u201d He had not been taking his medications or sleeping and was exhibiting \u201cpressured speech.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was admitted to MGH\u2019s psychiatric unit for eight days with diagnoses of \u201c[sjchizoaffective disorder chronic in acute exacerbation\u201d and severe hypertension. During that admission, MGH maintained a \u201cphysically safe and emotionally supportive milieu\u201d for Crise; monitored him \u201cclose[lyj ... to prevent any harm to himself or others\u201d; counseled him about environmental stressors; encouraged him to attend counseling and group therapy; and adjusted his medications. Crise was discharged when his psychosis was under control and his treating doctors at MGH determined that he could \u201cadequately and safely be managed in the community ... and that he would be no danger to himself or to others.\u201d He was prescribed Seroquel and Depakote, both to be taken twice daily,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and two medications for hypertension.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The events giving rise to the instant litigation began around 2:30 p.m. on December 31, 2008, when Crise, then age 25, arrived at MGH\u2019s ER accompanied by Ms. Crise and Mary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>He was complaining of chest pain and heart palpitations. Upon arrival in the E.R., Ms. Crise told the nurses that Crise had bipolar disorder and was experiencing a psychiatric crisis. She further informed the nurses that for the past five days Crise had not taken his prescribed psychiatric medications, eaten, had anything to drink, or slept.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Vicki Chitwood, R.N., the ER Head Nurse, immediately took Crise to Room 3 to have his cardiac condition evaluated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Room 3 is ten to twelve feet from the nurses\u2019 station. It contains a stretcher that the patient assigned to the room uses as a bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">At 2:45 p.m., Nurse Chitwood performed an initial triage assessment of Crise, recording her notes on a \u201cPhysical Assessment Flow Sheet\u201d (\u201cNursing Assessment\u201d). Ms. Crise and Mary were present at that time. Also present was Trina Dixon Holmes, a patient care technician (\u201cPCT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">With respect to Crise\u2019s health history, Nurse Chitwood checked a box on the Nursing Assessment for \u201cMental Illness,\u201d making handwritten notations of \u201cBipolar\u201d and \u201cAcute Mania.\u201d She wrote that Crise was living with his family members and that in the last three months he had been prescribed Depakote 250 mg, Depakote 500 mg, and Trazadone 500 mg.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Crise\u2019s chief complaint was \u201cchest pain\u201d that had started earlier that day. He reported a history of panic attacks and said he had not slept or taken his psychiatric medications for five days. In the neurological assessment part of the Nursing Assessment, Nurse Chitwood wrote that Crise was appropriately dressed; alert; oriented to person, place, time, and event; anxious and restless; and had clear but \u201cpressured\u201d speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>In the psychiatric assessment, Nurse Chitwood noted that, according to Ms. Crise, Crise was suicidal and had a history of prior suicide attempts. Specifically, Ms. Crise advised that, just a few months earlier, Crise had become manic and had run naked along a highway in Delaware. Crise \u201cdenie[d] active suicidal ideation,\u201d however, and was not homicidal. Nurse Chitwood checked the \u201cauditory hallucinations\u201d box on the Nursing Assessment form.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Following Nurse Chitwood\u2019s initial evaluation, another ER nurse, Digma Lagmay, R.N., briefly took over Crise\u2019s care. At her request, Crise disrobed and donned a hospital gown. MGH staff performed a \u201csharps check\u201d to make sure Crise did not have any weapons or sharp objects in his possession. MGH policy mandates that all psychiatric patients undergo a \u201csharps check.\u201d All of these tests were performed around 3:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Brian Finnegan, M.D., the attending physician in the ER that day, ordered blood and urine tests to evaluate Crise\u2019s cardiac function and determine whether he was under the influence of narcotics or alcohol. The latter tests are standard \u201cpsych labs.\u201d Nurse Lagmay inserted an intravenous (\u201cIV\u201d) line, started IV fluids, administered oxygen, and performed an EKG.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">According to Mary, while Crise was undergoing the EKG, Ms. Crise handwrote a note and gave it to a nurse at the nurses\u2019 station. At the top of the note, Ms. Crise wrote the date, the time Crise had arrived in the E.R., and his full name, date of birth, and address. She also wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">Diagnosis-Acute mania</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGB\">Bipolar Mental Illness</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>patient has not slept for 5 days</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">No sleep.

At the bottom of the note, Ms. Crise listed Crise\u2019s current medications and dosages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">At some point, Ms. Crise and Mary returned to the ER waiting room. They may have been directed to do so by staff because Crise did not want them with him or because the staff found Ms. Crise to be disruptive.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> PCT Holmes overheard Ms. Crise protesting that she could not leave Crise alone because, if she did, he would leave the ER. She was \u201cbegging [them]\u201d to watch him to make sure he did not leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">At 3:20 p.m., Dr. Finnegan examined Crise. He already had reviewed the EKG results, which were normal. He recorded his observations on an \u201cEmergency Physician Record.\u201d He noted that Crise was complaining of chest pain and heart palpitations that \u201ccome[][and] go[]\u201d and \u201ctightness\u201d around his mid-sternum. Crise told Dr. Finnegan that he had not slept in three days and had not eaten \u201cmuch\u201d either. In addition to chest pain, Crise reported having a sore throat and a headache.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">Dr. Finnegan reviewed Crise\u2019s records from prior admissions to MGH, noting the previous diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and hypertension. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>He observed Crise to be oriented, with normal mood and affect; alert; and in \u201cno acute distress.\u201d He observed that Crise appeared \u201canxious.\u201d Crise did not report being suicidal or homicidal and denied that he was experiencing hallucinations. Dr. Finnegan did not speak to Ms. Crise or Mary. Dr. Finnegan acknowledged during his deposition that ordinarily he speaks to family members when evaluating patients for psychiatric problems and, had he known that Ms. Crise and Mary were in the ER waiting area, he would have communicated with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Dr. Finnegan\u2019s clinical impression was that Crise was suffering from \u201canxiety, bipolar, mania, [and] chest pains.\u201d He concluded that the likely cause of the heart palpitations was anxiety. He wrote an order for Crise to be assessed by a crisis evaluator. Crisis evaluators are not physicians and do not work on-site at MGH. They are expected to arrive to perform an evaluation within 90 minutes of being contacted. It is MGH\u2019s policy that a crisis evaluator will not be contacted until a patient\u2019s blood and urine laboratory tests have been returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Around 4:30 p.m., Elizabeth Svehla, R.N., the ER charge nurse, took over Crise\u2019s nursing care.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">At 4:41 p.m., Crise\u2019s lab work came back. Nurse Svehla reported to Dr. Finnegan that all the test results were normal. The results did not reveal the presence of alcohol or narcotics in Crise\u2019s system and confirmed that he had not been taking his psychiatric medications, as those drugs were present in his blood below any therapeutic level.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">At 5:00 p.m., a crisis evaluator was called.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Throughout the more than two hours that Crise had been in the ER, he had remained in Room 3, which was \u201cin [Nurse Svehla\u2019s] direct eyesight\u201d from the nurses\u2019 station. Upon taking over his care, she began watching Crise to \u201cmake sure he [stayed] in the room.\u201d She observed him \u201cclimbing off of the stretcher [in his room] and being restless\u201d; \u201cpacing\u201d around his room; and \u201coccasionally venturing out and looking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>at the other patients.\u201d On several occasions, Nurse Svehla or other hospital staff redirected Crise back to his bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">PCT Holmes advised Nurse Svehla that Ms. Crise told her that Crise needed to be watched and was likely to run. She volunteered to act as a \u201csitter.\u201d A sitter is a hospital employee, usually a PCT, assigned to monitor a patient one-on-one. If the patient exhibits any harmful or dangerous behavior or attempts to leave, the sitter is to alert medical or security staff. According to PCT Holmes, Nurse Svehla responded that the ER did not have enough staff to assign a sitter and that Crise had been placed in Room 3, across from the nurses\u2019 station, so she (Nurse Svehla) could \u201ceyeball\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Because Crise was exhibiting \u201cincreasingly restless\u201d behavior, Nurse Svehla contacted Dr. Finnegan and requested medication to calm him down. At 5:30 p.m., Dr. Finnegan ordered that Crise be given 1 milligram of Ativan, a sedative, by IV. Nurse Svehla administered the Ativan.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Immediately thereafter, Crise asked to use the bathroom. Nurse Svehla escorted him to a bathroom and waited outside the door for him. He was in the bathroom for some time, causing Nurse Svehla to ask him to hurry up. When Crise came out of the bathroom, Nurse Svehla saw that he had pulled his IV out of his arm and was bleeding. She asked him why he had done that; he replied that \u201che didn\u2019t need it [and i]t was bugging him.\u201d Nurse Svehla bandaged the IV site but did not reinsert an IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">After giving Crise the dose of Ativan, Nurse Svehla began \u201cwatch[ing]\u201d him \u201cmore carefully\u201d from the nurses\u2019 station, to make sure he did not become too sedated and to determine whether the medication was effectively calming him down. She kept a \u201cperipheral eye on him at all times.\u201d He started pacing less, but was not lying down.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">At 6:15 p.m., Nurse Svehla noticed that Crise no longer was in Room 3. She immediately checked the nearest bathroom, but he was not there. She checked a second bathroom and he was not there either. She then started asking other ER staff if they had seen him. She was advised that a patient had just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>walked out a rear door of the E.R., causing an alarm to sound. Nurse Svehla walked through that door, which empties onto Howard Street, and looked around for Crise. When she did not see him, she went back inside, notified security, and called the Baltimore City Police Department (\u201cBCPD\u201d). Within ten to fifteen minutes, BCPD personnel notified MGH ER staff that officers had located Crise on the Howard Street Bridge. MGH staff asked the BCPD to \u201cescort [Crise] back to the [ER].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Apparently, upon exiting the ER through a rear door, Crise, wearing only his hospital gown and leaving his clothes behind, walked northbound on Howard Street for several blocks, in the direction of his home in Remington. When he was walking on the Howard Street Bridge, which is a part of Howard Street that spans Interstate 83 and areas surrounding that expressway, he saw several BCPD police cruisers traveling southbound on Howard Street, toward him. (These police were looking for Crise in response to the call from MGH). One police cruiser parked on the bridge and two police officers got out of it and slowly approached Crise. Crise turned around and walked southbound, away from the officers. The officers continued to approach. When they were within two to three feet of Crise he jumped over the side of the Howard Street Bridge, falling 30 to 40 feet onto concrete. He was transported by ambulance to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center. As noted, he fractured his pelvis, left wrist, right arm, and right leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In his deposition, Crise testified that he jumped off the bridge because he was \u201cparanoid and delusional and [he] thought it wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal.\u201d He wanted to \u201cget away from the police\u201d and \u201c[k]eep walking home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">On September 22, 2009, after waiving health claims arbitration and obtaining an order of transfer from the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office (\u201cHCADRO\u201d), Crise filed suit in the circuit court against MGH for medical negligence. He alleged that MGH owed him a duty of care; that it breached that duty by, <em>inter alia, </em>failing to thoroughly assess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>his psychiatric condition and \u201csupervise, observe and/or closely monitor\u201d him; and that the breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of the injuries he sustained when in a manic and psychotic state he jumped off the Howard Street Bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Crise designated two medical experts to opine about the standard of care: Stephan Lynn, M.D., and Stephen Siebert, M.D., M.P.H. MGH also designated two medical experts on the standard of care: David A. Shank, M.D., and Gayle Galan, M.D. All were deposed during discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Dr. Lynn, who signed Crise\u2019s certificate of merit in the HCADRO, is board-certified in Emergency Medicine and has practiced in that field for more than 30 years. He is the Director of the Emergency Department at St. Luke\u2019s Roosevelt Hospital in New York City, and is an associate professor of medicine and surgery at Columbia University. In the report attached to his certificate, he opined that \u201cthe applicable standards of care required Crise to have a constant observer <em>[ie., </em>a sitter] placed to monitor him [during his time in MGH\u2019s E.R.] due to his underlying history of schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder.\u201d He further opined that Crise\u2019s clinical presentation on December 31, 2008, in and of itself, required MGH either to assign a sitter to monitor him or to take \u201cother type[s] of security measure[s] to ensure that [he] did not pose a danger to himself or others.\u201d According to Dr. Lynn, MGH\u2019s failure to take appropriate measures to prevent Crise from leaving the ER was the direct and proximate cause of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">On July 15, 2010, counsel for MGH deposed Dr. Lynn. The doctor elaborated upon the opinions in his report, testifying that MGH\u2019s ER staff failed to adequately assess Crise\u2019s anxiety, particularly in light of his medical history, and to recognize that it was escalating rapidly during his time in the ER. According to Dr. Lynn, the standard of care required that, as soon as Dr. Finnegan read the EKG results and ruled out acute cardiac distress as a cause of Crise\u2019s chest pain, Crise be placed in a safe and secure environment to await a psychiatric evaluation. Dr. Finnegan had ruled out acute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>cardiac distress by 3:20 p.m., a little less than an hour after Crise\u2019s arrival in the ER and almost two hours before he walked out of the hospital. In Dr. Lynn\u2019s opinion, a \u201csafe and secure environment\u201d would have been a locked room. He further opined that, although less desirable, MGH could have satisfied the standard of care by assigning a sitter to monitor Crise \u201cconstantly.\u201d Dr. Lynn testified that any hospital staff member could have filled that role, so long as watching Crise was the sitter\u2019s sole responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Dr. Lynn also opined that when Crise was in the ER and when he left he was not competent to make rational decisions about his course of treatment and was a danger to himself and others. Under those circumstances, had MGH personnel been aware that Crise was attempting to leave the hospital, they could have taken steps to prevent him from doing so. Dr. Lynn opined about numerous additional breaches of the standard of care, including a delay of more than two hours after Crise arrived in the ER before a crisis evaluator was contacted; administration of an insufficient dose of Ativan; failure to reevaluate Crise\u2019s mental state in light of his escalating anxiety, as evidenced by his refusal to stay in his room and his ripping out his IV; and failure to maintain secure exits from the ER.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Dr. Siebert is a board-certified psychiatrist who works for the Baltimore County courts. In his August 27, 2010 deposition, he opined that Crise\u2019s clinical presentation on December 31, 2008, was consistent with his being in a manic and psychotic state and justified his being admitted to the hospital either voluntarily or involuntarily. Dr. Siebert further opined that, under the circumstances, the standard of care \u201crequired the hospital staff at [MGH] to keep [] Crise in the hospital,\u201d whether by assigning him a sitter, using a chemical restraint a more effective sedative), or using a physical restraint (?'.&amp;, placing him in a secure room).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Dr. Shank, one of the two defense experts, opined in his August 2, 2010 deposition that a patient presenting to an ER who is \u201cmanic and ... hearing voices\u201d needs to be admitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the hospital. He explained that he had not \u201cseen anything\u201d in Crise\u2019s MGH records to suggest that that was Crise\u2019s clinical presentation on the day in question. He agreed that, if there was information of that sort in the medical record, his opinion regarding the \u201ccare that would have been expected to be delivered\u201d would change. He further explained that, in the hospital where he works,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a patient who is deemed to be suicidal, homicidal, or incompetent will be watched by a hospital security guard or placed in a locked room.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Dr. Galan, the second defense expert, opined in her August 25, 2010 deposition that the standard of care requires a hospital to keep a patient who is exhibiting symptoms of psychosis in the ER at least until he or she has been evaluated to determine \u201cwhether the patient is able to care for [himself or herself] or [whether the patient is] demonstrating any risk of harm to [himself or herself] or others.\u201d She further opined, however, that observation of a patient \u201cevery few minutes\u201d by a nurse is sufficient monitoring to satisfy the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">On August 25, 2010, MGH filed a motion for summary judgment. It attached six exhibits: the complaint; its answers to interrogatories; Crise\u2019s deposition; Crise\u2019s answers to interrogatories; Dr. Lynn\u2019s certificate of merit and attached report; and Dr. Lynn\u2019s deposition transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">MGH argued that, even crediting Dr. Lynn\u2019s opinion that it had deviated from the standard of care by failing \u201cto have a constant observer [or \u2018sitter\u2019] placed to monitor [] Crise\u201d while in the E.R., there was \u201cno causation between [MGH\u2019s] alleged negligence in failing to have a sitter and [Crise\u2019s] injuries.\u201d This was so, MGH asserted, because, had it assigned a sitter to Crise, the sitter would not have had any authority to physically intervene to prevent him from leaving the ER. Thus, Crise could have left the ER while he was being monitored; and, under those circumstances, MGH could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>satisfied its duty of care by contacting the police. As there was no evidence that compliance with the standard of care would have prevented Crise from leaving the E.R.; the hospital complied with its duty to notify the police; and Crise jumped off the bridge to elude the police, the chain of causation was broken by the arrival of the police on the Howard Street Bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">MGH pointed out that in deposition Crise testified that he left the ER because \u201cnothing was happening.\u201d MGH argued that this evidence further showed that its allegedly negligent acts or omissions did not cause Crise\u2019s injuries. Crise did not testify that he left the ER with any intention of jumping off a bridge or hurting himself. Thus, but for his confrontation with the police, Crise would not have jumped off the Howard Street Bridge and would not have been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In two related contentions, MGH also argued that Crise\u2019s claim was barred as a matter of law by the doctrines of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk. It asserted that Maryland employs an objective test for both doctrines and therefore Crise\u2019s conduct would be assessed not based upon his own, subjective mental state, but based upon the conduct of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances. According to MGH, a reasonably prudent person would not act contrary to his own well-being by jumping off a bridge and would assume the risk of bodily harm if he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Crise filed an opposition to the motion for summary judgment. He attached the discharge summary from his June 2008 admission to MGH; his MGH medical record from December 31, 2008; excerpts of the depositions of Nurses Svehla, Lagmay, and Chitwood, and of Dr. Finnegan; Ms. Crise\u2019s handwritten note (which, as mentioned, was in MGH\u2019s December 31, 2008 record for Crise); his own deposition; excerpts from the depositions of Drs. Shank and Siebert and from the deposition of Christopher Brooks, an MGH security guard who was present on December 31, 2008; and the BCPD report of the events of December 31, 2008, involving Crise.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Crise argued that his clinical presentation on December 31, 2008, coupled with his psychiatric history, showed that he was in a \u201cpsychotic, delusional, and hypermanic state making him a danger to himself or others.\u201d Citing the deposition testimony of MGH\u2019s own expert, Dr. Shank, he asserted that, under those circumstances, MGH owed him a duty of care to use one of several options to ensure that he was safe and secure while he awaited crisis evaluation and likely admission to the hospital\u2019s psychiatric unit. Those options included assigning a sitter to observe him one-on-one and to alert ER staff if he tried to leave; placing him in a locked and secure room; or using effective chemical restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">With respect to causation, Crise argued that if MGH had assigned a sitter to observe him continuously, the sitter could have alerted ER staff immediately if he attempted to leave. Medical and security personnel could have prevented him from leaving the hospital by an assortment of interventions, up to and including physical restraint. He argued, moreover, that there was no evidence that physical restraint would have been necessary to keep him in the hospital, as, according to Nurse Svehla\u2019s testimony, Crise had been easily redirected to his room on numerous occasions before he absconded. Also, the evidence on the summary judgment record showed that, before December 31, 2008, he had voluntarily admitted himself to MGH\u2019s psychiatric unit at least four times. Thus, Crise argued, had MGH complied with its duty of care by, at a minimum, assigning a sitter to watch him, he likely would not have tried to leave the ER at all, and, if he had made an attempt to leave, he likely would not have been able to do so surreptitiously and without the knowledge and intervention of MGH personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Crise also argued that contributory negligence and assumption of the risk are defenses properly reserved to the jury and, because of his psychiatric state on the night in question, his conduct could not be assessed properly based upon an objective reasonable man standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>On September 20, 2010, MGH filed a motion <em>in limine, </em>seeking to exclude certain evidence at trial. Crise filed an opposition on October 4, 2010.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The parties attached many of the same materials already submitted on the summary judgment record. In addition, Crise attached excerpts of the depositions of Dr. Galan, PCT Holmes, and Mary. In her deposition, PCT Holmes testified that she personally told Nurse Svehla that Ms. Crise had told her that Crise would flee if he were not monitored constantly and that he was likely to harm himself if he left the E.R.; and that she (PCT Holmes) had volunteered to act as a sitter to monitor Crise.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In her deposition, Mary testified that on the day in question her mother was \u201cconstantly ... telling [E.R. staff] to watch [Crise] [because] he might run away.\u201d She further testified that, after the EKG was performed, a nurse accompanied Crise to the bathroom. While he was in the bathroom, Mary could hear him \u201cmaking all of these, like, loud grunting noises like he was a dog.\u201d Also, she later observed Crise eating in the ER without utensils, \u201clike an animal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Trial was scheduled to commence on October 5, 2010. That morning, the court heard argument on the motions for summary judgment and <em>in limine. </em>The court ruled on the <em>in limine </em>motion, but deferred ruling on the summary judgment motion. Thereafter, a jury was selected and sworn and the proceedings were adjourned for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The next morning, before the jurors were brought into the courtroom, the trial judge began discussing the arguments advanced in the motion for summary judgment and opposition. The judge then announced that on his own initiative he was \u201craising under Rule 2-502, certain questions which must be resolved before the case can go forward.\u201d The judge opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akr\">The first [question] is, what legal authority does [MGH] have to prevent a patient who is voluntarily admitted him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>self [sic] from leaving because he was dissatisfied with [MGH\u2019s] services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">And if [MGH] did not have the legal authority to prevent [Crise] from leaving, can a claim of negligence for allowing [Crise] to leave the hospital be allowed to proceed as a matter of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">In this case, there is no allegation that [MGH] had the legal authority to hold [Crise] against his will. But rather, it is argued that [MGH] could have used better practice by providing [Crise] with a sitter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">However, the sitter would have had no legal authority to prevent [Crise] from voluntarily leaving the hospital, which he chose to do because he was dissatisfied with the hospital\u2019s service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">In fact, [Crise] stated that he left because he felt like, quote, \u201cNothing was happening,\u201d end of quote, and felt disrespected when he was told not to use the bathroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">[Crise] also contends that a note was provided to [MGH] giving notice that [Crise] was suffering from delusions. Even taking into consideration the potential evidentiary value of that note, the question remains, what legal authority does the hospital have to detain a voluntarily admitted patient prior to an evaluation being conducted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">Here, [Crise] was initially triaged and was seen by Dr. Brian Finnegan, who observed [Crise] as oriented, with normal mood and affect. Dr. Finnegan also diagnosed [Crise] with anxiety, bipolar disease, mania, and chest pain. He ordered that [Crise] be seen by a crisis evaluator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">However, the fact Dr. Finnegan ordered an evaluation of a voluntarily admitted patient does not give the hospital the authority to prevent that patient from leaving the hospital before such an evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-11\">Furthermore, in [Crise\u2019s] triage evaluation, [Crise] denied having active homicidal or suicidal thoughts. The Court\u2019s analysis may have been different if there was indication that [Crise] was entertaining suicidal thoughts. But the facts before the Court clearly indicate such was not the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>In addition, [Crise] does not allege that he was suicidal, so this issue is moot and is merely stated to emphasize that this Court recognizes the fact that [MGH] was notified that [Crise] had a prior history of suicide attempts. But in this instance, it was determined that [Crise] had no such thoughts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">In fact, the record indicates that [Crise] continually stated that he was not having suicidal thoughts, and the reason he jumped from the Howard Street Bridge was that he could\u2014 why he left the hospital was so that he could go home, and he jumped from the Howard Street Bridge because of his confrontation with the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">Thus, under the facts before the Court, it is clear that [MGH] did not have the authority to prevent [Crise], a voluntarily admitted patient, from voluntarily choosing to leave the hospital when he chose to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">Therefore, as a matter of law, under Rule 2-502, the Maryland Rules of Procedure, the Court, considering the matter sua sponte, finds that [MGH] cannot be negligent for [faffing to] prevent[ ] [Crise] from leaving the hospital, nor can they be liable for any injuries or damages occurring after he left the hospital\u2019s care. And a judgment will be entered in favor of the defendants for those reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">At the conclusion of the court\u2019s ruling, Crise\u2019s lawyer expressed surprise, pointing out that MGH had not argued in its summary judgment motion that it did not owe Crise a duty of care and complaining that he had not been afforded \u201can opportunity to address the concerns of the Court ... through the evidence ... and the testimony.\u201d MGH\u2019s counsel asked the court to clarify whether it intended to reach the arguments raised on summary judgment. The court replied that it would not address the motion for summary judgment because its ruling under Rule 2-502 had rendered that motion moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">On October 22, 2010, Crise filed a timely motion for reconsideration or, in the alternative, for new trial. He argued that numerous provisions of Maryland law authorize hospitals to detain patients for evaluation for eventual admission and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>MGH was exercising such authority (albeit too late) when it contacted the BCPD and directed BCPD officers to find Crise and return him to the ER. He further argued that, even if MGH did not have the legal authority to \u201cforcibly detain\u201d him, it still was obligated to make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to prevent him from leaving the hospital before he was seen by the crisis evaluator.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">By order entered January 24, 2012, the circuit court denied Crise\u2019s motion for reconsideration or new trial. The order reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">This matter arose out of a claim for negligence against [MGH] as the result of injuries sustained by the Plaintiff on December 31, 2008, when the Plaintiff jumped from the Howard Street Bridge in Baltimore City, Maryland. The Plaintiff contends his injuries were the result of medical negligence by the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">The Plaintiff went to [MGH] on the date of his injuries and then walked out of the facility. He contends [MGH] was responsible for preventing him form [sic] eloping from their facility and but for their failure to do so he would not have been injured by jumping from the bridge. At the time he jumped he was being approached by Baltimore City Police who were attempting to locate him at the request of [MGH].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">The Plaintiff had a history of psychiatric problems. When he went to the hospital he was given a hospital gown in exchange for his street clothes and was examined by Dr. Brian Finnegan, the emergency room doctor, who ordered that a crisis evaluator see the Plaintiff for further psychiatric evaluation. (The plaintiff was diagnosed with anxiety, bipolar disorder and mania prior to the date of the incident giving rise to the action <em>sub judice. </em>[) ] Before that evaluation could be performed the Plaintiff who had not been admitted and who was not under any other restriction, other than his own motivation, left the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">... The negligence alleged to have been committed was essentially that [MGH] had the duty to prevent the [Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tiff] from injuring himself when he jumped from the bridge, but under circumstances that it did not have the authority to restrain him or hold him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\">All theories as to how such injury could have been prevented are pure speculation. That the Plaintiff did have the legal right to leave and exercised that right and was subsequently injured when he jumped from the bridge does not establish any legal liability on the part of [MGH].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">This timely appeal followed. We shall include additional facts as necessary to our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Crise contends the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that MGH did not owe him a legal duty of care. He asserts that when he was in the ER he was under the care of Dr. Finnegan and other hospital staff members and was awaiting a psychiatric evaluation; and, under Maryland law, these health care provider-patient relationships gave rise to a duty of reasonable care. The nature and scope of that duty was in dispute and was within the province of the jury to decide based on the evidence, including the testimony of expert witnesses. Crise maintains that whether MGH had the legal authority to detain him in the ER was not dispositive of the issue of duty of care; and even if it were, the court\u2019s conclusion that MGH had no such authority was legally incorrect and contrary to the evidence before the court. Crise also asserts that the court abused its discretion by addressing the duty of care issue under Rule 2-502 and by doing so without giving him notice or an opportunity to be heard on the issue of the existence <em>vel non </em>of a legal duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">MGH responds that the court properly used Rule 2-502 as a vehicle to decide the \u201cpurely legal issue\u201d of whether MGH owed Crise a duty of care. It maintains that the court\u2019s determination that MGH \u201cultimately could not have prevented [Crise]\u2014an otherwise voluntarily admitted patient who was not a danger to himself or others\u2014from leaving the E.R.\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>based on non-clearly erroneous factual findings and was legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">We conclude that the issue decided by the trial court, while framed by it as a purely legal question, was not; that, to the extent that any part of the issue was legal, the court incorrectly decided it; that the issue required factual determinations that were for the jury to decide, and therefore the court decided an issue that was not within its sole province and thus was not susceptible to a Rule 2-502 decision; and, beyond that, the court abused its discretion not only by invoking Rule 2-502 but also by doing so without affording the parties prior notice and an opportunity to be heard. For all these reasons, the judgment of the circuit court shall be reversed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\n<em>History and Purpose of Rule 2-502</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Rule 2-502, entitled \u201cSeparation of questions for decision by eourt[,]\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">If at any stage of an action a question arises that is within the sole province of the court to decide, whether or not the action is triable by a jury, and if it would be convenient to have the question decided before proceeding further, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, may order that the question be presented for decision in the manner the court deems expedient. In resolving the question, the court may accept facts stipulated by the parties, may find facts after receiving evidence, and may draw inferences from these facts. The proceedings and decisions of the court shall be on the record, and the decisions shall be reviewable upon appeal after entry of an appealable order or judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The committee note to the rule gives examples of when Rule 2-502 does not apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">When a question defined by this Rule involves one of the matters listed in Rule 2-322 [governing preliminary motions], the question should be raised and decided under the provisions of that Rule. When a judgment is sought and there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, the question should be raised and decided under Rule 2-501 [governing summary judgment]. When the question is not a question within the sole province of the court to decide but it would nonetheless be convenient or less prejudicial to conduct a separate trial on the issue, it is appropriate to proceed under Rule 2-503(b) [governing separate trials].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Rule 2-502 was derived from former Rule 502 and was adopted effective July 1, 1984, as part of the comprehensive revision of the Maryland Rules of Civil Procedure. Among other things, the 1984 revision created a unitary \u201ccivil action,\u201d under Rule 2-301, thus \u201celiminatfing] distinctions between law and equity for purposes of pleadings, parties, court sittings, and dockets.\u201d Committee note to Rule 2-301. The revision was not intended however, to \u201c \u2018abolish all differences between legal and equitable claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>Higgins v. Barnes, </em>310 Md. 532, 534, 530 A.2d 724 (1987); <em>LaSalle Bank, N.A. v. Reeves, </em>173 Md.App. 392, 404-05, 919 A.2d 738 (2007) (quoting 9 <em>Md.

At a March 6, 1981 Rules Committee meeting, Judge McAuliffe, Chairman of the \u201cTrial Rules Subcommittee,\u201d presented for consideration \u201cReorganization Rule 2-503,\u201d which later became Rule 2-502. At that time, the first clause of the reorganized rule read, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">if ... at any stage of the action ... there is a question of law which it would be convenient to have decided before going further, the court may upon request or on its own motion, direct such question to be raised for the court\u2019s decision in such manner as the court may deem expedient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKS\">Minutes of March 6, 1981, at 26. The remainder of the proposed rule did not differ substantively from the current rule. The Trial Rules Subcommittee also included an explanatory note, for the benefit of the Rules Committee, stating in relevant part that the reorganized Rule \u201celiminate[s] troublesome language, currently found in section b of Rule 502, which the subcommittee felt might encourage a court, under the guise of determining a question of law, to make factual findings in derrogation [sic] of a litigant\u2019s right to trial by jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AST\">Judge McAuliffe explained that by \u201ccollapsing] the two sections of Rule 502\u201d into one paragraph, the reorganized rule would \u201cmake it clear that when a question of law requires the resolution of questions of fact, the court may receive evidence in order to make the necessary findings and may draw inferences from the facts show.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26. He emphasized, however, that factual findings may not be made by the court \u201cin derrogation [sic] of a litigant\u2019s right to trial by jury because the court may only find those facts and draw those inferences which are necessary to determine a question of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26-27. Moreover, if, in deciding a legal issue, the court resolves disputed facts, and those same disputed facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>are relevant to a determination of an issue reserved to the jury, the jurors will \u201cnot be precluded from deciding those facts again.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">In addressing the Rules Committee, Judge McAuliffe offered the issues of public necessity in an eminent domain case and the bar of limitations as examples of legal questions susceptible of resolution by the court under the reorganized rule. In each such instance, the issue for the court to decide is one of law, but factual findings may be \u201c[incidental to the determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27. For example, in ruling on the legal question whether a cause of action is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, the court might need to take evidence about when the plaintiff knew or should have known that the cause of action accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Rules Committee members suggested modifications to the reorganized Rule 2-502 to make clear that only those questions of law \u201creserved for decision by the court\u201d are within the ambit of the rule and that the court may find facts only when necessary to the resolution of the legal question. <em>Id. </em>at 29. The reorganized Rule was referred back to the subcommittee \u201cwith the request that the subcommittee consider making the Rule expressly applicable only to those cases where a question of law requires that disputed facts be resolved.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">On June 19-20, 1981, Judge McAuliffe again presented reorganized Rule 2-502 to the Rules Committee for consideration. As requested, language had been added to clarify that only those questions \u201cwithin the sole province of the court to decide, regardless of whether the case is being tried by a jury,\u201d may be decided under the Rule and to allow the court to receive evidence and find facts \u201c[i]f resolution of the question requires facts to be established.\u201d Minutes of June 19-20, 1981, at 10. A committee note was added, which is substantively identical to the current note. Reorganized Rule 2-502 then was approved by the Rules Committee with minor alterations and, ultimately, was adopted by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">In keeping with Judge McAuliffe\u2019s remarks to the Rules Committee, Rule 2-502 (and its predecessor rule) has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>invoked most commonly in the context of eminent domain cases. <em>See, e.g., State Rds.

The trial court decided what it described as a legal duty of care issue under Rule 2-502. We conclude that, as a matter of law, MGH, through its agent health care providers, owed Crise, a patient being treated in the ER, a duty of care; and the nature and scope of that duty was not an issue \u201cwithin the sole province of the court\u201d so as to be susceptible of determination under Rule 2-502.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\u201cEstablishment of a legal duty is a prerequisite to a claim of negligence because \u2018[t]here can be no negligence where there is no duty that is due; for negligence is the breach of some duty that one person owes to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v.

First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>307 Md. 527, 531, 515 A.2d 756 (1986) (stating that the elements in any cause of action for negligence are \u201ca duty owed----, a breach of that duty, a legally cognizable causal relationship between the breach of duty and the harm suffered, and damages\u201d). An action for medical malpractice, being a type of negligence action, requires proof, among other elements, of a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. The plaintiff must prove the applicable standard of care; that the standard of care was violated by the defendant; and that the violation proximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>caused the injury for which damages are sought. <em>See Sterling v. Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>145 Md.App. 161, 169, 802 A.2d 440 (2002); <em>Jacobs v. Flynn, </em>131 Md.App. 342, 354, 749 A.2d 174 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Ordinarily, the duty of care in a medical malpractice action arises from the health care provider-patient relationship. <em>See Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>384 Md. 606, 620, 865 A.2d 603 (2005) (\u201cIt is the general rule that recovery for malpractice against a physician is allowed only where there is a relationship between the doctor and patient\u201d); <em>Dingle v. Belin, </em>358 Md. 354, 367, 749 A.2d 157 (2000) (same); <em>Sterling, </em>145 Md.App. at 169-70, 802 A.2d 440 (same). That duty, stated more fully, is to exercise the degree of care or skill expected of a reasonably competent health care provider in the same or similar circumstances. <em>Shilkret v. Annapolis Emergency Hosp. Assoc., </em>276 Md. 187, 200, 349 A.2d 245 (1975) (the doctor-patient relationship gives rise to a duty on the part of the doctor \u201cto use that degree of care and skill which is expected of a reasonably competent practitioner in the same class to which [the doctor] belongs, acting in the same or similar circumstances\u201d). <em>See </em>Md.Code (2013 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-2A-02(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (Plaintiff in medical malpractice claim must prove that the care given by the \u201chealth care provider [was] not in accordance with the standards of practice among members of the same health care profession with similar training and experience____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Thus, when a health care provider-patient relationship exists, the \u201cduty of care\u201d issue is not whether any duty exists but the nature and scope of the duty. With few exceptions, the applicable standard of care, <em>ie., </em>the nature and scope of the duty owed, is proven by expert testimony (as is the issue whether the applicable standard of care was breached). <em>Rodriguez v. Clarke, </em>400 Md. 39, 71, 926 A.2d 736 (2007) (explaining that the defendant\u2019s \u201cuse of suitable professional skill\u201d in the practice of medicine and proximate cause usually are the subject of expert testimony) (internal quotation marks omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>ted); <em>Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp. v. Gholston, </em>203 Md.App. 321, 337, 37 A.3d 1074 cert. denied, 427 Md. 65, 46 A.3d 406 (2012) (describing a \u201cclassic battle of the experts\u201d regarding causation in an action for medical negligence and affirming the denial of a motion for JNOV by the hospital on that issue); <em>Hahn v. Suburban Hosp. Assoc., </em>54 Md.App. 685, 695, 461 A.2d 7 (1983) (stating it is \u201caxiomatic that a qualified medical expert can render an opinion as to whether a hospital did or did not comply with applicable standards of care ... permitting a trier of fact to determine whether the hospital was negligent\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds by Newell v. Richards, </em>323 Md. 717, 731-32, 594 A.2d 1152 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">To be sure, the question whether any duty of care is owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, whether in a medical malpractice or any other negligence action, is one of law. <em>See, e.g., Pace v. State, </em>425 Md. 145, 154, 38 A.3d 418 (2012) (affirming circuit court\u2019s grant of motion to dismiss negligence action against the State based on an alleged duty owed to a public school student to ensure she received a school lunch that met her specific dietary needs); <em>Doe v. Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, Co., Inc., </em>388 Md. 407, 414, 879 A.2d 1088 (2005) (in answer to a certified question of law, determining that as a matter of law a company cultivating and harvesting the HTV virus for use in HIV antibody tests owed no legal duty to its employees\u2019 spouses). The committee note to Rule 2-502 makes plain, however, that a legal question such as whether any duty of care exists in an action for negligence is not proper for decision under that Rule. The issue properly can be raised in a motion to dismiss, under Rule 2-322, which includes among other grounds for dismissal failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, <em>see </em>subsection (b)(2). If on the facts alleged no duty of care exists, a claim is not stated upon which relief may be granted. Likewise, the issue whether a duty of care exists as a matter of law properly can be decided on summary judgment, under Rule 2-501, if the facts have been developed in discovery and are not in genuine material dispute. In neither situation is the issue of duty of care suitable for decision under Rule 2-502, however. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>Harris v. Stefanowicz Corp., </em>26 Md.App. at 218, 337 A.2d 455 (observing that former Rule 502 \u201cis as different from summary judgment in purpose and effect as is an apple from an orange.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">MGH did not file a motion to dismiss asserting that it did not owe Crise a legal duty of care, nor did it advance such an argument in its motion for summary judgment. The reason for this is obvious. Maryland law is clear that, as a patient in the MGH E.R., Crise was owed a duty of care by the MGH health care providers who were assigned to and participated in his care. It is undisputed that on December 31, 2008 Crise was admitted to the E.R., where he was assigned a room, triaged, given a nursing assessment, examined by an ER doctor, administered a sedative, and scheduled for evaluation by a crisis counselor. On these undisputed facts, there is no merit to any contention that Crise was not owed a duty of care by the MGH ER health care providers. If, for example, Dr. Finnegan had carelessly ordered a lethal dose of Ativan, instead of the proper dose, and Crise had been given the lethal dose and had died, any assertion that Dr. Finnegan and MGH did not owe Crise a duty of care would be ludicrous.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The trial court mistook the legal question whether <em>any </em>duty of care was owed by MGH to Crise for the factually disputed (and complicated) question of the nature and scope of the duty of care owed. Using the evidence submitted on the summary judgment and <em>in limine </em>records (which is not proper to do under Rule 2-502 in any event), the court made factual findings and concluded that the nature and scope of the duty of care owed by MGH to Crise could not exceed the hospital\u2019s legal authority to detain him. In other words, if MGH lacked the authority to hold Crise in the ER for evaluation, it did not owe him any related duty of care, such as to monitor him to prevent him for attempting to abscond.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Unlike the issues typically resolved under Rule 2-502, which are \u201cdiscrete\u201d and separate from the underlying merits, <em>see Werbowsky, </em>362 Md. at 621, 766 A.2d 123 (demand futility is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u201cperfect candidate\u201d for resolution under Rule 2-502 because it \u201cis a preliminary issue that is discrete, that does not go to the merits of the underlying complaint, ... and ... that is resolvable by the court\u201d), the nature and scope of MGH\u2019s duty of care to Crise required resolution of factual disputes that were intertwined with factual disputes regarding the breach, <em>vel non, </em>of that duty and the causal connection between any breach and Crise\u2019s injuries. All of these disputes were within the province of the jury, not the court, to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The court\u2019s oral ruling from the bench, later elucidated in its memorandum opinion denying the motion for reconsideration, paints a picture of Crise as a rather ordinary ER patient with a psychiatric history who was not suicidal or homicidal, had come to MGH on his own accord, and, having become dissatisfied with MGH\u2019s services, simply chose to leave and go home. It does not mention that Crise did not tell anyone at the ER that he was leaving; that he exited through an alarmed door at the end of a back hallway off the E.R.; that he left his clothes behind and walked outside on a cold night wearing only a hospital gown; and traversed several blocks north on Howard Street, a busy road in the middle of Baltimore City. The ruling goes on to say that when Crise came upon the police as he was walking on the Howard Street Bridge, he decided to jump off the bridge because the police (two officers, walking slowly) were approaching him.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In making its findings, the court rejected, explicitly and implicitly, Crise\u2019s own deposition testimony and that of his fact witnesses, as well as information contained in Crise\u2019s medical records. All of that evidence could support a reasonable finding that Crise was in a manic and psychotic state and was becoming increasingly agitated and detached from reality. He and others reported that he was hearing voices, his speech was \u201cpressured,\u201d he had not taken his psychiatric medications for five days, and had not eaten or slept for days. Moreover, while in the E.R., he pulled out his IV, walked from \u201croom\u201d to \u201croom\u201d wearing only his hospital gown, ate food like an animal and made strange noises, exhibited a level of agitation that required sedation, and was not calmed sufficiently from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>sedative that he would stay in his assigned bed. Evidence that was not credited by the court but could have been credited by the jury showed that family members warned the MGH nurses that if not watched closely, Crise would try to leave; that he had had a recent dangerous experience of running naked along a Delaware highway; and that PCT Holmes had volunteered to watch Crise but was told not to because the ER was too busy. Further, there was evidence that, after Crise absconded (the word used in the medical record), ER personnel called the police to fetch him and bring him back\u2014something they would not have done if they thought his leaving was just an ordinary event\u2014and that when Crise reached the Howard Street Bridge he could not rationally process the presence of the police because, as Crise himself put it, he was so \u201cparanoid and delusional that [he] thought [jumping off the Howard Street Bridge] wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">In deciding the issue it described as the existence of a legal duty of care, but in fact was the issue of the nature and scope of an established duty of care, the trial court not only rejected the latter version of the events of December 31, 2008, and all the evidence on which it was based, but also rejected the expert opinions of Drs. Lynn and Siebert. As noted above, both were prepared to testify, based on Crise\u2019s manic behavior, lack of sleep, failure to take his medications, auditory hallucinations, and increasing agitation, that he was incompetent to make rational decisions about his own well-being and was a danger to himself; and therefore the standard of care owed by MGH and its agents to Crise required that measures be taken to keep Crise safe and secure until he was psychiatrically evaluated. According to these experts, this could have been accomplished (in order of less to more invasive therapy) by assigning a sitter to watch him, so any expression of interest on his part in leaving, or any attempt to leave, would have been witnessed immediately and communicated to the doctors and nurses, and could have been responded to by a verbal request for cooperation, redirecting or diverting his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>emotions, increasing or changing his sedative, or placing him in a locked room.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">The findings by the trial judge rendered irrelevant what in fact was the central standard of care question in the case: Given that MGH owed a duty of care to Crise, as its patient, did Crise\u2019s condition create an obligation on the part of MGH\u2019s personnel to take measures (as Crise\u2019s experts would testify) to control his actions, so as to make it unlikely that he even would try to leave the ER and likely that he would be redirected from doing so before he succeeded in walking out. The court, having discounted the evidence that Crise was a danger to himself, determined that the standard of care could not reasonably require having a sitter observe Crise, because the sitter would have no authority to detain him if he tried to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">As Dr. Lynn opined, however, whether a sitter could detain Crise made no difference. If a sitter had been assigned to Crise, that person\u2019s sole responsibility would have been to constantly observe him and report any adverse behavior to medical personnel. Had the assigned sitter seen Crise attempt to leave Room 3 and move toward an alarmed exit door, medical personnel could have been alerted immediately and intervened before Crise left. Dr. Lynn voiced the opinion, based upon information in Crise\u2019s medical file and his history of voluntary admissions for psychiatric treatment, that a verbal intervention alone more likely than not would have been sufficient to redirect him away from the exit door. (In fact, earlier on the day in question, he had responded positively to verbal directions, such as to stay out of other patients\u2019 rooms). In addition, Dr. Lynn opined that, if a verbal intervention would not have worked, the mere fact that a patient was attempting to leave the ER clothed only in a hospital gown in winter would have given rise to a duty on the part of MGH health care providers to reevaluate his competency and assess whether he was a danger to himself which, contrary to the \u201clegal conclusion\u201d reached by the trial judge, would permit the hospital to detain Crise involuntarily. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2009 RepLVol.) \u00a7 10-625 of the Health General Article (\u201cHG\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>(authorizing emergency involuntary admission of an individual for psychiatric evaluation). Thus, there was evidence that, if credited by a jury, could have led reasonable jurors to conclude that the standard of care at the very least required MGH to have Crise monitored by a sitter; and had that duty been satisfied, he would not have absconded from the ER and injured himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">What is critical is that the issue of the scope and nature of MGH\u2019s duty of care to Crise in this case was not a matter \u201cwithin the sole province of the court\u201d to decide, and that in endeavoring to decide this issue preliminarily, the court \u201cunder the guise of determining a question of law,\u201d made factual findings \u201cin der[ Jogation of [Crisej\u2019s right to trial by jury.\u201d Minutes of the June 19-20, 1981 Rules Committee Meeting at 11. For this reason, the judgment in favor of MGH must be reversed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">(0</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\n<em>Procedure Followed Under Rule 2-502</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Although the substance of the trial court\u2019s decision is sufficient to support reversal of the judgment, the procedure that was followed, or not followed, is worthy of comment. In <em>Harris, </em>26 Md.App. at 213, 337 A.2d 455, we considered the procedural prerequisites under section (a) of former Rule 502. The Rule then permitted a court to determine an issue of law preliminarily by \u201cdirecting] [the] question to be raised for the court\u2019s decision in such manner as the court may deem expedient.\u201d We explained that because Rule 502(a) was drafted using \u201clifted language\u201d from Art. 75, \u00a7 134 and Art. 16, \u00a7 237, \u201ccertain language which had been in the equity act (originally Acts of 1886, Ch. 334) was omitted to facilitate the revision.\u201d That language \u201cincluded a phrase more clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>conveying the procedural safeguard to be followed when it appeared to the chancellor that there was a question of law that it would be convenient to decide[:] \u2018 ... the Court may make an order accordingly, and may direct such question of law to be raised for the opinion of the Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219, 337 A.2d 455. In the light of the history of the rule and the plain language, we concluded that Rule 502(a) required that the parties be afforded \u201csome warning and opportunity to prepare\u201d before the court could determine an issue of law. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 337 A.2d 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Under Rule 2-502, the court on motion or on its own initiative may \u201corder\u201d that a question within its sole province to decide be \u201cpresented for decision\u201d in the manner the court deems expedient. We think it plain that this language, like the language of <em>former </em>Rule 502(a), requires that the parties at least be afforded adequate notice and an opportunity to prepare before a court decides an issue under Rule 2-502. <em>Cf. Phillips v. Venker, </em>316 Md. 212, 221-22, 557 A.2d 1338 (1989) (holding that a plaintiff was deprived of due process when the court heard argument and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant during a conference call to discuss a scheduling matter); <em>Burdick v. Brooks, </em>160 Md.App. 519, 524-27, 864 A.2d 300 (2004) (mother denied due process when the court modified custody without affording her notice or an opportunity to prepare); <em>Van Schaik v.

Niemayer <em>&amp; </em>Linda M. Schuett, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>363 (3d ed.2003); <em>see also </em>March 6, 1981 Rules Committee Minutes at 28 (unlike proceedings on summary judgment, the proposed Rule 2-502 would involve \u201ca trial-like procedure\u201d). Without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>advance notice, the parties cannot gather the necessary evidentiary materials, determine whether to summons witnesses to appear, or decide whether to stipulate to certain facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In the instant case, neither party was given advance notice of the court\u2019s plan to decide the issue of a legal duty as a preliminary question under Rule 2-502. The court raised the issue for the first time, <em>sua sponte, </em>at the commencement of the second day of trial, following jury selection but before opening statements. Moreover, the court did not take any evidence prior to rendering its decision, relying instead on the evidentiary submissions before it on summary judgment<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and announced its decision from the bench without providing either party an opportunity to be heard. Following its ruling, counsel for Crise expressed shock at the court\u2019s decision, as he had not been apprised that the court was going to consider any issue under Rule 2-502, and therefore had had no opportunity to \u201caddress the concerns of the Court\u201d by presenting evidence. Nor did counsel for Crise have the opportunity to prepare to argue why Rule 2-502 was not a proper procedure to be following in any event. Even if the standard of care issue had been proper for decision under Rule 2-502, which it was not, the court abused its discretion by holding a proceeding under Rule 2-502 without giving the parties notice that it was going to do so, to enable them to prepare.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.
