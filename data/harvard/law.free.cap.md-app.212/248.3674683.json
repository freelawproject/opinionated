When Spencer failed to appear for trial, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County ordered the bond forfeited and later entered judgment against Financial Casualty for the full amount of the bond. 4 Aces Bail Bonds, Inc.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201con behalf of\u2019 Financial Casualty, filed a Petition for Remission, which the circuit court denied. In this timely appeal, Financial Casualty presents one question for our review, which we have revised: did the trial court abuse its discretion in denying the Petition for Remission?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">On March 3, 2009, Spencer was charged by criminal information with various narcotics charges. Bail was set at $25,000, and Spencer was \u201creleased from commitment\u201d on March 9, 2009 when Financial Casualty, through bondsman Calvin Jones, posted a bond in that amount. The bond states that it \u201cshall continue in full force and effect until discharged pursuant of Rule 4-217.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Spencer did not appear for trial on October 15, 2009. The docket entry states, in pertinent part, \u201cBail forfeited. Bench Warrant issued.\u201d The next day, October 16, 2009, a warrant was issued for Spencer\u2019s arrest. An undated letter from the court was sent to bondsman Jones, stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">As Surety for [Spencer], you have 90 days (14th day of January, 2010) to satisfy this forfeiture by either producing [Spencer] in court, or by paying the penalty sum on the bond. If the bail forfeiture has not been stricken, or satisfied within 90 days, a judgment will be entered against [Spencer] and Surety for the penalty sum of the bail, with interest from the date of the forfeiture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The record further indicates that a \u201cNotice of Recorded Judgment\u201d in the amount of $25,000 \u201cplus interests and costs\u201d was entered on March 31, 2010 against Spencer and Financial Casualty. The docket entry for May 27, 2010 reflects a \u201cForfeiture of $25,000.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">On February 7, 2011, writs of habeas corpus were sent from the court to Jones and the Warden of the Baltimore City Detention Center, stating: \u201cYou are hereby COMMANDED TO HAVE THE BODY of ... Spencer before\u201d the court on March 7, 2011. A \u201ccriminal Postponement Hearing Request Form,\u201d dated March 7, 2011 states that \u201c[Spencer] not brought from Balto City jail,\u201d and the case was reset for April 7, 2011.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Writs were also sent on March 14, 2011, commanding Spencer\u2019s presence on April 7, 2011. A \u201cCriminal Postponement Hearing Request Form,\u201d dated April 7, 2011, states Spencer\u2019s location as \u201ccity jail,\u201d and the case was reset to June 2, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The \u201cPeace Officer\u2019s Return\u201d section of the bench warrant that was issued on October 16, 2009 indicates that the warrant and charging document were served on Spencer on April 23, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>2011.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Another section of the warrant, dated April 25, 2011, states that \u201c[Spencer] is currently at the Baltimore County Detention Center.\u201d The \u201cReport of Prisoner Brought to Circuit Court for Baltimore County,\u201d dated April 26, 2011, states that Spencer was remanded to \u201cBCBC,\u201d which likely stands for the Baltimore County Bureau of Corrections. A handwritten note on the document in the section entitled \u201cBail Hearing Held\u201d states \u201cBench Warrant [Spencer] adv why he was picked up.\u201d On May 5, 2011, a writ of habeas corpus was sent to the Baltimore County Bureau of Corrections commanding Spencer\u2019s appearance on June 2, 2011. On August 22, 2011, Spencer pled guilty to the manufacture and distribution of narcotics; the other charges against him were nolle prossed. He was sentenced to 10 years incarceration, \u201csuspend all but time served.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">On June 9, 2011, 4 Aces Bail Bonds, Inc., \u201con behalf of\u2019 Financial Casualty, filed a Petition for Remission with the circuit court, citing \u00a7 5-208 of the Criminal Procedure Article. The Petition, in pertinent part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">1. That on or about the 10th day of April 2009,<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> a bond in the amount of $25,000.00 was posted in the Circuit Court of Maryland guaranteeing the appearance of [Spencer] at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">2. On the 16th day of October 2009, [Spencer] failed to appear for trial in the Circuit Court. A bench warrant was issued and the bond was ordered forfeited, to be payable within ninety (90) days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">3. On the 31st day of May 2010, [Financial Casualty] in the amount of $25,000.00 plus interest made payment of the bond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>4. On the 3rd day of May 2011, [Spencer] was surrendered and the bail warrant was served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">At the hearing-on the Petition, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">[FINANCIAL CASUALTY\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, your hon- or, ... [\u00a7 5-208(c) of the Criminal Procedure Article], proof that he\u2019s [confined] in a correctional institution in the United States. He\u2019s in Baltimore County Detention Center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">[THE COURT]: But, I mean, the fact that they later get picked up on something. The question is what if any efforts did [the surety] have anything to do with that eventual detention? And did it, did, you know, I mean, the bail is posted to ensure their presence. When they don\u2019t show up the fact that they get arrested for something else a year or so down the road doesn\u2019t mean you get your money back, unless I\u2019m missing something in this Statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">[FINANCIAL CASUALTY\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Well, your honor, in the Statute I mean it\u2019s said, I mean, evidence of confinement in a correctional institution. We, we, we know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">[THE COURT]: Within 180 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">[FINANCIAL CASUALTY\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes. I mean, we, we know he\u2019s incarcerated in the Baltimore County\u2014I mean, he\u2019s here. We know he\u2019s incarcerated in the Baltimore County Detention Center. I mean, the [surety] sponsored, I mean, had people looking for him, there, diligent efforts to find him. I mean, he was just picked up on something else and a warrant was issued in May. And the warrant was served in the, it was served in May.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">[THE COURT]: In this case let me look. I mean, there were different time lines on each of these. The Petition for Remission on Mr. Spencer it represents that on April 10th of 2009 bond was posted. In October he failed to appear and a warrant was issued. In May of 2010 bond was forfeited. And then a year later he was picked up on something else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>[FINANCIAL CASUALTY\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes. On ... May 3rd, 2011 your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">[THE COURT]: And he was picked up on another matter? Not brought in by any representative of the [surety], is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">[FINANCIAL CASUALTY\u2019S COUNSEL]: I believe he was picked up on another matter your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">[THE COURT]: Okay. I mean, I don\u2019t think [Financial Casualty] is entitled to remission under those facts. It\u2019s not within the 180 days. [He was not] picked up based upon efforts by the [surety]. He was picked up on another criminal offense and you know, almost two years down the road comes back in through the Court\u2019s custody. Um, as I read the Statute under those circumstances I don\u2019t believe that remission is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">The court entered an order denying the Petition for Remission, and Financial Casualty noted this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">The issue before us involves a discrete set of facts and the application of a statute and Maryland Rule that have since been amended. The defendant, Spencer, did not appear as required in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Over a year later, he was \u201ccommitted,\u201d after being arrested on other charges, to the Baltimore County Department of Corrections. Ultimately, he entered a plea of guilty to a charge in Baltimore County for which Financial Casualty posted the bond at issue in this case, and he was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">A bail bond is \u201ca written obligation of a defendant, with or without a surety or collateral security, conditioned on the appearance of the defendant\u201d before the court \u201cas required and providing for the payment of a penalty sum according to its terms,\u201d Md. Rule 4\u2014217(b)(1), when \u201cthe defendant fails to \u2018well and truly make his appearance before\u2019 the court and to answer to the charges.\u201d <em>Allegheny Mut. Casualty Co. v. State, </em>35 Md.App. 55, 57, 368 A.2d 1032 (1977); <em>see also </em>Restatement (First) of Security \u00a7 203 (1941) (\u201cA bail bond is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>bond to obtain the release of a person from imprisonment and to secure his appearance to answer legal process.\u201d); <em>Tyler v. Capitol Indem. Ins. Co., </em>206 Md. 129, 136-37, 110 A.2d 528 (1955) (The \u201cobligation is either to produce the principal when required by the court or at such earlier date as the surety may elect or, failing to produce the principal when required by the court, to pay the sum specified in the bond.\u201d). With the posting of the bond, \u201cthe principal is released from the custody of officers of the law and is considered as being in the custody of a surety of his own selection, whose duty is to assure the principal\u2019s subsequent appearance\u201d before the court. <em>Tyler, </em>206 Md. at 134-35, 110 A.2d 528 (quoting Rest. \u00a7 203 comment b).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">This Court has said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">[t]he purpose of the bond or security is to secure a trial, its object being to combine the administration of justice with the convenience of a person accused, but not proved, to be guilty. If the accused does not appear the bail may be forfeited, not as a punishment to the surety or to enrich the Treasury of the State[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\"><em>Irwin v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 518, 524, 302 A.2d 688 (1973). Rather, the threat of forfeiture is an incentive to the surety to ensure the accused\u2019s timely presence at trial. <em>Allegheny Mut. Casualty Co., </em>35 Md.App. at 58, 368 A.2d 1032. In the event of forfeiture, the surety\u2019s incentive is redirected from <em>avoiding </em>forfeiture to seeking the <em>\u201c[Remission </em>of the forfeiture\u201d by returning the absconding defendant to the jurisdiction of the court. <em>Allegheny Mut. Casualty Co. v. State, </em>234 Md. 278, 284, 199 A.2d 201 (1964) (emphasis added). Without the possibility of remission, \u201cthere would be no inducement to the [surety] to have the defendant arrested and brought to justice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Section 5-208 of the Criminal Procedure Article, as in effect at the time of these proceedings, states, in pertinent part:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>(b) <em>In </em>General.\u2014(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a court that exercises criminal jurisdiction shall strike out a forfeiture of bail or collateral and discharge the underlying bail bond if the defendant can show reasonable grounds for the defendant\u2019s failure to appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\">(2) The court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">(i) allow a surety 90 days after the date of the defendant\u2019s failure to appear or, for good cause shown, 180 days to return<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> the defendant before requiring the payment of any forfeiture of bail or collateral; and (ii) strike out a forfeiture of bail or collateral and deduct only the actual expense incurred for the defendant\u2019s arrest, apprehension, or surrender, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">1. the defendant is returned; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">2. the arrest, apprehension, or surrender occurs more than 90 days <em>after </em>the defendant\u2019s failure to appear or at the end of the period that the court allows to return the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">(c) <em>Confinement of </em>defendant.\u2014Evidence of confinement of a fugitive defendant in a correctional facility in the United States is a wholly sufficient ground to strike out a forfeiture,<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> if assurance is given that the defendant will come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>back to the jurisdiction of the court on expiration of the sentence at no expense to the State, county, or municipal corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Maryland Rule 4-217 (\u201cBail bonds.\u201d), as in effect at the time of these proceedings, states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">(f) Condition of bail bond.

If the defendant or surety can show reasonable grounds for the defendant\u2019s failure to appear, notwithstanding Rule 2-535, the court shall (A) strike out the forfeiture in whole or in part; and (B) set aside any judgment entered thereon pursuant to subsection (4)(A) of this section, and (C) order the remission in whole or in part of the penalty sum paid pursuant to subsection (3) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>(3) Satisfaction of forfeiture.

If the defendant is produced within such time by the State, the court shall require the surety to pay the expenses of the State in producing the defendant and shall treat the order of the forfeiture satisfied with respect to the remainder of the penalty sum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">(4) Enforcement of forfeiture.

Similarly, the \"Current Law\u201d section of the Fiscal and Policy Note for H.B. 682, which amended the statute in 2011, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-12\">A court is <em>required </em>to strike out a forfeiture of bail or collateral and discharge the underlying bail bond if ... the defendant is returned to the custody of law enforcement and the arrest, apprehension, or surrender occurs more than 90 days after the defendant\u2019s failure to appear or at the end of the period that the court allows to return the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">That is consistent with H.B.2074 from the 1976 legislative session, which provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-15\">The court shall strike out a forfeiture of bail or collateral deducting only the actual expense incurred for the defendant's arrest, apprehension, or surrender if the defendant is produced in court and if the arrest, apprehension, or surrender occurs more than 90 days after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>defendant\u2019s failure to appear or at the termination of the period allowed by the court to produce the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The fiscal note for that bill states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">This bill would allow any court exercising criminal jurisdiction to remit part or all of the bail forfeited when a defendant fails to appear if the defendant surrenders or is apprehended or arrested more than 90 days after he fails to appear and only deduct actual expense incurred for his surrender, apprehension, or arrest <em>if he is unable to show reasonable grounds for his nonappearance.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b306-12\">. Had this case been decided under the revised statute, <em>see supra </em>n. 6, and the revised rule, <em>see supra </em>n. 9, the surety would not have been entitled to a refund. Under the revised scheme, when a defendant is returned to the jurisdiction of the court <em>after </em>the 90/180 day period, a refund is only appropriate if the penalty sum was paid <em>during </em>the 90-180 day period. Here, bail was forfeited on October 15, 2009, and the surety was given until January 14, 2010, to satisfy the forfeiture by either producing Spencer or paying the penalty sum on the bond. According to the petition for remission, the $25,000 judgment entered on March 31, 2010, was not paid until May 31, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
