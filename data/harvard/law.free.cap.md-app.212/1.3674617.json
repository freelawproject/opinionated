In his timely appeal, appellant presents three questions for our review, which we have expanded into four and rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-11\">1. Did appellant\u2019s two convictions for conspiracy to commit first-degree burglary offend double jeopardy principles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-12\">2. Did the trial court err in not merging the conviction for <em>accessory </em>to first-degree burglary with the conviction(s) for <em>conspiracy </em>to commit first-degree burglary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-13\">3. Did the trial court err in restricting the cross-examinations of Demarics Banks and Sergeant Chastity Blades?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>4. Did the trial court err in admitting evidence that the occupant of the burglarized home was killed?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm in part and remand in part the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Reginald Greene lived at 1704 Dale Lane in Salisbury, Maryland (\u201cthe Greene home\u201d) with his sister Barbara Greene. When he returned home at approximately midnight on December 17, 2010, he noticed that \u201cthe back door was busted open.\u201d Walking into the living room, he saw clothes \u201cspread out in the hallway\u201d and \u201ca little blood.\u201d Continuing into the kitchen, he found a rug that had been \u201cpushed over,\u201d and saw snow and footprints on the floor near the back door. He left the house and called the police, who responded and searched the Greene home. When Mr. Greene later returned to the house, he observed that the upstairs bedrooms were \u201ctore up\u201d\u2014\u201c[t]he doors was off the hinges,\u201d \u201cboxes and stuff was ransacked,\u201d and \u201c[t]he drawers was out, busted up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Sergeant Scott Cook, who responded to Mr. Greene\u2019s call, testified that the living room was \u201cvery neat\u201d and the kitchen was \u201cundisturbed,\u201d but described Mr. Greene\u2019s bedroom as \u201cransacked. The drawers were pulled out, emptied, the closet doors were open, stuff was pulled out all over the floor.\u201d Ms. Greene\u2019s bedroom \u201cwasn\u2019t nearly as ransacked,\u201d but it appeared that somebody had \u201cdone a cursory-type search.\u201d According to Sergeant Cook, Demarics Banks and Shawn Franklin \u201cwere the first two suspects that were developed,\u201d and, later, appellant was developed as the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">On December 23, 2010, Detective Chris Taylor<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Detective Tingle<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> interrogated appellant at the Wicomico County\u2019s Sheriffs Office. During that interrogation, according to Detective Taylor, appellant \u201cwas indicating that he didn\u2019t know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>... who we were talking about\u201d and that he \u201chad no involvement whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Sergeant Steve Hall testified that he watched the detectives\u2019 interrogation \u201cfrom another room.\u201d After it was over, he and Sergeant Chastity Blades had an impromptu conversation with appellant, which he recounted to the prosecutor at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">[Sergeant Hall]: I believe [appellant] said that he had talked to Demarics Banks and Shawn Franklin about committing a burglary at [the Greene home].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">He said that Banks and Franklin were pushing him to take them to where the [Greene home] was....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">[Prosecutor]: Did he acknowledge that he had assisted them in planning the burglary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">[Sergeant Hall]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">[Prosecutor]: Did he acknowledge that he and [Tavonne Clark-Smith, who dated appellant after ending a romantic relationship with Mr. Greene,] took [Banks] to show them where the [home] was located?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">[Sergeant Hall]: Yes, they actually rode by the [home] and he identified the [home] for Banks and Franklin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">[Prosecutor]: Did he say anything with respect to his involvement in the burglary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">[Sergeant Hall]: He wasn\u2019t involved in the burglary. He said that he had backed out at the last minute before they went and actually committed the burglary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">Regarding that same conversation, Sergeant Blades testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-14\">[Appellant] at first, denied any involvement in the burglary, and then admitted that he had contact with both Demarics Banks and Shawn Franklin, about committing the burglary. More so with Demarics Banks and that they had agreed that there would be a burglary, that would occur, that no one was supposed to be home. There wasn\u2019t an agreement as to what portion he would get of the burglary, but there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>was an agreement that he would get something out of the burglary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">He further went on to say that Tavonne Clark-Smith had dated, I believe, it was Reginald Greene and that Demarics Banks and Shawn Franklin knew that she had dated him and ... believed that ... she would know where he lived and wanted her to ... drive them by there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">[Prosecutor]: Did he acknowledge that she did, in fact, do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">[Sergeant Blades]: Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">[Prosecutor]: Did he acknowledge that he was present when that occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">[Sergeant Blades]: Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">[Prosecutor]: Did he say anything to you about trying to change his mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">[Sergeant Blades]: He said that he did change his mind but that he did not relay that to Demarics Banks or Shawn Franklin. He said that he had changed his mind prior to the burglary occurring but that he had not relayed that to anyone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">Clark-Smith testified that appellant \u201ckept asking [her] over and over and over again\u201d where Mr. Greene lived, but she never asked why he wanted to know. Finally, during a car ride a few weeks before the burglary, she pointed out the location of the Greene home to appellant and Banks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">Banks, who cooperated as a State\u2019s witness in accordance with a plea agreement, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-14\">\u2022 \u201cthe plan to burglarize the [Greene] home\u201d was \u201coriginally between [appellant] and [Franklin]\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-15\">\u2022 Banks did not \u201cget any of the information about the [Greene home] and the money\u201d\u2014including the location of the Greene home, the amount of money therein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>(approximately $65,000), or the exact location of that money (in the \u201c[bjottom drawer of [a] dresser\u201d)\u2014\u201cfrom anybody other than\u201d appellant,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with whom he \u201cdiscussed\u201d the burglary plan \u201c[o]nce or twice\u201d and with whom he would \u201csplit that money\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u2022 Clark-Smith had pointed out the location of the Greene home when she, he, and appellant had driven by it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u2022 appellant \u201casked [him] to do\u201d the robbery, but Banks did not \u201clet [appellant] know that\u201d he was \u201cgoing to do it that night.\u201d Instead, he \u201ccalled [Franklin],\u201d and they agreed that they would just \u201ctell [appellant] when [they] did it\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u2022 Franklin already knew about the Greene home and the money, but Franklin didn\u2019t tell him that until \u201cafter the fact\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">\u2022 he and Franklin together burglarized the Greene home. Afterwards, they went to appellant\u2019s home and told appellant that the burglary had been unsuccessful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Franklin, appellant\u2019s only witness, testified that: (1) he received his information about the burglary from Banks; (2) he never discussed the burglary with appellant; and (3) appellant did not play \u201cany role in this burglary.\u201d On cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned Franklin about contradictions between this testimony and statements he had made during a December 23, 2010 interview with Detective Taylor. In that interview, the transcript of which was entered into evidence, Franklin stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">\u2022 there was a conversation in which Clark-Smith \u201ctold me there\u2019s a lot of cash somewhere.\u201d Franklin asked appellant, who he knew as \u201cD,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cso you going to put me on to that, what you was talking about? [Appellant] was like no, you got to give me some time.... I was keeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>asking, but he never\u2014you know, but then like down the line, he ... told Banks and shit\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">\u2022 he \u201ckn[e]w nothing about\u201d money being inside the Greene home until he \u201cand Banks talked about it Wednesday!, December 15, 2010] by ourselves\u201d at 407 Hastings Street, which Franklin identified as appellant\u2019s residence. According to Franklin, Banks had stated that appellant had told Banks about the money;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u2022 on Thursday, December 16,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> there was another conversation at 407 Hastings Street among Franklin, Banks, <em>and appellant </em>regarding the robbery plan. According to Franklin, appellant \u201cdidn\u2019t really say nothing, only\u2014but only about the cash. He\u2019s saying, yeah, it\u2019s there, where it was at and everything.... It was right\u2014it\u2019s in the bottom of the drawer where all the envelopes and stuff at\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">\u2022 the robbery was originally planned for Thursday night, \u201c[b]ut I had to ... babysit my son the whole night, so we didn\u2019t do nothing\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u2022 appellant \u201cwasn\u2019t going to\u201d participate in the actual robbery attempt, and thus, although appellant \u201cprobably knew [the burglary] was going to go down,\u201d \u201c[h]e probably ain\u2019t know for real\u201d exactly when it was going to occur;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">\u2022 although appellant had instructed Banks \u201cto go by himself\u2019 on the robbery, Banks \u201ctook [Franklin] anyway\u201d on Friday, December 17, without telling appellant. \u201cBut at first he wouldn\u2019t take me because he had to break off [appellant]. But he was like, fuck it, he just break it off on his half.\u201d In other words, Banks and Franklin were going to \u201csplit it down the middle,\u201d and \u201cBanks was going to give [appellant] out of his cut\u201d in return for the information about the Greene home; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u2022 after the robbery attempt, Banks and Franklin went to 407 Hastings Street, and appellant was \u201cangry because he thought we got something[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Appellant was convicted of: (1) two counts of conspiracy to commit first-degree burglary (2) two counts of conspiracy to commit third-degree burglary, (3) one count of accessory before the fact to first-degree burglary, and (4) one count of accessory before the fact to third-degree burglary. For sentencing purposes, the court merged the two third-degree burglary-conspiracy convictions into the two first-degree burglary-conspiracy convictions, and merged the third-degree burglary-accessory conviction into the first-degree burglary-accessory conviction. Thus, when \u201cthe dust settled,\u201d sentencing was based on two convictions for conspiracy to commit first-degree burglary (one conspiracy between appellant and Franklin, and another conspiracy between appellant and Banks) and a conviction for accessory to first-degree burglary. Appellant was sentenced to consecutive eight-year terms for each of those three remaining convictions. Further facts shall be introduced as required for our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\n<em>Conspiracy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">A criminal conspiracy is \u201cthe combination of two or more persons, who by some concerted action seek to accomplish some unlawful purpose, or some lawful purpose by unlawful means.\u201d <em>Mason v. State, </em>302 Md. 434, 444, 488 A.2d 955 (1985).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As Judge Moylan has reminded us, conspiracy is a \u201ccommon law crime\u201d that \u201carrived in our then proprietary colony as part of the unseen cargo of the Ark and the Dove.\u201d <em>Rudder v. State, </em>181 Md.App. 426, 432, 956 A.2d 791 (2008). At common law, conspiracy \u201cis complete without any overt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>act\u201d to advance its goal, <em>Mason, </em>302 Md. at 444, 488 A.2d 955, and is \u201ca crime at the moment the agreement is formed[.]\u201d Paul Marcus, <em>Conspiracy: The Criminal Agreement, in Theory and in Practice, </em>65 Geo. L.J. 925, 930 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The \u201cunit of prosecution\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for conspiracy is \u201cthe agreement or combination, rather than each of its criminal objectives.\u201d <em>Tracy v. State, </em>319 Md. 452, 459, 573 A.2d 38 (1990). \u201cA single agreement ... constitutes one conspiracy,\u201d and \u201cmultiple agreements ... constitute multiple conspiracies.\u201d <em>United States v. Broce, </em>488 U.S. 563, 570-71, 109 S.Ct. 757, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989). In other words, the conviction of \u201c \u2018a defendant for more than one conspiracy turns on whether there exists more than one unlawful agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Nyhuis, </em>8 F.3d 731, 734 (11th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Cochran, </em>883 F.2d 1012, 1016 (11th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">It is the State\u2019s position that it \u201cpresented evidence that [appellant] made two <em>separate </em>agreements\u2014one with Banks, and one with Franklin\u2014to burglarize\u201d the Greene home, and therefore appellant \u201cproperly received separate punishments for <em>separate </em>conspiracies.\u201d (Emphasis added). Appellant contends that any agreements he made with Banks and Franklin were part of one <em>overall </em>conspiracy to burglarize the Greene home, and thus he is being punished twice for the same crime in violation of the prohibition against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">As appellant contends, multiple agreements can be part of a single conspiracy, <em>State v. Choppy, </em>141 N.C.App. 32, 40, 539 S.E.2d 44 (2000), because \u201c[a] single conspiracy can include subgroups or subagreements[.]\u201d 16 Am.Jur.2d Conspiracy \u00a7 36; <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>819 F.2d 1495, 1502 (9th Cir.1987). The context of the case being prosecuted will determine which side\u2014prosecution or defense\u2014argues that there is only one agreement or conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Abbamonte, </em>759 F.2d 1065, 1068 (2d Cir.1985) (\u201cWhether a defendant\u2019s criminal activities establish his participation in one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>large conspiracy or two separate conspiracies is an issue on which prosecutors and defense counsel have often changed positions \u2018as nimbly as if dancing a quadrille.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Orloff v. Willoughby, </em>345 U.S. 83, 87, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953)).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The prosecution may charge multiple conspiracies with \u201cthe hope that the defendant(s) would receive heavier sentences[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Cerro, </em>775 F.2d 908, 910 (7th Cir.1985). But, perhaps counterintuitively, it is \u201c[m]ore often\u201d the case that \u201cit is the [prosecution] that is arguing for a single overarching conspiracy,\u201d <em>id., </em>in order \u201cto introduce the acts and statements made by co-conspirators in a transaction against individuals involved in an entirely separate transaction by relying upon the co-conspirators\u2019 exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Bolden v. State, </em>44 Md.App. 643, 650, 410 A.2d 1085 (1980). The prosecution takes that approach \u201cwhen more than two conspirators are jointly tried, some of the conspirators are not known to the other conspirators, and a single all-encompassing conspiracy is charged.\u201d Paul Marcus, <em>Prosecution and Defense of Criminal Conspiracy Cases </em>\u00a7 4.02[2], at 4-11 (2012). In that situation, the defendant may contend that there were multiple conspiracies and his involvement was limited to only one smaller conspiracy, <em>see Iannelli v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 770, 784, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975); <em>United States v. Prince, </em>515 F.2d 564, 567 (5th Cir.1975), and advance a variance argument. <em>See Abbamonte, </em>759 F.2d at 1068 (When a defendant \u201curges that, though the indictment alleged one conspiracy, the evidence showed at least two,\u201d he may \u201cchallenge [the] conviction on the ground of variance[.]\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The State has the burden to prove the agreement or agreements underlying a conspiracy prosecution. <em>See </em>Albert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>J. Harno, <em>Intent in Criminal Conspiracy, </em>89 U. Pa. L. Rev. 624, 632 (1941) (prosecution must \u201cprove as laid[ ] the agreement on which\u201d a particular conspiracy charge is based). If the prosecution seeks to establish a single conspiracy, it has the burden \u201cto prove the existence of \u2018one overall conspiracy ... <em>as opposed to separate and independent conspiracies.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Trainor, </em>477 F.3d 24, 35 (1st Cir.2007) (emphasis added). If it seeks to establish multiple conspiracies, it \u201chas the burden of proving a <em>separate </em>agreement for each conspiracy.\u201d 16 Am Jur 2d Conspiracy \u00a7 40 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">When a defendant \u201ccontends that only one conspiracy exists, while the [prosecution] insists there are at least two,\u201d he \u201cchallenges [his] conviction[s] on the ground of double jeopardy[.]\u201d <em>Abbamonte, </em>759 F.2d at 1068. The theory underlying the double jeopardy challenge is that, \u201c[t]o convict [him] severally for being part of two conspiracies when in reality he is only involved in one overall conspiracy would be convicting him of the same crime twice.\u201d <em>United States v. Palermo, </em>410 F.2d 468, 470 (7th Cir.1969) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>To be sure, determining the number of conspiracies and distinguishing one agreement from another is a \u201cchallenge\u201d with which \u201c[c]ourts have long wrestled.\u201d Anne Bowen Poulin, <em>Double Jeopardy Protection from Successive Prosecution: a Proposed Approach, </em>92 Geo. L.J. 1183, 1274 n. 507 (2004). This is, in part, because \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has not ... established in the double jeopardy context how to determine whether there was one agreement or more than one agreement,\u201d William H. Theis, <em>The Double Jeopardy Defense and Multiple Prosecutions For Conspiracy, </em>49 SMU L.Rev. 269, 286 (1996), and because conspiracy law is often \u201ca veritable quicksand of shifting opinion and ill considered thought.\u201d Francis B. Sayre, <em>Criminal Conspiracy, </em>35 Harv. L.Rev. 393, 393 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">To address the single as opposed to multiple conspiracies question, it is \u201cnecessary to analyze the nature of the agreement\u201d or agreements, <em>Mason v. State, </em>302 Md. 434, 445, 488 A.2d 955 (1985), and to ask, when there are agreements among several parties, \u201cwhether there was \u2018one overall agreement\u2019 to perform various functions to achieve the objectives of the conspiracy,\u2019 \u201d or separate conspiracies. <em>United States v. Arbelaez, </em>719 F.2d 1453, 1457 (9th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>United States v. Zemek, </em>634 F.2d 1159, 1167 (9th Cir.1980)). In making that determination, some courts consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d in their analysis. <em>United States v. Fenton, </em>367 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>450 F.3d 856, 860 (8th Cir.2006). Justice Blackmun has observed that courts \u201chave looked to a number of discrete factors. Some of these include the relevant (1) time, (2) participants, (3) ... offenses charged, (4) overt acts charged, and (5) places where the alleged acts took place.\u201d <em>United States v. Broce, </em>488 U.S. 563, 585 n. 2, 109 S.Ct. 757, 102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>L.Ed.2d 927 (1989) (Blackmnun, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">In the multiple conspiracy context, the agreements are \u201cdistinct,\u201d <em>Manuel v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 1, 12, 581 A.2d 1287 (1990), and \u201cindependent\u201d from each other, <em>Timney v. State, </em>80 Md.App. 356, 368, 563 A.2d 1121 (1989), in that each agreement has \u201cits own end, and each constitutes an end in itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Sababu, </em>891 F.2d 1308, 1322 (7th Cir.1989) (citing <em>Blumenthal v. United States, </em>332 U.S. 539, 558-59, 68 S.Ct. 248, 92 L.Ed. 154 (1947)). If the prosecution fails to present \u201cproof sufficient to establish a second conspiracy,\u201d it follows that \u201cthere [is] merely one continuous conspiratorial relationship,\u201d <em>Vandegrift v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 617, 646, 573 A.2d 56 (1990), or one \u201congoing criminal enterprise,\u201d <em>Rudder v.

The Court of Appeals saw instead \u201cone continuous conspiratorial relationship ... to commit robbery and murder,\u201d and held that \u201cTracy\u2019s and Jordan\u2019s decision to change which of the two participants would actually carry out the intended murder and to change the type of weapon to be used to commit the crimes would not be sufficient to constitute a second conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In <em>Ezenwa v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 489, 572 A.2d 1101 (1990), each defendant was charged with and convicted of \u201ctwo distinct conspiracies: (1) to import heroin and (2) to distribute heroin.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 572 A.2d 1101. The defendants asserted on appeal that they were \u201cprejudiced by the failure to dismiss one of the two counts of conspiracy and, therefore, that [the] convictions must be reversed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 572 A.2d 1101. The State</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">conceded that a single agreement underlay both conspiracy counts. It stated, however, that that agreement had two distinct objectives; hence, it maintained that, for that reason, the conspiracy was properly charged in two counts. In the State\u2019s view, both counts had to be submitted to the jury and, in the event that the jury found appellants guilty of both, their remedy lay in their being sentenced on only one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa\"><em>Id. </em>at 498, 572 A.2d 1101. The State also contended that because \u201ceach count contained a different element, <em>i.e., </em>the different object of the conspiracy, they are not the same offense\u201d under the required evidence test. <em>Id. </em>at 500, 572 A.2d 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Reasoning that \u201cthe State conceded that a single agreement underlay both conspiracy counts,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 498, 572 A.2d 1101, we stated both that the convictions \u201cought to merge\u201d for sentencing purposes, <em>id. </em>at 504, 572 A.2d 1101, and\u2014noting that the same penalty was imposed for each conviction\u2014that \u201cone of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the conspiracy sentences must be vacated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501, 572 A.2d 1101.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We also stated that although \u201cthe application of the required evidence test would indicate that the offenses are not the same, ... they may very well be alternative modes of committing the single crime of conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504, 572 A.2d 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">In <em>Vandegrift v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 617, 573 A.2d 56 (1990), Vandegrift was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiracy to distribute marijuana, and conspiracy to import cocaine. On appeal, he argued for the merger of these convictions for sentencing. We held that, \u201calthough distributing and importing controlled dangerous substances constitute distinct objectives,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 646, 573 A.2d 56, \u201cthe evidence [was] not sufficient to show the existence of separate conspiratorial agreements to distribute and import.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 645, 573 A.2d 56. Thus, \u201cin the absence of proof sufficient to establish a second conspiracy, there was merely one continuous conspiratorial relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 646, 573 A.2d 56. According to the Court, where the conspiracy sentencing statute \u201cdoes not expressly relate to any substantive offense,\u201d and it is \u201cunclear whether the Legislature intended that sentences be cumulative for different criminal acts that result from a single common law conspiracy,\u201d the rule of lenity would apply. <em>Id. </em>at 644, 573 A.2d 56.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In <em>Manuel v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 1, 581 A.2d 1287 (1990), two of the defendants, Aniunoh and Manuel, alleged that their convictions for conspiracy to possess and distribute <em>heroin </em>should merge with their convictions for conspiracy to possess and distribute <em>cocaine. </em>We disagreed and held that \u201cthe nature of the agreement among the members of the [heroin] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>drug ring\u201d did not extend \u201cto cocaine trafficking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 581 A.2d 1287. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">Of the thousands of telephone calls intercepted by the police and the numerous conversations recorded via Thomas\u2019 body wire, there are four distinct components of one cocaine transaction. In the course of a heroin deal which occurred on October 15, 1987, Aniunoh told Thomas that he could obtain some \u201cgirl,\u201d the street name for cocaine, if Thomas was interested. Aniunoh revealed possible sources in Virginia and in Atlanta. Aniunoh then contacted a possible supplier, Kingsley, in Mississippi, who disclosed his terms and invited Aniunoh to Mississippi to conclude the deal. Aniunoh also discussed with Manuel the terms of the cocaine supplier with whom the latter was familiar. Aniunoh then contacted Thomas to further negotiate the cocaine trafficking scheme.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">While the conspiracy to distribute cocaine emanated from the heroin conspiracy, it was a separate, distinct agreement. The cocaine scheme was the offspring solely of conspirators Aniunoh and Manuel, whereas the heroin ring was the prodigy of Onwuneme, Ohakwe, Brewer, Aniunoh, Manuel and many others. The heroin conspirators did not broach the topic of cocaine distribution; rather their focus centered on heroin. The cocaine conspiracy is further distinguishable due to the use of different suppliers. The cocaine derived from a source in the southeast portion of the United States whereas the heroin primarily originated in Nigeria. Finally, the two conspiracies covered different periods of time. The heroin trafficking spanned from January 1987 through February 1988, approximately a thirteen-month period, while the cocaine conspiracy covered a two-month stretch between October 1987 and December 1987. Under these circumstances the cocaine conspiracy constituted a separate offense which does not warrant merger with the heroin conspiracy conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Id. at 11-12, 581 A.2d 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Looking beyond Maryland, it has been said that \u201cthe question of whether one or more than one conspiracy has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>established is a question of fact <em>for a properly instructed, jury.\u201d United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, </em>922 F.2d 934, 962 (2d Cir.1990) (emphasis added). For example, in <em>United States v. Frierson, </em>698 F.3d 1267 (10th Cir.2012), the defendant was convicted of, <em>inter alia, </em>conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine (count 11),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and conspiracy to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine (count 28).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that the convictions violated double jeopardy, and remanded the case to the trial court \u201cwith instructions ... to vacate Defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence on either Count 11 or Count 28.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1270. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">To establish that the two conspiracies charged in Counts 11 and 28 were distinct\u2014that is, that the conspiracy convictions were not multiplicitous\u2014the jury had to find the \u201cexistence] [of] more than one agreement to perform some illegal act or acts.\u201d To do so, the \u201cjurors [had to be] adequately instructed that they could not find [Defendant] guilty of more than one count of conspiracy unless they were convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he entered into two separate agreements to violate the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>In this case the jury was not so instructed, and accordingly it did not find that Defendant entered into two separate agreements to distribute crack cocaine. The instruction to the jurors that they \u201cseparately consider each defendant and each Count,\u201d did not alert them that they needed to find that the two conspiracies involved distinct agreements. And there was nothing in the government\u2019s closing argument to suggest that the conspiracy alleged in Count 11 was anything other than part of the larger conspiracy alleged in Count 28, or that Defendant had two separate agreements to distribute illegal drugs. Thus, the two convictions on Counts 11 and 28 are plainly multiplicitous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In <em>Turnley v. State, </em>725 N.E.2d 87 (Ind.2000), Turnley and Thacker discussed burglarizing the home of Anthony and Monique Hollowell. \u201cThacker proposed that they break into the Hollowells\u2019 home in the daytime when no one would be home. Thacker added that, if the men were unable to locate the money, they would return that evening and take Monique\u2019s purse. Turnley agreed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89. The next day, around noon, Turnley and Thacker broke into the house, but found no money. They decided to return later that night. When they did, they again found no money. But, after discovering Monique Hollowell asleep, they assaulted and murdered her.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Turnley was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit burglary. On appeal, he argued that \u201cone of his two conspiracy to commit burglary convictions ... should be vacated because the evidence presented at trial proved only one agreement,\u201d while the State argued that there were separate agreements. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Indiana agreed with Turnley: \u201c[t]he agreement was to attempt to locate the money during the afternoon, while Monique was at work, but it also contemplated returning that evening if the money could not be found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90. The court also noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the jury was not instructed on the \u201cone conspiracy, one conviction\u201d rule. Rather, the trial court gave a single instruction defining the crime of \u201cconspiracy.\u201d No other instruction suggested that the State needed to prove separate agreements to prove each separate conspiracy count. The jury may very well have been left with the impression that one agreement could support more than one conspiracy count.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 90 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Although not a jury instruction case, we also find <em>United States v. Cerro, </em>775 F.2d 908 (7th Cir.1985), instructive. Cerro was convicted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">of five counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine .... The [trial] judge gave him concurrent 15-year sentences on the first three conspiracy counts and consecutive 15-year sentences on the fourth and fifth conspiracy counts, for a total of 45 years.<footnotemark>[17]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">Each of the alleged conspiracies was between Cerro and one other person, to whom Cerro consigned (\u201cfronted\u201d) up to one ounce of cocaine each week for resale to users of cocaine. Each dealer would remit all or part of his retail sales revenues to Cerro, either retaining some of the revenues as compensation for his services or retaining some of the cocaine in lieu of money compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">On appeal, Cerro contended that the five conspiracies were \u201caspects of a single conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 910. Although there was \u201cno direct evidence\u201d that each dealer knew there were other dealers, which would indicate multiple conspiracies, <em>id. </em>at 914, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that Cerro was given an \u201cillegal sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 912. Calling the lack of direct evidence \u201cnot surprising,\u201d given that \u201c[i]t was no part of the government\u2019s purpose to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>show an overarching conspiracy,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 914, the court reasoned that \u201cthe government should not be allowed to obtain a sentencing advantage from having failed at trial to explore the dealers\u2019 knowledge of the scope of the conspiracy in which each was involved,\u201d and \u201ccannot shift, to a defendant fearful of more severe punishment, the burden of proving how much his coconspirators knew about the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Here, there was testimony that, if credited by the jury, might establish, as a matter of law, two separate conspiracies. The following colloquy between Banks and the prosecutor at trial indicates that appellant sought out Banks <em>only after Franklin had backed out:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">Q. Were you originally the person that was supposed to commit the burglary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">Q. Who was originally supposed to do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">A. [Franklin].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-11\">Q. <em>Did [appellant] tell you why [Franklin] wasn\u2019t doing it?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-13\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">On the other hand, the State, at trial, did not advance a two-conspiracy theory by seeking to prove that: (1) the conspiracy to burglarize the Greene home was originally between only Franklin and appellant, and that, when Franklin dropped out, the appellant-Franklin conspiracy terminated; and (2) then, when appellant joined with Banks in that same endeavor, a new conspiracy was created.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-16\">Recognizing that \u201c[i]t is impossible in the nature of things for a man to conspire with himself,\u201d <em>Morrison v. California, </em>291 U.S. 82, 92, 54 S.Ct. 281, 78 L.Ed. 664 (1934), and, therefore, \u201cthe crime of conspiracy necessarily requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>[agreement] of at least two people,\u201d <em>Gardner v. State, </em>286 Md. 520, 524, 408 A.2d 1317 (1979), Judge Bazelon has explained: \u201c[t]here may ... be a continuing conspiracy with a changing dramatis personae, <em>so long as there are never less than two conspirators. </em>A gap during which there is only one actor breaks the continuity.\u201d <em>Greene v. United States, </em>246 F.2d 677, 680 (D.C.Cir.1957) (Bazelon, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). When such a gap occurs, the appearance of a new and different confederate with the remaining actor creates \u201ca new and separate conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">It has been said that \u201c[a] conspiracy is presumed to continue until there is an affirmative evidence of abandonment, withdrawal, disavowal or defeat of the purposes of the conspiracy,\u201d <em>United States v. Little, </em>753 F.2d 1420, 1448 (9th Cir.1984), <em>\u201ceven if the participants ... change over time </em>[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Roach, </em>164 F.3d 403, 412 (8th Cir.1998) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But, it is necessary for one conspiracy to end before a second distinct and separate conspiracy can be formed. <em>See Bergeron v. State, </em>85 Wis.2d 595, 608, 271 N.W.2d 386 (1978) (the end of one conspiracy \u201cis inextricably bound to whether a second conspiracy was formed\u201d). The question is whether there was a \u201cbreak,\u201d for an \u201cappreciable time, in the sequence of events,\u201d in order to \u201ccategorize\u201d the agreements as \u201cseparate and distinct.\u201d <em>Purnell v. State, </em>375 Md. 678, 698, 827 A.2d 68 (2003). As a practical matter, the fact that a conspirator in a two-person conspiracy seeks a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>replacement for a departed would-be cohort is a strong indication of the failure of one conspiracy and the creation of another.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">If a defendant is convicted of and sentenced for multiple conspiracies when, in fact, only one conspiracy was proven, the Double Jeopardy Clause has been violated. The foregoing authority persuades us that, under the facts of this case, one of appellant\u2019s two conspiracy convictions must be vacated to avoid this violation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>See Jordan v. State, </em>323 Md. 151, 160-61, 591 A.2d 875 (1991) (The imposition of two conspiracy sentences resulted in an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d under Rule 4-345(a) even though the defendant \u201c(1) did not object to two conspiracy counts being submitted to the jury, (2) did not except to the conspiracy instructions actually given to the jury, and (3) even after the jury found him guilty of two conspiracies, did not make the contention he now makes on appeal with respect to [this] issue.\u201d). First, unlike the <em>Turnley </em>court, we are not prepared to say that there was clearly \u201conly one agreement to commit a burglary\u201d in this case. 725 N.E.2d 87, 90 (Ind.2000). But, we are persuaded that the jury instruction was inadequate to convict and sentence appellant of multiple conspiracies. The jury was instructed generally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">Conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime. In order to convict [appellant] of conspiracy, the State must prove, one, that [appellant] entered into an agreement with at least one other person to commit the crime; and two, that [appellant] entered into the agreement with the intent that the crime be committed. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>is not necessary that a formal agreement be shown, nor that it be manifested by formal words, either written or spoken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">An agreement exists if the parties to a conspiracy tacitly come to an understanding with regard to an unlawful act or purpose. Both the agreement and the specific intent may be inferred from the surrounding circumstances.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5\">Without an instruction that the jury could not find appellant \u201cguilty of more than one count of conspiracy unless [it] was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he entered into two <em>separate </em>agreements to violate the law,\u201d <em>United States v. Frierson, </em>698 F.3d 1267, 1270 (10th Cir.2012) (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Swingler, </em>758 F.2d 477, 492 (10th Cir.1985) (similar instruction to Frierson), the State was not put to the test of proving separate conspiracies, and therefore it cannot be \u201callowed to obtain a sentencing advantage from having failed at trial to\u201d do so. <em>United States v. Cerro, </em>775 F.2d 908, 913 (7th Cir.1985). Without a proper instruction, \u201c[t]he jury may very well have been left with the impression that one agreement could support more than one conspiracy count.\u201d <em>Turnley, </em>725 N.E.2d 87 at 90 n. 2. We recognize that the jury was also instructed that it \u201cmust consider [each charge] individually and separately,\u201d but that general instruction was insufficient to \u201calert\u201d the jury that it \u201cneeded to find that the two conspiracies involved distinct agreements.\u201d <em>Frierson, </em>698 F.3d. at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In other words, without a clear instruction, there is no way to be certain that one or more jurors voting guilty did not see the appellant-Banks agreement and the appellant-Franklin agreement as one overall conspiracy among appellant, Banks, and Franklin to burglarize the Greene home. <em>United States v. Echeverry, </em>698 F.2d 375, 377 (9th Cir.1983). We are not willing to \u201cassume\u201d that the jury was \u201cso well informed\u201d of conspiracy law\u2019s subtleties and the State\u2019s burden to prove two distinct conspiracies that it did not do just that. <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 769, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>(1946). In fact, the note sent by the jury during its deliberations, which stated \u201cWhat is the difference between counts one and three, and counts two and four? They are the same.,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> indicates jury confusion regarding the conspiracy counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Second, as in <em>Frierson, </em>there was nothing in the State\u2019s opening or closing remarks to suggest to the jury that there were multiple conspiracies or that the appellant-Banks agreement was distinct from the appellant-Franklin agreement. During opening statements, the prosecutor stated that appellant and Banks</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">plotted ... to go ahead with the burglary and <em>the agreement </em>was that [appellant] would not actually participate in going to the [Greene] home but that whatever Demarics Banks and Shawn Franklin retrieved from inside the [Greene home], he would get a cut of for giving them the information and showing them where the [home] was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_\">(Emphasis added). The prosecutor also twice referred to a \u201cconspiracy\u201d\u2014rather than \u201cconspiracies\u201d\u2014to burglarize the Greene home.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">During closing arguments, the prosecutor stated, \u201c[t]he conspiracy <em>count </em>requires that the State prove that [appellant] entered into an agreement with at least one other person. I would submit to you that he entered into <em>the agreement </em>with <em>both </em>[Franklin] and [Banks], but for conspiracy it only has to be one person.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">If anything, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks suggest an agreement among appellant, Franklin, and Banks to burglarize the Greene home. In <em>Tracy v. State, </em>319 Md. 452, 573 A.2d 38 (1990), to buttress its holding that Tracy\u2019s two convictions were part of the same conspiracy, the Court of Appeals \u201cnote[d] that during his closing argument, the prosecutor told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the jury \u2018our contention is that Tracy entered into <em>an </em>agreement with Jordan to commit these various crimes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, 573 A.2d 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Third, as in <em>Cerro, </em>the State did not concern itself with proving separate conspiracies. In fact, although the indictment contained separate conspiracy counts as to Banks and as to Franklin,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> it was not until the jury note raised the issue that there was even a hint of the State\u2019s interest in proving separate conspiracies. In response to the question posed in that jury note, the verdict sheet, with the consent of both counsel, was amended in handwriting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">\u2022 Count one: \u201cConspiracy to Commit First Degree Burglary <em>w/ Demwi.es Banks</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">\u2022 Count two: \u201cConspiracy to Commit Third Degree Burglary <em>w/ Demarics Banks</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">\u2022 Count three: \u201cConspiracy to Commit First Degree Burglary <em>w/ Shawn Franklin </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">\u2022 Count four: \u201cConspiracy to Commit Third Degree Burglary <em>wl Shawn Franklin.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">(Emphasis added). The court also indicated that it would send a response to the jury stating: \u201cCounts One and two charge [appellant] as to Banks. Counts three and four charge [appellant] as to Franklin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">The court later announced on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-11\">Because there was a suggestion of confusion by the jury through the question they presented, the Court did meet with both the State and the defense and agreed to amend the verdict sheet, so that it showed conspiracy\u2014let\u2019s take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>count one, conspiracy to commit first-degree burglary. We added the words, with the coconspirator\u2019s name. We did that for each of the first four counts, or each of the counts involved in their question so that it was clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The amendment of the verdict sheet to designate in each count the person with whom appellant conspired in no way addressed the single or multiple conspiracies issue and the State\u2019s obligation to prove two separate conspiracies.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Moreover, while the jury could have credited Banks\u2019s testimony indicating that appellant sought out Banks <em>only after Franklin had backed out, </em>the following evidence would also support a finding that appellant, Banks and Franklin were part of <em>one </em>conspiracy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">\u2022 Sergeant Hall testified that appellant said that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">\u2022 \u201che had talked to Demarics Banks and Shawn Franklin about committing a burglary at [the house]\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">\u2022 \u201cBanks and Franklin were pushing him to take them to where the house was\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">\u2022 he \u201cassisted\u201d Banks and Franklin in planning the burglary; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">\u2022 \u201che identified the house for Banks and Franklin\u201d;<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">\u2022 Sergeant Blades testified that appellant said that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-13\">\u2022 \u201che had contact with both Demarics Banks and Shawn Franklin, about committing the burglary\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-14\">\u2022 Clark-Smith had driven appellant, Banks, and Franklin to see the Greene home;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-15\">\u2022 Banks testified and Franklin stated during his interview that, when the burglary was over, Banks and Franklin went to appellant\u2019s house and told appellant what had happened; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u2022 Franklin stated during his interview that he, appellant, and Banks jointly discussed the robbery plan on Thursday, December 16, 2010.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Had (1) the jury been properly instructed, (2) a two-conspiracy argument been advanced by the State, and (3) the jury found either a single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies, we would, in a sufficiency review, review the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict. Under the circumstances present in this case, we cannot do so. Therefore, one of appellant\u2019s conspiracy convictions must be vacated. <em>See Ezenwa v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 489, 504, 572 A.2d 1101 (1990) (\u201cSince ... the same penalty was assessed for both [conspiracy convictions], we may vacate one of the convictions and allow the other to stand.\u201d)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\n<em>Accessory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Appellant argues that, under either the required evidence test or for \u201cfundamental fairness,\u201d his conviction for accessory before the fact to first-degree burglary should merge with his one remaining conviction for conspiracy to commit first-degree burglary. The State responds that \u201c[i]t is well settled law in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Maryland that convictions for accessory before the fact and conspiracy do not merge under the required evidence test,\u201d and that, based on appellant\u2019s \u201cinstrumental role in the completion of the substantive offense ... there is nothing fundamentally unfair about punishing [him] separately for his agreements with Banks and Franklin to commit the burglary, and for his role in the consummated offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Accessory before the fact to first-degree burglary requires proof that the defendant <em>\u201caided, counseled, commanded, or encouraged </em>\u201d another to commit a burglary, <em>\u201cwithout </em>having been present either actually or constructively at the moment of perpetration.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>397 Md. 172, 193, 916 A.2d 294 (2007) (citations omitted) (emphasis added). Because \u201caccessoryship\u201d is a \u201cmechanism by which culpability for the substantive crime is incurred,\u201d a \u201ccompleted crime is a necessary element.\u201d <em>Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 759, 506 A.2d 580 (1986). Conspiracy to commit first-degree burglary requires an agreement to commit the burglary, but it does not require proof that an actual or attempted burglary occurred. Thus, because each crime contains an element that the other does not, appellant\u2019s accessory conviction does not, under the required evidence test, merge with his one remaining conspiracy conviction. <em>See State v. Lancaster, </em>332 Md. 385, 391, 631 A.2d 453 (1993) (\u201cif each offense contains an element which the other does not, there is no merger under the required evidence test even though both offenses are based upon the same act or acts\u201d); <em>Grandison, </em>305 Md. at 759, 506 A.2d 580 (\u201c[E]ach of these crimes requires an element distinct from the other. Conspiracy to murder requires an agreement, while murder, regardless of whether one is convicted as an accessory or a principal, requires the completed crime. Thus it is apparent that the conspiracy to murder is a separate and distinct crime from the substantive crime itself.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">As to his \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d argument, appellant, citing <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 582 A.2d 525 (1990), contends that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>in the present case, accessory before the fact is an integral component of the alleged conspiracy. The same acts that formed the accessory before the fact formed the conspiracy. Therefore, it would be fundamentally unfair to sentence appellant for both crimes. As such, appellant\u2019s sentence for accessory before the fact should be merged into the conspiracy sentence[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In <em>Monoker, </em>the Court of Appeals held that fundamental fairness required the merging of the defendant\u2019s convictions for <em>solicitation </em>to commit daytime housebreaking and <em>conspiracy </em>to commit the same because the conspiracy \u201cripen[ed] from\u201d the solicitation, such that \u201csolicitation was part and parcel of the ultimate conspiracy and thereby an integral component of it[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223, 582 A.2d 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Assuming, without deciding, that consideration of fundamental fairness was preserved for appellate review\u2014we are not persuaded that merger was required under the fundamental fairness doctrine. <em>See Pair v. State, 202 </em>Md.App. 617, 649, 33 A.3d 1024 (2011) (\u201cWe decline, however, to review the issue of merger pursuant to the so-called \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 test because we do not believe that it enjoys the procedural dispensation of Rule 4-345(a). We do not believe that a non-merged sentence pursuant to such a fluid test dependent upon a subjective evaluation of the particular evidence in a particular case is an inherently \u2018illegal sentence\u2019 within the tightly limited contemplation of the rule.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Appellant\u2019s conspiracy and accessory convictions address, in our view, two different aspects of the burglary: the agreement to burglarize the Greene home with one or more persons, and the specific acts taken prior to and towards its commission. Regarding the latter, in this case, appellant \u201ckept asking [Clark-Smith] over and over and over again\u201d to show him the Greene home and he personally, along with Clark-Smith, took Banks and/or Franklin to show them the home before the burglary. <em>See Coleman v. State, </em>209 Md. 379, 384-85, 121 A.2d 254 (1956) (\u201cTo be an aider or abettor it is not essential that there be a prearranged concert of action,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>ment, \u201calthough, in the absence of such action, it is essential that he should in some way advocate or encourage the commission of the crime.\u201d). These actions were important to success of the burglary and exceeded mere planning.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In doing so, appellant clearly aided, counseled and encouraged the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\n<em>Cross-examination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u201cThe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights guarantee a criminal defendant the right to confront the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>Martinez v.

Giddens, </em>335 Md. 205, 217, 642 A.2d 870 (1994). We perceive no error or abuse of discretion in sustaining the prosecutor\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Nor, based on our review of the colloquy, are we persuaded that appellant\u2019s counsel was attempting to impeach Banks through a prior inconsistent statement. First\u2014and assuming that Banks\u2019s denial was in response to appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s assertion, \u201cyou did say that you sold a lot of dope,\u201d rather than to the assertion \u201cthat that was the only thing that you had ever done\u201d\u2014it was not until <em>after </em>these questions were asked that there was any basis to advance impeachment by an inconsistent statement. We do not see where appellant made it clear to the court that the sale of \u201ca lot of dope\u201d exchange was laying the foundation for impeachment by a prior inconsistent statement or pursued it after the court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\n<em>Sergeant Blades</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">During direct examination, the following exchange occurred between the prosecutor and Sergeant Blades:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">[Prosecutor]: Did [appellant] say anything to you about trying to change his mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">[Sergeant Blades]: He said that he did change his mind but that he did not relay that to Demarics Banks or Shawn Franklin. He said that he changed his mind prior to the burglary occurring but that he had not relayed that to anyone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">And, during cross-examination of Sergeant Blades, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>[Appellant\u2019s counsel]: You said that [appellant] said that he changed his mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\">[Sergeant Blades]: That\u2019s what he told me, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">[Appellant\u2019s counsel]: And what do you mean he changed his mind, about what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">[Prosecutor]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">The Court: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">[Prosecutor]: [Sergeant Blades] can\u2019t say what [appellant] means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">The trial court erred in sustaining the objection. The question asked what [Sergeant Blades] meant by the answer, not what appellant meant. The State asked the question on direct examination about appellant changing his mind. [Sergeant Blades] answered the question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">According to appellant, the error was not \u201charmless\u201d because \u201cwithdrawal from a conspiracy constitutes a complete defense to the crime of conspiracy.\u201d The State responds that, even if it the court abused its discretion in sustaining the objection, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">We agree with the State. First, as we have previously explained, mere withdrawal is not a \u201ccomplete defense\u201d to the crime of conspiracy. <em>See supra, </em>n. 19. Second, as pointed out by the State, what appellant \u201csought to elicit was admitted through another source (besides Sergeant Blades\u2019s direct examination).\u201d More specifically, Sergeant Hall, who was part of the conversation with appellant described by Sergeant Blades, testified, without objection, that appellant had told the sergeants that \u201c[h]e wasn\u2019t involved in the burglary. He said that he had backed out at the last minute before they went and actually committed the burglary.\u201d A \u201cruling, even if erroneous, would not present a reversible error\u201d where \u201cit is clear that the identical fact, sought to be proved by one witness, was subsequently proved without objection by another witness.\u201d <em>Gouker v.

Our understanding of the charges [is] that they basically allege that [appellant] conspired to ... plan and commit the crime of burglary. That crime allegedly occurred and an individual died in the course of or as a result of that crime. [Appellant] is not charged with the death or any of the aspects of the death of that individual.

Subsequent to the burglary or in the course of the burglary somebody died. Or do you wish us to simply allege that [appellant] is charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit the crime of burglary? One of the witnesses who may testify in this matter, from our understanding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the case, is an individual who has pled guilty to causing the death of the individual and that person is going to testify to implicate [appellant], and the conspiracy aspect of this case, and the conspiracy aspect of the ease only. The State did not intend to bring out the death of the victim but the defense may inquire of this witness regarding that person\u2019s plea and the plea arrangement made for that person\u2019s testimony. <em>So the question was whether we refer to the death in the opening statements by\u2014the preliminary statements by the Court to the jury and now the answer we have is, no.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">[The Court]: Is that the record as we understand it, [Ms. prosecutor]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">[Prosecutor]: Yes, Your Honor, however I would ask that you mention that the home belonged to Barbara Greene and Reginald Greene.
