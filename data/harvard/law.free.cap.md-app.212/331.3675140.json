That sentence was to run concurrent to the sentence imposed in Case No. K-10-2130.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On appeal, appellant presents three questions for our review, which we have revised as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">I. Did the circuit court err in denying his motion to suppress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">II. In Case No. K-10-2230, did the circuit court impose an illegal sentence in violation of the plea agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">III. In Case No. K-10-2131, was the evidence sufficient to support his conviction for reckless endangerment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer \u201cno\u201d to questions I and III, and \u201cyes\u201d to question II.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-16\">On April 4 and 8, 2011, the parties came before the court on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress \u201cphysical items seized,\u201d \u201cstatements,\u201d and \u201csome subsequent photo arrays\u201d that were allegedly the \u201cfruit\u201d of \u201cone specific stop\u201d involving appellant. As explained by appellant\u2019s counsel, evidence obtained and statements made as the result of this stop \u201cleads to ... five cases,\u201d including the four in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Detective John Murphy testified that, in the fall of 2010, he was investigating several robberies that had occurred in the area of Thom and Forest Drives in the Quiet Waters Village community of Annapolis. According to Detective Murphy, police had formed a \u201csuspect description\u201d based on descriptions given by the robbery victims: \u201c[b]lack male, six foot, cornrows, dreads, and slight facial hair.\u201d Police had also been \u201cmade aware\u201d that the suspect went by the nickname \u201cB.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">On October 18, 2010, a robbery occurred in Quiet Waters Village. The suspect was described as a \u201c[b]lack male, wearing cornrows\u201d and riding a dark-colored bicycle. The next day, Detective Murphy was watching a \u201clive feed\u201d of \u201cthe Bens Drive area, the Marcs Court, which is across the street from Quiet Waters.\u201d He observed \u201ctwo subjects ... on [bicycles] at the bottom of Marcs Court. One was on a bike that was darker in color, one was on a light-colored bike.... \u201d According to Detective Murphy, the individual on the dark-colored bicycle matched the description of \u201cthe suspect in the robberies\u201d: \u201c[b]lack male, dark-colored clothing, I could see cornrows on his head. I couldn\u2019t see his face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Detective Murphy \u201ccalled for a patrol officer who was in the area to go down and identify the subjects[.]\u201d Through the live feed, the detective observed that, when Officer Michael Prout arrived on the scene, the man on the dark-colored bicycle \u201ctook off\u2019 and \u201cran off into the building straight ahead\u201d; the man on the light-colored bicycle stood by his bicycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Officer Prout testified that he was on patrol duty on October 19, 2010, when he received a radio call from Detective Murphy asking him to go to the Marcs Court area to investigate two black males riding bicycles. He \u201cknew of a robbery that happened the evening before\u201d and had been \u201cbriefed in lineup as to the suspect\u2019s description\u201d: \u201ca black male, ranging in six foot one to about six foot three in height. And his nickname was B[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The officer drove to the Marcs Court area and, as he turned his marked police cruiser onto Marcs Court, he saw two men riding bicycles toward a nearby apartment building located at 9 Marcs Court, their backs to the cruiser. One of the men <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>was wearing \u201ca white sweatshirt with red vertical lines, blue jeans,\u201d and the other was wearing \u201ca black baseball cap, I think a dreadlock style haircut and a camouflaged jacket.\u201d As he approached, the man in the white sweatshirt, later identified as appellant, abandoned his bicycle, ran \u201cwith his back turned ... into the mouth\u201d of 9 Marcs Court, and entered Apartment F. Officer Prout was \u201cnot sure\u201d if the suspect saw him. The other man (later identified as Joshua Grier) \u201cjust stood there.\u201d He told Officer Prout that the man who ran away went by the nickname \u201cB.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the officer, \u201cas soon as Mr. Grier said that, alarms went off\u2019 and he radioed for backup, indicating that the \u201csubject that ran into the building\u201d matched the description from the briefing: \u201ca black male fitting the height requirements, nickname of B.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Additional officers arrived, and a \u201cp[e]r[ijmeter\u201d was set up \u201caround the building.\u201d Detective Richard Truitt attempted to \u201cmake contact with the resident whoever was in apartment F ... to try to ... get into the apartment and ... identify the subject that just ran in.\u201d According to Officer Prout, Detective Truitt announced that he was a police officer and banged on the door to the apartment. Eventually, an \u201cadult female came to the door\u201d and indicated that her two children and appellant were in the apartment. She agreed to leave the apartment with her children and they were \u201cescorted away.\u201d At that point, the group of officers \u201cstood outside of the apartment and Detective Truitt continued to ask the person inside, [appellant], to come out for approximately 25/30 minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Officer Prout testified that, \u201cafter the [SWAT] Access Team arrived, I believe [appellant] came out on his own accord and they were able to put him into custody.\u201d The officer also testified that \u201cI believe the consent was given by the female\u201d and the SWAT team \u201csearched the apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Officer Jennifer Card testified that, on October 18,2010, she was \u201ccalled\u201d to 9 Marcs Court, Apartment F, in Annapolis. There, she \u201cspoke with\u201d Sherry Brown, who indicated that she was the \u201cleaseholder\u201d of Apartment F and that \u201cB\u201d was in the apartment at that time. According to Officer Card, Ms. Brown consented to a search of the apartment and later, at the police station, Ms. Brown executed a consent to search form.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">After the testimony, the prosecutor argued that there was probable cause to arrest appellant, and that appellant did not have standing to contest the search of Apartment F. As to the arrest, appellant\u2019s counsel responded that \u201cI don\u2019t think that the information that [the police] were acting on even comes close to them having probable cause to arrest [appellant] for this situation.\u201d More specifically, counsel reasoned, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) the description of the suspect was \u201cvery vague\u201d; (2) there was no indication that appellant had seen Officer Prout\u2019s cruiser when he fled (\u201cSo, at best, what we have is a guy with his back to the police officer, with absolutely no eye contact, who is running into an apartment.\u201d); and (3) there were no \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d justifying a \u201cwarrantless stop,\u201d such as \u201cthe exigency of a felony having been committed or a misdemeanor being committed in the officer\u2019s presence,\u201d or \u201chot pursuit\u201d of a fleeing felon. Regarding the search of the apartment, appellant\u2019s counsel submitted that \u201cthe consent search, itself, is fruit of the poisonous tree\u201d of an illegal arrest, and thus appellant did not \u201cnecessarily need[] standing\u201d to challenge the search. \u201cBecause but for the arrest of [appellant], they would not have even attempted to have a consent search there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The court found that \u201cthe police had ample evidence from which they could conclude that they had probable cause\u201d to arrest appellant. The court reasoned: (1) \u201che meets the description in the same area of the robber who committed the robbery the day before\u201d; (2) \u201c[t]hey give not the most detailed description but they do say black male, they give a height, they say cornrows or dreadlocks\u201d; (3) \u201c[w]hy does someone throw [his] bike down, leave [his] bike there and take off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>running?\u201d; and (4) Mr. Grier indicated that the man who fled went by the nickname \u201cB,\u201d \u201cwhich is the same nickname that was given of the person who was involved in the robbery on the 18th.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The court also found that appellant lacked standing to \u201ccomplain about the search of the apartment\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">I don\u2019t see anything [in evidence] that tells me what was seized or where it was seized from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">It seems that [appellant\u2019s] argument [alludes] to the fact that those items were seized from the apartment and all I know is that the woman, Ms. Brown, is the leaseholder. There has been [no] evidence in the case that [appellant] is also a co-leaseholder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">So, I have no basis from which to conclude that he had the authority to consent or not consent to the search of the apartment. So, it appears that the evidence presented shows that he has no standing to contest the search of the apartment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment in <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), includes \u201ctwo separate clauses, the first protecting the basic right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and the second requiring that warrants be particular and supported by probable cause.\u201d <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 584, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980). It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">U.S. Const. Amend. IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">\u201cThe touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 118, 122 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001). With this in mind, the Supreme Court has consistently affirmed that searches and seizures \u201cconducted outside the judicial process,\u201d <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), <em>i.e., </em>without \u201ca judicial warrant ... issued by a neutral magistrate after finding probable cause,\u201d <em>United States v. Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 701, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983), are both \u201cpresumptively unreasonable,\u201d <em>Payton, 445 </em>U.S. at 586, 100 S.Ct. 1371, or <em>\u201cper se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment^]\u201d <em>Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 357, 88 S.Ct. 507.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">But the warrant requirement is \u201csubject ... to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In regard to <em>arrests, </em>the Court of Appeals has said that a police officer \u201cpossesses legal justification \u2018to make a warrant-less arrest where he has probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed, and that the arrestee perpetrated the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Longtin, </em>419 Md. 450, 506, 19 A.3d 859 (2011) (quoting <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 120, 660 A.2d 447 (1995)) (emphasis removed). And \u00a7 2-202(c) of the Criminal Law Article states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">A police officer without a warrant may arrest a person if the police officer has probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed or attempted and the person has committed or attempted to commit the felony whether or not in the presence or within the view of the police officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">In regard to <em>searches of a residence, </em>another exception to the warrant requirement is the consent of the occupant of the property searched. <em>Nestor v. State, </em>243 Md. 438, 443, 221 A.2d 364 (1966); <em>Georgia v. Randolph, </em>547 U.S. 103, 106, 126 S.Ct. 1515, 164 L.Ed.2d 208 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>On appeal, appellant contends that the circuit court \u201cerred\u201d in denying the motion to suppress. According to appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">\u2022 there was no probable cause to arrest him because (1) \u201c[t]he State relied on evidence that [appellant] fit the description of a person who had committed robberies in the area\u201d\u2014a \u201c[b]lack male, six foot, cornrows, dreads, and slight facial hair\u201d who went by the nickname \u201cB\u201d\u2014 without \u201cpresenting] any evidence about the source or sources of that description, the basis of the source\u2019s or sources\u2019 knowledge, or the veracity or reliability of the source or sources\u201d; and (2) neither Officer Prout\u2019s observation of appellant running into the apartment building nor appellant\u2019s belated exit from Apartment F supports a finding of probable cause;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">\u2022 the State \u201csandbagged\u201d him with the standing issue \u201cat the end of the hearing when the time for presenting evidence on the issue of standing had passed\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">\u2022 the State did not meet its burden of \u201cestablishing] where in the apartment the incriminating evidence was found, and whether it was found in a common area in which Ms. Brown had actual or apparent authority to allow a search.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The tree standing at the heart of appellant\u2019s \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d argument is the arrest; the consent search and thus the evidence recovered in that search are the \u201cfruit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The State responds that many of these arguments are being \u201craised for the first time on appeal,\u201d and, therefore, have been \u201cwaived\u201d; but, even if these arguments had been preserved, \u201cthe motions court properly denied [appellant\u2019s] motion to suppress evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The Court of Appeals has explained appellate review of a motion to suppress and the concept of probable cause as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">Our review of a motion to suppress is limited to the record of the suppression hearing. We review the findings of fact for clear error and do not engage in <em>de novo </em>fact-finding. This Court will review <em>de novo </em>the question whether, based on the facts presented at the suppression hearing, probable cause existed to support a warrantless arrest. We consider the facts in the light most favorable to the State as the prevailing party and independently apply the law to those facts to determine if the evidence at issue was obtained in violation of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">Probable cause is a nontechnical conception of a reasonable ground for belief of guilt. To determine whether probable cause exists, we consider the totality of the circumstances, in light of the facts found to be credible by the trial judge, factoring in the variables of the information leading to police action, the environment, the police purpose, and the suspect\u2019s conduct. Probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the officer at the time of the arrest, or of which the officer has reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient to warrant a prudent person in believing that the suspect had committed or was committing a criminal offense. A finding of probable cause requires less evidence than is necessary to sustain a conviction, but more evidence than would merely arouse suspicion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-8\"><em>Haley v. State, </em>398 Md. 106, 131-33, 919 A.2d 1200 (2007) (internal citations omitted). We review a circuit court\u2019s determination of standing for clear error. <em>See Joyner v. State, </em>87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Md.App. 444, 451, 589 A.2d 1330 (1991) (\u201cThe circuit court\u2019s ruling on the standing issue is subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We are persuaded that there was probable cause to support appellant\u2019s warrantless arrest. When Officer Prout turned his marked police cruiser into Marcs Court, he observed a man abandon his bicycle and run away. Although it was undisputed that, as the officer approached, the man\u2019s back was to him, it was still reasonable to infer that the man was aware of Officer Prout\u2019s approach and fled to avoid the police, and that his flight indicated, in light of the recent robberies, consciousness of guilt\u2014especially when, in his haste, he abandoned his bicycle and made no effort to retrieve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Officer Prout was also aware that the suspect from the October 19, 2010 robbery had been described as \u201ca black male, ranging in six foot one to about six foot three in height\u201d who went by the nickname \u201cB.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the officer, the man who ran fit that physical description, and, when Mr. Grier, appellant\u2019s cycling companion, stated that the man who ran into the Apartment F went by the nickname \u201cB,\u201d \u201calarms went off\u201d because Officer Prout recognized \u201cB\u201d as \u201c[t]he initial that was given in the previous lineup for the possible robbery suspect.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Regarding the search of the apartment, we are not persuaded that appellant\u2019s arguments regarding being \u201csandbagged\u201d on the standing issue and the location of the evidence within the apartment are properly before us on appeal. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>138 Md.App. 539, 560, 772 A.2d 1260 (2001) (\u201cThe failure to argue a particular theory in support of suppression constitutes a waiver of that argument on appeal.\u201d). In fact, not only did appellant not make these arguments during the hearing, but he specifically asserted that neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>issue was of consequence. His counsel stated that appellant did not \u201cnecessarily need[ ] standing\u201d to challenge the search of the apartment and that \u201cwhere specifically in the apartment the items were seized or taken from\u201d does not \u201ccome[ ] into play\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">That said, appellant would not prevail even if these arguments were properly preserved for our review. In regard to standing, appellant has not referred us to any supporting authority for his contention that the State must challenge standing \u201cbefore or during the <em>evidentiary portion </em>of the hearing[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). This Court has said that the \u201cinitial\u201d burden is on the State to challenge standing, but \u201c[i]f the prosecution does raise the challenge, however, by even the most informal of oral pleadings, it is then clear that the burden of proof is allocated to the defendant to show his standing.\u201d <em>Thompson v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 190, 202-03, 488 A.2d 995 (1985) (quoting R. Gilbert <em>&amp; </em>C. Moylan, <em>Maryland Criminal Law: Practice and Procedure </em>(1983)). Moreover, after the State raised appellant\u2019s lack of standing to challenge the search of the apartment, appellant made no effort to rebut that argument or reopen the evidentiary portion of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Regarding the location of the evidence and Ms. Brown\u2019s authority to consent to a search of Apartment F, both Officer Prout and Officer Card testified that Ms. Brown provided verbal consent at the scene to a police search of the apartment, and Officer Card testified that Ms. Brown, who identified herself as the \u201cleaseholder,\u201d also executed a consent to search form later at the police station. Thus, and assuming, without deciding, that appellant was a \u201cco-tenant\u201d of Apartment F, we are persuaded that Ms. Brown had actual or common authority to consent to a search of the areas of the apartment where the \u201cincriminating evidence\u201d was found. <em>See Nestor v. State, </em>243 Md. 438, 443, 221 A.2d 364 (1966) (\u201cThe rule is well established that one co-tenant may give consent to a search and the evidence there disclosed can be used against the other tenant whose permission to enter and search the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>premises had not been elicited.\u201d); <em>State v. Miller, </em>144 Md.App. 643, 650, 799 A.2d 462 (2002) (\u201cIn <em>[United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 94 S.Ct. 988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974) ], a woman who shared a room with the defendant authorized a search that resulted in finding inculpatory evidence to be used against the defendant. The Court held that the woman possessed common authority through joint access or control of the room, and thus, her consent was not unreasonable and the evidence discovered was admissible against the defendant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">In sum, even if appellant\u2019s arguments regarding standing had been properly preserved, we would hold that the motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">ILLEGAL SENTENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">On April 28, 2011, appellant appeared before the court on a \u201cplea hearing,\u201d and the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0i\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, we are [here] for a plea hearing and my understanding of the plea agreement is as follows____[Appellant] will enter a plea in K-10-2230 to Count 1, which is robbery. [Appellant] will also enter a plea to K-10-2231, Count 1, which is robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyV\">Upon disposition in those two cases, the remaining counts in those two cases will be dismissed or nol-prossed----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">What we agreed upon is that any sentence both active and suspended imposed in K-10-2230 and 2231 will be run <em>concurrent </em>to each other. The length of active incarceration, the length of suspended sentence, any probation supervised, unsupervised terms or such, we are essentially free to argue for and it is up to you to impose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aps\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">(Emphasis added). The court accepted the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">In Case No. K-10-2231, appellant was sentenced to fifteen years incarceration (five years suspended) and five years probation. In Case No. K-10-2230, appellant was sentenced to fifteen years incarceration (all fifteen years suspended) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>five years probation. At the sentencing hearing, the court stated that, \u201cin the event of a violation of probation,\u201d the fifteen suspended years in Case No. K-10-2230 would be \u201cserved <em>consecutive </em>\u201d to the five suspended years in Case K-10-2231. (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cSo, essentially, there is an additional 20 years that will be potential incarceration if [appellant] were to violate probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">According to appellant, by imposing a <em>consecutive </em>suspended sentence in Case No. K-10-2230, the court violated the plea agreement\u2019s call for <em>concurrent </em>sentences and entered an \u201cillegal sentence.\u201d In the State\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he court properly exercised its discretion under law and by agreement with the parties, to impose that appropriate term and sanction on probation in the event [appellant] violated his probation.\u201d Whether a trial court has violated the terms of a plea agreement is a question of law which we review <em>de novo. Cuffley v. State, </em>416 Md. 568, 581, 7 A.3d 557 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Section 6-224 of the Criminal Procedure Article states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">(b) <em>Sentencing by presiding judge of circuit </em>court.\u2014If a defendant is brought before a circuit court to be sentenced on the original charge or for violating a condition of probation, and the judge then presiding finds that the defendant violated a condition of probation, the judge:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">(1) may sentence the defendant to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">(i) all or any part of the period of imprisonment imposed in the original sentence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">(ii) any sentence allowed by law, if a sentence was not imposed before[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-12\"><em>Nguyen v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 501, 985 A.2d 87 (2009) is instructive. In that case, Nguyen was sentenced to 365 days incarceration (277 days suspended) for a sexual offense, 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>months incarceration for assault, and three years probation. Although some conditions were placed on Nguyen\u2019s probation, the court specifically stated at the sentencing hearing that it was <em>not </em>requiring him to register as a sex offender. Later, at a violation of probation hearing, Nguyen was ordered to serve the remaining portion of his sentence and to register as a sex offender. On appeal, he argued that the trial court had exceeded its authority by ordering him to register as a sex offender. We agreed that, because the original sentence did not require Nguyen to register as a sex offender, the court could not impose that requirement for the first time as a consequence of his failure to abide by the terms of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Here, there is no dispute that, under the terms of the plea agreement, any sentences imposed in cases K-10-2230 and K-10-2231 were to run concurrent to each other. While the circuit court did not actually impose a consecutive sentence, we are persuaded that, were it to be imposed\u2014as indicated it would be in the event of a violation of probation\u2014that sentence would be in violation of the plea agreement. Neither \u00a7 6\u2014224(b) of the Criminal Procedure Article nor the plea agreement itself authorizes a change in the sentence from concurrent to consecutive upon appellant\u2019s failure to abide by the terms of his probation. Therefore, that aspect of the sentence must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">At appellant\u2019s trial in case No. K-10-2131, Vincente Ramirez testified that, on October 18, 2010, while standing outside the Ashton Apartments on Ashton Court in Annapolis smoking a cigarette, he observed a young, black man going by on a bicycle. The young man parked \u201cthe bicycle at the corner of the building and then he came up in front of me and stuck a gun, like a pistol ... right in my face.\u201d Mr. Ramirez wanted to run to try to get into the apartment, but, according to Mr. Ramirez, appellant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>blocked the stairway and got even closer to me -with the pistol. That was when I took my arm and ... slammed it up against his hand that had the gun and that\u2019s when I realized the gun was fake and then I wasn\u2019t afraid of him anymore and that\u2019s when I took him on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">As soon as I grabbed his hand like this, his hand hit against the wall. And that\u2019s when I heard the noise of the gun and realized it wasn\u2019t made of metal. That\u2019s when I realized that this gun wasn\u2019t going to do me any harm. And then while I had his hand up like this with the gun in the hand that\u2019s when he reached down with his other hand and grabbed my phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">I started fighting with him. He got me ... in a headlock trying to bend my head over. That\u2019s when I was able to bite him and I bit him in the chest [and on the hand].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">He cornered me. And then my wife came out and she grabbed him by the sweater. And she called my daughter and my daughter came out and then he took off running, but he was able to get my wallet out of my pants, so he took off with my wallet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Ramirez\u2019s wallet contained his residency card, driver\u2019s license, social security card, credit cards, a national identification card from El Salvador, a card with personal phone numbers written on it, and currency consisting of 26 El Salvadoran colons.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">At the end of the State\u2019s case, appellant\u2019s counsel made a motion for judgment of acquittal. As to the reckless endangerment charge, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiY\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t think that the State proved that [there was] a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to Mr. Ramirez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>I think what we have in the best case scenario is a person ... grabs Mr. Ramirez, they struggle. Mr. Ramirez realizes that a gun that has been pointed at him is not a real gun. He identifies it as such when it is hit against the wall and he hears a plastic sound. At that point he testifies himself that he doesn\u2019t become afraid and struggles further with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">I don\u2019t believe that there was any risk of death based upon the mere struggle. I don\u2019t believe there was any risk of serious physical injury based upon the struggle. So I would ask for acquittal in that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">THE COURT: What is your response from the State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgMb\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, certainly there was some weapon that was used whether it was an actual working handgun or not....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">Certainly it is not just a handgun that can cause serious physical injury. Someone\u2014the right person with the right instrument in their hand, the heavy object, could cause a significant amount of damage to someone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">You saw Mr. Ramirez, he is small in stature. Certainly a lot smaller than [appellant]. Just because ... Mr. Ramirez was eventually able to fight [appellant] off, mind you, by biting him, it was a fairly extreme response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">The Court denied the motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">During closing arguments, the prosecutor did not address the reckless endangerment charge, but stated, regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>armed robbery charge: \u201cif you find that the weapon that was used in this case could have been something that could have made a serious bodily injury, you could find that [appellant] committed the armed robbery.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In response to that argument, appellant\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>[Tjhere is absolutely no evidence that [the plastic gun] has the capability to cause death or serious bodily harm. That is what the State has to prove, that this weapon had the capability of causing death or serious bodily harm, and that wasn\u2019t proven.... There is absolutely no proof that the State put on that there was any substantial risk of death or serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The prosecutor, in rebuttal, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">Now, [appellant] also mentions that ... Mr. Ramirez wasn\u2019t scared at some point. He said he felt that [the gun] ... was plastic, and all of a sudden he is not scared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">Well ladies and gentlemen, that doesn\u2019t mean that he shouldn\u2019t have been scared. You know, not everybody reacts the same way. And there are certainly circumstances where someone probably should be scared and maybe those impulses don\u2019t pick up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">So when he said at that point he wasn\u2019t scared, implying that at some other point he was scared. And certainly he felt that it was plastic, but he didn\u2019t say I thought it was a toy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">Well it doesn\u2019t mean that ... he shouldn\u2019t have been scared and it doesn\u2019t mean that something bad, you know, worse than what happened could have happened. That doesn\u2019t mean that, you know, it is not a crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The jury convicted appellant of, <em>inter alia, </em>reckless endangerment relating to Mr. Ramirez.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">Appellant contends that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction for reckless endangerment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>More specifically, he argues that, because Mr. Ramirez believed the gun was \u201cfake,\u201d there was no \u201cserious risk of death or serious injury.\u201d The State replies that \u201c[i]t matters not that Mr. Ramirez may have thought that the gun was not real or that he did not feel that he was in danger\u201d because \u201cthe jury could have concluded, in the light most favorable to the State, that Mr. Ramirez may have been mistaken that the gun posed no risk[.]\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we view the evidence, and all inferences fairly deducible from the evidence, in the light most favorable to the prevailing party; in this case, the State. <em>Hackley v. State, </em>389 Md. 387, 389, 885 A.2d 816 (2005). The Court of Appeals has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZj\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence presented on the charges of ... reckless endangerment, we emphasize that we are not sitting as the trier of fact and, therefore, we are not to ask ourselves whether <em>we </em>would convict based upon the evidence presented____ [W]e are asked only to determine whether <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found [the defendant] guilty of the crimes charged based upon the evidence presented at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\"><em>State v.

As a consequence, a defendant may be guilty of reckless endangerment even where he has caused no injury.\u201d <em>Albrecht, </em>336 Md. at 500-01, 649 A.2d 336. Reckless endangerment \u201cis an inchoate crime and is intended to deal with the situation in which a victim is put at substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm but may, through a stroke of good fortune, be spared the consummated harm itself.\u201d <em>Albrecht v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 45, 58, 658 A.2d 1122 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">The Court of Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-13\">The elements of a prima facie case of reckless endangerment are: 1) that the defendant engaged in conduct that created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another; 2) that a reasonable person would not have engaged in that conduct; and 3) that the defendant acted recklessly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-14\"><em>Jones v.

Put another way,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-15\">[t]he test ... is whether a [defendant\u2019s] misconduct, viewed objectively, was so reckless as to constitute a gross depar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ture from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe, and thereby create the substantial risk that the statute was designed to punish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><em>State v.

The State failed to counter Mr. Ramirez\u2019s testimony with any evidence from which a juror might rationally infer that the gun was real and capable of firing a projectile, or if used as a club, would present a substantial risk of death or serious personal injury. The question then is whether wielding a \u201cfake,\u201d \u201ctoy,\u201d or \u201cplastic\u201d gun under the circumstances of this case could satisfy the necessary elements of reckless endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In 1989, the General Assembly passed H.B. 1448, which became Maryland\u2019s reckless endangerment statute. Although H.B. 1448 has a \u201csparse legislative history,\u201d <em>Minor, </em>326 Md. at 442, 605 A.2d 138, documents in the legislative history file of the bill reveal a particular concern for the reckless discharge of <em>firearms. See </em>Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Floor Report on H.B. 1448 (1989) (\u201cThis bill prohibits conduct which, while not criminal under current law, creates a substantial risk that a criminal act will result. According to testimony, individuals who recklessly shoot <em>firearms </em>without criminal intent near roads or buildings cannot be prosecuted under current law.\u201d); Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, Position on Proposed Legislation (February 27, 1989) (\u201cAs applied to a criminal violation, reckless endangerment would be particularly useful in charging and prosecuting the miscreant who demonstrates a total neglect for the welfare and safety of bystanders during his criminal behavior, <em>i.e., firing a weapon </em>while in a populated area.\u201d) (emphasis added). This Court has said that the reckless endangerment statute \u201cis modeled on \u00a7 211.2 of the Model Penal Code,\u201d <em>Albrecht, </em>105 Md.App. at 83, 658 A.2d 1122, which states that \u201c[rjecklessness and danger shall be pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>sumed where a person knowingly points <em>a firearm </em>at or in the direction of another[.]\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We have not found a Maryland case directly addressing whether brandishing and pointing a fake or inoperable firearm at another creates \u201ca substantial risk of death or serious physical injury\u201d within the meaning of reckless endangerment statute. Several Maryland cases, however, are instructive, and lead us to conclude that brandishing and threatening another with a fake gun incapable of firing does not, under the circumstances of this case, satisfy the risk element of reckless endangerment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In <em>Wieland v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 1, 643 A.2d 446 (1994), the defendant was convicted of reckless endangerment for brandishing a handgun while drunk and accidentally shooting his brother. This Court held that the evidence was sufficient to support that conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">\u201cIn terms of <em>corpus delicti, </em>deliberately firing a bullet into the torso of another person could be deemed to create \u2018a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person.\u2019 At a lesser, but still sufficient, level of risk, even brandishing a <em>loaded </em>and cocked weapon, particularly when in shaky control of one\u2019s own motor skills, could be deemed conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 28, 643 A.2d 446 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">In <em>Minor, </em>326 Md. 436, 605 A.2d 138, the defendant was convicted of reckless endangerment for handing his brother, with whom he had been drinking alcohol throughout the day, a <em>loaded </em>shotgun and daring him to play \u201cRussian roulette.\u201d The brother took the weapon and shot himself to death. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Court of Appeals held that the evidence was sufficient to show that the appellant both acted recklessly and created a substantial risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\"><em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 649 A.2d 336 (1994), which primarily addressed the recklessness element of the offense rather than the substantial risk component, is nevertheless relevant to our discussion. In <em>Albrecht, </em>the Court of Appeals affirmed a Montgomery County police officer\u2019s convictions of involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment, stemming from an incident during which the shotgun he was pointing at a female suspect accidentally discharged, Wiling the woman. Addressing Albrecht\u2019s contention that he acted reasonably under the circumstances, the Court identified the following factors that supported its conclusion that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the convictions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">The State adduced sufficient testimony from which the trial court could have concluded that a reasonable Montgomery County police officer would not have acted as Albrecht did on this occasion, in drawing and <em>racking</em><footnotemark><em>[14]</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a shotgun fitted with a bandolier and bringing it to bear, with his finger on the trigger, on an unarmed individual who did not present a threat to the officer or to any third parties, in a situation where nearby bystanders were exposed to danger.... We therefore cannot, as a matter of law, find that trial judge erred in concluding that Albrecht\u2019s actions, in their totality, were both recWess and grossly negligent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 505, 649 A.2d 336 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">These cases hold that the risk of death or injury created in recWessly handling a loaded, operable firearm is that the weapon may discharge. Here, there is no evidence that the alleged weapon was either operable as a firearm or substantial enough to use as a bludgeoning instrument. Thus, there is no evidence to support a finding that appellant created a \u201csubstantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.

But again he has not been offered as an expert in any sort of firearms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak6\">This is an opinion of a guy in the moment of this struggle. We have absolutely no idea if it is in fact plastic or if it is in fact nonworking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHV\">So it could have been in fact a BB gun for all we know, which could have caused serious injury, you know, had it been shot. You know, plenty of BB guns are made of plastic. So we don't know that it is not operable. Certainly that wouldn't be a handgun, but a BB gun could cause serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtB\">So, you know, I think that is up to the jury to decide, you know, whether or not they think this object could cause serious injury, but I don\u2019t think at this point\u2014either there is nothing to say that Mr. Ramirez is an expert or saw it\u2014it is just his opinion that it is made of plastic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW5\">THE COURT: He said it was\u2014he thought that it was plastic____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN9\">Certainly it could have been a plastic BB gun. That could certainly shoot your eye out or cause another serious injury[.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b396-16\">. We note that in <em>Wright v.
