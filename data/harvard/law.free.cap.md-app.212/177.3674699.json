Jackson alleged that Edgewood had constructively terminated her employment in retaliation for reporting a sex discrimination complaint made by a subordinate. She sought compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Jackson\u2019s case was tried to a jury. On a special verdict form, the jury found in favor of Jackson, awarding her $500,000 in \u201ceconomic damages\u201d and $150,000 in \u201ccompensatory damages.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court entered judgment in Jackson\u2019s favor for $650,000 (\u201cthe Judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Edgewood filed a ten-day motion to amend the Judgment to \u201cconform with the [MCC]\u201d and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d). Jackson filed a post-judgment memorandum addressing her entitlement to punitive damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">The court denied Edgewood\u2019s motion for JNOV and granted its motion to amend the Judgment to conform with the MCC. The court entered an amended judgment reducing the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>to $89,195, comprised of back-pay for two years minus the amount of unemployment benefits collected by Jackson during that time (\u201cthe Amended Judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Edgewood noted an appeal, presenting five questions for our review, which we have condensed and rephrased as two:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">I. Was the evidence at trial legally insufficient to sustain Jackson\u2019s retaliation claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">II. Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion in declining to submit Edgewood\u2019s proposed special verdict sheet to the jurors?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Jackson noted a cross-appeal, presenting four questions for review, which we have condensed and rephrased as three:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">I. Are the remedies for a retaliation action brought pursuant to SG section 20-1202 limited to those set forth in MCC section 27-8?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">II. May economic damages for retaliatory discharge be offset by the amount of unemployment benefits the employee collected?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">III. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in declining to instruct the jurors on punitive damages?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">For the reasons to follow, we answer all the questions in the negative. Accordingly, we shall vacate the Amended Judgment and reinstate and affirm the original Judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">Except where noted, we present the facts in a light most favorable to Jackson, the prevailing party below.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">Edgewood is a property management company headquartered in Germantown. It manages numerous properties throughout Maryland, including Glenview Garden Apartments (\u201cGlenview\u201d) in Glen Burnie. Glenview is a 204-unit, low-income apartment complex subject to regulations by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d). It is owned by Triton Advisors, Inc. (\u201cTriton\u201d), a corporation owned and operated by one Janet Charlton.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Triton had purchased Glenview with a \u201cSection 236 loan,\u201d a low-interest loan insured by the federal government under the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-l. In the loan agreement, HUD set the income limits for tenants in the property. <em>See U.S. ex rel. K &amp; R Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Mass. Housing Finance Agency, </em>530 F.3d 980, 981 (D.C.Cir.2008) (discussing Section 236 loans). Only 10% of the units in a Section 236 property can be rented to \u201cmarket renters,\u201d that is, tenants with incomes above 80% of the area median income, as determined by HUD.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">In 2007, Triton began the process of transitioning Glenview from a Section 236 property to a Low Income Housing Tax Credit (\u201cLIHTC\u201d) property. LIHTC is a federal tax-incentive program designed to encourage private development of low income properties. <em>See Carter v. Maryland Mgmt. Co., </em>377 Md. 596, 603, 835 A.2d 158 (2003). Under this program, a property owner will receive a tax credit if a certain minimum number of residential units in the property are rent-restricted and occupied by people whose incomes do not exceed \u201csixty percent of the area median income,\u201d as determined by HUD. The property owner then can sell the tax credit to investors to raise capital for improvements to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Jackson has been employed by Edgewood since 1979. From 1990 until her resignation on March 25, 2010, she held the position of community manager for Glenview. At the time of her resignation, she was earning approximately $55,000 annually.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">As community manager, Jackson was responsible for the day-to-day operations of Glenview, including collecting rent, handling resident complaints and maintenance requests, and reviewing and approving rental applications. Jackson supervised one employee, Paula \u201cDrema\u201d Wagner, a leasing specialist at Glenview, whom Jackson hired in 1990. Art Wilcoxen was Glenview\u2019s groundskeeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Before 2009, Jackson\u2019s supervisor was Lisa Davis, an assistant vice-president with Edgewood. During much of that time, Scott Jones was the regional vice-president who super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>vised Davis. He has since become Edgewood\u2019s president and chief executive officer. Jackson received uniformly positive performance evaluations from Davis and Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">In September of 2009, Arturo \u201cArt\u201d Reyes replaced Davis as Jackson\u2019s direct supervisor. Reyes reported to Norman Azouqha, a regional vice-president who, in turn, reported to George Caruso, Edgewood\u2019s executive vice-president and chief \u201cknowledge officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">On or about December 7, 2009, Larry Davis, a senior vice-president at Edgewood, and Terrance Kelly, an assistant vice-president at Edgewood, called Wagner and offered her a promotion to the position of community manager at an apartment complex in Capital Heights that Edgewood managed. Wagner declined the promotion for several reasons, including the length of the commute and safety concerns. Wagner had been living in Glen Burnie for decades, near Glenview. Capital Heights is in Prince George\u2019s County, about 36 miles from Wagner\u2019s home, and in a neighborhood with a high crime rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">On December 10, 2009, Reyes came to Glenview to discuss a tenant complaint with Jackson and to inform Art Wilcoxen, the groundskeeper, that his position was being eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Reyes met with Jackson in her office, which was located at the back of Glenview\u2019s rental office. He advised Jackson that a tenant, one Mary Barnes, had filed a complaint with the Maryland Commission on Human Relations (\u201cMCHR\u201d) alleging that Jackson had discriminated against her on the basis of her race by failing to handle her maintenance requests promptly. Jackson responded by telling Reyes that Barnes was a problem tenant and offering to show Reyes Barnes\u2019s lengthy tenant file, which documented frequent complaints made by her and by other tenants about her. Reyes asked to see maintenance requests made by Barnes, took certain of the records, and said he would look into the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Reyes asked Jackson to call Wilcoxen to her office, which she did. In Jackson\u2019s office, with the door shut, Reyes informed Wilcoxen that his position was going to be eliminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>on an uncertain date in the future, for budgetary reasons. Reyes said he had wanted to give Wilcoxen a \u201cheads up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Following this conversation, Wilcoxen walked out of Jackson\u2019s office and into the front reception area, where Wagner\u2019s desk was located. Reyes and Jackson followed him out. Also in the reception area were Rick West, Edgewood\u2019s maintenance supervisor; Penny Ingold, another Glenview employee; a tenant; and a new rental applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Wilcoxen walked over to Wagner\u2019s desk and told her he had just been laid off. Reyes then approached Wagner\u2019s desk. He said, \u201coh, [I heard] you didn\u2019t take the job transfer.\u201d He sat down in front of Wagner\u2019s desk and asked her why she had declined the transfer. Wagner replied, giving the reasons discussed above. Reyes told her, \u201cwell, due to the fact you didn\u2019t take the transfer, we\u2019re cutting your pay from [$]18 [per hour] down to [$]13 [per hour].\u201d Wagner asked Reyes why her pay was being cut and when this change would go into effect. Reyes simply repeated his previous statement that her pay would be cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">A tenant then walked into Glenview\u2019s office. Wagner tried to get Reyes to \u201cstop speaking.\u201d Wagner said, \u201cexcuse me,\u201d and began attempting to assist the tenant. Nevertheless, Reyes continued to \u201crepeat[ ] what he [had] said,\u201d announcing to Wagner that it was a \u201ca new day,\u201d and budgets were being cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">At this point, Wagner was near tears. Jackson, who, like everyone in the vicinity, had overheard Reyes talking to Wagner, approached Reyes and asked if he\u2019d like to use her office to continue his conversation with Wagner. Reyes declined, saying \u201cwe\u2019re almost finished here.\u201d He then walked into Jackson\u2019s office, collected his belongings, and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Immediately after Reyes departed, Wagner reported to Jackson that she believed Reyes had discriminated against her on the basis of her gender by speaking privately to a male employee (Wilcoxen) about his job being eliminated but speaking to her about a significant reduction in her pay in front of numerous employees and tenants. Wagner was extremely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>upset. Jackson tried to console her, remarking that she \u201cdidn\u2019t know why [Reyes] did that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Later that day, Wagner sat down with Jackson and Wilcox-en to discuss the incident a second time. She expressed the view to both of them that Reyes had \u201cdiscriminated against [her] because [she] was a woman.\u201d After leaving work for the day, Wagner remained \u201cupset\u201d about the incident with Reyes. She typed a letter (\u201cthe Grievance Letter\u201d) that summarized her encounter with Reyes that day:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">I Drema Wagner was offered a new position [Community Manager] at another property. I declined the offer to due to having to travel &amp; work at a bad area. I would have to travel 1 hr to <em>Vk </em>hrs one way. I chose to work at Glenview due to I only live 10-15 minutes away, the money I was offered would not even cover my gas expenses. This position was offered to me by Larry Davis &amp; Terrance Kelly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">On Thursday 12/10/2009 Art Reyes, Ms. Jackson supervisor told me due to I declined the job transfer my pay would properly be cut/decreased by $ 5.00 per hour. I ask Mr. Reyes why, Mr. Reyes stated this was a new day, there were budget cuts. Mr. Reyes was explaining this to me in the front office while I was answering the phone &amp; waiting on residents and a co-worker come in and Mr. Reyes kept discussing my personal business. In order to get Mr. Reyes to stop, I turned to my co-worker spoke to her then turned back to look at Mr. Reyes he paused &amp; continued discussing my personal business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">I feel Mr. Reyes should have requested me to go to a private close area to discuss my personal business. I also feel the real reason my current pay maybe cut/decreased because I would not accept the new position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The next day, Friday, December 11, 2009, Wagner gave Jackson the Grievance Letter. Jackson initialed it and marked it as \u201creceived 12/11/09.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>On Tuesday, December 15, 2009, Jackson called Reyes\u2019s supervisor, Azouqha, to report Wagner\u2019s grievance. She advised him that Wagner had \u201cwritten a discrimination letter against Mr. Reyes\u201d and explained what had happened. She told him that Wagner had said that \u201cshe felt she was discriminated against, because of her gender.\u201d Jackson also discussed with Azouqha a conflict she had had with Reyes concerning a repair to Barnes\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">At the end of the conversation, Jackson asked Azouqha whether she should \u201cforward [the Grievance Letter] to [him], or send it to HR.\u201d Azouqha replied that Jackson should put the letter in Wagner\u2019s file and to just try to \u201cget along\u201d with Reyes \u201cuntil the rehab is over with\u201d (referring to renovations to Glenview that were being undertaken).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Jackson followed Azouqha\u2019s directive and placed the Grievance Letter in Wagner\u2019s file. She also wrote a contemporaneous note \u201cto document the employee file of Ms. Drema Wagner.\u201d It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">On 12/15/09 at approximately 11:45 a.m., I, Donna L. Jackson, Com. Mgr. for Glenview, called Mr. Norman Azouqha to inform him of a grievance letter Ms. Wagner wrote concerning the transfer offer or possible pay decrease from Mr. Art Reyes. I asked Mr. Azouqha if he wished me to send him a copy through e-mail and send to HR. Mr. Azouqha told me no and to place it in her employee file. I did as such.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Jackson also made a note in a journal she kept to record events for work. This note stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">12/15/09 I called Mr. Azouqha and told him Mr. Reyes had Rick and 2 men from another property go to 76-101\u2019s [Barnes\u2019s apartment] bathroom and cut out the ceiling when there was no leak nor did the resident ever call in a leak and this to me didn\u2019t look good for Glenview\u2019s staff and could possibly hurt the complaint [Barnes] filed. I also told Mr. Azouqha Drema had written a complaint about Mr. Reyes due to she was embarrassed on how Mr. Reyes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>discussed her personal business in the front office with residents and a fellow employee present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">That same day, Jackson told Wagner that she had informed Azouqha of Wagner\u2019s complaint and that he would \u201ctake care of it.\u201d Based on her long history with Azouqha, Jackson felt certain that Azouqha would \u201cdiscuss it with Mr. Reyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">On December 29, 2009, Glenview received final approval as an LIHTC property.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Approximately one month after Jackson reported Wagner\u2019s grievance, on Saturday, January 16, 2010, at 1:23 a.m., Reyes sent an e-mail to Azouqha and Caruso, attaching a draft disciplinary memo against Jackson. The draft memo cited three instances of misconduct by Jackson that warranted disciplinary action. The first instance concerned acceptance of tenants who did not satisfy the income eligibility requirements for Glenview to be an LIHTC property. In particular, Reyes stated that \u201cJackson took upon her own to approve and move several applicants to units restricted by income limits and whose incomes were over the allowable incomes under HIJD\u2019s rules and regulations.\u201d The second two instances of misconduct concerned information Reyes claimed to have learned in investigating the Barnes race discrimination complaint. Reyes stated that his investigation revealed that, in managing Glenview, Jackson had not met Edgewood\u2019s policy of providing corrective maintenance to tenants within 48 hours of receiving a complaint; instead, in the past year, maintenance work orders at Glenview had averaged between six to seven days for completion. Reyes further stated that he was of the view that Jackson had lied to an attorney representing Edgewood in the Barnes case when she told the attorney that after Barnes complained of a leak in her apartment the Glenview maintenance staff inspected Barnes\u2019s apartment and did not find any leaks. According to Reyes, he dispatched a quality control team to Barnes\u2019s apartment and, as Jackson knew, the team discovered a leaking overflow gasket in the bathtub in the apartment above Barnes\u2019s bathroom. Reyes\u2019s draft disciplinary memo stated that disciplinary action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>required due to these \u201crecent incidents and findings\u201d and advised Jackson that the memo served as her \u201cfinal warning\u201d and that she would need to \u201cimmediate[ly] improve [her] unsatisfactory performance\u201d or face \u201cfurther disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\u201d The memo closed by stating that Jackson\u2019s \u201cwork performance ha[d] been of poor and careless performance [sic]\u201d and that \u201cher neglect of duty and misleading of facts could put the owners and the company at risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In the e-mail to Azouqha and Caruso attaching the draft disciplinary memo, Reyes stated that the offenses described in the draft memo \u201ccould be enough for a termination of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Caruso replied to Reyes\u2019s e-mail two days later. He praised Reyes\u2019s \u201cinitial work up,\u201d but disagreed that termination was appropriate as this was the first time Jackson had been disciplined. Caruso suggested they look into transferring Jackson and \u201cwatch [Jackson] closely going forward.\u201d He also made some edits to the draft disciplinary memo, including a note directing Reyes to add the names of the market tenants referenced in the memo.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Two days later, on January 21, 2010, Reyes e-mailed Jackson with a number of questions. As relevant here, Reyes commented that three \u201cmove ins\u201d in 2009 had been \u201cover the 80% income limits\u201d; named the three market tenants; and asked whether there had been any other market tenants approved since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">In a reply e-mail sent that day, Jackson told Reyes that the three market tenants to whom he had referred all had been approved before Davis, who, as mentioned, was Jackson\u2019s former supervisor, had directed her by e-mail not to move in anyone else at \u201cMarket Rent.\u201d Jackson further stated that no additional market tenants had been approved since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Reyes responded by asking Jackson to forward to him the income limits Davis had provided her and the \u201ce-mail in which she <em>[ie., </em>Davis] indicates that no one should move in at market rent.\u201d Jackson did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>On January 25, 2010, Azouqha hand-delivered to Jackson a Disciplinary Action Memorandum. Reyes and Azouqha were listed as the authors and it was copied to Caruso. It was nearly identical to Reyes\u2019s draft disciplinary memo, but incorporated certain of Caruso\u2019s edits and suggested changes. It closed by advising Jackson that her performance would be reevaluated in 30 days and listing seven areas in which she needed to improve her performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Three days later, Jackson sent a memorandum addressed to Reyes, Azouqha, and Caruso, and copied to Jones, rebutting the charges in the Disciplinary Action Memorandum. With respect to market tenants, Jackson explained that she always had complied with the directives she had received from her supervisors regarding income limits for tenants and that the three market tenants in question had been approved in compliance with the directives in effect at that time. Moreover, she asserted that Glenview had been the subject of numerous \u201caudits and reviews\u201d and she \u201cnever [had] been told [Glen-view] was not in compliance with the income limits.\u201d With respect to completion of repairs, Jackson stated that the maintenance records Reyes had reviewed reflecting that work orders had taken between five to six days on average to complete were not accurate, due to a data-entry error on her part, which she would correct going forward. Specifically, when closing out work orders using Edgewood\u2019s computer software, she had not changed the completion date. As a result, the completion date reflected the date she had entered a work order as \u201ccompleted\u201d in the computer, not the date it actually had been completed. With respect to Barnes\u2019s complaints, Jackson explained Barnes\u2019s history as a \u201cproblem resident.\u201d Finally, Jackson denied ever lying to an attorney representing Edgewood in the Barnes discrimination matter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Jackson\u2019s memorandum concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>In closing, I would like to thank you for your time in going over my responses to all the above accusations. <em>There may be other reasons as to why Mr. Reyes found it necessary to put in writing these accusations however at this time I wish not to discuss.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">After your investigation I hope your findings will prevail this should and will be removed from my employee file. I assure you, I will continue to be as I have always been an asset to Glenview Gardens as well as being a dedicated, honest and responsible employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">On February 1, 2010, Jones e-mailed Reyes and Azouqha and directed them to prepare a \u201cresponse for [his] signature.\u201d He copied his e-mail to Caruso. Caruso replied that he wished to sit down with Reyes and Azouqha to discuss their response, explaining that because Jackson was \u201ctrying to deny responsibility,\u201d it was important that they reply \u201cfactually, and carefully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">On February 5, 2010, Reyes e-mailed Charlton. He advised her that Jones had directed him to \u201cmove on implementing the plan to change the staff at Glenview\u201d and he was seeking her approval for the planned changes. He stated that, at that time, they did not have \u201cenough to do a termination\u201d of Jackson, but were planning to transfer her to another Triton-owned property, Glenarden, because that property could \u201cab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>sorb her salary.\u201d Charlton replied three days later, copying Jones, saying that while she was \u201canxious to get a LIHTC certified manager at Glenview,\u201d it did not seem fair to transfer Jackson to another Triton property in order to \u201cabsorb\u201d her salary. She sought a meeting to discuss the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The following day, February 9, 2010, Jones e-mailed Charlton, explaining that Glenarden was the only possible property to which he could transfer Jackson.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">Please know that we are on the path to terminating Donna\u2019s employment but don\u2019t have enough hard evidence as of today to make it happen. There is one write up in the file and another is being worked on. However, over the next few weeks, I believe that we will have what we need. Her time at Glenarden would be short. In addition, I have a strong feeling that she may resign when we announce the transfer to her. Her world does not extend beyond Glen Burnie.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Charlton responded that if the transfer was to occur, Jackson\u2019s salary would have to be reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">On February 24, 2010, Reyes sent Jackson a response memorandum, rejecting each of her explanations and concluding that the disciplinary action was appropriate. The response memorandum further advised Jackson that she was being transferred to the position of community manager for Glenreed Apartments and Charles Landing Apartments. Charles Landing is located in northern Virginia, 34 miles from Jackson\u2019s home. Glenreed is located 36 miles from Jackson\u2019s home in the opposite direction. Her salary was to be decreased by $5,000 annually \u201cto reflect [her] new responsibilities and to adhere to the approved budget.\u201d The stated reason for this transfer was that Glenview recently had be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>come an LIHTC property and Jackson had not passed her LIHTC certification test.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Also on that day, Reyes met with Wagner to inform her that the pay cut he previously had discussed with her was going to take effect immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The next day, Jackson and Wagner both submitted letters of resignation. Jackson\u2019s letter was sent to Reyes, Azouqha, Caruso, Jones, and Charlton. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">After 31 years of dedicated service to Glenview Garden Apartments it brings me great sadness that due to an unnecessary job transfer I am being forced to take which I feel has been brought on by retaliation, I must resign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">This will serve as a thirty day notice that my last day will be March 25, 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">I have elected to give a thirty day notice instead of the normal two weeks due to the property is currently under rehab and I want the owner to have time to find someone else to fill my position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Wagner\u2019s letter was sent to Jackson, Reyes, Azouqha, Jones, and Charlton. It described the December 10, 2009 incident with Reyes, her Grievance Letter, the fact that Jackson had reported her grievance to Azouqha, and that Azouqha had directed Jackson not to forward the Grievance Letter to him or to HR.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">On February 29, 2010, Azouqha and Reyes each responded to Wagner\u2019s letter of resignation. In Azouqha\u2019s response, he accepted Wagner\u2019s resignation and stated that he \u201cwas never aware nor I have [sic] received any complaint referencing your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>allegations that Art Reyes met with you in the front office.\u201d He also denied having any knowledge of her Grievance Letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">In Reyes\u2019s response, he acknowledged having discussed Wagner\u2019s transfer in the reception area, but said that Wagner had initiated the conversation by telling Reyes she had declined the transfer. Reyes claimed that he had been unaware that Wagner even had been offered a transfer prior to that time. He denied having spoken to Wagner about a reduction in her salary in the reception area at Glenview. He stated that he had met with her privately in Jackson\u2019s office to inform her of the salary cut and again on February 24, 2010, when he had told her the salary reduction was to become effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Jackson\u2019s last day was March 25, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">On September 3, 2010, Jackson filed her circuit court complaint asserting one count of retaliation against Edgewood pursuant to SG section 20-1202, for a violation of MCC section 27-19(c). She alleged that she had opposed an act of sex discrimination by reporting Wagner\u2019s grievance to Azouqha and that Edgewood had retaliated against her for doing so by initiating a disciplinary action against her, transferring her, and decreasing her salary. She further alleged that these actions amounted to a constructive discharge. She sought compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The case was tried to a jury over five days in September of 2011. At that time, Jackson was 54 years old. She testified and called seven lay witnesses: Reyes, Caruso, Azouqha, West, Wagner, Wilcoxen, and Jones. Reyes and Azouqha each denied having any knowledge of Wagner\u2019s complaint of discrimination when they disciplined Jackson. Caruso testified that he believed Reyes had become aware of Wagner\u2019s complaint in March of 2010. He acknowledged, however, that he had testified in deposition that Reyes had learned of Wagner\u2019s complaint in December of 2009. Jones testified that he first became aware of Wagner\u2019s complaint when Wagner and Jackson submitted their letters of resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Jackson introduced into evidence e-mail correspondence from February 2010 between Jones, Caruso, Reyes, and Azouqha reflecting that they knew when they decided to transfer her and reduce her salary that she would likely resign as a result. She also introduced into evidence Barnes\u2019s tenant file and internal Edgewood email correspondence demonstrating that she had received conflicting directives from Davis and Jones regarding whether she could approve market tenants in the year prior to her discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Jackson also called three expert witnesses. Phillip Bussey, Ph.D., was accepted as an expert in the fields of vocational rehabilitation, vocational assessment, and vocational counseling and opined that it would take Jackson at least two to three years to find employment commensurate with the work she had performed at Edgewood and that, if she had not found a job in that time period, she might never find an equivalent job given her age and the length of her period of unemployment. Richard Edelman, Ph.D., was accepted as an expert in economics and finance. He opined that if Jackson were unable to find suitable replacement employment, she would sustain economic losses of $568,912. Finally, Liza Gold, M.D., a psychiatrist, opined that Jackson suffered from an \u201cadjustment disorder with depressed mood\u201d as a result of Edgewood\u2019s actions in disciplining and constructively discharging her.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">At the close of Jackson\u2019s case, Edgewood moved for judgment. It argued that Jackson had failed to prove that she held an objective, good faith belief that Reyes had engaged in discrimination when she made her report to Azouqha in December of 2009. This was so because neither the Grievance Letter nor Jackson\u2019s contemporaneous notes documenting her conversation with Azouqha mentioned discrimination. Edge-wood further argued that there was no evidence of an adverse action against Jackson because it had offered her a lateral transfer with a slight pay decrease. Finally, Edgewood argued that Jackson failed to prove that any adverse action was caused by a report of discrimination because the ultimate decision maker, Jones, had no knowledge of Jackson\u2019s report at the time he approved her transfer and salary decrease.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>The court denied the motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">In its case, Edgewood recalled Reyes, Azouqha, and Jones, and called Charlton and the director of Edgewood\u2019s compliance division. Charlton, who as mentioned owned and operated Triton, testified that in the spring of 2009 she discovered that 99 of the 204 units at Glenview were occupied by market renters. As a result, those 99 units would not be eligible for LIHTC tax credits, representing a loss to Triton of $1,000,000 in \u201ctax credit investment equity.\u201d Charlton stated that, after learning this information, she discussed the issue with Davis (Reyes\u2019s predecessor) and with Jones. Charlton was \u201cinsistent\u201d that Glenview have a \u201ctax credit certified\u201d community manager because she expected that Triton\u2019s investor would want a certified manager in place. She also testified that she told Jones that Edgewood would need to eliminate a position at Glenview.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Edgewood introduced into evidence a budget that Jones testified he prepared in August 2009. The budget showed a reduction in Wagner\u2019s salary from $18 per hour to $13 per hour; that Jackson\u2019s salary would not increase in 2010; and that Wilcoxen\u2019s position would be eliminated. Jones stated that these budgetary changes were implemented in February 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">At the close of all the evidence, Edgewood renewed its motion for judgment on the same grounds previously raised. Edgewood further argued that it had presented evidence <em>of </em>legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for its employment actions. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">On September 26, 2011, the case was sent to the jury on a special verdict form. (We shall discuss the verdict form in more detail, <em>infra.) </em>As noted, the jurors returned a verdict in favor of Jackson, awarding her $500,000 in \u201ceconomic damages\u201d and $150,000 in \u201ccompensatory damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">On September 27, 2011, Jackson filed a memorandum arguing that she had presented evidence sufficient to support an award of punitive damages. Edgewood filed an opposition three days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>On October 3, 2011, the court entered the Judgment in favor of Jackson for $650,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">On October 6, 2011, Edgewood filed a motion for JNOV and a 10-day \u201cMotion to Amend Judgment to Conform\u201d with the MCC, which Jackson opposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">On October 28, 2011, Jackson filed a petition for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">On February 23, 2012, the court heard argument on the motion for JNOV and the fee petition. It denied the JNOV motion and held the fee petition <em>sub curia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">On March 8, 2012, the court heard argument on the motion to amend the Judgment. It held the matter <em>sub curia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">On March 21, 2012, Edgewood noted an appeal from the Judgment entered on October 3, 2011, and the order denying its motion for JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">On April 23, 2012, the court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting Edgewood\u2019s motion to amend the Judgment. The court directed that the jury\u2019s verdict \u201cbe reduced ... to $89,195.00, an amount equaling a two year cap on back pay less [Jacksonj\u2019s unemployment compensation.\u201d The Amended Judgment was entered that same day.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">On April 30, 2012, Jackson noted a cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">On December 21, 2012, the court issued an order awarding Jackson $219,569.10 in attorneys\u2019 fees and $76,640.60 in costs. Jackson also noted an appeal from that order, but, as mentioned, that appeal is not before us at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>We shall include additional facts in our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Legal Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">For a number of related reasons, Edgewood contends the evidence at trial was legally insufficient to prove Jackson\u2019s claim for discrimination based on retaliation. Before turning to Edgewood\u2019s specific arguments, we shall set forth the law governing Jackson\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Jackson filed suit pursuant to SG section 20-1202, which provides, in relevant part, that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">person that is subjected to a discriminatory act prohibited by the county code [in Howard, Montgomery, or Prince George\u2019s County] may bring and maintain a civil action against the person that committed the alleged discriminatory act for damages, injunctive relief, or other civil relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0P\">In her complaint, Jackson alleged that Edgewood had committed a discriminatory act in violation of MCC section 27-19(c). As relevant here, that section prohibits an employer from \u201cretaliating] against any person for ... lawfully opposing any discriminatory practice prohibited under this division.\u201d Discrimination on the basis of sex is a prohibited practice. MCC \u00a7 27-19(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination based on retaliation, a plaintiff must produce evidence that she engaged in a protected activity; her employer took an adverse action against her; and her employer\u2019s adverse action was causally connected to her protected activity. <em>Taylor v. Giant of Maryland, LLC, </em>423 Md. 628, 658, 33 A.3d 445 (2011) (citing <em>Manikhi v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>360 Md. 333, 349, 758 A.2d 95 (2000)); <em>Killian v. Kinzer, </em>123 Md.App. 60, 68, 716 A.2d 1071 (1998). If a plaintiff meets this threshold burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>production, the burden of production then shifts to the defendant to offer a non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. <em>See Killian, </em>128 Md.App. at 68, 716 A.2d 1071; <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the employer does so, the burden of production shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the proffered reasons for the employment action were a mere pretext. <em>Killian, </em>123 Md.App. at 68, 716 A.2d 1071. As this Court explained in the context of a claim for employment discrimination on the basis of disability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">\u201cPretext might be established by showing \u2018such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANo\"><em>Nerenberg v. RICA of S. Md., </em>131 Md.App. 646, 675, 750 A.2d 655 (2000) (quoting <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759, 765 (3rd Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In the instant case, Edgewood argues that Jackson failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation because the evidence was legally insufficient to prove that she engaged in a protected activity; that she was the subject of an adverse employment action; and, even if there were sufficient proof of those elements, that there was a causal connection between her protected activity and the employment action. Edgewood further maintains that, even assuming for the sake of argument that Jackson made a threshold showing of retaliation, it produced evidence of several non-discriminatory reasons for its employment actions against Jackson and Jackson failed to prove that any of these reasons were pretextual. Thus, the trial court erred in denying its motions for judgment and for JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Jackson responds that she presented relevant and competent evidence legally sufficient to prove that she engaged in protected \u201coppositional\u201d activity by making a report of sex discrimination on behalf of a subordinate employee; that Edgewood reduced her salary and transferred her to a less desirable placement; that this transfer and pay cut were intended to and did in fact cause her to resign, amounting to a constructive discharge; and that her constructive discharge was causally connected to her protected oppositional activity. She maintains that Edgewood\u2019s proffered explanations for its adverse employment actions were amply rebutted by evidence she produced and were shown to be pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u201cIn a jury trial, a party may move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict only if that party made a motion for judgment at the close of all the evidence and only on the grounds advanced in support of the earlier motion.\u201d Md.

Booker, </em>152 Md.App. 166, 176, 831 A.2d 481 (2003).

Jackson\u2019s Prima Facie Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\n<em>1. Protected Oppositional Activity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">An employee\u2019s complaint about an employer\u2019s allegedly discriminatory conduct, whether through formal or informal grievance procedures, constitutes protected oppositional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>activity. <em>Crawford v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville, 555 </em>U.S. 271, 276, 129 S.Ct. 846, 172 L.Ed.2d 650 (2009) (employee\u2019s report of incidents of sexual harassment during an internal review is protected activity under Title VII). A plaintiff must show that he or she held a good faith, subjective, and objectively reasonable belief that the employer engaged in discriminatory conduct. <em>Peters v. Jenney, </em>327 F.3d 307, 320-21 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The evidence at trial, viewed in a light most favorable to Jackson, showed that on December 10, 2010, she witnessed Reyes discuss in close succession planned changes in employment with two employees\u2014Wilcoxen, a male, and Wagner, a female. Reyes met privately with Wilcoxen in Jackson\u2019s office, and told him about his impending lay-off. Moments later, in a central area of the Glenview office that was not private and in which employees, tenants, and prospective tenants were present, Reyes loudly criticized Wagner for declining a transfer to another office for personal reasons and announced that her salary was going to be reduced, specifying the amount of the reduction. Immediately thereafter, Wagner told Jackson she thought that Reyes had treated her differently from Wilcoxen because of her gender. This evidence, if credited by the jurors, was legally sufficient to show that, based on what she witnessed and Wagner\u2019s stated reaction to her treatment by Reyes, Jackson held a subjective and objectively reasonable belief that Reyes had discriminated against Wagner based on her gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Jackson testified that, on December 15, 2009, consistent with Edgewood\u2019s internal policies, she called Azouqha, Reyes\u2019s immediate supervisor, and reported to him that Wagner had made a complaint of sex discrimination. Although Azouqha denied this in his testimony, the jurors were free to reject Azouqha\u2019s testimony and credit Jackson\u2019s testimony instead. On this evidence, reasonable jurors could find by a preponderance of the evidence that Jackson engaged in protected oppositional activity by opposing an act of discrimination on the basis of sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\n<em>2. Adverse Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Edgewood argues that none of the employment actions it took with respect to Jackson rose to the level of an actionable adverse action. Jackson responds that she needed only to show that she was subjected to an employment action that a \u201creasonable employee would have found ... materially adverse,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>an action that \u201cmight have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe R. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 60, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006) (internal citations omitted). We agree with Jackson that she satisfied her burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">At the time Jackson reported Wagner\u2019s grievance, she had been employed by Edgewood for thirty years, all at Glenview, and had been working as the community manager for Glen-view for 20 years. She never had been disciplined. She lived in Glen Burnie, very near Glenview.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In January and February of 2010, Jackson was disciplined for poor and careless performance, was told that the disciplinary action constituted a \u201cfinal warning,\u201d was directed that she must immediately improve her performance or risk termination, and then was informed that she would be transferred to a position managing two properties, one located in Virginia, more than 30 miles from where she lived, and another also located in Virginia, more than 35 miles away from Jackson\u2019s residence, in the opposite direction; and would have her salary reduced by $5,000. The evidence most favorable to Jackson showed that Jones and Reyes were trying to engineer the termination of Jackson\u2019s employment and they expected that she would resign upon being told that she was being transferred to the two distant properties that would result in at least a 70-mile-per-day drive to and from work and her pay being cut. In fact, what Jones and Reyes wanted to happen, and expected to happen, did happen. Jackson tendered her notice of resignation the day after she was told she was being transferred and her pay was being cut. This evidence plainly was sufficient to prove that Jackson suffered an adverse employment action. <em>See, e.g., Moniodis v. Cook, </em>64 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>1, 11, 494 A.2d 212 (1985) (evidence that an employer altered an employee\u2019s working conditions with the expectation and intention that it would cause the employee to resign sufficient to prove constructive discharge).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\n<em>3. Causal Connection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Edgewood argues that even if the first two elements of Jackson\u2019s claim were satisfied, the evidence nevertheless was legally insufficient to show a causal connection between Jackson\u2019s protected oppositional activity and her constructive discharge. This is so, Edgewood maintains, because it was undisputed that the \u201cactual decisionmaker\u201d\u2014Jones\u2014had no knowledge that Jackson had reported Wagner\u2019s complaint of discrimination against Reyes until after Jackson submitted her resignation. Edgewood further argues that Jackson\u2019s neglect of the income limitations in approving rental applications for Glenview and her failure to achieve tax-credit certification were the but-for causes of the decision to transfer her and to reduce her salary, and therefore the evidence at trial was not sufficient to show that Jackson would not have suffered these adverse employment actions even if she had not made a report that Wagner had been discriminated against.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Relying on <em>Taylor, supra, </em>Jackson responds that an employee can prove causation by adducing evidence that his or her \u201cprotected activity was a \u2018motivating factor\u2019 in an employer\u2019s decision to subject [him or her] to an adverse employment action, not necessarily the controlling factor.\u201d 423 Md. at 658, 33 A.3d 445. She maintains that Jones\u2019s role as the ultimate decision-maker is not dispositive because she presented evidence that Reyes had initiated the disciplinary action against her, based on his own investigation, and that Jones had relied upon Reyes\u2019s investigation in determining to transfer her, an action that Jones himself had predicted would result in her resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Recently, in <em>Staub v. Proctor Hospital, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1186, 1189, 179 L.Ed.2d 144 (2011), the Supreme Court considered \u201cthe circumstances under which an employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>may be held liable for employment discrimination based on the discriminatory animus of an employee who influenced, but did not make, the ultimate employment decision.\u201d The Court held that \u201cif a supervisor performs an act motivated by [discriminatory] animus that is <em>intended </em>by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action,\u201d then the employer may be held liable. <em>Id. </em>at 1194 (emphasis in original; footnote omitted). Moreover, if a supervisor submits a biased report urging an adverse employment action, even if the decision-maker conducts an independent investigation in response to the report and concludes that termination is justified, an employee still may show that the biased report was the proximate cause of the adverse employment action if it was one of many factors considered by the decision-maker. <em>Id. </em>at 1193.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">In the instant case, Jackson presented ample evidence that Reyes had knowledge of her report that he had discriminated against Wagner in December of 2009. Jackson testified that she had reported Wagner\u2019s sex discrimination complaint to Reyes\u2019s immediate supervisor, Azouqha, on December 15, 2009. She further testified that she expected that Azouqha would discuss the complaint with Reyes. Caruso acknowledged testifying in his deposition that he believed that Azouqha and Reyes knew of Wagner\u2019s complaint, via Jackson, in December of 2009. The jurors were, of course, free to reject Reyes\u2019s and Azouqha\u2019s testimony to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The evidence viewed most favorably to Jackson showed that, just one month after Jackson reported that Reyes had discriminated against Wagner based on gender, Reyes initiated an investigation into Jackson and authored the Disciplinary Action Memorandum citing Jackson for violations of Edge-wood policies and general neglect of her duties. <em>See Bleich v. Florence Crittenton Servs. of Baltimore, Inc., </em>98 Md.App. 123, 142, 632 A.2d 463 (1993) (in wrongful discharge action, temporal proximity between protected activity and discharge was evidence supporting an inference that the protected activity was the proximate cause of her termination.) At that time, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>suggested to Caruso and Azouqha that termination was the appropriate sanction against Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Jones testified that he relied upon Reyes\u2019s investigation and his Disciplinary Action Memorandum in approving the subsequent decision to transfer Jackson to a position managing two properties more than 30 miles away in opposite directions, and that he did so with the knowledge that such a transfer likely would result in her resignation. On that evidence, reasonable jurors could find that Reyes instigated the disciplinary action against Jackson and that this act was the proximate cause of Jones\u2019s decision to transfer Jackson, which resulted in her resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\n<em>B. \u201cMere Pretext\u201d Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Having concluded that Jackson\u2019s evidence was legally sufficient to prove a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, we now turn to Edgewood\u2019s contention that the evidence was legally insufficient to prove that the \u201clegitimate and non-retaliatory\u201d reasons for Jackson\u2019s discharge were a pretext. Edgewood asserts that each justification for the Disciplinary Action\u2014 accepting more market tenants than permitted under the Section 236 program, tardiness in having maintenance work orders completed, and lying to the attorney representing Edgewood in the Barnes discrimination complaint case\u2014was borne out by the evidence and was sufficient to justify Jackson\u2019s termination and, unquestionably, a lateral transfer to a less desirable location. Edgewood asserts, moreover, that it showed an independent, non-discriminatory reason that justified Jackson\u2019s transfer to a position at another property. Specifically, Edgewood points to its evidence that, upon discovering that the number of market tenants accepted at Glenview exceeded what was permitted and would result in a $1 million decrease in the number of LIHTC tax credits available to Triton, Charlton personally insisted that Glenview be managed by a tax credit certified manager. Jackson was not tax credit certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Jackson responds that she rebutted Edgewood\u2019s proffered justifications by showing that her acceptance of the three market tenants in 2009 was done with Davis\u2019s approval (and that Reyes was aware of this fact); that maintenance requests were handled in a prompt fashion and, in any event, that another Edgewood employee, West, bore the ultimate responsibility for fulfilling such requests and was not disciplined; and that her statements to the Edgewood attorney were accurate. With respect to her lack of tax-credit certification, Jackson points out that, of the two properties to which she was to be transferred, one (Charles Landing) also was an LIHTC property and the other (Glenreed) was in the process of applying to become an LIHTC property. Thus, her transfer to these properties was inconsistent with the stated justification. She asserts that this was evidence of \u201cweaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions\u201d in Edgewood\u2019s proffered explanations and, as such, was sufficient to permit reasonable jurors to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the explanations were pretextual. <em>Nerenberg, supra, </em>131 Md.App. at 675, 750 A.2d 655 (quoting <em>Fuentes, supra, </em>32 F.3d at 765). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">It is a fundamental principle that the weighing of competing inferences to be drawn from evidence of conflicting facts is within the province of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">\u201cWhen the interplay of circumstances is susceptible of different interpretations by rational minds, the problem is essentially one for the jury; the trial judge is not permitted to transform it into a question of law for his own determination. The choice between conflicting facts and the weighing and assessing of competing inferences radiating therefrom is the jury\u2019s province.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\"><em>Grady v. Brown, </em>408 Md. 182, 198, 968 A.2d 1084 (2009) (quoting <em>Rea Construction Co. v. Robey, </em>204 Md. 94, 100, 102 A.2d 745 (1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Here, the evidence of Charlton\u2019s concern about Jackson\u2019s remaining at Glenview was shaky, at best. Although Jones testified that he had received complaints from Charlton about Jackson\u2019s performance, he acknowledged that he had no e<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>mails or other documentation to support any such complaint. An e-mail in which Charlton expressed to Jones an interest in getting an LIHTC-certified manager in place at Glenview was sent by Charlton <em>in response </em>to Reyes\u2019s e-mail stating that Edgewood was planning to terminate Jackson and, in the interim, intended to transfer Jackson to another Triton property. The jurors reasonably could have found by a preponderance of the evidence that Charlton did not complain about Jackson and only requested an LIHTC-certified manager at Glenview after being told that Jackson no longer would be there; and therefore Jones\u2019s testimony that Jackson was disciplined because of complaints by Charlton was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Similarly, the jurors were free to accept Jackson\u2019s rebuttal of the disciplinary charges against her. She presented evidence showing that her handling of Barnes\u2019s maintenance requests was appropriate and that Barnes was a difficult tenant with a long history of unsubstantiated complaints. She also presented evidence that, if credited, supported her view that a \u201cleak\u201d never was found in Barnes\u2019s apartment and therefore her statement to Edgewood\u2019s attorney in the Barnes matter was accurate. Finally, Jackson and West each testified that delays in the handling of maintenance requests never had resulted in a disciplinary action in the past and, in any event, West bore the ultimate responsibility for delays experienced at Glenview, if there were any.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">This evidence was legally sufficient for the jurors to find by a preponderance of the evidence that Edgewood\u2019s \u201cproffered legitimate reasons for its action\u201d were \u201cunworthy of credence\u201d and, accordingly, that Edgewood did not \u201cact for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons.\u201d <em>Nerenberg, </em>131 Md.App. at 675, 750 A.2d 655 (quoting <em>Fuentes, supra, </em>32 F.3d at 765). For all these reasons, we perceive no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to deny Edgewood\u2019s motions for judgment and for JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Special Verdict Sheet</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Edgewood contends the trial court abused its discretion by declining to use a verdict sheet that Edgewood pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>posed; and that this was reversible error. Edgewood asserts that its \u201cstep-by-step verdict sheet encouraged orderly analysis by the jurors\u201d and \u201cminimized the risk that the jurors would confuse the threshold issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Jackson responds that the court did not abuse its discretion by using her proposed verdict sheet and, in any event, Edge-wood has failed to demonstrate that it was prejudiced as a consequence of the court\u2019s using her verdict sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">At the close of all the evidence, the court heard argument about the parties\u2019 proposed verdict sheets. Jackson\u2019s counsel proposed a \u201cone-page verdict form that [he thought] comport[ed] with this Court\u2019s general practice.\u201d Edgewood\u2019s counsel proposed a \u201cthree-page verdict form with 10 separate questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The court reviewed Jackson\u2019s proposed verdict sheet, directing her counsel to remove two questions pertaining to punitive damages. The court further remarked: \u201cReally, that\u2019s all you really need.\u201d Edgewood\u2019s counsel argued, however, that the jury should be given a verdict sheet that included the \u201cthree essential elements\u201d of retaliatory discharge\u2014protected activity, adverse action, and causation\u2014and that \u201cask[ed] the jury to make [a] finding as to each element.\u201d The court opined that the verdict sheet \u201cjust needs to be simple questions,\u201d but agreed that it would be appropriate to ask the jury to first find that Jackson had engaged in a protected activity before considering damages. Edgewood\u2019s counsel responded by asking whether she should \u201ctry to modify [the verdict sheet].\u201d The judge responded that they could make \u201cadjustments in the verdict sheet\u201d at a later point in time because the jury did not need a verdict sheet at the beginning of deliberations. The court then turned to the issue of jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The verdict sheet issue was not raised again before the jury was sent to deliberate. Apparently, without the knowledge of the judge or counsel, Jackson\u2019s proposed verdict sheet (minus the punitive damages questions) was provided to the jurors at the outset of deliberations. That verdict sheet stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>1. On Donna Jackson\u2019s claim of retaliation in violation of the [MCC] against Edgewood [], we find in favor of? _Plaintiff, Donna Jackson_Defendant, Edgewood</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\">If you find for Plaintiff, continue to Question 2. If you find for Defendant, you may stop deliberating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">2. If you found for Plaintiff Donna Jackson, what is the amount of economic and/or compensatory damages to be awarded?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">Economic Damages: $_;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">Compensatory Damages: $_;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">In the meantime, Edgewood had modified its proposed verdict sheet, in response to the court\u2019s suggestions, substituting two questions in place of the first question, both of which were susceptible of a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer: 1) \u201cHas plaintiff proved that she engaged in a protected activity?\u201d and 2) \u201cHas Plaintiff proven she was retaliated against in violation of the [MCC]?\u201d This proposed verdict sheet directed the jurors to stop deliberating if they answered \u201cNo\u201d to either question.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">About one hour after the jurors began deliberating, the court entertained further discussion on the verdict sheet issue. The court observed that both proposed verdict sheets were correct, but that Edgewood\u2019s was \u201cmore detailed and clearer.\u201d By then, the court and counsel knew that the jurors had Jackson\u2019s verdict sheet with them in the jury room. The court determined that, given that Jackson\u2019s verdict sheet already had been provided to the jurors, it would be improper and confusing to substitute Edgewood\u2019s proposed verdict sheet at that time. Edgewood\u2019s counsel noted her objection to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">The Court of Appeals has explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\">the decision to use a particular verdict sheet \u201cwill not be reversed absent abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Applied Indus. Techs, v. Ludemann, </em>148 Md.App. 272, 287, 811 A.2d 845, 854 (2002). Moreover, Maryland appellate courts generally will not reverse even an unreasonable decision without evidence of prejudice/harm. <em>See Owens\u2014Corning Fiberglas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>Corp. v.

Both proposed verdict sheets accurately stated the findings required to be made by the jurors to decide the case. Moreover, Edgewood has not shown any prejudice to it flowing from the trial court\u2019s decision to use Jackson\u2019s proposed verdict sheet. The jurors properly were instructed on the elements of an action for retaliatory discharge in violation of the MCC, including that they would need to find by a preponderance of the evidence that Jackson engaged in a protected activity. The verdict sheet as used was not legally incorrect or confusing, and there is no reason to think that the jurors would have decided this case differently had Edgewood\u2019s proposed verdict sheet been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">\n<em>CROSS-APPEAL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Grant of Edgewood\u2019s Motion to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Jackson contends the trial court committed an error of law in granting Edgewood\u2019s motion to amend the Judgment by reducing the damages awarded to \u201ccomport\u201d with a limitation on damages that is set forth in MCC section 27-8. We begin by reviewing the pertinent statutory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">Maryland\u2019s anti-discrimination laws are codified at Title 20 of the State Government Article.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Several subtitles are relevant to our analysis. First, in 1965, the General Assembly enacted the Fair Employment Practices Act (\u201cFEPA\u201d), now codified at Subtitle 6. 1965 Laws of Maryland, Ch. 717. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>FEPA prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>discrimination on the basis of sex, including retaliating against an employee for opposing a discriminatory practice. SG \u00a7 20-606(a) <em>&amp; </em>(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Before 2007, the only remedy available to an employee claiming discrimination in violation of the FEPA was to file a charge with the MCHR. <em>See Md. Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Downey Communc\u2019ns, Inc. </em>110 Md.App. 493, 542, 678 A.2d 55 (1996). In <em>Shabazz v. Bob Evans Farms, Inc., </em>163 Md.App. 602, 624, 881 A.2d 1212 (2005), we discussed that \u201cadministrative enforcement remedy,\u201d then codified at Article 49B:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">[T]he Commission has the power to receive complaints about alleged acts of discrimination (including unlawful employment practices), investigate, determine probable cause to support an allegation, make a complaint if there is probable cause and the alleged acts are not eliminated by agreement, and refer the matter for determination by a hearing officer, in a contested case hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">(Citing <em>State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Kaydon Ring &amp; Seal, Inc., </em>149 Md.App. 666, 684-85, 818 A.2d 259 (2003).) Upon a finding by a hearing officer that an employer violated the FEPA, the hearing officer was authorized to order the employee reinstated, with or without backpay, and to award other equitable relief. <em>Id. </em>(citing Article 49B, \u00a7 11(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">In 2007, however, the General Assembly amended the FEPA to authorize an employee and the MCHR to bring a civil action against an employer and to require that administrative charges be brought before an Administrative Law Judge instead of a hearing officer. Laws of 2007, chs. 176 &amp; 177, \u00a7 2. This legislation also expanded the remedies available in an administrative proceeding to allow compensatory damages in addition to backpay. <em>Id.; see </em>SG \u00a7 20-1009. The amount of the total additional compensatory damages awarded to an employee was capped based upon the size of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>employer.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id.; see </em>SG \u00a7 20-1009(b)(3). Finally, the legislation provided that the remedies available in a private civil action or in an action brought by the MCHR were identical to those available in an administrative action with one exception: an employee could be awarded punitive damages only in a private civil action. The punitive damages combined with any compensatory damages also were subject to the damages caps based upon the size of the employer. <em>Id.; </em>SG \u00a7 20-1012(b) (civil action by MCHR); SG \u00a7 20-1013(d) (civil action by employee). The FEPA was again amended in 2009 to, <em>inter alia, </em>limit an award of backpay to the two years preceding the filing of a complaint. Laws of 2009, Ch. 56; SG \u00a7 20-1009(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Subtitle 12, entitled \u201cCivil Actions-Violations of County Discrimination Laws,\u201d provides an alternative avenue of relief for residents of Baltimore, Howard, Montgomery, and Prince George\u2019s counties. SG section 20-1202(b), authorizes \u201ca person that is subjected to a discriminatory act prohibited by the county code [in Howard, Montgomery, or Prince George\u2019s County to] bring and maintain a civil action against the person that committed the alleged discriminatory act for damages, injunctive relief, or other civil relief.\u201d A plaintiff must commence such an action \u201cwithin 2 years after the occurrence of the alleged discriminatory act,\u201d but no sooner than \u201c45 days after the aggrieved person files a complaint with the county unit responsible for handling violations of the county discrimination laws.\u201d SG \u00a7 20-1202(c).

Punitive damages may not be awarded, however. SG \u00a7 20-1203(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In the instant case, Jackson filed suit under SG section 20-1202, alleging an underlying violation of section 27-19 of the MCC, which prohibits discrimination in employment, including retaliation against an employee opposing a discriminatory act. Chapter 27 of the MCC governs \u201cHuman Rights and Civil Liberties.\u201d Article I creates a 15-member \u201cCommission on Human Rights\u201d (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), appointed by the Montgomery County Executive, to research, educate and promote equal opportunity in the county. In addition to prohibiting discrimination in employment, Article I governs discrimination in places of public accommodation, in real estate, and racial or religious intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Article I of Chapter 27 creates two alternative avenues of relief for any person discriminated against in violation of the Chapter (including a person subjected to employment discrimination). One avenue allows the employee to file a complaint with the Director of the Office of Human Rights, seeking administrative relief before a case review board consisting of a three-member panel drawn from the members of the Commission. As relevant here, MCC section 27-8 governs the \u201cPenalties and relief\u2019 a case review board may award following a finding of a violation of the anti-discrimination provisions of Chapter 27. Subsection (a) states that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the case review board may order the payment of damages <em>{other than punitive damages) </em>and any other relief that the law and the facts warrant, such as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">(1) compensation for</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">(A) reasonable attorney\u2019s fees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">(B) property damage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">(C) personal injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">(D) unreimbursed travel or other reasonable expenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">(E) <em>damages not exceeding $500,000 for humiliation and embarrassment, </em>based on the nature of the humiliation and embarrassment, including its severity, duration, frequency, and breadth of observation by others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">(F) financial losses resulting from the discriminatory act</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">(G) interest on any damages from the date of the discriminatory act or violation, as provided in subsection (c);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-12\">(2) equitable relief to prevent the discrimination....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-13\">(3) <em>consequential damages, such as lost wages from employment discrimination ... for up to 2 years after the violation, not exceeding the actual difference in expenses or benefits that the complainant realized while seeking to mitigate the consequences of the violation (such as income from alternative employment or unemployment compensation following employment discrimination); and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-14\">(4) any other relief that furthers the purposes of this Article or Article X or is necessary to eliminate the effects of any discrimination prohibited under this Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-15\">(Emphasis added.) Subsection (b) authorizes the case review board to impose civil penalties upon the person found to have violated the Chapter, including, in the case of a finding of employment discrimination, $5,000 for each violation. Subsection (c) authorizes the case review board to award the complainant interest on any damages awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-16\">In the instant case, however, Jackson did not pursue the administrative remedy avenue under Chapter 27. Instead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>she pursued the alternate avenue of relief afforded by Article I of that Chapter, by filing suit against Edgewood in the circuit court, as authorized by MCC section 27-9(a). MCC section 27-9(a) provides in relevant part, \u201c[a]ny person subjected to an act of discrimination or intimidation under this article may pursue a civil action under Maryland law. A person who substantially prevails in a civil action may recover costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In its motion to amend the Judgment, Edgewood argued that because Jackson\u2019s retaliation action was for a violation of MCC section 27\u201419(c), her \u201cremedies [were] limited to those enumerated in MCC \u00a7 27-8.\u201d On this basis, Edgewood asked the court to reduce the $500,000 verdict for economic damages in Jackson\u2019s favor \u201cto the 2 year limitation on lost wages and [to] offset [the award] by [Jackson]\u2019s receipt of unemployment benefits.\u201d It calculated Jackson\u2019s lost wages for the two-year period following her constructive discharge at $119,125, based upon the evidence she had submitted at trial ($54,275 in 2010 and $64,849 in 2011). It further calculated the value of the unemployment benefits she had received since her constructive discharge at $29,930.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It thus asked the court to reduce the $500,000 in economic damages to $89,195 ($119,125 minus $29,930). Edgewood did not seek a reduction in the award of $150,000 in compensatory damages.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, it took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>position that the Judgment should be amended to award a total of $239,195 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Jackson responded that because she brought her action pursuant to SG section 20-1202, which does not impose a limit upon the type or amount of relief available, the common law of damages governed her claim. She further argued that her damages should not be offset by her receipt of unemployment benefits because MCC section 27-8\u2019s offset provision does not apply to her claim; unemployment benefits are a collateral source under Maryland law; and, in any event, there was no evidence admitted at trial that showed the amount of unemployment benefits she actually received.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The court heard argument of counsel on the motion to amend and, on April 23, 2012, issued and entered a memorandum opinion and order granting the motion. The court reasoned that SG section 20-1202 \u201cauthorizes lawsuits in Circuit Court based on local ordinances,\u201d and that, \u201c[b]y extension, damages are properly gauged by the local ordinance.\u201d The court opined that Maryland\u2019s common law of damages only is \u201cthe default damage provision when there are no statutory damages,\u201d but concluded that MCC section 27-8 set forth \u201cstatutory damages to properly gauge the award of damages\u201d in this case. The court thus decided the jury verdict for economic damages in favor of Jackson had to be reduced to two years\u2019 of back pay, less the amount of unemployment benefits she had received. It entered the Amended Judgment in the amount of $89,195 on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">First, as discussed, Edgewood only sought a reduction of the jurors\u2019 verdict in favor of Jackson for economic damages. Without explanation, the court not only reduced the economic damages award but also eliminated the jury\u2019s entire award of $150,000 in non-economic damages. Given that the elimination of the $150,000 non-economic damages award was not requested by Edgewood in its motion and was done without any apparent or expressed legal basis, it is beyond cavil that the court committed error.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>We now turn to the propriety of the court\u2019s decision to reduce the economic damage award of $500,000 to \u201ccomport\u201d with MCC section 27-8. Jackson asserts this ruling was legally incorrect for three reasons. First, the plain language of MCC section 27-8 \u201cis directed solely to administrative claims brought before [a case review board].\u201d Second, MCC section 27-9, authorizing a private cause of action for violation of the anti-discrimination provisions of the MCC, \u201cimposes no limitation on damages.\u201d Finally, SG section 20-1202, which authorizes a private cause of action for discrimination in violation of the MCC, does not impose any limit on the type or amount of damages recoverable. Jackson asserts, alternatively, that even if MCC section 27-8 applies to private causes of action, it is clear from the provision permitting a case review board to award \u201cany other relief that furthers the purposes of this Article\u201d that the limitation on economic damages is not absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Edgewood responds that, although Jackson\u2019s action for retaliation was authorized by SG section 20-1202, an enabling statute, the action was premised on an alleged violation of MCC section 27-19. As such, Jackson\u2019s remedies are limited to those available under the administrative procedures of the MCC, as set forth in section 27-8. Its argument is as follows. The private cause of action authorized by MCC section 27-9 was \u201ccreated by the Montgomery County Council and approved and authorized by the Maryland General Assembly\u201d; therefore, it is a local law authorized by the Home Rule Amendment and is not preempted by state law. Because Jackson\u2019s cause of action arises under the MCC, we must construe the term \u201cdamages\u201d in MCC section 27-9 within the context of the MCC as a whole, which includes MCC section 27-8. To construe section 27-9 otherwise would create the absurd result that a complainant who sues in the circuit court may be awarded much greater damages than a claimant who pursues administrative relief for the same violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Because we are tasked with interpreting state and local laws, we are guided by the sound principles of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u201cIn statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always \u2018to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules.\u2019 <em>Barbre v.

MCC section 27-8 governs the \u201c[p]enalties and relief\u201d that may be awarded by a \u201ccase review board\u201d after an administrative finding of a discriminatory act under the MCC. In contrast, MCC section 27-9 authorizes \u201c[a]ny person subjected to an act of discrimination or intimidation under this article\u201d to bring a \u201ccivil action under <em>Maryland law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) It does not limit the damages that may be awarded in such an action to those stated in the immediately preceding section 27-8 or by reference to any other provision of federal, state, or local law. Moreover, the two sections both allow a prevailing party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. If MCC section 27-9 were read to incorporate the damages provisions of MCC section 27-8, the attorneys\u2019 fees clause would be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Additionally, in <em>McCrory Corp. v. Fowler, </em>319 Md. 12, 19, 570 A.2d 834 (1990), the Court of Appeals construed the predecessor ordinance to MCC section 27-9 to permit a plaintiff to seek \u201cunlimited money damages.\u201d In <em>McCrory, </em>the Court of Appeals considered two questions certified to it by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The first was whether then section 27-20(a) of the MCC,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which \u201ccreat[ed] a private cause of action for employment discrimination entitling a claimant to sue for <em>damages, injunctive or other civil relief\u201d </em>exceeded the authority delegated to Montgomery County, a home rule county, under the Express Powers Act. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 570 A.2d 834 (emphasis added.) The second question was whether MCC section 27-20(a) was a valid grant of authority or was preempted by state discrimination laws, then codified at Article 49B of the Maryland Code. The Court held that MCC section 27-20(a) was not preempted by Article 49B, but that it was a local law that was not authorized by the Express Powers Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The plaintiff in <em>McCrory </em>had alleged that he was constructively discharged for refusing to follow directives not to hire any African-American workers. He filed suit in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against his employer for retaliation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and for abusive discharge. After the employer removed the case to federal court, the plaintiff amended his complaint to eliminate the claim for abusive discharge and to substitute a claim under MCC section 27-20(a). He sought \u201cover $1.8 million in compensatory and punitive damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 570 A.2d 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>After discussing the difference between a \u201clocal law\u201d authorized under the Express Powers Act and a general law that exceeds the authority granted a home rule county to enact, the Court turned to the purpose and effect of MCC section 27-20:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arm\">Section 27-20(a) of the Montgomery County Code authorizes a private citizen to seek redress for another private citizen\u2019s violation of a county anti-employment discrimination ordinance <em>by instituting a judicial action in the courts of the State for, inter alia, unlimited money damages. </em>Fowler, for example, is seeking over $1.8 million. While a plaintiff must first file a complaint with an administrative agency, he is free to institute a civil action after forty-five days have elapsed. In the present case, the administrative agency followed its standard policy and closed Fowler\u2019s complaint when he \u201cdecided to pursue his claim in a judicial forum.\u201d Thus, the judicial action is effectively independent of any county administrative proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 19-20, 570 A.2d 834 (emphasis added). The Court concluded that Montgomery County as a local jurisdiction is not authorized to \u201ccreate[ ] a new judicial cause of action between private individuals,\u201d as that authority lies with the General Assembly or is within the province of the Court of Appeals \u201cunder its authority to modify the common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 570 A.2d 834. The Court held that, while a home rule county has \u201cconcurrent authority to provide administrative remedies not in conflict with state law,\u201d MCC section 27-20(a) exceeded the authority conferred upon Montgomery County under the Express Powers Act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In 1992, in response to the <em>McCrory </em>decision, the General Assembly enacted section 42(a) of Article 49B, later recodified without substantive change at SG section 20-1202, creating a \u201cnew cause of action in the circuit courts for violation of the local antidiscrimination laws of Montgomery County.\u201d <em>Shabazz, </em>163 Md.App. at 626, 881 A.2d 1212.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Appeals has described the legislative history and purpose of SG section 20-1202 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In 1992, responding to our holding in <em>McCrory, </em>the General Assembly passed House Bill 722, which created the original version of \u00a7 42(a) [now SG section 20-1202] thereby authorizing explicitly private civil actions for violations of the anti-discrimination provisions of the Montgomery County Code. The Preamble to House Bill 722 left no doubt that the purpose of the measure was to overrule legislatively our decision in <em>McCrory. </em>In no uncertain terms, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZq\">WHEREAS, On March 7, 1990 the Maryland Court of Appeals invalidated Section 27-20(a) of the Montgomery County Code, which was enacted in 1973 and provides for private causes of action for violations of certain County discrimination laws; and WHEREAS, The Maryland Court of Appeals held in <em>McCrory Corp. v. Fowler </em>that the Express Powers Act did not provide adequate authority to create private causes of actions and that the creation of a new private cause of action has traditionally been the province of the General Assembly or the Court of Appeals; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">WHEREAS, The General Assembly believes that it is important to provide full protection of the law to its citizens and that allowing private causes of action for violations of certain county discrimination laws, under certain circumstances, is appropriate;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">1992 Md. Laws 3446.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\"><em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Phillips, </em>413 Md. 606, 628-29, 994 A.2d 411 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">We must presume that the legislature \u201cmeant what it said and said what it meant\u201d when it enacted SG section 20-1202 using language nearly identical to the language in MCC section 27-20(a). <em>E.g., Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525, 801 A.2d 160 (2002). <em>See also Howard County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. v. Linda J., </em>161 Md.App. 402, 409, 869 A.2d 404 (2005) (legislature must be presumed to have \u201cunderstood and intended\u201d to use the language it used). As the <em>McCrory </em>Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>had held, this language authorized recovery of \u201cunlimited money damages.\u201d <em>Compare </em>SG section 20-1202(b) (authorizing a plaintiff to seek \u201cdamages, injunctive relief, or other civil relief\u2019) <em>with </em>MCC \u00a7 27-20(a) (1973) (authorizing a plaintiff to seek \u201cdamages, injunctive or other civil relief\u2019). Had the legislature intended to limit the remedies available to a plaintiff suing for a violation of the anti-discrimination provisions of the MCC, it could have included limitations either within section 20-1202 or by reference to MCC section 27-8. It did neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Moreover, the legislature has made clear that it is fully aware of how to specify the damages available for violations of state or county anti-discrimination laws. As discussed, it specified the types of damages available to employees suing for a violation of the BCC when, in 1997, it enacted then Article 49B, section 43, now codified at SG section 20-1203. <em>See </em>1997 Laws of Maryland, Ch. 348. Similarly, in 2007, when the legislature amended Article 49B to authorize a private cause of action for violations of the FEPA and the other anti-discrimination laws therein, it specified that a successful plaintiff is entitled to the same remedies available in an administrative action,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> with the exception of punitive damages, which only were allowable in a private cause of action brought by an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">This Courts\u2019s decision in <em>Shabazz, </em>163 Md.App. at 602, 881 A.2d 1212, also is consistent with this construction. There, the plaintiff, Wendy Shabazz, who is African-American, had worked as a server in a Bob Evans restaurant in Bowie. She alleged that certain policy changes at the restaurant that had the effect of limiting a server\u2019s ability to develop regular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>customers and increase his or her tips were being applied in a discriminatory manner. She complained to the assistant manager, who, in turn, communicated the complaint to Shabazz\u2019s immediate supervisor, Martin. Martin promptly fired Shabazz. Two days later, after protesting her termination, Shabazz was reinstated to her position. She continued to complain of less desirable work assignments until she was again terminated by Martin, three months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Shabazz filed suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against Bob Evans and Martin, asserting two violations of the PGCC: unlawful employment discrimination on the basis of her race; and retaliation. She sought \u201ceconomic damages, compensatory damages, and punitive damages to be determined at trial, plus attorneys\u2019 fees, costs,\u201d and other appropriate relief. <em>Id. </em>at 614, 881 A.2d 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The case was tried to a jury. At the close of all the evidence, Shabazz withdrew her claim for economic damages. She argued to the jury that it should award compensatory damages for pain and suffering and punitive damages. The jurors returned a verdict finding that Bob Evans was not liable for race discrimination or retaliation, but finding that Martin had \u201cunlawfully discharged [Shabazz] in retaliation for her complaint of discriminatory conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616, 881 A.2d 1212. The jurors awarded Shabazz \u201c0\u201d in compensatory damages and $85,000 in punitive damages. <em>Id. </em>at 617, 881 A.2d 1212. The court entered two judgments: one in favor of Bob Evans and against Shabazz for costs; and one against Martin and in favor of Shabazz for $85,000 and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Martin moved for JNOV, arguing that because the award of punitive damages was not supported by a predicate award of compensatory damages, it had to be stricken. Shabazz filed a post-judgment motion, as well, seeking to have the court determine and award her backpay \u201cas a form of \u2018make whole\u2019 equitable relief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">In analyzing Shabazz\u2019s backpay argument, we considered the state and federal anti-discrimination law schemes. We explained that, at that time, the FEPA, then codified in Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>49B, prohibited at section 16(f) retaliation against an employee for making a complaint of unlawful discrimination. It did not authorize a private cause of action for a violation of that section, however. Rather, the FEPA provided only an administrative enforcement mechanism for violations of section 16(f). Upon a finding of a violation, the MCHR could order an employee reinstated and award backpay, but could not award damages or other monetary relief. In contrast, under then recent changes to federal anti-discrimination laws set forth at Title VII, an employee could bring a private cause of action to recover compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">We then turned to the relief available under then Article 49B, section 42(a), permitting a \u201ccivil action\u201d for \u201cdamages, injunctive relief, or other civil relief\u201d against a person who committed an \u201cact of discrimination prohibited by the [PGCC].\u201d Section 2-185(a) of the PGCC prohibited, <em>inter alia, </em>discrimination on the basis of race. Shabazz argued that she could recover backpay under section 42(a) and that because backpay was in the nature of equitable relief, it was for the court to determine after liability had been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">We concluded, however, that even if section 42(a) authorized Shabazz to pursue backpay as an equitable remedy, it only was recoverable against Bob Evans, not against Martin and because Bob Evans had been found not liable, her claim failed. Alternatively, we concluded that, because section 42(a) permitted Shabazz to seek lost wages as a form of damages, it could not be construed to also permit her to seek backpay as post-judgment equitable relief. We explained that Title VII expressly carved out backpay as an equitable remedy, permitting the court to award backpay and the jury to award \u201c \u2018other compensatory damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630, 881 A.2d 1212 (quoting <em>Corti v. Storage Technology Corp., </em>304 F.3d 336, 344 (4th Cir.2002)). In contrast, \u201cthe cause of action [] created in section 42, for violation of three local anti-employment discrimination laws, does not carve out backpay and disallow recovery of lost earnings from recovery as damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631, 881 A.2d 1212. Therefore, \u201cthere was nothing to preclude Shabazz from going forward with her economic claim of lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>earnings before the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Having made the decision to withdraw that claim from the jury\u2019s consideration, however, she had waived any entitlement to that relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">We also rejected Shabazz\u2019s argument that the jurors\u2019 award of punitive damages could stand in the absence of an underlying award of compensatory damages. We explained that the federal courts of appeal were in \u201cgeneral agreement\u201d that an equitable award of backpay by the court in an action under Title VII was sufficient to support an award of punitive damages by a jury without an award of compensatory damages. <em>Id. </em>at 684, 881 A.2d 1212. In contrast to the controlling provisions of Title VII, however, section 42(a) did not \u201cmake any specific reference to punitive damages\u201d or to federal jurisprudence interpreting Title VII. <em>Id. </em>at 638, 881 A.2d 1212. We opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">Unless the General Assembly has stated otherwise, which it has not, the meaning of section 42, a state enactment, is to be interpreted by application of Maryland common law. That includes the Maryland common law of damages, and further, the Maryland common law of punitive damages</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-6\"><em>Id. </em>Because under Maryland common law an award of punitive damages must be supported by an award of compensatory damages, which at the least would be an award of nominal damages, we held that the trial court was legally correct in granting Martin\u2019s motion for JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Finally, in the case at bar, Edgewood relies upon <em>Makovi v. Sherwin-Williams Company, </em>316 Md. 603, 561 A.2d 179 (1989), and <em>Chappell, </em>320 Md. at 483, 578 A.2d 766, for the proposition that \u201cstatutory remedies for statutory claims \u2018are exclusive.\u2019 \u201d This reliance is misplaced. In <em>Makovi, </em>the Court of Appeals held that an employee could not bring a tort action for abusive discharge in violation of the clear mandate of public policy expressed in the FEPA and Title VII. The Court explained that the FEPA predated its decision in <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 432 A.2d 464 (1981), recognizing the tort of abusive discharge. It commented that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>by recognizing the tort of abusive discharge in <em>Adler </em>it had intended to \u201cvindicate] an otherwise civilly unremedied public policy violation.\u201d 316 Md. at 626, 561 A.2d 179. The Court concluded that because the FEPA already prohibited employment discrimination and provided administrative remedies, including injunctive relief and 2 years\u2019 of backpay, to permit an employee to sue for \u201cfull tort damages\u201d would \u201cupset[ ] the balance between right and remedy struck by the Legislature in establishing the very policy relied upon.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Just one year later, in <em>Chappell, </em>the Court of Appeals reaffirmed its holding in <em>Makovi, </em>explaining that \u201cthe tort of abusive discharge will not lie where the public policy sought to be vindicated by the tort is expressed in a statute which carries its own remedy for vindicating that public policy.\u201d 320 Md. at 490, 578 A.2d 766. Thus, because the FEPA provides a remedy for an employee alleging discrimination in employment, including retaliatory discharge for opposing discriminatory practices, that it precludes a tort remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">We return to the case at bar. Here, Jackson did not file a tort suit for wrongful discharge alleging a violation of a clear mandate of public policy expressed in the FEPA, in the MCC, or in Title VII. Rather, she brought a statutory action pursuant to SG section 20-1202, in which she alleged a violation of MCC section 27-19 and sought \u201cdamages, injunctive relief, or other civil relief,\u201d as authorized by that statute. Thus, <em>Chappell </em>and <em>Makovi </em>are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">As this Court held in <em>Shabazz, </em>Maryland\u2019s common law of damages is the default provision absent some evidence of a legislative intention to enlarge or restrict the type and amount of remedies available. The operative statutes and ordinances in this case plainly and unambiguously authorize a private civil action for common law damages for a violation of the anti-discrimination provisions of the MCC. There is no evidence of any intention to transport the limitation on damages in an administrative proceeding under Article I, Chapter 27 of the MCC into SG section 20-1202. For all of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>reasons, the trial court erred in granting Edgewood\u2019s motion to amend the Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Unemployment Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We also agree -with Jackson\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by reducing the verdict in her favor by the amount of unemployment benefits she received. Jackson maintains that this ruling was contrary to the collateral source rule. Edge-wood does not dispute that unemployment benefits are a collateral source. It argues that a reduction in the verdict based on the amount of unemployment benefits received was required under MCC section 27-8(a)(3). For the reasons already discussed, we reject Edgewood\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u201cThe collateral source rule permits an injured person to recover the full amount of his or her provable damages, \u2018regardless of the amount of compensation which the person has received for his injuries from sources unrelated to the tortfeasor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haischer v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>381 Md. 119, 132, 848 A.2d 620 (2004) (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Admin, v. Seidel, </em>326 Md. 237, 253, 604 A.2d 473 (1992)). A majority of federal circuit courts considering the applicability <em>vel non </em>of the collateral source rule to unemployment benefits in actions brought under Title VII have held that an employee\u2019s damages should not be offset by unemployment benefits received. <em>See Craig v. Y &amp; Y Snacks, Inc., </em>721 F.2d 77, 82-83 (3rd Cir.1983); <em>EEOC v. Ford Motor Co., </em>645 F.2d 183, 195-96 (4th Cir.1981), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>458 U.S. 219, 102 S.Ct. 3057, 73 L.Ed.2d 721 (1982); <em>Rasimas v. Michigan Dep\u2019t. of Mental Health, </em>714 F.2d 614, 627-28 (6th Cir.1983); <em>Kauffman v. Sidereal Corp., </em>695 F.2d 343, 346-47 (9th Cir.1982) <em>(per curiam); B</em>r<em>own v. A.J. Gerrard Mfg. Co., </em>715 F.2d 1549, 1550 (11th Cir.1983) <em>(en banc) (per curiam). But see Dailey v. Societe Generale, </em>108 F.3d 451, 459-60 (2nd cir.1997) (determination as to whether unemployment benefits may be deducted from a Title VII award left to discretion of the district court). We find the reasoning of the majority line of cases on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>issue persuasive and conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of Jackson for \u201ceconomic damages,\u201d which, as the jury was instructed and counsel argued was the loss of salary and benefits she otherwise would have received, was not subject to reduction based on her receipt of unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Moreover, even if we were not persuaded that unemployment benefits were subject to the collateral source rule, we nonetheless would hold that the circuit court erred in reducing the verdict on this basis when, as here, Edgewood did not introduce evidence or make a proffer at trial of the amount of unemployment benefits Jackson received.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Finally, Jackson contends the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jurors on punitive damages. Edgewood responds that Jackson waived this issue for review by failing to except to the instructions as given. We agree with Edgewood.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">During the on-the-record discussions about Jackson\u2019s proposed verdict sheet, the trial court directed her attorney to change the verdict sheet to remove the two questions addressing punitive damages. Jackson\u2019s attorney replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Your Honor. I mean based on your previous ruling, [questions] 3 and 4 would no longer be appropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The jurors subsequently were instructed with no mention of punitive damages. Having failed to except to the instructions, Jackson may not be heard to complain on appeal that the instructions as given were erroneous. Md. Rule 2-520(e) (\u201cNo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">APRIL 23, 2012 AMENDED JUDGMENT VACATED; ORIGINAL JUDGMENT ENTERED OCTOBER 3, 2011, AFFIRMED.

It was apparent at trial that \"economic damages\u201d meant lost wages and \"compensatory damages\u201d meant non-economic damages, <em>i.e., </em>pain and suffering.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-11\">.

We have not made any corrections to the Grievance Letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\">. Jackson explained that when Reyes came to Glenview on December 10, 2009, he had asked her to check the status of any outstanding maintenance requests made by Barnes. She had done so and found no open requests. That same day, Reyes met with Barnes in her apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ment with regard to her discrimination complaint. While there, he observed a \"bulging ceiling\u201d in her bathroom. He asked Jackson to send West, Edgewood\u2019s maintenance supervisor, to check it out. Jackson issued a work order and West inspected the ceiling. He reported back to Jackson that the bulging ceiling was due to a previous repair, but was not caused by a current leak. Nevertheless, four days later, Reyes asked two other maintenance workers to accompany him and West to Barnes's apartment to check for a leak. Reyes directed them to cut through the bulging drywall to check for a leak. None was found.</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">Reyes then directed the maintenance workers to go to the apartment above Barnes\u2019s and open the access panel while splashing water inside that tenant\u2019s bathtub. The workers were then able to see \"water dripping off.\u201d As a result, they were directed to replace an overflow gasket and a shower diverter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b237-8\">. Jones explained that \u201cin order to transfer [Jackson]\u201d he had to replace her with an LIHTC-certified manager and that Glenarden was the only property within \u201creasonable commuting distance\u201d with a certified manager.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b238-11\">. Jackson had taken LIHTC certification classes, but had failed the exam. As of February 4, 2010, it was Edgewood\u2019s policy that all community managers at \"affordable\u201d properties obtain an \"approved industry designation\u201d evidencing their successful completion of a training exam.

As mentioned, Edgewood filed its notice of appeal subsequent to the denial of its JNOV motion, but prior to the court\u2019s ruling on its ten-day motion to amend and the entry of the Amended Judgment. As the Court of Appeals has explained, \"a notice of appeal filed prior to the withdrawal or disposition of a timely filed [ten-day] motion ... is effective. Processing of that appeal is delayed until the withdrawal or disposition of the motion.\u201d <em>Edsall v. Anne Arundel County, </em>332 Md. 502, 508, 632 A.2d 763 (1993); Md. Rule 8-202(c). Thus, since Edgewood filed a timely 10-day motion to amend the Judgment, its notice of appeal filed prior to the court\u2019s disposition of that motion became effective on April 23, 2012, the date the court granted the motion to amend and entered the Amended Judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b244-6\">. Federal cases interpreting Section 2000e-3(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are persuasive authority in interpreting Maryland\u2019s employment discrimination laws. <em>See, e.g., Chappell v.

Edgewood calculated the amount of unemployment benefits Jackson had been paid by using a notice it had received from the Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation indicating that Jackson would be paid $410 per week for 26 weeks; and based on Jackson\u2019s deposition testimony that she had received benefits for \"46 or 47 weeks ... past [her] ... initial 26 weeks.\u201d It thus multiplied her weekly benefit amount by 73 weeks. Edgewood acknowledged that neither the notice nor the excerpt from Jackson\u2019s deposition were introduced into evidence at trial. It argued, however, that the trial court had the authority under Rule 2-534 to \"open the judgment to receive additional evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b260-6\">. As noted above, the award of \"compensatory damages\u201d plainly was non-economic relief. Thus, even if Jackson\u2019s remedies were limited to those set forth in MCC section 27-8, the $150,000 in non-economic damages was permissible as \"damages not exceeding $500,000 for humiliation and embarrassment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\">.

Edgewood urges us to view these enactments as suggesting creation of an overarching scheme to permit a private plaintiff to recover no more relief than would be available in an administrative proceeding for the same underlying violation. Even if we were to find merit in this argument, which we do not, SG section 20-1203 explicitly authorizes a plaintiff suing for a violation of the BCC in the circuit court to recover compensatory damages <em>in addition to </em>backpay, whereas backpay is the only monetary relief available in an administrative action brought under the BCC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b273-9\">. Counsel for both parties acknowledged during oral argument in this Court that the transcript of the trial in this matter does not contain any argument regarding Jackson's entitlement, <em>vel non, </em>to punitive damages. Jackson's attorney stated that it was his recollection that he argued for a jury instruction on punitive damages, which the trial court denied. Edgewood\u2019s attorney had a similar recollection. The omission of this argument from the transcript could not be explained, however. As Jackson's attorney candidly admitted he feared, the absence of any record of this argument inures to Jackson's detriment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
