County Commissioners of Kent County, </em>305 Md. 407, 504 A.2d 1145 (1986), that the voluntary dismissal by the plaintiffs of the only remaining defendant in that case, amounted to a final judgment under Maryland Rule 2-601 and therefore triggered the thirty-day period for filing a notice of appeal. Eleven years after that decision, Rule 2-601(a) was amended. It now requires that \u201c[e]ach judgment shall be set forth on a separate document.\u201d This appeal presents the question of whether the holding of <em>Houghton </em>retains any precedential value, notwithstanding that amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Deborah Hiob and the passengers of her vehicle\u2014Margaret Nelson, Laura Dusome, and Virginia Hiob\u2014were in an automobile accident, which resulted in the death of Laura Dusome and Virginia Hiob and serious bodily injuries to Deborah Hiob and Margaret Nelson. When, following that accident, a dispute arose as to the amounts due under their uninsured motorists\u2019 insurance policies, Deborah Hiob and her husband, Douglas Hiob, individually and as personal representative of the estate of Virginia Hiob, together with Margaret Nelson and the personal representative of the estate of Laura Du-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>some\u2014all of whom are the appellants in this case\u2014brought a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against appellee, Progressive American Insurance Company (\u201cProgressive\u201d), as well as Erie Insurance Exchange (\u201cErie Insurance\u201d). The case was then removed to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. But that court, upon determining that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the matter, remanded this case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The Baltimore County circuit court ultimately granted Progressive\u2019s motion for summary judgment, eliminating it from the case. Sometime after that, appellants, upon reaching a settlement with Erie Insurance, dismissed it from the case and then noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In response, Progressive moved to dismiss this appeal, asserting that appellants had filed their notice of appeal more than thirty days after Erie\u2019s dismissal and that, therefore, their appeal was time-barred under Maryland Rule 8-202(a), which requires that a notice of appeal be filed within thirty days \u201cafter entry of the judgment.\u201d We denied that motion without prejudice and with leave for Progressive to raise this issue in its brief. As Progressive has done so, we now grant that motion and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">On August 17, 2006, Deborah Hiob was driving her 2005 Toyota Corolla westbound on Liberty Road (Maryland Route 26) in Baltimore County. She had three passengers in her car: her mother-in-law, Virginia Hiob, as well as Margaret Nelson and Laura Dusome. At that moment, a truck driven by Raymond Bert Strigle was traveling in the opposite direction on Liberty Road. At some point, Strigle\u2019s truck veered across the center line of the road and collided head-on with Hiob\u2019s vehicle. All four occupants of Hiob\u2019s vehicle sustained serious injuries, and, within the next two months, Virginia Hiob and Laura Dusome died from their injuries. The damages sustained by the four occupants of the Hiob vehicle exceeded the total amount of all available insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>On the date of the accident, Strigle owned an automobile insurance policy issued by State Auto Insurance Company (\u201cState Auto\u201d), with \u201csplit limits\u201d of liability coverage of $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident. State Auto settled with the Hiob vehicle\u2019s occupants, paying the full $300,000 per accident policy limit, divided among them by mutual agreement, in exchange for waivers by all parties and their insurers of their rights of subrogation against Strigle. As a consequence, neither State Auto nor Strigle has ever been named as a party to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">Margaret Nelson, a survivor of the accident, owned an automobile insurance policy issued by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cNationwide\u201d). Nationwide waived its rights of subrogation and paid $50,000 to Ms. Nelson under the terms of her uninsured motorists\u2019 coverage. As a result, it, too, is not a party to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Virginia Hiob, who died after the accident, owned an automobile insurance policy issued by Erie Insurance. Although initially a party in this case, Erie Insurance eventually settled with Virginia Hiob\u2019s estate and is not a party to this appeal. The date that Erie Insurance was dismissed from the case plays, as we shall see, a central role in our disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Finally, at the time of the accident, Deborah Hiob and her husband, Douglas Hiob, owned an automobile insurance policy issued by Progressive, providing \u201csplit limits\u201d of uninsured motorists\u2019 coverage of $250,000 per person/$500,000 per accident. Each of the injured occupants of the Hiob vehicle, as well as the estates of the two occupants who had died as a result of the accident, filed claims against Progressive under the uninsured motorists\u2019 provision of that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">In response to those claims, Progressive asserted that the policy at issue only required it to pay an aggregate of $150,000; that is, the difference between the $500,000 per accident limit and the $350,000 already paid to appellants under other insurance policies. Appellants disagreed, contending that, because the policy stated that the per accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>limit was \u201csubject to\u201d the per person limit, the per person limit should control and that, therefore, Progressive was liable for amounts to each of the injured parties up to the respective $250,000 per person limits, so long as its aggregate payments did not exceed $500,000. Therefore, according to appellants, Progressive\u2019s refusal to pay more than $150,000 in total was in violation of that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">In any event, because appellants and Progressive agreed that Progressive was hable for at least $150,000, Progressive paid that amount to appellants, dividing it among them as agreed. Then, seeking a resolution of their claim to the remainder of the funds purportedly owed under the uninsured motorists\u2019 provision, appellants filed a declaratory judgment action in the Baltimore County circuit court. Cross motions for summary judgment eventually<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">On September 23, 2009, the circuit court granted Progressive\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied appellants\u2019. A written order, setting forth that disposition, was docketed on October 7, 2009. The order declared that \u201cProgressive\u2019s aggregate policy limit for the uninsured/underinsured motorist claims\u201d was \u201c$150,000.00, representing its $500,000.00 per accident limit, less the total amount of other insurance coverage available and paid to [appellants], $350,000.00\u201d; and that, having paid, as agreed by the parties, a total of $150,000 to appellants, Progressive had \u201cpaid its policy limit to\u201d appellants, and there was \u201cno additional uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage available to [appellants] under the Progressive policy.\u201d As of the date the order was docketed, the case remained open because Erie Insurance was still a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The docket reflects no further activity for more than a year. Meanwhile, as noted earlier, appellants and Erie Insurance had agreed to a settlement. Appellants thereafter filed a line voluntarily dismissing Erie Insurance from the case \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d That dismissal was entered on the docket on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>January 10, 2011. On that same day, appellants filed a motion to reduce the order of October 7, 2009, to final judgment. Then, more than thirty days later, on February 15, 2011, appellants filed a notice of appeal. Ten days after that, on February 25, 2011, the Baltimore County circuit court granted appellants\u2019 motion to reduce the order of October 7, 2009, to final judgment. The February 25 docket entry states: \u201cfinal judgment is entered on this 8th day of Feb. 2011 and the earlier findings <em>&amp; </em>rulings ... set out in [the] order dated 9/23/09/filed Oct 7, 2009 are incorporated into this final judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Relying on Maryland Rule 2-601, which governs entry of judgments, Progressive maintains that the voluntary dismissal of Erie Insurance by appellants, as a party to this matter, on January 10, 2011, effectively rendered the October 7, 2009 order a final judgment and set the clock ticking for noting an appeal. Then, invoking Rule 8-202(a), which requires that a \u201cnotice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken,\u201d Progressive contends that appellants were required to file the notice of appeal within thirty days of January 10, 2011, or, in other words, no later than February 9, 2011. Because the notice of appeal was filed six days after that date, Progressive asserts that their appeal was untimely and should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Appellants respond that, because the docket below shows that final judgment was \u201centered on this 8th day of Feb. 2011 and the earlier findings &amp; rulings ... set out in [the] order dated 9/23/09/filed Oct. 7, 2009 [were] incorporated into this final judgment,\u201d a \u201creasonable application\u201d of Rule 8-202 leads to the conclusion that the Baltimore County circuit court \u201ctreated February 8, 2011 as the date of entry of final judgment in this case,\u201d and so should we.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The grant of appellants\u2019 motion to reduce the October 7, 2009 order to final judgment is, in our view, inconsequential. Once Erie Insurance was dismissed from the case, there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>no more defendants or claims before the circuit court in this matter. Thus, final judgment, as Progressive maintains, was entered in this case on January 10, 2011, when the clerk of the circuit court entered appellants\u2019 voluntary dismissal of Erie Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">We reach this conclusion based on <em>Houghton v. County Commissioners of Kent County, </em>305 Md. 407, 504 A.2d 1145 (1986), which was decided under a previous version of Maryland Rule 2-601, and <em>Houghton\u2019s </em>progeny, which were decided under a later version of that rule. We begin with <em>Houghton </em>where, under similar procedural circumstances, the Court of Appeals reached the same result as we do here.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">In that 1986 case, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss counts I and III of a three-count complaint, and, thereafter, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed, with prejudice, count II. Both actions were entered on the docket, but neither was designated as a \u201cjudgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410, 504 A.2d 1145. Then, roughly three months later, the circuit court ordered that a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as to counts I and III be entered on the docket, and, the following day, the plaintiffs noted an appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 411, 504 A.2d 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">At that time, Maryland Rule 2-601 (\u201cEntry of judgment\u201d) (1984)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-7\">(a) When entered. Upon a general verdict of a jury or upon a decision by the court allowing recovery only of a sum certain or costs or denying all relief, the clerk shall forth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>with enter the judgment, unless the court orders otherwise. Upon a special verdict of a jury or upon a decision by the court granting other relief, the court shall promptly approve the form of the judgment, and the clerk shall then enter it. (b) Method of entry\u2014Date of judgment. The clerk shall enter a judgment by making a record of it in writing on the file jacket, or on a docket within the file, or in a docket book, according to the practice of each court, and shall record the actual date of the entry. That date shall be the date of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">As the Court of Appeals observed, the initial order granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss counts I and III of the complaint, as well as the subsequent voluntary dismissal of the only remaining count, \u201cwere entered on the docket as required by Rule 2-601(b),\u201d and, because \u201c[njothing in Rule 2-601 ... requires that the word \u2018judgment\u2019 always be used as a prerequisite to finality,\u201d the absence of that term from the two orders did not prevent the Court from concluding that they, together, \u201cconstituted the final judgment of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Houghton, </em>305 Md. at 412-13, 504 A.2d 1145. Consequently, the Court dismissed the appeal, finding that it had been filed more than thirty days after the entry of judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 413, 504 A.2d 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">In concluding our discussion of that case, we pause briefly to note that, when <em>Houghton </em>was decided, Maryland Rule 2-601(b) was identical to the current version of section (b) of the rule. In fact, the principal difference between the current rule and the version of the rule then in effect is the amendment to section (a) of the rule which occurred in 1997. That amendment incorporated the \u201cseparate document\u201d requirement, the effect of which was \u201cto convert the official form of a judgment from a docket entry to a separate document.\u201d <em>Byrum v. Homing, </em>360 Md. 23, 33, 756 A.2d 560 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Prior to the adoption of that amendment, there had been concern expressed that, under the then extant version of the rule, attorneys may \u201cbe trapped because they do not know the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>exact date of the judgment, and they may lose an appeal.\u201d Minutes, Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Oct. 8, 1993, at 11 (available at http:// mdcourts.gov/lawlib/collections/digitalcollections.html) (last visited May 24, 2013). An example of the confusion wrought by the rule was outlined in <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>335 Md. 699, 646 A.2d 365 (1994), where a circuit court orally announced the judgment of the court, and the clerk thereafter entered that oral judgment on the docket, only to have the same court later issue an order memorializing that judgment, which was also entered on the docket. <em>Id. </em>at 704-05, 646 A.2d 365. In that case, the Court of Appeals held, under the pre-1997 version of Rule 2-601(a), that the earlier oral judgment, once docketed by the clerk, became a final judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 709-17, 646 A.2d 365. As a consequence, the appellant in that case lost his right to appeal from that judgment, as he did not note an appeal until more than thirty days after entry of judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 717-18, 646 A.2d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">To help eliminate the confusion and uncertainty generated by the pre-1997 rule, the \u201cseparate document\u201d requirement, patterned after Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58, was adopted. Reporter\u2019s Note to Proposed Rule 2-601, 23 Md. Reg., Issue 24, Fri., Nov. 22, 1996, at 1667; Rules Order, 24 Md. Reg., Issue 9, Fri., Apr. 25,1997, at 649-50. As amended, section (a) now<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-5\">(a) Prompt entry\u2014Separate document. Each judgment shall be set forth on a separate document. Upon a verdict of a jury or a decision by the court allowing recovery only of costs or a specified amount of money or denying all relief, the clerk shall forthwith prepare, sign, and enter the judgment, unless the court orders otherwise. Upon a verdict of a jury or a decision by the court granting other relief, the court shall promptly review the form of the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>presented and, if approved, sign it, and the clerk shall forthwith enter the judgment as approved and signed. A judgment is effective only when so set forth and when entered as provided in section (b) of this Rule. Unless the court orders otherwise, entry of the judgment shall not be delayed pending determination of the amount of costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">In light of that amendment to the rule, the question naturally arises whether <em>Houghton </em>is still \u201cgood law.\u201d A popular treatise on Maryland civil procedure seems to suggest that it is not. Paul V. Niemeyer <em>&amp; </em>Linda M. Schuett, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary </em>488-89 (3d ed.2003). That treatise describes a sequence of procedural events similar to that which took place here, a sequence which it terms a \u201c\u2018springing\u2019 finality\u201d\u2014that is, when there is a non-final order disposing of only some claims (or of all of the claims, but of fewer than all of the parties), followed by a subsequent order, perhaps \u201cmonths or even years later,\u201d disposing of all remaining claims and parties, thereby resulting in a final judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 488, 504 A.2d 1145. It then asserts: \u201cThis \u2018springing\u2019 finality trap is substantially eliminated with the requirement adopted in 1997 that the judgment be embodied in a separate document. This is because the rule contemplates that <em>(me </em>document is to embody the entire judgment and therefore that the appeal period runs from the entry of that document on the docket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488-89, 504 A.2d 1145 (emphasis in original). But neither the \u201clegislative history\u201d of Rule 2-601 nor subsequent caselaw supports this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">When the amendment to Rule 2-601(a) was being considered by the Rules Committee, one of the Committee members, Melvin J. Sykes, Esquire, \u201casked how piecemeal judgments [would] be handled under the modified Rule,\u201d noting that, under the then-existing rule, \u201cwhen a party [was] dismissed at some point in the case, the dismissal [was] entered on the docket.\u201d Draft Minutes, Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, May 17, 1996, at 4 (on file at Rules Committee). Another Committee member, Lowell R. Bowen, Esquire, replied that, under the proposed amendment, the entry of that dismissal \u201cwould be [on] a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>separate document\u201d and that the docket would contain \u201ca notation\u201d to that effect \u201cand the date of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He further \u201cexplained that the docket entry is a warning that a judgment has been entered, so someone can go to the file to read it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. It thus appears that, under the amended rule, the only difference as to \u201cpiecemeal judgments\u201d was that they would have to be in the form of a separate document.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">That view has been confirmed by subsequent decisions of the Court of Appeals, rendered after the adoption of the \u201cseparate document\u201d requirement, and thus, <em>Houghton </em>remains viable. <em>See, e.g., Miller &amp; Smith at Quercus, LLC v. Casey PMN, LLC, </em>412 Md. 230, 243-44, 987 A.2d 1 (2010) (discussing <em>Houghton </em>favorably); <em>Tierco Md., Inc. v. Williams, </em>381 Md. 378, 393, 849 A.2d 504 (2004) (observing that \u201cfinal judgment would have been completed ... with the entry of a written final order disposing of\u2019 claims of sole remaining plaintiff); <em>Byrum v. Homing, supra, </em>360 Md. 23, 756 A.2d 560. We shall consider one of those cases, <em>Bymm, </em>in greater detail, as it illustrates how \u201cpiecemeal judgments\u201d should be analyzed under the amended version of Rule 2-601.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\"><em>Byrum, </em>a case in which the Court granted certiorari for the express purpose of addressing the effects of the 1997 amendment, 360 Md. at 24, 756 A.2d 560, involved a dispute over the use of a right-of-way between Barney L. and Elizabeth By-rum, and Rodney C. and Barbara L. Horning and Jack W. Harvey. <em>Id. </em>at 27, 756 A.2d 560. There were two separate actions: one of those actions, No. 94-10601, was a claim by the Byrums against the Hornings and Harvey; the other, No. 93-10121, was a claim by the Hornings seeking \u201cto enjoin the Byrums from blocking the disputed right-of-way.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The two cases were consolidated, and, when they were tried by the circuit court on July 15, 1999, the Byrums did not appear, and the court granted judgment in favor of the Hornings and Harvey. <em>Id. </em>at 28, 756 A.2d 560. Although \u201c[t]hat same day,\u201d the court clerk \u201cgenerated entries into the computer-maintained docket of the circuit court\u201d reflecting that disposition, \u201c[n]o separate document setting forth the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>judgment or judgments signed by the clerk (or by the judge) was filed in the court file on that date.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Instead, a separate, undated document, noting the entry of judgment, in case No. 94-10601 (the claim by the Byrums against the Hornings and Harvey), in favor of Harvey but omitting any mention of the Hornings, was signed by the trial court and thereafter was \u201cfiled by the clerk on August 6, 1999, and entered into the computerized docket on August 9, 1999.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus, per Rule 2-601(a) judgment was entered in Harvey\u2019s favor on the Byrums\u2019 claim against him, and, under Rule 2-601(b), the date of that judgment was August 9, 1999,\u201d explained the Court. <em>Id. </em>at 28-29, 756 A.2d 560. But, noted the Court, there was \u201cno final judgment in action No. 94-10601 at that time, because no judgment had been entered on the claim of the Byrums against the Hornings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 756 A.2d 560 (citing Md. Rule 2-602(a)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Then, another undated document in the same case (No. 94-10601) was also signed by the trial court, noting the entry of judgment in favor of the Hornings. \u201cThis separate document was filed in the court file on August 13, 1999, and entered into the computerized docket on August 16, 1999.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 756 A.2d 560. The Court of Appeals held: \u201cAll claims in No. 94-10601 having been adjudicated, the judgment entered on August 16, 1999, constituted final judgment in that action,\u201d and, \u201c[cjonsequently, the thirty day period within which to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals is calculated from August 16,1999.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Thus, in a decision where the Court of Appeals expressly addressed the \u201cseparate document\u201d requirement, it held that a case could be disposed of piecemeal, by the successive docketing of judgments, none of which were of a final nature (as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>none of them, individually, adjudicated all of the claims as to all of the parties), so long as each judgment was entered in a manner that complied with Rule 2-601, and that finality ultimately attaches when the last such judgment is docketed. In short, the \u201cseparate document\u201d requirement has no effect on the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Houghton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Turning to the instant case, we observe that the order granting Progressive\u2019s motion for summary judgment was memorialized in a separate document, as required under Rule 2-601 (a); was signed by the trial judge; and was docketed on October 7, 2009, as required under Rule 2\u2014601(b). That order, moreover, met the requirements of a declaratory judgment with respect to all of the parties except Erie Insurance (which was subsequently dismissed). <em>See, e.g., Union United Methodist Church, Inc. v. Burton, </em>404 Md. 542, 552, 948 A.2d 1 (2008) (observing that <em>\u201c[w ]hen entering a declaratory judgment, the court must, in a separate document, state in muting its declaration of the rights of the parties </em>\u201d) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The line of dismissal was entered on January 10, 2011. As required by Rule 2-506(a)(2),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that line of dismissal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>\u201csigned by all parties to the claim being dismissed\u201d and, thus, was properly entered \u201cwithout leave of court.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[t]he dismissal of [appellants\u2019] claims\u201d against Erie \u201cwas a judgment governed by Rule 2-601.\u201d <em>Tierco Md., Inc. v. Williams, supra, </em>381 Md. at 393, 849 A.2d 504. To determine whether the dismissal complied with Rule 2-601, we look to <em>Tierco, </em>where the Court of Appeals explained how Rule 2-601 applies to a dismissal of a claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-4\">According to Rule 2-601, each dismissal must be memorialized by a document in the case file. The word \u201cjudgment\u201d need not appear on the document. Nor is the judge necessarily required to sign an order of voluntary dismissal, which is a judgment that denies all relief. The document need only put litigants and the public on notice that the claim has been resolved. It must also be docketed, entered, and recorded by the clerk. These steps ensure that litigants, third parties, and the public have access to the disposition of every civil claim brought in Maryland\u2019s circuit courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 394, 849 A.2d 504 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Although the word \u201cjudgment\u201d does not appear on the line of dismissal in this case, and the judge did not sign it, neither of those is required. <em>Id. </em>The line of dismissal does, nonetheless, \u201cput litigants and the public on notice that the claim has been resolved\u201d and was, as required by rule, \u201cdocketed, entered, and recorded by the clerk.\u201d <em>Id. We </em>conclude that the line of dismissal complied with the requirements of Rules 2-506 and 2-601.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Consequently, the instant case is procedurally indistinguishable from <em>Houghton. We </em>therefore hold that the docketing of appellants\u2019 dismissal of Erie Insurance, on January 10, 2011, together with the October 2009 entry of summary judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>favor of Progressive, \u201cconstituted the final judgment of the circuit court,\u201d 305 Md. at 413, 504 A.2d 1145, and that the date of that judgment was January 10, 2011, the date the suit ended with the dismissal of Erie. Thus, a straightforward application of Rule 8-202(a) compels us to conclude that the instant notice of appeal was untimely. Moreover, because adherence to the time limit for filing a notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement, <em>see, e.g., Houghton, </em>305 Md. at 413, 504 A.2d 1145; <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Regency Furniture, Inc., </em>183 Md.App. 710, 740-41, 963 A.2d 253 (2009), appellants\u2019 failure to file their notice of appeal within thirty days of January 10, 2011 mandates the dismissal of their appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-7\">. Because the case was removed to federal court and then remanded to state court, the first summary judgment motion was not filed until more than fifteen months after the case was originally filed in state court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-8\">. When <em>Houghton </em>was decided, on February 25, 1986, the version of the rule then in effect was the same as that enacted in 1984, as part of the comprehensive rules revision. Since then, the following amendments have been enacted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-9\">1. Effective July 1, 1986. In section (a), substituted \"costs or a specified amount of money\" for \u201ca sum certain or costs\u201d in the first sentence, rewrote the second sentence, and added the third sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-10\">2. Effective October 1, 1997 (the amendment we are focused on in this opinion).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-11\">3. Effective January 1, 2002. Deleted \"general\u201d preceding \"verdict\u201d and deleted \"upon\u201d preceding \"a decision\u201d in the second and third sentences of (a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-12\">4. Effective January 1, 2004. Changed the Source note reference.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b786-6\">. Since 1997, there have been two minor revisions to Rule 2-601: one amendment, effective January 1, 2002, deleted the words \"general\u201d preceding verdict and \"upon\u201d preceding \"a decision\u201d in the second and third sentences of section (a); the other amendment, effective January 1, 2004, changed the Source note reference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b789-7\">. Maryland Rule 2-602(a) provides that, with exceptions not relevant here, \u201can order or other form of decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all of the claims in an action (whether raised by original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim), or that adjudicates less than an entire claim, or that adjudicates the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties to the action ... is not a final judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\">. Maryland Rule 2-506 (\"Voluntary dismissal\u201d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-7\">(a) By Notice of Dismissal or Stipulation. Except as otherwise provided in these rules or by statute, a party who has filed a complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim may dismiss all or part of the claim without leave of court by filing (1) a notice of dismissal at any time before the adverse party files an answer or (2) a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties to the claim being dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-8\">(b) By Order of Court. Except as provided in section (a) of this Rule, a party who has filed a complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim may dismiss the claim only by order of court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. If a counterclaim has been filed before the filing of a plaintiffs motion for voluntary dismissal, the action shall not be dismissed over the objection of the party who filed the counterclaim unless the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-9\">(c) Effect. Unless otherwise specified in the notice of dismissal, stipulation, or order of court, a dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a party who has previously dismissed in any court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>any state or in any court of the United States an action based on or including the same claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS-C\">(d) Costs. Unless otherwise provided by stipulation or order of court, the dismissing party is responsible for all costs of the action or the part dismissed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
