Prior to the laws of I860, a married woman could not carry on business and bind herself. This transaction took place in 1856.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-12\">This case is, therefore, to be examined on the law as it existed prior to 1860.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-13\">Was the purchase of this property by Mrs. Powers, and the assumption of the mortgage in question, for the benefit of her separate estate at the time of the purchase?</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-14\">It was, or was not, a valid contract at that time. It c\u00f3\u00fald not be one or the other, depending on what she subsequently got for the property. (2 <em>Esp. </em>472 ; 1 <em>Salbe. </em>386.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-15\">It does not appear that she had any separate estate at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>time of this transaction to be benefited. If by this purchase she acquired a separate estate, then the estate so acquired is the only estate to be charged. <em>(Ballin and others </em>agt. <em>Dillaye, </em>37 <em>N. Y.

It was not a present debt, but a contingent liability in the nature of security for the mortgage, which require express words to charge it upon her \u2018estate. <em>(Yale </em>agt. <em>Dederer, </em>18 <em>N. </em>Y. <em>R. </em>265; <em>Id. </em>22 <em>N.

R. </em>371), the court hold that it must appear that the contract was for the benefit of her separate estate, and that the guarantee of a mortgage which a married woman had taken on the sale. of her real estate was not binding on her, because it appeared ; that her husband received the proceeds of such mortgage.. Had she received the money, it is difficult to conceive how her guarantee would benefit her separate estate, unless it . was proved that she obtained a better price for the mortgage on account of the guarantee.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>- In order to show that it was for the benefit of her separate estate, the plaintiffs should have proved and the court found that the property was worth mo're than she paid at the time she bought it. If it was worth exactly what she paid, or less, how was her separate estate benefited?</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-5\">II. At the time the defendant bought this property and assumed to pay this mortgage, and at the time she sold the property to J. Brouwer, she was an infant under the age of twenty-one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-6\">A suit for a foreclosure of this mortgage was commenced and a summons and notice of the object of the action served on the defendant after she became of age.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">The court holds that the fact that she appeared in that suit by an attorney-and raised no question of infancy, was a ratification or affirmance of the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-8\">We submit this is not an affirmance of the contract. No act was done by the defendant showing any intention to affirm the contract, nor anything from which a new promise to pay the debt could be inferred (assuming it to be an existing indebtedness). <em>(Goodsell agt. Myers, 3 Wend. </em>479; <em>Hodges agt. Hunt, 22 Barb. </em>151; <em>Voorhies agt.

It was a contingent liability depending upon what the property sold for. It was time enough to disaffirm it when any claim was made under it. An appearance by attorney in that suit would,it seems to us, repel the idea of an affirmance by her, rather that confirm it. Certainly, when she was served with a notice that no personal claim was-made against her, she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>.not called upon to object nor raise any question of infancy. Had she done so, she would have been charged with costs. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 131.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-5\">She had disposed of the property to Brouwer <em>before . she became of age; </em>therefore that was no affirmance. <em>(Story on Contracts, </em>\u00a7 68; 20 <em>American Jurist, </em>267; 1 <em>Parsons on Contracts, </em>267.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-6\">In the case of <em>Lynde </em>agt. <em>Budd, </em>the infant conveyed the property with warranty <em>after she became of age. </em>In the case of <em>Henry </em>agt. <em>Root </em>(33 <em>N. Y. R.), </em>the same doctrine was affirmed on the same facts, and the question of what constitutes an affirmance fully discussed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-7\">in. The court holds in this case that, before-the defendant .can sustain the defense of infancy she must restore what she has received.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-8\">This is undoubtedly so where an <em>adult </em>seeks in equity to .set aside a contract made during his minority upon .which he has received payments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-9\">The court say in such a case to the party coming into a court of equity, your contract is voidable, but where you ask for affirmative relief, to have your property restored to you, you must also restore what you received for your property. <em>(Story on Contracts, </em>\u00a7 63.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-10\">But we submit this is not so in an action at law by one who has taken an infant\u2019s contract by assignment, to recover on the contract, so assigned after the infant becomes of age.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-11\">The defense of infancy is a strict legal defense. It is not incumbent on the defendant when she puts in a defense of infancy to first restore the consideration. Infancy is a perfect and complete defense. (1 <em>Parsons on Contracts, </em>267, 268, <em>and </em>note; <em>Story on Contracts, \u00a7 </em>60.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-12\">Suppose.she had given her note for the price of this property instead of assuming to pay the mortgage, and before she became of age had sold the property and spent the money. Can it be said that she could not interpose a defense of infancy until she had restored the Consideration of the note ? Sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>pose the note had changed a dozen times, who is it to be restored to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-5\">We submit that no case can be found where the defense of infancy, in an action at law, has been made to .depend upon a restoration of the consideration of the contract sued on. <em>(Shaw </em>agt. <em>Boyd, </em>5 <em>Serg. &amp; </em>Rawle, 309.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-6\">In a case like the present where the property had been disposed of by the infant before she became of age, the seller has no remedy. <em>(Story on Contracts, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 60 <em>and </em>62; <em>Amer</em>i<em>can Jurist, Vol. </em>20, 260; 1 <em>Parsons on Contracts, </em>267.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-7\">IV.

It was therefore a direct benefit to her separate estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-7\">(3.) In <em>Ballin </em>agt. <em>Dillaye (supra), </em>the judge says ;</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-8\">\u201cFor how can it be said that a debt contracted upon the \u201c purchase of property which purchaser takes into possession, \u201c and enjoys and disposes of, is not a debt contracted for the- \u201c benefit of the purchaser\u2019s estate, and her separate estate as \u201c a whole becomes liable for any indebtedness contracted by \u201cher for its benefit to any extent.\u201d Also, see case decided in this 2d district before Judges Brown, Lott and Schrugham.

If there had been a surplus upon the foreclosure sale, the defendant\u2019s grantee would have been entitled to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">If she then had repudiated her purchaase of Walsh and her sale to Brouwer, all parties were before the court and Walsh could have been protected. By her suffering the foreclosure complaint to be taken as confessed by her, she determined that the act done by her in infancy should stand,; she and Brouwer were made defendants, as grantees subsequently to Whitehead\u2019s mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>It is too late after she takes her chance for the surplus or permits her grantee to have a right to the surplus, as if the conveyances were good, to set up this defense of infancy to escape deficiency. The judgment should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b303-5\">Lott, P. J., <em>dissenting.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A3c\">The learned judge who tried this action without a jury has found as a fact, that the defendant was an infant at the time she received the deed containing the assumption and agreement on her part to pay the amount secured by the mortgage in question, and that she had not attained full age at the time of the conveyance subsequently executed and delivered by her to John Brouwer of the property covered by the mortgage, and referred to in his findings of fact. That conveyance can consequently not operate as an affirmance or satisfaction of the original assumption and agreement, and I do not find any promise, declaration or acts by her after she became of fnll age, by which she agreed to ratify that contract or which in any manner, import a recognation or confirmation of it. The naked fact found by the judge that she was made a party to the action for the foreclosure of the mortgage and appeared, therein by her attorney, that a sale was under the judgment therein for a price insufficient to pay the amount due thereon, and that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor subsequently paid the deficiency or balance that remained due in pursuance of the direction and requirement of that judgment is not sufficient. It does not appear that any answer was put in for her or that any act whatever except such appearance was done by her or her attorney in the action; nor is it found that the fact of such assumption or agreement \"was alleged in the complaint; and as the liability of her grantor to satisfy and discharge the deficiency arose out of his personal obligation to pay the mortgage, there was no necessitiy of setting out any of the contents of the deed made by him to her, and it will not be assumed that they were. There was therefore not even an admission by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>defendant, assuming that she suffered judgment to pass by default, of the execution and delivery of that deed to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Under such circumstances the defendant was not legally liable on her promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The judgment against her must therefore be reversed and a new trial is ordered. Costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
