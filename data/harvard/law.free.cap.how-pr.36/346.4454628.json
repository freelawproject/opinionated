All the witnesses agree that two cents per week was the highest price for the best pasture.

The justice erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s objection to the question put to the witness Healy, viz: \u201cDid Mr. White state to him what he charged him for sheep pasture per head per week, or what aggregate for the sheep pasture when pastured at his place?\u201d and \u201cstate the conversation between you and Mr, White with regard to the pasturing the sheep at his place, relative to the price at the time of taking them away?\u201d This evidence was wholly immaterial, having no reference to the contract in question, but relating to a subsequent contract with another party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-8\">\u201c The admission of irrelevant evidence is good ground for a n\u00e9w trial, as it is impossible to say what influence the evidence may have exerted on the minds of the jury.\u201d <em>(Dresser </em>agt. Ainsworth, 9 <em>Barb. </em>619; <em>Clark </em>agt. Vorce, 19 <em>Wend. </em>232; <em>Boylan </em>agt.

The justice erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s objection to the following question put to the witness William White, viz: \u201cDid you understand from Faucett the price per head per week that the defendant was to pay Faucett <em>&amp; </em>White?\u201d The answer to this question, viz: \u201cI did. He</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-10\">reported to me 240 wethers at 2J cents per head per week,\u201d \u2019 was irrelevant and was incompetent as being clearly hearsay evidence. The report of Faucett was but the declaration of a third person, not a party. The credibility of the respective parties as witnesses became a very material question. This evidence was used on the trial to discredit Healy, by contradicting his statement that he never paid over two cents per head.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>In <em>Worrell </em>agt. <em>Parmlee </em>(1 <em>Coms. 521), </em>in reviewing a judgment of a justice, Mr. Justice Jewett uses this language, viz: \u201c Where error is in the admission of illegal evidence which bears in the least degree on the question at issue, it cannot be disregarded.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-6\">In <em>Bort </em>agt. <em>Smith (5 Barb. 285), </em>Mr. Justice Pratt uses this language, viz : \u201c The true rule, we apprehend, is this: when the fact in dispute is so clearly proved by competent testimony that the county court would have been legally bound had no improper testimony been admitted, to reverse a judgment adverse to such proof, then ,a j\u00fadgment in accordance with such proof ought not to be reversed, although improper testimony may have been admitted.\u201d If that testimony had been excluded, would a judgment have been reversed if the jury had by their verdict found the price to be two cents instead of three cents per week <em>% </em>Clearly not. The judgment would not have been reversed if the judgment had been wholly in favor of the defendant instead of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-8\">III. The justice erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s objection to the following question put to the witness White, viz: \u201cHow many more sheep did defendant report than Faucett, and how much more time than defendant 1\u201d This was offered evidently to contradict Healy by the statements of Faucett as to the time, as tending to show that the sheep were at plaintiff\u2019s pasture for a longer time than he admitted. That evidence was hearsay and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-10\">IY. The judgment is against evidence and excessive. 1. The testimony of plaintiff that not over a week or ten days after the sheep were taken to pasture that he should charge three cents, with no proof that the defendant agreed to it, was insufficient to establish a contract as to price. The minds of the parties did not meet. He could only recover on a \u201c <em>quantum </em>meruit.\u201d Hone of the witnesses placed the value over two cents per week for the best of pasture protected by sufficient fences. The evidence is that the pasture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>in which the 261 sheep were kept was only sufficient for 75 sheep for the time. This is not contradicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-5\">The evidence of Thomas Reynoldson, the agent of defendant, establishes a warranty that the pasture was enough for $500 sheep, and was enclosed by a sufficient fence. It is true that Battin first testified, <em>\u201c </em>No man ever called on me-in regard to the pasturing for defendant,\u201d and that he never had any acquaintance with defendant until that day on Lem-, on\u2019s stoop. But after Reynoldson was sworn the plaintiff admitted that he did come to his house, and inquired about the pasture,.and that he knew from Reynoldson\u2019s statements that he had been in defendant\u2019s employ; but he does not deny the representations sworn to by Reynoldson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-6\">\u25a0That the defendant sustained damages to a large amount by reason of p itting 261 sheep in a pasture only sufficient for 75 for the time, is established beyond contradiction. The sheep lost flesh instead of gaining as they should, and were scattered, and a portion of them lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-7\">Manifest injustice has been done the defendant, and the judgment of the county court and of the justice should be reversed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-8\">D. H. Holliday, <em>for respondent.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-9\">This action.was brought before justice, to recover for the price of pasturing sheep. Judgment given for plaintiff. Defendant appealed to county court, and there the judgment affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-10\">I. The plaintiff only sought to recover on the contract price, three cents per week, and gave no evidence whatever on the value of the keeping. The issue was as to whether defendant made a bargain to pay three cents per week, and the jury found that he did. The questions asked the witness White, and objected to by defendant, are wholly immaterial, and had no bearing on that issue, and could not affect it, one way or the other. What defendant had paid or agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>pay others, was not in any way connected with, nor could it in anywise affect, the contract between the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-5\">II. It is a familiar principle, that when there is abundant evidence to sustain the finding, the giving of irrelevant testimony which might have a bearing, will be disregarded. But in this case the testimony given, though irrelevant, is remote from, and did not directly or indirectly affect the issue. This was the view taken by the county court, and on this ground that court very properly affirmed the the judgment.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b354-6\"><em>By the court, </em>Davis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIs\">This action was brought upon an alleged contract for the pasturing of 260 sheep at \u201c three cents per head per week.\u201d The' plaintiff gave evidence tending to prove the alleged agreement as to the price, the substance of which was that a few days after the sheep were turned into the pasture, he saw the defendant and told him that he should charge him three cents, per head per week, that defendant said : \u2018\u2018It is a big price and run one\u2019s own risk.\u201d To which plaintiff answered that they seemed to be all large sheep, and defendant then turned and went into the store (on the steps of which the parties were standing), and nothing more was said about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">As the sheep were kept subsequently to this conversation for several weeks in the plaintiff\u2019s pasture, it follows, that if the jury believed plaintiff\u2019s statement of this conversation, they would be justified in finding the alleged special agreement as to price, because by continuing to keep his sheep in plaintiff\u2019s pasture, the defendant\u2019s assent to the terms might be inferred as to price. The defendant denied having the conversation as to price, as stated by plaintiff, and gave evidence to show that the pasturing was worth much less than three cents per head. On his cross-examination stated in substance, that he never had paid over two cents per head; that the sheep were taken from plaintiff\u2019s pasture to a\"farm owned by one White and occupied by one Faucett, where they were kept several weeks, and that he paid White <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>two cents per head per week; and he was asked several questions relative to what White stated as to his charge for pasturage, which elicited nothing of any moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The question whether the sheep were pastured at the agreed price of three cents per head or not, depended almost wholly, if not altogether, on which of the parties to the suit the jury believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">After the \u2018defendant rested his case, the plaintiff called William W. White, who testified to the pasturing of 240 of the sheep on his farm occupied by Faucett, late in the season, and that he and Faucett were partners in the pasturage. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then put to him the following question : \u201cDid you understand from Faucett the price per head per week that defendant was to pay Faucett and White?\u201d Objected to as being irrelevant and hearsay; objection overruled. Answer. I did. He replied to me, 240 wethers at 2J cents per head per week, and the time which I took from my books. Defendant reports more sheep and less time than Faucett in his bill to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Q. How many more sheep did defendant report than Faucett, and how much more time than defendant. Objected to same as before, and same ruling.' He reported 14 more sheep, and Faucett six day\u2019s more time than defendant did.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">This testimony was clearly irrelevant and immaterial upon the question of the contract, and for that reason the county court has regarded it as an error that could have worked no injury. But the court overlooked the fact that a collateral issue of credibility was raised in the case,\u201cbetween the plaintiff and defendant, and that the determination of the main issue depended upon which of the parties was believed by the jury. For the purpose of impairing the credit of defendant, the statements which he had made on his cross-examination were allowed to be contradicted, not by the testimony of Faucett, but by his statements to his partner White. The testimony which, was given on that point, was mere hearsay, for he knew nothing of any arrangement as to the price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>of pasturing defendant was to pay, except what Faucett stated, nor as to any discrepancy between defendant and Faucett as to the account for that pasturage. Yet Faucett\u2019s statement which tended to contradict defendant\u2019s oath, was laid before the jury under a ruling of the court, and it isimpossible to say that the\u2019 contradiction between defendant and Faucett thus improperly proved, may not have turned the scale in the conflict of credibility between plaintiff and defendant. I think the admission of the answers of White to the questions objected to was an error which cannot be be overlooked; and that the judgments below must, therefore be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
