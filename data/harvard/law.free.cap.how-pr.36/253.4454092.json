And also on the ground that the affidavit for attachment upon which the same was granted, filed in the clerk\u2019s office of this court does not show facts sufficient to establish that the defendant was about to fraudulently remove and dispose of his property with intent to cheat or defraud his creditors or any other ground for an-attachment, and why such other or further relief should not be granted to the defendant as to the court shall seem proper, besides the costs of this motion ; and in the meantime and until the hearing and determination of this motion, let the plaintiff be stayed from entering judgment in this action, and from further proceedings under the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">December 4, 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">JOHN H.
