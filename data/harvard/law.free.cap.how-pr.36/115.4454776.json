(1 <em>Burrill's Prac. </em>39.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-15\">The institution of the appeal was in effect a new action. <em>(Pratt </em>agt. <em>Allen. 19 How. </em>456; <em>McLaren agt. Charrier, </em>5 <em>Paige, </em>530; <em>Tendal </em>agt. <em>Jones, </em>11 <em>Abb. </em>259 ; <em>Gormby </em>agt. <em>McIntosh, </em>22 <em>Barb. </em>273; <em>Fenno </em>agt. <em>Dickinson, </em>4 <em>Denio, </em>85.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-16\">\u25a0 <em>Second. </em>The attachment is a provisional remedy, and is given, in order that the plaintiff may attach the defendant\u2019s property \u201cas a security for the satisfaction of such judgment as the plaintiff may recover.\u201d <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 227.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-17\">The section 237 provides that \u201cthe judgment\u201d shall be satisfied out of the property attached by the sheriff before resorting to other property; but the plaintiff is not limited to such property, but may resort to any other property of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-18\">As a provisional remedy, it must necessarily be affected by the judgment which is rendered in the court out of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the attachment was issued. If the judgment had been for the defendant, this attachment would have fallen with it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-5\">The necessity for our application to the court arises out of the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was not wholly defeated but was reduced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-6\">Are we not entitled to a'satisfaction of the judgment on payment of it, so as to release any property on which it is a <em>lien.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-7\">The pendency of the appeal would furnish no reason for a refusal to give such satisfaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-8\">If we can thus pay the judgment, to secure which the attachment was issued, we are certainly entitled to have the attachment discharged on payment of such judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-9\"><em>Third. </em>The court cannot assume its own judgment to be erroneous, and that it will be reversed, but its correctness must be assumed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-10\">On the theory on which the motion was denied, if the judgment be affirmed by the general term on appeal, the court must still assume that the judgment is erroneous, and that it will be reversed by the court of appeals. This is hot only unsound, but is productive of great injustice and operates with great hardship.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-11\">In this case defendant\u2019s property has been attached to the extent of $10,000, and is in possession of sheriff, and notwithstanding the court has judicially determined that the plaintiff is entitled to recover only $528.79, the defendant is to be kept out of her property for seven years, until this case can be carried to the court of appeals and there be determined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-12\">For all the injuries she may sustain, she has no mode of procuring compensation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-13\">The undertaking given by the plaintiff is not.only limited to $500, but its conditions do not embrace this species of damage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-14\">Suppose, that instead of an attachment against property, it had been issued against the person, and an order of arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>granted, bailable in $10,000, and the defendant was in the actual custody of the sheriff under such order .for want of bail, could the plaintiff successfully resist an application to discharge from custody on the ground that <em>non constat </em>plaintiff might reverse the judgment, and perhaps one of these days obtain a favorable one f</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-5\">On the principle on which the plaintiff keeps the defendant\u2019s property in custody of sheriff in this case, he would be entitled to retain the property or person of the defendant in such custody, even had the judgment been an absolute judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-6\"><em>Fourth. </em>If it be asked what is the plaintiff\u2019s remedy if the j udgment be reversed, our answers are:</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-7\">1. That the court cannot assume its own judgment to be erroneous or that it will be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-8\">2. That after such reversal the plaintiff may again apply for a new attachment, the Code giving him the right to issue .one at any time during the pendency of the action, and if there be any doubt in regard to that the order might reserve the right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-9\"><em>Fifth. </em>The order should be reversed and an order directed to be entered that on payment of the judgment to the plaintiff\u2014or into court if plaintiff refuses to take it, the attachment be discharged without prejudice to plaintiff\u2019s right, in case of a reversal of such judgment, to apply for another attachment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-10\">Chambers &amp; Pomeroy, <em>for plaintiff, respondent.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-11\"><em>First. </em>The motion to discharge the attachment if grantable at all was addressed to the discretion of the court, and is not appealable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-12\"><em>Second. </em>The motion was properly denied upon the merits of the case, as disclosed by the papers used at special term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-13\"><em>Third. </em>Defendant has not recovered any judgment against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the plaintiff so as to entitle her to a discharge of the attachment under section 239 of Code.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-5\">' <em>Fourth. As </em>the plaintiff may prevail upon the appeal taken by him from the judgment in his favor, and in that event recover a very much larger sum (for which the security offered by defendant was manifestly insufficient), it could never have been intended in such case to take away during the pendency of the appeal the only security, viz.: the levy of the attachment, for the payment of the ultimate judgment which plaintiff may obtain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-6\">The plaintiff is entitled to be protected by the continuance of the attachment until judgment on appeal be rendered; for until then there has been no final determination of the case between the parties. <em>(Drake on </em>Attachments, 3d <em>Ed., </em>\u00a7 411; <em>Danforth </em>agt. <em>Carter, </em>4 <em>Iowa, </em>230; <em>Caperton </em>agt. <em>McCorkle, 5 Grattan, </em>177; <em>Sherrod </em>agt. <em>Davis, </em>17 <em>Ala. </em>312 ; <em>see also Bennett </em>agt. <em>Brown, </em>31 <em>Barb. </em>158 ; <em>Bennett </em>agt. <em>Brown, </em>20 <em>N.
