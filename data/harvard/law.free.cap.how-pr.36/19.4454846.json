Whiting, <em>for the </em>appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsD\">argued that the jurisdiction of the county court was exhausted on the acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s oiler and the correction of the justice\u2019s judgment. (Morgan, <em>J. </em>The provision of section 371 is, that the corrected judgment shall stand\u2019 as his judgment, and be enforced accordingly; and that the appellant shall recover his disbursements on appeal, and his costs in the justice\u2019s court. Tim recovery here mentioned must, therefore, be had in the appellate court as the authority of the justice is exhausted.) The counsel then argued that the county court had no authority to tax the costs. (Morgan, <em>J. </em>The papers do not show that the court taxed the costs. For aught that appears, they may have been taxed by the clerk. But we think no formal taxation was necessary.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-4\">W. J.
