We shall conclude that the circuit courts properly held that the appellees could not be considered \u201cunsafe\u201d drivers under that provision of the code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before explaining why we do so, we recount the somewhat different factual background in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">A. No. 52 \u2014 MVA v. Mohler</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">On 5 June 1986, a United States Magistrate, sitting in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, convicted Thomas Noble Mohler, III, (Mohler) of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of the provisions of former 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.28(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) thereafter conducted a hearing to determine whether to suspend or revoke Mohler\u2019s motor vehicle operator\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 16-206(a)(l), which permits the MVA to impose one of those sanctions \u201con a showing by [MVA\u2019s] records or other sufficient evidence that the ... licensee ... (ii) Is an unfit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>unsafe or habitually reckless or negligent driver of a motor vehicle.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">The MVA hearing examiner suspended Mohler\u2019s license for 15 days and placed him on a three-year alcohol restriction, tersely concluding that Mohler was \u201csubject to\u201d \u00a7 16 \u2014 206(a)(l)(ii). On appeal to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, the parties stipulated that the hearing officer based his decision \u201csolely upon [Mohler\u2019s] conviction of a violation of 36 Code of Federal Regulations 50.28(c).\u201d They also stipulated that \u201c[n]o other evidence concerning appellant\u2019s fitness to drive, safety as a driver, or habitual recklessness or negligence was considered by the hearing examiner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Judge Woods, of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, found \u201cthat the Administration could not reasonably conclude that one with a single conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol is [an] unfit, unsafe, or habitually reckless or negligent driver.\u201d This Court granted the MVA\u2019s petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">B. No. 53 \u2014 MVA v. Tritaik</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">On 27 June 1987, Kurt Dennis Tritaik (Tritaik) was on his way to Ocean City, Maryland. The weather was rainy and it was about 1:00 a.m. He was travelling eastward in the westbound lane of Route 90 when he collided head-on with another car. The driver of the other car subsequently died as a result of the accident. Tritaik was convicted of violating Maryland Code (1987 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 21-305 of the Trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>portation Article, for driving to the left of the center line of the road in an unauthorized manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Following the conviction, the MVA charged Tritaik with being \u201can unfit, unsafe, or habitually reckless or negligent driver\u201d under \u00a7 16-206(a)(l)(ii), and conducted a hearing on this charge on 1 February 1988. Tritaik\u2019s prior record was in evidence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but the hearing examiner focused on the 27 June 1987 collision. Tritaik, who was severely injured in the collision, testified that he did not recall the sequence of events immediately prior to and during the accident. The accident report indicated that Tritaik was in the process of passing three cars when he collided with the oncoming car.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The hearing officer noted that the accident report stated that Tritaik had been drinking. Tritaik admitted to having two beers with dinner about 7:00 p.m. (six hours before the accident); no charges, however, were ever brought against Tritaik for the use of alcohol. There was evidence from two of Tritaik\u2019s neighbors that Tritaik was not known to drink to excess and \u201cwas never observed in an intoxicated condition.\u201d The hearing officer concluded that Tritaik was \u201cinvolved in an accident in which there had to be a degree of recklessness because [he] did cross over into the next man\u2019s lane and had a head-on collision.\u201d The examiner also stated that he felt that Tritaik \u201coperated that vehicle in [a] wanton and reckless manner.\u201d He then revoked Tritaik\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Tritaik appealed to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Judge Goudy reversed and vacated the MVA\u2019s decision. This Court issued a writ of certiorari to the circuit court at the request of the MVA.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">II. Construction and Application of \u00a7 16-206(a)(l)(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">A. Mohler\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The \u00a7 16-206(a)(l)(ii) issue in Mohler\u2019s case is clear cut: Can a single conviction of driving under the influence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>of intoxicating liquor serve, without more, as the factual predicate for a finding that a driver is \u201cunsafe\u201d within the meaning of the subsection? <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We hold that Judge Woods construed and applied the statute correctly when he answered that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">As we have noted, \u00a7 16-206(a)(l)(ii) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">(a)(1) The Administration may suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue or renew the license of any resident ... on a showing by its records or other sufficient evidence that the applicant or licensee: ... (ii) Is an unfit, unsafe, or habitually reckless or negligent driver of a motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASr\">When construing a statute, the duty of the reviewing court is to determine the goal of the legislature and to effectuate that objective. <em>Rucker v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>315 Md. 559, 564, 555 A.2d 1060, 1063 (1989). The court must divine the legislative goal or purpose by examining the language of the statute \u201cin the context within which it was adopted.\u201d <em>Rucker, </em>315 Md. at 565, 555 A.2d at 1063. <em>See State v. Runge, </em>317 Md. 613, 566 A.2d 88, 92-93 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The statute before us went through several metamorphoses before reaching its current form. Under the 1918 Code of Maryland, the commissioner of Motor Vehicles could, at his discretion, suspend or revoke the license of a person holding a Maryland driver\u2019s license who was \u201cconvicted of any violation of any of the provisions of this sub-title.\u201d Md.Code (1918), Art. LVI, \u00a7 145. The statute also gave the commissioner the discretion to revoke or suspend an operator\u2019s license \u201cfor any cause which he may deem sufficient.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The \u201cunfit\u201d and \u201cunsafe\u201d language appeared in 1947. The Department of Motor Vehicles retained the authority to revoke or suspend a license for any violation of the code and, in addition, could do so \u201cfor any other cause or reason which, in the opinion of the Department renders the holder of any such license ... an unfit or unsafe person.\u201d Md. Code (1947 Cum.Supp.), Art. 66V2, \u00a7 95. This version of the statute deleted the broad language which gave the commissioner the power to revoke or suspend a license \u201cfor any cause which he may deem sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">In 1970, the legislature again revised the provision. The grounds for suspension or revocation became:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">a showing by [the department\u2019s] records or other sufficient evidence that the licensee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">(1) Is either an unfit or unsafe driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">(2) Has been convicted with such frequency of violations of the traffic regulations ... as to indicate an intent to disregard the traffic laws and the safety of other persons</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">(3) Is an habitually reckless or negligent driver of a motor vehicle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">(4) Is incompetent to drive a motor vehicle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">(5) Has permitted an unlawful or fraudulent use of the license;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">(6) Has committed an offense in another state____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Md.Code (1970 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66x/2, \u00a7 6-206. This revision divested the department of its authority to revoke or suspend an operator's license for any violation of the code. In the 1977 code revision process, the revisors consolidated the language in former \u00a7 6-206. Paragraphs (1) and (3) were combined, and paragraph (4) was deleted. Md.Code (1977), \u00a7 16-206 of the Transp. Art. Those changes put the provision in its current form.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">The evolution of \u00a7 16-206 reveals the legislature\u2019s goal of limiting the department\u2019s (now the MVA\u2019s) discretion to revoke or suspend licenses. The legislature first took away the commissioner\u2019s (department\u2019s) power to revoke or sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>pend a license for any reason that that official (it) found sufficient, and later took away the department\u2019s power to revoke or suspend a license for any motor vehicle violation under the statute. The objective of these changes was to establish a tighter, more specific standard for revocation or suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Moreover, the statutory development shows that the legislature meant to attach distinct meanings to \u201cunsafe,\u201d \u201cunfit,\u201d and the two \u201chabitual\u201d categories. The 1977 re-visor\u2019s note to \u00a7 16-206 advises that the \u201creference to an \u2018incompetent\u2019 driver [in former Art. I6V2, \u00a7 6-206 was] deleted as superfluous in light of the references to an \u2018unfit,\u2019 or \u2018unsafe\u2019 driver.\u201d Ch. 14, Acts of 1977. We may conclude that the legislature believed that \u201cunsafe\u201d and \u201cunfit\u201d together encompass the meaning of \u201cincompetent\u201d and \u201cunsafe\u201d and \u201cunfit\u201d are not intended to be synonyms; otherwise, the legislature would have deleted one of those words as well. Lack of fitness has to do with incompetence: physical or mental unsoundness for a particular purpose. <em>See </em>Random House Dictionary of the English Language at 2068 (2d ed. 1987); Oxford English Dictionary Vol. XIX at 19 (2d ed. 1989). \u201cUnsafe\u201d means, among other things, \u201cexposing to danger.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary at 2509 (1976); Oxford English Dictionary Vol. XIX at 180 (2d ed. 1989). An unfit driver may be an unsafe one, but an unsafe one is not necessarily an individual who is subject to a physical or mental condition that impairs his or her ability to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">As we have said, we deal here with a driver found by the MVA to be \u201cunsafe.\u201d But the single conviction upon which the hearing examiner relied could not be the basis for that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">We do not rule out the possibility that a single incident might, in some circumstances, provide a sufficient foundation for a finding of \u201cunsafe.\u201d But a conviction of driving under the influence is not even complete evidence of a single incident. The surrounding circumstances are unknown. We do not know how Mohler was driving, to what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>extent he was under the influence, his proclivity, if any, to drink or any other information that might bear upon his \u201cunsafeness\u201d as a driver. The hearing examiner must determine that the licensee is \u201cunsafe\u201d at the time of the hearing. The statute is a measure designed to keep unsafe drivers off the road, at least for a time. Hence, it must be determined that the licensee is unsafe at the time of revocation or suspension. The statute\u2019s history supports this reading of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">What is now \u00a7 16-206 traces back to \u00a7 6-206 of the Uniform Vehicle Code. <em>See Uniform Vehicle Code </em>(Revised 1962). While the Maryland statutory provisions are not identical to those of the Uniform Code, and never have been, the purpose of both is the same. With respect to the physical or mental disability ground for sanction, it has been said that \u201c[i]f any broad generalization is possible, it is that in order to support the administrative denial or withdrawal of driving privileges ... there must be competent, substantial evidence of the existence of some tangible disease or defect which bears, or could in the future bear, adversely upon the particular motorist\u2019s capacity to drive safely.\u201d 7A Am.Jur.2d. <em>Automobiles and Highway Traffic </em>\u00a7 116 at 284 (1980). In other words, where unfitness is the criterion, the unfitness must be a present one ... one that \u201cbears, or could in the future bear,\u201d upon the licensee\u2019s \u201ccapacity to drive safely.\u201d The same is true when \u201cunsafe\u201d is the criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Thus, the \u201cunsafe\u201d standard requires the hearing examiner to determine whether the licensee possesses some characteristic that is likely to make him an unsafe driver. The focus is on the driver, not on the offense of which the driver was convicted. For this reason, MVA\u2019s reliance on out-of-state cases that allow suspension or revocation when a driver has been convicted of a serious offense is not helpful. <em>See, e.g., Crow v. Shaeffer, </em>199 N.W.2d 45 (Iowa 1972) (I.C.A. \u00a7 321.210(7) authorizing suspension of licensee who has \u201ccommitted a serious violation of the motor vehicle laws of this state\u201d allows suspension based on single conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>of reckless driving, when details of reckless driving established); <em>Ralston v. State, </em>60 Wash.2d 535, 374 P.2d 571 (1962) (R.C.W. 46.20.290(4) authorizing suspension of license of one who \u201chas committed a serious violation of the motor vehicle laws of this state\u201d permits suspension based on single drunk driving conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Those statutes make the nature of the violation the test for suspension or revocation. Maryland, at least where \u00a7 16-206(a)(l)(ii) is concerned, looks to the characteristics of the driver, not just the gravity of the motor vehicle violation. To be sure, the nature of a violation may have some bearing on whether a driver may be considered unsafe, as may facts that disclose the details of the violation. <em>See Bungardeanu v. England, </em>219 A.2d 104 (D.C.1966) (facts that drunk driver struck two parked cars and left scene of accident sufficient to support a finding of \u201cflagrant disregard for the safety of persons or property\u201d under D.C. Traffic and Motor Vehicle Regs. \u00a7 5(a)). But under our carefully limited statute, Mohler\u2019s single conviction of driving under the influence is insufficient in and of itself, to sustain the hearing examiner\u2019s finding that Mohler was an \u201cunsafe\u201d driver. Judge Woods did not err when he reversed the hearing examiner on this point.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">B. Tritaik\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">As reference to Part I.B, <em>supra, </em>will reveal, the facts upon which Tritaik\u2019s revocation was based showed more than a single conviction. There was, of course, a conviction for driving to the left of the center line of the road. But in addition, the hearing examiner learned some facts about the accident in which Tritaik was involved (including the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>of another driver) and about some of Tritaik\u2019s activities shortly before the accident. The MVA insists that these additional facts are sufficient to uphold findings of both \u201cunsafe\u201d and \u201chabitually negligent.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">As in Mohler\u2019s case, the hearing examiner was somewhat nonspecific in explaining just what was the basis for his suspension order. Maryland Code (1984), State Government Article, \u00a7 10-214 (Part of the Administrative Procedure Act) directs in no uncertain terms that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">(b)(1) A final decision in a contested case shall contain separate statements of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">(1) the findings of fact; and (ii) the conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">(2) If the findings of fact are stated in statutory language, the final decision shall state concisely and explicitly the facts that support the findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">If hearing examiners followed this directive scrupulously, it would be helpful to us, to the circuit courts, and to the hearing examiners themselves, for a careful statement of facts and conclusions would force the examiner to focus on the evidence presented and its sufficiency to support a particular conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">In any case, \u00a7 10-214(b) was given somewhat short shrift here. The examiner recited several pieces of information. He made few findings of fact, except to state that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag\">You [Tritaik] had left your lane to the other lane and hit a head-on \u2014 had a head-on accident in which there was a fatality and you had been drinking on this occasion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag5E\">Later on, the examiner opined that he couldn\u2019t tell to what extent the consumption of alcohol had contributed to the accident. His \u201cinescapable conclusion\u201d (as we have recounted) was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>You were involved in an accident in which there had to be a degree of recklessness because you did cross over into the next man\u2019s lane and had a head-on collision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">He summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">The evidence before me is that you did cross into the other lane on a dark wet night and did strike the victim\u2019s car head-on. The victim, Robert Cannon, did die. I think greater [care] should have been used due to the time and the road conditions. Today, ... I do feel that you operated the vehicle in [a] wanton and reckless manner and the license will be revoked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The examiner\u2019s language at once disposes of the MVA\u2019s contention that there was a finding of habitual recklessness. For something to be habitual, it must be done \u2014 or not done \u2014 over some period of time. There must be some evidence of habit. Whether Tritaik\u2019s prior record<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> could constitute enough evidence of habitual recklessness, we need not decide. The examiner did not rely on that record. He relied <em>only </em>on the event of 27 June 1987. When we review an administrative action, we may uphold the agency order only if \u201c \u2018it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baltimore Heritage v. City of Baltimore, </em>316 Md. 109, 113, 557 A.2d 256, 258 (1989) (quoting <em>United Steelworkers v. Bethlehem Steel, </em>298 Md. 665, 679, 472 A.2d 62, 69 (1984)). The findings and reasons disclosed here do not permit us to sustain any conclusion as to Tritaik\u2019s habitual negligence, even if the examiner intended to so conclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">As to \u201cunsafe,\u201d we are left with a single incident as a basis for the finding. The MVA tells us that the death of another driver supports a finding of \u201cunsafe.\u201d It does not, on this record. The death was a tragic event, but it tells us virtually nothing about why Tritaik might be found to possess the ongoing characteristics of an unsafe driver. Motor vehicle fatalities may occur even though no driver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>breaks the law; on the other hand, a case of the most egregiously unsafe driving might cause no fatality. The fact that \u00a7 16-207(a)(l)(i) gives the MVA discretion to call a licensee in for reexamination if there has been a fatal accident has no bearing on \u00a7 16-206(a)(l)(ii). As we already have explained, the two sections represent distinct and alternative routes to suspension or revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The MVA relies on <em>Cutlip v. Connecticut Motor Vehicle Commissioner, </em>168 Conn. 94, 357 A.2d 918 (1975). It cites the case for the proposition that a driver determined to be at fault in a fatal accident should be removed from the highway. This decision, however, was made under a Connecticut statute (Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-111(c)) that specifically authorized revocation or suspension in the event of a fatal accident, <em>if </em>the licensee was found responsible for the accident, and <em>if </em>the licensee had caused or contributed to the death by virtue of a violation of the Connecticut Motor Vehicle laws or by negligence or carelessness. Our statute is not remotely like the Connecticut statute, and in any case, the hearing examiner here did not make findings like those made in <em>Cutlip.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The MVA\u2019s other out-of-state cases suffer from the same deficiency as the \u201cserious conviction\u201d cases we discussed in Part II.A: the underlying statutory schemes are vastly different from Maryland\u2019s. Moreover, all involve facts quite distinct from those here. <em>See, e.g., Hernigle v. Macduff, </em>305 N.Y. 367, 113 N.E.2d 520 (1953) (finding that accident causally related to respondent\u2019s drowsy condition, and that driver was aware he was dosing off, but continued to drive); <em>Griffin v. Muzio, </em>10 Conn.App. 90, 521 A.2d 607, <em>cert. denied, </em>203 Conn. 805, 525 A.2d 520 (1987) (same statute as that involved in <em>Cutlip); Farrell v. Adduci, </em>138 A.D.2d 944, 526 N.Y.S.2d 686 (1988) (drinking driver exceeded speed limit by at least 15 miles per hour, crossed center line, and crashed into guard rail, killing two passengers); <em>Commonwealth v. Fisher, </em>184 Pa.Super. 75, 132 A.2d 739 (1957) (driver had 10-12 beers, and fell asleep at wheel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>causing vehicle to travel 445 feet, striking posts and guard rails before stopping).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">We venture no opinion as to whether facts like these would justify suspension or revocation under \u00a7 16-206(a)(1)(ii). We point out only that the facts pertaining to Tritaik are different. They do not show that Tritaik, when he appeared before the examiner, possessed any characteristics likely to render him an unsafe driver. Accordingly, Judge Goudy did not err in reversing the hearing examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">III. An Evidentiary Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Remaining for disposition is the MVA\u2019s contention that Judge Woods erred in admitting certain evidence during Mohler\u2019s appeal. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">At the circuit court hearing, Mohler produced one Mary Rita Miller, a Ph.D. affiliated with the English Department at the University of Maryland. Mohler qualified Dr. Miller as an expert in linguistics. He then, over the MVA\u2019s objections, had her testify as to the meanings of \u201cunsafe\u201d and \u201cunfit.\u201d Her testimony consisted chiefly of stating dictionary definitions of the words.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The MVA avers that this procedure violated State Government Article \u00a7 10-215(e). This subsection permits additional evidence on judicial review of an administrative agency decision only if, among other things, the party offering the evidence applies for leave to do so prior to the court hearing (\u00a7 10-215(e)(1)(i)) and the court is satisfied that there were good reasons for failure to offer the evidence before the agency (\u00a7 10-215(e)(1)(ii)(2). Mohler satisfied neither of these preconditions. Moreover, if the criteria of \u00a7 10-215(e) are met, the additional testimony is heard before the agency, not the court. <em>Consumer Protection v. Consumer Pub., </em>304 Md. 731, 749, 501 A.2d 48, 58 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Assuming, without deciding, that \u00a7 10-215(e) applies to a situation in which the additional evidence does not relate to the merits of a case, but only to the meaning of words in a statute, Judge Woods erred when he admitted the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>in the circuit court proceeding. But to remand this case to the circuit court to allow Judge Woods to decide whether the evidence should come in under the \u00a7 10-215(e) criteria, and in the event of a favorable decision, to send the case back to the MVA to consider the evidence, <em>Howard County v. Davidsonville Civic Ass\u2019n, </em>72 Md.App. 19, 47, 527 A.2d 772, 786, <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 286, 533 A.2d 1308 (1987), on the facts of this case would be inconsistent with judicial economy and efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The record contains not the slightest hint that Judge Woods considered Dr. Miller\u2019s dictionary readings in any respect. Indeed, he could have obtained much the same information by reading dictionaries himself. In his written opinion and order of court, he made no attempt to define \u201cunsafe\u201d or \u201cunfit.\u201d He simply found that \u201cgiven the clear and unambiguous language of [\u00a7 16-206(a)(l)(ii) ] ... the Administration could not reasonably conclude that one with a single conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol is an unfit, unsafe, or habitually reckless or negligent driver.\u201d But the error in admitting the evidence could not have prejudiced the MVA. \u201cIt is a fundamental rule of appellate procedure that a reviewing court will not reverse upon rulings on evidence where the ruling did not result in prejudice to the complaining party.\u201d <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 528-529, 495 A.2d 1, 22 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1093, 106 S.Ct. 868, 88 L.Ed.2d 907 (1986); <em>accord Tully v. Dasher, </em>250 Md. 424, 436, 244 A.2d 207, 214 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">JUDGMENTS IN NO. 52 AND NO. 53 AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MOTOR VEHICLE ADMINISTRATION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-10\">. In No. 52, Mohler's case, an evidentiary issue is raised as well. We shall deal with that in Part III of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-11\">. Former 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.28(c) provided: \"No person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor ... shall operate or drive a motor vehicle of any kind in any area covered by this part.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b293-8\">. Section 16-205 of the Transportation Article permits the MVA to revoke or suspend the license of any individual who is convicted of certain violations of \u00a7 21-902, which penalizes driving while intoxicated, while under the influence of alcohol, or while under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance. Mohler, of course, was not convicted of any violation of \u00a7 21-902, but instead a violation of 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.28(c). <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra. </em>The legislature has not seen fit to extend the sanctions of \u00a7 16-205 to a driving-under-the-influence conviction imposed by a federal court pursuant to the Code of Federal Regulations. As a consequence, in Mohler\u2019s case, the MVA proceeded under \u00a7 16-206(a)(l)(ii) not \u00a7 16-205.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-10\">. The prior record (in addition to the 1987 conviction) consisted of two failures to obey traffic signals or devices (1980 and 1981) and speeding (1984). One of the \"failures to obey\u201d resulted in an accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\">. The hearing officer in Mohler\u2019s case did not specify whether he found Mohler unsafe, unfit, or habitually reckless or negligent. Judge Woods concluded that the single conviction was insufficient to support a finding of the existence of any of those conditions. The MVA, in its brief, advises that it \u201cdoes not contest the lower court\u2019s ruling insofar as it ruled that [Mohler\u2019s] conviction, standing alone, does not indicate that the driver is unfit or habitually reckless or negligent.\u201d MVA\u2019s sole contention under \u00a7 16 \u2014 206(a)( 1 )(ii) is that it was error to hold that the single conviction was \"not a reasonable basis upon which MVA could conclude that a driver is \u2018unsafe.\u2019\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\">. Mohler also argues that the MVA was required to reexamine him before suspending his license. His contention is based primarily on \u00a7 16-207(a)(l) which declares that \u201c[t]he Administration may require a licensee to submit to reexamination\u201d if, among other things, \u201c(ii) ... the Administration has good cause to believe that the licensee is unfit, unsafe, or otherwise not qualified to be licensed.\u201d But \u00a7 16-207(a)(l), as its language discloses, does not mandate anything. It simply gives the MVA an alternate path to suspension or revocation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b300-10\">.
