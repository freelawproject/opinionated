The Clinic is located on West Washington Street, a congested, one-way, two-lane thoroughfare in Hagerstown. The building which houses the Clinic also houses two other businesses and at least one residential apartment. Across the street from the Clinic is a residential apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">On the morning of 18 May, petitioner Jerry Wayne Eanes (Eanes) was part of a small group that had gathered in front of the Clinic to, in Eanes\u2019s words, \u201cassemble [,] to speak out against abortion, to pass out gospel tracts [and] to try and talk to girls that are walking by [in order to explain the evils of abortion].\u201d Eanes\u2019s primary method of opposing abortion, however, was \u201cto preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d Indeed, he asserted that his purpose was to preach to the entire neighborhood.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Eanes and another man, Timothy Schuller, preached that morning between approximately 10:80 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. Each spoke for short periods of time at varying intervals. Each spoke unaided by any artificial amplification. People employed in the vicinity and local residents complained to the Hagerstown Police Department (Department) that they were being disturbed by the loudness of the preaching. At least one resident left her home and complained to the demonstrators. She requested that the noise level be reduced. The administrator of the Clinic left her office and complained directly to Eanes. She indicated to him that the noise was disrupting her work and requested that he quiet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>down. Police Officer Feigly, who had responded to complaints received at the Department, also spoke with Eanes and with Schuller. He explained that a number of noise complaints had been received and requested that the volume level of the speech be reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">After warning Eanes, Officer Feigly left the scene, although it appears from the record that other police officers remained in the area. He returned approximately forty minutes later in response to further noise complaints received by the Department. At that time he observed Eanes shouting in a loud voice. He then placed Eanes under arrest for disturbing the peace in violation of \u00a7 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">On 2 August 1988, the District Court of Maryland sitting in Washington County (Glaser, J.) found Eanes guilty of disturbing the peace in violation of \u00a7 121. On 15 December 1988, Eanes obtained de novo review of his conviction before Judge Frederick C. Wright, III, of the Circuit Court for Washington County.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">At that trial the State presented eleven witnesses who testified as to Eanes\u2019s conduct on 18 May: three residents, three local business people, one pedestrian, one police cadet, and three police officers. All generally characterized Eanes\u2019s preaching as very or extremely loud. His conduct was more specifically described as \u201cscreaming without screeching,\u201d \u201cshouting and screaming,\u201d \u201cyelling and screaming at the top of his voice.\u201d Each of the first six witnesses listed above testified that they were disturbed in their homes or places of business and that it was the loudness and tone they found objectionable, not the message Eanes conveyed. One resident, unable to put her son down for his nap, testified that she and her child were forced to leave their apartment due to the noise. Another resident, in an apartment in the back of the building across the street from the Clinic, testified that her husband\u2019s sleep (he worked the night shift) was disrupted. Each of the three State\u2019s witnesses who were employed in the area testified that the volume level of Eanes\u2019s speech was so great that it interfered in some manner with their work.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Although there was some conflicting testimony, several of the witnesses agreed that Eanes could readily be heard above the traffic noise. One witness testified that Eanes was \u201cfar louder than the vehicle noises,\u201d while others testified that he \u201coverpowered\u201d or \u201covertook\u201d the sounds from the street. It also was said that Eanes could be heard as far away as \u201cthe square,\u201d a location stated to be a block and a half from where Eanes was preaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Eanes, testifying in his own defense, did not, for the most part, dispute this evidence. He testified that in preaching in front of the Clinic, he raised his voice. When asked why he raised his voice, he replied:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Because I\u2019m speaking not just to the people in that buildingf.] I was speaking to the general people that were in that area, the bystanders, the people driving by, the people that I knew were going to be coming in. Based on the evidence presented, Judge Wright found Eanes \u201cguilty of willfully disturbing the peace and tranquility of that particular neighborhood during the morning of May the 18th ... by making loud and otherwise unacceptable^] improper under the circumstances noises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Eanes raises several constitutional challenges to his conviction. He insists that in <em>Diehl v. State, </em>294 Md. 466, 451 A.2d 115 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1098, 103 S.Ct. 1798, 76 L.Ed.2d 363 (1983), this Court definitively limited application of the statutory prohibition against \u201cloud and unseemly noises\u201d to speech that falls outside the protective reach of the first amendment; speech, for example, that advocates imminent, lawless action. Bereft of such a limitation, he argues, the statute is left unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. He concludes that even if \u00a7 121 is found to overcome those hurdles, it cannot, consonant with the first amendment, be enforced to limit the volume level of speech that is not artificially amplified.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">The State, for its part, disputes each of these contentions. It takes the position that the provision at issue is a content-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>neutral regulation of the manner of protected speech, one that is neither vague nor overbroad, and one that was properly applied in the case at bar. Noting the substantial disparity between the parties\u2019 understanding of the constitutionally permissible scope of \u00a7 121, we granted Eanes\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, 315 Md. 223, 554 A.2d 351 (1989), in order to consider if and in what manner \u00a7 121 may be applied as a limitation on protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">We begin by disagreeing with Eanes\u2019s evaluation of <em>Diehl. </em>He reads that opinion much too broadly. We dealt there not with a conviction based on objectionabl\u00e9 loudness, but with one based on allegedly objectionable content. As we shall explain, the <em>Diehl </em>limitation on which Eanes relies is only applicable when the prohibition against \u201cloud and unseemly noise\u201d seeks to regulate the content of speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\"><em>Diehl </em>involved a police officer, Gavin, who stopped an automobile for a traffic violation. Diehl, a passenger, left the vehicle but was ordered by Gavin to return to the car. Diehl responded by screaming, \u201c \u2018Fuck you Gavin;\u2019 \u2018I know my rights;\u2019 you can\u2019t tell me what to do____\u2019\u201d 294 Md. at 468, 451 A.2d at 116. A crowd gathered. After Diehl refused a second time to get back in the car, Gavin arrested him for \u201c \u2018screaming obscenities and ... drawing a crowd.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468, 451 A.2d at 117 [ellipsis in <em>Diehl].</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">The State sought to uphold Diehl\u2019s subsequent conviction under \u00a7 121 in part on the ground that Diehl violated the statute \u201cby making loud and unseemly noises in refusing \u2018to obey Gavin\u2019s proper order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470, 451 A.2d at 118. At no time did the State argue that the loudness of Diehl\u2019s protestations violated \u00a7 121.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, it was the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>position that the statements \u201cattracted a crowd and enhanced the possibility of chaos.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief in <em>Diehl v. State </em>at 6; <em>see </em>294 Md. at 480-481, 487-488, 451 A.2d at 123, 126-127 (Rodowsky, J., dissenting). Since the State\u2019s argument addressed the content of Diehl\u2019s speech (and not its loudness), we determined that in order to qualify as <em>\u201cloud and unseemly noise,\" </em>under the circumstances, \u201cDiehl\u2019s conduct must have advocated imminent lawless action and been likely to incite a breach of the peace____\u201d <em>Diehl, </em>294 Md. at 472, 451 A.2d at 119 [emphasis in original]. In this manner we limited the provision\u2019s ability to regulate the content of speech. We did not in that case, however, consider the argument the State at present raises before us: that the statute serves as a constitutionally valid content-neutral regulation of the volume level of protected speech. We now address that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The command of the first amendment, that \u201cCongress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech ...,\u201d is directed with equal force, by way of the fourteenth amendment, to state and local governments. <em>Gitlow v.

Indeed, because we are working in the area of protected speech, the statutory phrase \u201cloud and unseemly noise\u201d should be construed in a content-neutral fashion in order to remain in conformity with first amendment jurisprudence. \u201c[I]f one of the proposed interpretations would render an enactment valid, while another would render it invalid or ineffective, the court will construe the enactment to be valid whenever feasible.\u201d <em>City of College Park v.

We interpret the word \u201cunseemly\u201d as directly modifying the volume level of \u201cloud.\u201d It requires the meaning of \u201cloud\u201d to be informed by the circumstances. It does not act as a blanket proscription against loud speech.

Under the statute individuals may speak in any traditional public forum at any time. The elements of time and place operate, in the context of the statute, to inform; they are not themselves the subject of regulation. As the State correctly contends, \u00a7 121 is a regulation on the manner of expression. It serves to limit, under proper circumstances, the loudness of the delivery of the communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">As a regulation on the manner of expression, \u00a7 121 must be narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.

The cases support the view that content-neutral regulations controlling its loudness are permissible. <em>See, e.g., Ward, </em>(volume may be controlled to protect area of park and nearby residences); <em>Grayned, </em>(ordinance prohibiting disturbance of good order of a school valid); <em>Kovacs </em>(municipality may control volume of sound trucks); <em>Reeves </em>(city may protect citizens from unreasonable or disruptive levels of noise in streets). It may be otherwise outside the home or office, where the audience is ordinarily not captive, <em>see Pacifica Foundation, </em>438 U.S. at 749 n. 27, 98 S.Ct. at 3040 n. 27, 57 L.Ed.2d at 1098 n. 27; <em>Erznoznik, </em>422 U.S. at 209-211, 95 S.Ct. at 2272-2273, 45 L.Ed.2d at 130-132; <em>Cohen, </em>403 U.S. at 21, 91 S.Ct. at 1786, 29 L.Ed.2d at 292. But \u00a7 121 prohibits only that volume level of communication that unreasonably disturbs individuals whose rights to be free from aural abuse override the right of a speaker to address them by direct or incidental oral communication. This is the type of balance of conflicting interests contemplated by first amendment jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We read the statute as going no further than to afford content-neutral protection to the captive auditor (on the facts before us, auditors in homes or in private offices) who cannot avoid continuing, unreasonably loud and disruptive communications emanating from the street. So read, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the statute serves a substantial interest and is narrowly tailored to serve those ends.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">When the State seeks to correct a particular evil by way of time, place, or manner restrictions, it need not employ the least restrictive or least intrusive means. <em>Ward, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 109 S.Ct. at 2758, 105 L.Ed.2d at 680. \u201cRather, the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied \u2018so long as the ... regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Albertini, </em>472 U.S; 675, 689, 105 S.Ct. 2897, 2906, 86 L.Ed.2d 536, 548 (1985) [ellipsis in <em>Ward], </em>Since the character of open public places may differ widely, one from another, only a flexible approach to volume control can adequately serve the myriad circumstances which the State can legitimately regulate. As we have pointed out, it is the particular circumstances that render a loud communication unseemly or unreasonable, and hence subject to time, place, and manner regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Consider apartment dwellers and workers in private offices along West Washington Street. The record in this case makes clear that during business hours the street is heavily travelled by motor vehicles, including large trucks. This traffic produces a high noise level, and one who wishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>to communicate by voice with people in the street must make his or her voice heard over the sound of traffic. But when the volume of the speaker\u2019s voice not only reaches passersby in the street \u2014 the public forum \u2014 but also awakens adults sleeping in their homes, prevents children from taking their naps, and makes it impossible for workers to concentrate on their work, the volume\u2019s effect on the captive audience reaches a point at which that volume may be controlled.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">One speaking on West Washington Street at midnight, with traffic levels much reduced, could run afoul of \u00a7 121 at a lower level of voice volume. In this quieter environment, a less loud oral presentation could unreasonably disturb what might well be a larger captive audience, at least from the viewpoint of apartment dwellers. <em>See People v. Fitzgerald, </em>194 Colo. 415, 419, 573 P.2d 100, 103 (1978) (proscribed conduct \u201cnecessarily varies according to the time, location and decibel level of such conduct\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 735, 359 N.E.2d 310, 312 (1977) (same). And if we move the scene to an area of Hagerstown that is solely residential, still different levels of speech might suffice to violate the statute. <em>Reeves, </em>631 F.2d at 385 n. 10 (threshold level of prohibited disruptive noise may be substantially lower in areas primarily residential). We deal with a balancing that involves the time and place where speech occurs as well as the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>places where auditors are \u2014 the street itself; stores; schools; hospitals; private offices; homes. A sound level that a pedestrian on the sidewalk could not constitutionally object to might be impermissible with respect to a patient in an intensive care ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Another factor that enters the balancing is that of alternative means. We shall have more to say about this topic shortly in a somewhat different context. Whether there is some other way of achieving the actor\u2019s goal is to be considered in the determination of whether a loud sound is unreasonably loud. Road construction equipment, for example, may make a great deal of noise and may seriously disturb people in homes, hospitals, schools, and offices. But broken water mains must be repaired and streets must be maintained, and it is often the case that noisy machines are the only practicable means of achieving these objectives. Thus, the sound created by that sort of activity is not necessarily unseemly or unreasonably loud. But a speaker will usually have a number of less noisy ways of presenting his or her message: speaking at lower volume; individual contact; use of placards or leaflets! So the balance of reasonableness may rest differently depending on the circumstances. <em>See Commonwealth v. Greene, </em>410 Pa. 111, 115-116, 189 A.2d 141, 144 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Another weight in the balance may be the mechanical or electronic amplification of sound. It is no doubt easier to find that an antinoise law is constitutional when it deals with that sort of amplification, as did the ordinance in <em>Kovacs, supra. See also, e.g., Ward, Saia </em>and <em>Reeves, </em>all <em>supra. </em>But even though cases like <em>Kovacs </em>emphasize the sound-truck feature of the law, we reject Eanes\u2019s argument that amplification is a constitutional <em>sine qua non. </em>Eanes would have it that a speaker could stand in front of a residence at two o\u2019clock in the morning and shout at top volume as long as he or \"she pleased provided a message was being conveyed. We disagree. If the State is able to prove that, under the circumstances, the human voice is so unreasonably loud as to be unreasonably intrusive on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>captive audience, that is enough. <em>See, e.g., Grayned, supra. </em>Captive auditors in their homes and places of business need not become an unwilling congregation for Eanes\u2019s street-preaching.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Eanes suggests that only a statute which sets a specific decibel level would be constitutional. Yet even with respect to a particular public forum, such as Hagerstown\u2019s West Washington Street, a decibel level that would permit communication with passersby and not disturb residents in their homes may vary with the time of day, air temperature, air currents, and background noise present. A standard which more specifically defined acceptable decibel levels at varying times and places would be likely both underinclusive and overbroad. <em>See Commonwealth v. Orlando, </em>371 Mass, at 735, 359 N.E.2d at 312 (addressing the statutory standard \u201cdisturbers of the peace\u201d). <em>See also Mann v. Mack, </em>155 Cal.App.3d 666, 674, 202 Cal.Rptr. 296, 301-302 (1984) (\u201cA determination as to what constitutes a 'loud, unnecessary and unusual noise\u2019 requires common sense not a decibel meter\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because \u00a7 121 is tailored to respond to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the individual circumstances and, as it is here construed, to regulate only that conduct which on balance can appropriately be limited consistent with the first amendment, we conclude it is sufficiently narrowly tailored.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Bolstering our determination that \u00a7 121 is narrowly tailored is the fact that the statute allows for ample alternative avenues of communication. <em>See Vincent, </em>466 U.S. at 812, 104 S.Ct. at 2132-2133, 80 L.Ed.2d at 792. <em>See also </em>J. Nowak, R. Rotunda, J. Young, <em>Constitutional Law </em>(3d.,ed. 1986) \u00a7 16.47 at 971. Nothing in \u00a7 121 prevents a spealcer from orally addressing passersby, or from distributing literature or carrying a sign which expresses his or her viewpoint. Nor, if the intent of the speaker is to reach area residents or merchants, is an individual prohibited by \u00a7 121 from communicating with willing recipients by telephone, postal service, or in person. That a speaker\u2019s potential aural audience may be limited by the inability to stand outside a residence or business and scream a message to the unwilling listener therein is of little consequence when there are ample alternative channels of conveying that communication which have not been shown to be inadequate. <em>Ward, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 109 S.Ct. at 2759, 105 L.Ed.2d at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">In summary, we hold that \u00a7 121, as we have construed it, is content neutral, narrowly tailored to serve a significant State interest, and does not inhibit the use of various alternative channels of communication. It does not violate the first amendment unless the words \u201cloud and unseemly noise\u201d in \u00a7 121 render the statute vague or overbroad.

A statute also may be void for vagueness if it lacks fixed enforcement standards or guidelines and thus \u201cimpermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108-109, 92 S.Ct. at 2299, 33 L.Ed.2d at 228. Both of these tests of vagueness are based on fourteenth amendment due process or fairness concerns. Tribe, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12-31. We first address the issue of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">A law is not <em>vague </em>simply because it requires conformity to an imprecise normative standard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">The root of the vagueness doctrine is a rough idea of fairness.

The statute was attacked, in part, for failing to delineate, with any specificity, between legitimate corporal punishment and illegitimate child abuse. We determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">[a] statute is not vague when the meaning of the words in controversy can be fairly ascertained by reference to judicial determinations, the common law, dictionaries, treatises or even the words themselves, if they possess a common and generally accepted meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 125, 389 A.2d at 347.

We explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGE\">[pjarents of ordinary intelligence are made aware that they do not subject themselves to the statute by merely engaging in corporal discipline for the purpose of punishment or correction. Only when the line is crossed and physical injury is intentionally and maliciously or cruelly inflicted does criminal responsibility attach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 128, 389 A.2d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Other courts have applied these principles in responding to vagueness attacks on antinoise laws. For example, in <em>Kovacs, supra, </em>the Supreme Court confronted a vagueness challenge to the not-too-dissimilar statutory phrase \u201cloud and raucous.\u201d 336 U.S. at 79, 69 S.Ct. at 449, 93 L.Ed. at 518. Remarking that the claim deserved only passing mention, the Court stated that \u201c[wjhile these are abstract words, they have through daily use acquired a content that conveys to any interested person a sufficiently accurate concept of what is forbidden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 69 S.Ct. at 449-450, 93 L.Ed. at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">The method of analysis is further demonstrated in <em>Grayned, supra. </em>That case involved a Rockford, Illinois, ordinance that made it a crime for anyone willfully to make a noise or diversion which disturbed or tended to disturb the peace or good order of any school in session. 408 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>107-108, 92 S.Ct. at 2298, 33 L.Ed.2d at 227. The Supreme Court held the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. The words \u201ctending to disturb,\u201d in a Chicago ordinance, had previously been construed by the Supreme Court of Illinois to refer only to an imminent threat of violence. <em>Id. </em>at 110-112, 92 S.Ct. at 2299-2301, 33 L.Ed.2d at 228-230. The Rockford ordinance did not define the requisite quantum of disturbance, but the United States Supreme Court found that this question was measured by the impact of the disturbance on school activity. Given the requirements of (1) willful conduct, (2) that the noise or diversion be actually incompatible with normal school activity, and (3) a demonstrated causal relationship between \u201cnoise or diversion\u201d and disruption, the ordinance withstood constitutional scrutiny. <em>Id. </em>at 113-114, 92 S.Ct. at 2301-2302, 33 L.Ed.2d at 230-231.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In similar fashion, we here apply normal meanings to words of common understanding and conclude that speech that is so unreasonably loud as to unreasonably intrude on the privacy of a captive audience may be punished.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We hold that the words \u201cloud and unseemly,\u201d so construed, give sufficient notice of what conduct is penalized. \u201cUnseemly\u201d modifies \u201cloud\u201d and means \u201cunreasonably loud in the circumstances.\u201d That is clear enough. The objective \u201creasonable\u201d test is used in many areas of the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>as an appropriate determinant of liability and thus a guide to conduct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">An exhaustive listing of words or phrases deemed not unduly vague would unduly prolong this opinion. We note a few examples in addition to those we have already discussed: <em>Reeves, </em>631 F.2d at 386 (prohibition of sound that is \u201cjarring\u201d or \u201ca nuisance\u201d not unconstitutionally vague; words do not provide mathematical certainty, but have acquired sufficiently definite content through daily use); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>112 Ariz. 383, 542 P.2d 808 (1975) (statute that made it a misdemeanor to \u201cmaliciously and wilfully disturb[ ] the peace or quiet of a neighborhood ... by loud or unusual noises\u201d is valid); <em>Commonwealth v. Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 269 N.E.2d 657 (1971) (\u201cdisturbers of the peace\u201d not unconstitutionally vague); <em>State v. Smith, </em>46 N.J. 510, 518, 218 A.2d 147, 151, <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 838, 87 S.Ct. 85, 17 L.Ed.2d 71 (1966) (statute proscribing \u201cnoisy or disorderly conduct\u201d which \u201cdisturbs or interferes with the quiet or good order\u201d of certain places of assembly is valid; \u201cif there is a public interest in need of protection, due process does not stand in the way merely because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>subject defies minute prescription\u201d); <em>State v. Holland, </em>132 NJ.Super. 17, 23, 331 A.2d 626, 629 (1975) (prohibition of \u201cunreasonably loud and unnecessary noise\u201d valid because \u201c[wjhether a given noise disturbs the public peace depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, and it is impractical to spell out rigid legislative criteria\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Weiner, </em>230 Pa.Super. 245, 326 A.2d 896 (1974) (\u201cloud\u201d and \u201cunseemly\u201d not unconstitutionally vague); <em>Seattle v. Eze, </em>111 Wash.2d 22, 759 P.2d 366 (1988) (\u201cloud or raucous behavior\u201d which \u201cunreasonably disturbs others\u201d not unconstitutionally vague).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The words \u201cloud and unseemly noise\u201d as used in \u00a7 121 are no more vague than the words considered in the preceding cases. As we have construed it, the phrase \u201cloud and unseemly noise\u201d reasonably conveys what is forbidden. Nevertheless, a speaker exercising the legitimate rights of free speech may be unaware that his or her volume has reached a prohibitive level and has become unlawfully disruptive. In order, then, to provide fair notice in a case such as this, we believe that the application of \u00a7 121 ordinarily requires prior warning by police authority, so that the speaker is made aware that further communication at the offensive volume level may subject the individual to prosecution. <em>See Bacheller v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 626, 634-635, 240 A.2d 623, 628 (1967), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>397 U.S. 564, 90 S.Ct. 1312, 25 L.Ed.2d 570 (1968) (Art. 27, \u00a7 123, prohibiting disorderly conduct, gives reasonable notice through its language, at least when demonstrators are notified, before arrest, that they are in violation of statute); <em>Occhino, </em>629 F.2d at 563 (conduct held to be \u201cunreasonable\u201d where disruptive behavior continued after individual was warned that disturbance was being created); <em>Weiner, </em>230 Pa.Super. at 250, 326 A.2d at 898 (statute prohibiting \u201cloud and unseemly noise\u201d violated when Weiner continued to use loudspeaker in residential area after police had warned him that residents had been disturbed).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>As to the matter of enforcement standards, we also addressed this issue in <em>Bowers, </em>wherein we concluded that a statute is not vague</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">merely because it allows for the exercise of some discretion on the part of law enforcement and judicial officials. It is only where a statute is so broad as to be susceptible to irrational and selective patterns of enforcement that it will be held unconstitutional under this second arm of the vagueness principle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">283 Md. at 122, 389 A.2d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Section 121, properly construed, does not invite arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. It can be enforced to limit protected speech only to the extent the speaker\u2019s actions are willful, the volume clearly exceeds what is necessary to address passersby, and the noise is actually disruptive to the \u201ccaptive\u201d audience in the neighborhood. Moreover, we hold that police may act under this statute only upon receipt of a complaint from an affected citizen upon the basis of which the officer reasonably believes that the statute has been violated. <em>See Weiner, supra. </em>This requirement guards against oppressive action initiated solely by government opposition to unwelcome speech. Circumscribed in this manner \u00a7 121 does not permit a subjective determination of what is \u201cloud and unseemly noise.\u201d The inquiry is limited to relatively objective criteria and does not confer \u201cimpermissible discretion\u201d on police officers, prosecutors, judges, or juries. <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 128, 389 A.2d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">We need not dwell long on Eanes\u2019s claim that \u00a7 121 is overbroad. \u201cThe crucial question ... is whether the [statute] sweeps within its prohibitions what may not be punished under the First and Fourteenth amendments.\u201d <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 114-115, 92 S.Ct. at 2302, 33 L.Ed.2d at 231. The concern is that an overbroad statute may, by that very fact, have a chilling effect on free expression. <em>Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 U.S. at 796-798, 104 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>2124-2125, 80 L.Ed.2d at 781-782. That is, if a statute is to be struck down as overbroad, it must appear that the statute\u2019s very existence will inhibit free expression. <em>Id. </em>at 799, 104 S.Ct. at 2125, 80 L.Ed.2d at 782. The doctrine is \u201cstrong medicine\u201d and should be applied sparingly. <em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 613, 93 S.Ct. at 2916, 37 L.Ed.2d at 841. It should not be invoked when a limiting construction can be placed on the statute. <em>Id. </em>Because the overbreadth doctrine involves a challenge to the facial validity of a statute, a court should not resort to it unless there is a realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized first amendment protection of parties not before the court. <em>Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 U.S. at 801, 104 S.Ct. at 2126, 80 L.Ed.2d at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Eanes argues that \u00a7 121 is overbroad because \u201cit delegates standardless discretionary power to local authorities to permit or deny first amendment activity\u201d and \u201cbecause its prohibition against \u2018unseemly\u2019 conduct can readily ban speech on the basis of its content.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 21-22. We have already rejected these arguments at various points in this opinion and need not repeat our reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">As we have concluded, \u00a7 121 is neither without applicable enforcement standards nor can it be permissibly applied when the objection to speech is solely based on its content. What is more \u00a7 121, properly applied, reaches only that conduct which can be regulated consistent with the rights of free speech and does not reach beyond. The instant case is not unlike <em>Boos v. Barry, supra. </em>There, a provision of the District of Columbia Code was attacked as overbroad. The provision penalized any congregation of three or more persons within 500 feet of a foreign embassy, if the persons failed to disperse when ordered to do so. The Supreme Court construed the law to prohibit only \u201ccongregations\u201d directed at an embassy and to permit the police to order dispersal only when they reasonably believed that a threat to the security or peace of the embassy was present. 485 U.S. at 331, 108 S.Ct. at 1169, 99 L.Ed.2d at 350-351. As so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>construed, the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad because it was site specific and limited to groups presenting security threats. <em>Id. </em>As a consequence, it did not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. <em>Id. </em>It did not have the chilling effect that is the concern of overbreadth analysis. This is also true of \u00a7 121 as we have construed it. It is not overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">We now consider the final issues of whether \u00a7 121 was properly applied to the specific facts of this case and whether that application was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The record demonstrates that Judge Wright construed \u00a7 121 in a manner consistent with this opinion. In denying Eanes\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case, Judge Wright rejected Eanes\u2019s notion that <em>Diehl, supra, </em>limited application of \u00a7 121\u2019s prohibition against \u201cloud and unseemly noises\u201d to speech which advocated imminent lawlessness. After reviewing the words \u201cloud\u201d and \u201cunseemly,\u201d as they were defined by Judge Orth in <em>Nawrocki, supra, </em>Judge Wright concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">Courts may differ. Judges will differ. Whether they are trial judges or whether they are appellate judges in the areas of speech and protection of speech. But I think that the evidence that I\u2019ve heard which indicates basically that Mr. Eanes during this morning in question was extremely loud, louder than normal, [\u201c]one of the two loudest persons I\u2019ve ever heard in my life,[\u201d] [at a] volume above the traffic____ But that the entire commotion then caused sufficient complaints to bring the police and the police officer asking Mr. Eanes to lower his voice and lower therefore the intensity and not withstanding that Mr. Eanes shouted about money for drugs, etc. at a very high voice, could well lead to the conclusion that his actions on this morning were to willfully disturb the peace and tranquility of the neighborhood. Not caring about whom he did disturb whether it be those that may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>have been targets of the language or those of [the] general public____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">It was not the content. The content of his language really was not that which was disturbing. It is interesting that the people ... some of the people who were disturbed ... indicated that they agreed with his purposes. And I think that there is sufficient evidence to indicate that on this occasion ... Mr. Eanes was using his right to communicate ideas to not only communicate but to willfully disturb. And I think that that kind of activity is proscribed by Section 121.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">After Eanes presented his defense and closing arguments were made, Judge Wright, in his ruling from the bench, explained how the statute was to be applied.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">The statute ... talks about willful disturbance of any neighborhood by means of loud and unseemly noises. Now the loudness of Mr. Eanes\u2019 expressions ... may well be a matter of how one views it, how one hears obviously. What is loud to one person may not be loud to another ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">But the Legislature said loud. So that has to be a fact that\u2019s found. And I would find from the evidence that Mr. Eanes\u2019 method and manner of expression was on this day in May of May 18, [1988] loud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">Now the Legislature also said and unseemly noises. And we know that the Court, the trier of fact is to give that adjective its common meaning, improper. And improper of course means under the circumstances. What is proper in one situation or under one set of circumstances may be improper in another set of circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">\n<em>Because it also means in violation of accepted standards of what is right or proper. So the noises have to be loud and in violation of accepted standards of what is right or proper. Loud and improper noises, that can mean speech. Because there has to be a balancing of one\u2019s right to express himself and other\u2019s right to be free from disruption.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number><em>Now the method here is what is being tested not the words. We do know that and there\u2019s no reason to keep on it. But it is not the content of Mr. Eanes\u2019 speech. There can be no chilling of that right to express what one believes. So it\u2019s not the content that is being judged or can be judged by any governmental agency. The manner, however, can be subject to restriction. And the statute here is a method of governmental ... restriction of the manner in which somebody expresses his views. Because it cannot be loud and unseemly. That is the manner, loud and unseemly, </em>[emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Having found Eanes to be loud, Judge Wright went on to find specifically that Eanes actually disturbed both residents and area business people and that he was aware that his manner of communication was disruptive to the neighborhood. He then concluded that Eanes was \u201cguilty of willfully disturbing the peace and tranquility of that particular neighborhood during the morning of May the 18th, [1988], by making loud and otherwise unacceptable improper under the circumstances noises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We hold, in view of Judge Wright\u2019s exposition of \u00a7 121, that he properly construed \u201cloud and unseemly noise\u201d to apply only to an improper volume level of speech and not to its content. He further correctly concluded that noise that was \u201cloud and unseemly\u201d was noise that was unreasonably loud under the circumstances \u2014 among those circumstances being the fact that the noise produced by Eanes unreasonably disturbed members of a captive audience who were entitled to be free of that sort of disturbance. In other words, Judge Wright properly balanced Eanes\u2019s first amendment rights against a substantial public interest protected by a narrowly drawn, content-neutral regulation. Eanes was warned to lower his voice by a police officer whose action was based on complaints from members of the captive audience. Eanes chose not to comply. Under these circumstances, he was properly convicted of a violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY AFFIRMED.

In affirming Jerry Wayne Eanes\u2019s conviction under a statute which penalizes disturbing neighborhoods \u201cby loud and unseemly noises,\u201d the majority has construed and applied that statute in a manner inconsistent with the First Amendment. Moreover, in applying a novel construction of the statute to Eanes, the majority has violated his rights under the Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The Court\u2019s opinion points out that this case arose in the context of an anti-abortion demonstration which took place on the public sidewalk in front of the Hagerstown Reproductive Health Services Clinic on May 18, 1988. Petitioner Eanes had, however, preached there before. On July 1, 1987, when Eanes was engaged in preaching identical to that of May 18, 1988, Hagerstown police officers arrested him and charged him under Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 122. That section establishes criminal penalties for \u201c[a]ny person ... who shall wilfully act in a disorderly manner by making loud and unseemly noises ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>on or about any public place____\u201d On May 17, 1988, only one day prior to the activity which is the subject of this appeal, the Circuit Court for Washington County (Moylan, J.) granted Eanes\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. The court found that Eanes\u2019s preaching was \u201cextremely loud, very loud, certainly above the hubbub and noise of the busy street\u201d and that \u201cthe particular means that they [Eanes and his fellow preachers] were doing\u201d were \u201cdisturbing to the business people who had their businesses nearby.\u201d The court held, however, that under <em>Diehl v. State, </em>294 Md. 466, 472-473, 451 A.2d 115 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1098, 103 S.Ct. 1798, 76 L.Ed.2d 363 (1983), the phrase \u201cloud and unseemly noises\u201d could encompass communications made in a loud manner only if they presented a clear and present danger of violence, or were not intended as communications but merely as a guise to disturb other persons. The court further held that Eanes\u2019s speech was constitutionally protected under principles set forth in United States Supreme Court opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The day after his acquittal, Eanes returned to the public sidewalk in front of the clinic and resumed his preaching. A police officer, after receiving a complaint, requested that Eanes lower his voice. The officer then left the scene, later explaining at trial that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201c[t]here was a confusion among my supervisors in refer-' ence to a decision handed down by Judge Moylan the previous day and we were advised by Captain Hart to leave the area until we got a ruling from the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">After receiving another complaint about the preaching in front of the clinic, the officer returned and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALL\">\u201cwas advised that the State\u2019s Attorney stated that Moylan\u2019s decision was in reference to that case only, that if anybody was disturbing the peace and I had probable cause to make an arrest to go ahead and make an arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW-\">The officer arrested Eanes and charged him under Art. 27, \u00a7 121. That section, as previously indicated, provides criminal penalties for \u201c[a]ny person ... who shall wilfully dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>turb any neighborhood in [any Maryland] city, town or county by loud and unseemly noises----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">On December 15, 1988, the Circuit Court for Washington County (Wright, J.) found Eanes guilty of violating \u00a7 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">This Court affirms the conviction by adopting a new construction of \u00a7 121, and by retroactively applying that construction to Eanes\u2019s speech. Despite the language of the statute which, as pointed out by Judge Wright below, treats \u201cloud\u201d and \u201cunseemly\u201d as separate elements, the majority today reads the word \u201cunseemly\u201d as a modifier of \u201cloud.\u201d The Court holds that the \u201cunseemly loud\u201d noise proscribed by the statute includes unamplified political speech protected by the First Amendment, even if the speech was not likely to incite a breach of the peace.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Furthermore, the Court initially states that \u00a7 121 \u201cis not a regulation of time or place. ... As the State correctly contends, \u00a7 121 is a regulation on the manner of expression. It serves to limit, under proper circumstances, the loudness of the delivery of the communication.\u201d Majority opinion, p. 449. Later, however, the Court treats the statute as regulating in part time and place, for it says that \u201c[o]ne speaking on West Washington Street at midnight ... could run afoul of \u00a7 121 at a lower level of voice volume.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In the context of the present case, however, the majority holds that Eanes committed a crime solely because of the volume level of his speech, and not because it was delivered at the wrong time or the wrong place. If Eanes\u2019s unamplified speech was too loud for the public sidewalk in the heart of downtown Hagerstown at 10:30 a.m. on a weekday, I cannot imagine any time in any neighborhood in this State where he could lawfully reach the same volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">In addition to construing \u201cloud and unseemly\u201d to mean \u201cunreasonably loud,\u201d the majority adds elements to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>statute which go beyond anything suggested by the statutory language, legislative history, or case law. The Court holds that \u201cthe application of \u00a7 121 ordinarily requires prior warning by police authority____\u201d The Court also \u201chold[s] that police may act under this statute only upon receipt of a complaint from an affected citizen upon the basis of which the officer reasonably believes that the statute has been violated.\u201d (Majority opinion, pp. 463-464).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In my view, the' First Amendment prohibits the State from punishing Eanes for speaking against abortion on a public sidewalk in Hagerstown under the circumstances of this case. The relevant clause of Art. 27, \u00a7 121, as construed by the Court today, may not be validly applied to one in Eanes\u2019s position under the Supreme Court\u2019s First Amendment decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">At the time of his arrest, Eanes was engaged in free speech in its \u201cmost pristine and classic form.\u201d <em>Edwards v. South Carolina, </em>372 U.S. 229, 235, 83 S.Ct. 680, 683, 9 L.Ed.2d 697 (1963). He was standing on a public sidewalk outside the clinic on West Washington Street, a congested, one-way thoroughfare, probably the busiest street in downtown Hagerstown. It is U.S. Route 40 West. He was in a commercial area, a block and a half from the city\u2019s public square. Between 10:30 a.m. and noon, he and another man, who were part of a group of several protesters, alternately spoke \u201cto preach the gospel of Jesus Christ\u201d and to \u201cspeak out against abortion\u201d with their unamplified human voices.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Eanes was expressing his opposition to abortion, one of the most controversial political and social issues today. Unlike many other cases involving protests at abortion clinics, <em>there is no contention in this case that Eanes attempted to block access to the clinic. </em>He did not trespass on clinic property, did not threaten anyone, did not incite listeners to violence, and did not use profanity, ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>scenity or \u201cfighting words.\u201d Moreover, there was neither a finding nor any evidence that Eanes\u2019s speech disrupted any medical procedures at the clinic.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Unamplified speech, on a public sidewalk in a commercial area, about a controversial political and social topic, was Eanes\u2019s only activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Eanes preached his anti-abortion message in the most appropriate place and at the most appropriate time. Yet today the majority has construed and applied Art. 27, \u00a7 121, in a manner that makes the delivery of the speech a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In holding that Eanes, standing on a public sidewalk adjacent to a busy street, may be punished for speaking against abortion, the majority relies on testimony that \u201cEanes could readily be heard above the traffic noise,\u201d although the majority acknowledges that the testimony as to this was conflicting. The only meaningful exercise of the First Amendment right to free speech under the circumstances, however, is if the speaker is allowed to speak above the traffic noise. As the majority acknowledges, public streets and sidewalks have been repeatedly recognized as archetypes of traditional public forums. The government\u2019s ability to restrict expressive activity in such places \u201cwhich occupy a \u2018special position in terms of First Amendment protection\u2019 \u201d is \u201c \u2018very limited.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boos v. Barry, </em>485 U.S. 312, 108 S.Ct. 1157, 1162, 99 L.Ed.2d 333 (1988), quoting <em>United States v. Grace, </em>461 U.S. 171, 177, 180, 103 S.Ct. 1702, 1707, 1708, 75 L.Ed.2d 736 (1983). Permitting on public sidewalks only speech which cannot be heard because of the surrounding traffic noise gives little effect to this \u201cspecial position in terms of First Amendment protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The majority opinion also relies heavily upon testimony that, allegedly because of Eanes\u2019s speech, an adult and a child in nearby apartments could not sleep and some workers nearby were \u201cdisturbed\u201d and had difficulty concentrating on their work. It must be emphasized, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Eanes\u2019s speech was not delivered in a residential neighborhood and was not delivered at a time when most people are sleeping. Of course, some people do reside in commercial and even in industrial areas, and some people do need to sleep during the day. Furthermore, some people are \u201cdisturbed\u201d and may lose concentration because of any sound out of the ordinary. If constitutionally protected speech is limited to that not objected to by such persons, the scope of the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause is extremely narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">For example, speeches by public officials at an outdoor ceremony on the grounds of the Maryland State House in Annapolis may wake up persons sleeping in apartments above stores on State Circle; the speeches might affect the concentration of workers in the stores. If so, would the continuation of the speeches at the same volume, after a complaint and warning by an Annapolis policeman, be criminal? Are demonstrations outside of the State House, when the Legislature is in session, to be suppressed by criminal prosecution if the crowd becomes noisy and causes complaints from persons trying to sleep? <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Presumably under today\u2019s decision, if Art. 27, \u00a7 121, is to be enforced without discrimination, they would.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The First Amendment would seem to preclude reducing speakers and the listening public to speech which does not disturb daytime sleepers in a downtown commercial area. <em>Cf. Butler v. State of Michigan, </em>352 U.S. 380, 383-384, 77 S.Ct. 524, 526, 1 L.Ed.2d 412 (1957) (\u201cThe incidence of this enactment is to reduce the adult population of Michigan to reading only what is fit for children. It thereby arbitrarily curtails one of those liberties of the individual ... that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>history has attested as the indispensable condition for the maintenance and progress of a free society\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">In light of the Court\u2019s application of Art. 27, \u00a7 121, to the facts of this case, I fail to see what would stop a policeman from using the statute to \u201cquiet\u201d a preacher who delivers a loud sermon from inside a church that lacks air conditioning and has open windows in the summer. Such preaching, or perhaps the enthusiastic singing of the congregation, could reach the same volume level that \u201cdisturbed\u201d the residents near the clinic. I also fail to understand what would stop an elected mayor from using \u00a7 121 to \u201cquiet\u201d a political opponent from delivering a loud but unamplified campaign speech at the Hagerstown public square, located only a block and a half from where Eanes was preaching. Such a speech could disturb the very same \u201ccaptive auditors in their homes and places of businesses\u201d who were \u201can unwilling congregation for Eanes\u2019s street-preaching.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">When a particular speech is unpopular or unusual, I doubt that it will be difficult to find an affected citizen to complain, ostensibly because of the sound level. <em>See Saia v. New York, </em>334 U.S. 558, 562, 68 S.Ct. 1148, 1151, 92 L.Ed. 1574 (1948) (\u201cAnnoyance at ideas can be cloaked in annoyance at sound\u201d). At Eanes\u2019s trial, the woman who testified that her child could not sleep because of the preaching stated: \u201cI really can\u2019t say whether it [the traffic noise on West Washington Street] did or did not [bother her child\u2019s sleep]____ I mean the traffic was something that we lived with every day.\u201d This testimony demonstrates how complaints because of sound may depend on individual sensibilities. People who live in the commercial area of downtown Hagerstown, and sleep at 10:30 a.m., may get used to the traffic noise on West Washington Street. A speech on abortion, at a sound level merely sufficient to be heard, may disrupt and draw complaints from those same people who may not be used to it, or may not like it. The First Amendment, however, protects speakers from these individual sensibilities of their fellow citizens. <em>Saia v. New York, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>While holding that one may be criminally punished for unamplified speech on a political or social issue, if the speech disturbs others and generates complaints, the majority apparently would not apply its holding of criminality to the operators of machines and other equipment which may make greater noise and cause greater disturbance. The Court\u2019s opinion states (p. 456): \u201cRoad construction equipment, for example, may make a great deal of noise and may seriously disturb people in homes, hospitals, schools, and offices. But broken water mains must be repaired and streets must be maintained, and it is often the case that noisy machines are the only practicable means of achieving these objectives.\u201d Because, in the majority\u2019s view, one desiring to give a speech on a political or social issue has the option of refraining from speaking and using \u201cplacards or leaflets,\u201d the majority places more importance upon the maintenance of streets than upon free speech. Under the majority\u2019s application of Art. 27, \u00a7 121, apparently only those persons desiring to exercise their First Amendment right to .make speeches need fear prosecution under the statute. Those engaged in other endeavors producing a high volum\u00e9 of sound, such as operating noisy equipment, are apparently doing something more important and thus are exempt from the criminal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The majority\u2019s insensitivity to Eanes\u2019s free speech rights is also illustrated by its assertion that \u201c[sjound is one of the most intrusive means of communication.\u201d The majority has overlooked that sound, in the form of the spoken word, is the most basic thing protected by the First Amendment. <em>See Texas v. Johnson, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2540, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989) (\u201cThe Government generally has a freer hand in restricting expressive conduct than it has in restricting the ... spoken word\u201d). Merely because a speaker on a public sidewalk along a busy street needs to speak loudly to be heard above the surrounding noise, or merely because he attains a high level of sound because of the fervor with which his beliefs are held, does not justify the suppression of his speech. As Professor Chafee stated over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>60 years ago, repeating an earlier thought by Judge Cooley, \u201cyou cannot limit free speech to polite criticism, because the greater a grievance the more likely men are to get excited about it, and the more urgent the need of hearing what they have to say.\u201d Zechariah Chafee, <em>Freedom of Speech in War Time, </em>32 Harv.L.Rev. 932, 961 (1919). <em>See </em>T. Cooley, <em>Constitutional Limitations </em>613-614 (7th ed. 1903) (\u201cThe heat of the discussion will generally be in proportion to the magnitude of the evil as it appears to the party discussing it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The First Amendment \u201cis a declaration of national policy in favor of the public discussion of all public questions.\u201d Chafee, <em>supra, </em>at 934. Mr. Eanes\u2019s public discussion of abortion, at a permitted place and permitted time, without obstructing, trespassing, or hindering anyone, and without any sound amplification devices, was protected by the national policy embodied in the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The majority argues that \u00a7 121\u2019s clause relating to \u201cloud and unseemly\u201d noises, as construed and applied by the Court today, is valid under the Supreme Court\u2019s First Amendment cases and justifies an affirmance of Eanes\u2019s criminal conviction. I disagree. The very cases relied on in the majority opinion undermine the majority decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The Court emphasizes that, under its construction of \u00a7 121, the statute\u2019s regulation of speech is \u201ccontent-neutral.\u201d Theoretically this may be true. Nevertheless, as previously indicated, authorizing policemen to arrest a speaker, where the speaker is simply using his unamplified voice at a permitted time and place, on the sole ground that the speech is \u201ctoo loud\u201d and therefore disturbing to others, gives complainants and police authorities a powerful weapon which can easily be misused to suppress speech because of its content and because of the identity of the speaker. More traditional or \u201cacceptable\u201d speeches by public officials or prominent persons will rarely, if ever, lead to arrests, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>regardless of the volume level of speech. Mavericks may regularly have problems with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The majority acknowledges that even \u201ccontent-neutral\u201d regulations of speech, to be valid under the First Amendment, are subject to stringent requirements. A State may \u201cenforce regulations of the time, place, and manner of expression which are content-neutral, are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.\u201d <em>Perry Educ. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Assn., </em>460 U.S. 37, 45, 103 S.Ct. 948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983). <em>See, e.g., Ward v. Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 2753, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989); <em>Frisby v. Schultz, </em>487 U.S. 474, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 2500, 101 L.Ed.2d 420, 429 (1988); <em>Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, </em>468 U.S. 288, 293, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 3069, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984), and cases there cited. The pertinent clause of \u00a7 121, as now construed and applied by this Court, is not a narrowly drawn time, place or manner regulation, tailored to serve a significant government interest, and leaving ample alternative channels of communication. Instead, it is overbroad and vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Initially, the majority invokes the principle that the government has an interest in protecting its citizens from unwelcome noise, and it relies on <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism, supra, </em>109 S.Ct. at 2756; <em>Kovacs v. Cooper, </em>336 U.S. 77, 69 S.Ct. 448, 93 L.Ed. 513 (1949); <em>Saia v. New York, supra, </em>334 U.S. at 562, 68 S.Ct. at 1150-1151; and <em>Reeves v. McConn, </em>631 F.2d 377 (5th Cir.1980). These cases, however, dealt with sound amplification devices; they indicate that narrowly drawn regulation of amplified sound is permissible. The cited cases do not countenance broad regulation of unamplified speeches.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">The Supreme Court has never held that the government has a legitimate interest in controlling the volume of unamplified political or social speech delivered in an appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>place and at an appropriate time. Indeed, the cases have suggested otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The Supreme Court first confronted the relationship between the First Amendment and amplification devices in <em>Saia v. New York, supra, </em>334 U.S. 558, 68 S.Ct. 1148, where a local penal ordinance forbade the use of sound amplification devices without the permission of the Chief of Police. The appellant, a Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 minister, received a permit to use sound equipment to amplify lectures on religious subjects in a public park on Sundays. After the permit expired, his request for another one was denied on the ground that complaints had been made. When he subsequently used his equipment anyway, he was arrested and convicted. The state presented witnesses at trial who, like the witnesses at Eanes\u2019s trial, testified that they were annoyed by the sound, although not by the content, of his speeches. The Supreme Court, holding the ordinance unconstitutional, stated that the ordinance prescribed no standards for the exercise of the Chief of Police\u2019s discretion, nor was it \u201cnarrowly drawn to regulate the hours or places of use of loud-speakers, or the volume of sound (the decibels) to which they must be adjusted.\u201d 334 U.S. at 560, 68 S.Ct. at 1149. Noting that loud-speakers \u201care today indispensable instruments of effective public speech,\u201d the Court concluded that abuses created by loudspeakers would have to be controlled by narrowly drawn statutes, saying in language quite pertinent here (334 U.S. at 562, 68 S.Ct. at 1150-1151):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201cThe present ordinance would be a dangerous weapon if it were allowed to get a hold on our public life. Noise can be regulated by regulating decibels. The hours and place of public discussion can be controlled. But to allow the police to bar the use of loud-speakers because their use can be abused is like barring radio receivers because they too make a noise. The police need not be given the power to deny a man the use of his radio in order to protect a neighbor against sleepless nights. The same is true here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>\u201cAny abuses which loud-speakers create can be controlled by narrowly drawn statutes. When a city allows an official to ban them in his uncontrolled discretion, it sanctions a device for suppression of free communication of ideas. In this case a permit is denied because some persons were said to have found the sound annoying. In the next one a permit may be denied because some people find the ideas annoying. Annoyance at ideas can be cloaked in annoyance at sound. The power of censorship inherent in this type of ordinance reveals its vice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In the instant case, even if Eanes had used a loudspeaker, it is questionable whether \u00a7 121, as construed by the majority, could be constitutionally applied to him in light of the above holding in <em>Saia. </em>Section 121, as formulated by the Court today, is no more narrowly drawn than the ordinance in <em>Saia. </em>It does not specify permitted times, places, or decibels. The only standard to guide the \u201cpolice authority,\u201d who must initially give the \u201cprior warning\u201d under the majority\u2019s construction of the statute, is whether a complaint has been made and whether the police officer believes that the sound is unreasonably loud.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority, employing broad and vague standards which perhaps could not constitutionally be applied to amplified sound, uses such criteria to suppress unamplified speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">One year later, in <em>Kovacs v. Cooper, supra, </em>336 U.S. 77, 69 S.Ct. 448, the Supreme Court upheld a Trenton, New Jersey, ordinance barring sound trucks from \u201cbroadcasting in a loud and raucous manner.\u201d The appellant had used a sound truck to broadcast music and comment on a labor dispute. The opinion of three justices, announcing the judgment of the Court, pointed out that the ordinance applied only to vehicles, only to those with a sound amplifier and only to those operating on the streets. The opinion emphasized that sound trucks could still be utilized \u201cin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>places such as parks or other open spaces off the streets.\u201d 336 U.S. at 85, 69 S.Ct. at 452. The plurality opinion also indicated that absolute prohibition of sound amplification devices in the city would be \u201cprobably unconstitutional.\u201d 336 U.S. at 82, 69 S.Ct. at 451. The opinion noted that in a city like Trenton, sound trucks blaring on the streets \u201cwould be dangerous to traffic____\u201d 336 U.S. at 87, 69 S.Ct. at 453. In concluding, the opinion specifically addressed unamplified human speech which the ordinance did not prohibit (336 U.S. at 89, 69 S.Ct. at 454, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">\u201cThere is no restriction upon the communication of ideas or discussion of issues <em>by the human voice, </em>by newspapers, by pamphlets, by dodgers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In concurring, Justice Frankfurter drew the following distinction (336 U.S. at 96, 69 S.Ct. at 458, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ako\">\u201cOnly a disregard of vital differences between natural speech, <em>even of the loudest spellbinders, </em>and the noise of sound trucks would give sound trucks the constitutional rights accorded to the unaided human voice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">The ordinance in <em>Kovacs </em>was more narrowly drawn than \u00a7 121 as construed by the Court today; the <em>Kovacs </em>ordinance was limited to vehicles, was limited to sound amplification devices, and permitted the sound trucks in certain places. More importantly, however, the Supreme Court clearly drew a distinction between amplified sound and the unaided human voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">The majority relies on a recent Supreme Court sound amplification case, <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism, supra, </em>which concerned a challenge to \u201cuse guidelines\u201d for a bandshell in New York City\u2019s Central Park. The regulations required bandshell performers to use sound-amplification equipment and a sound technician provided by the city. Rock Against Racism had previously sponsored programs where it furnished the equipment and technician. The city asserted two justifications for its guidelines. The first was to control noise levels at bandshell events, in order to retain the character of a quiet area of Central Park and avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>undue intrusion into nearby residential areas. The second was to ensure the quality of sound at bandshell events.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Again, the regulations in <em>Ward </em>were much more narrowly drawn and specific than Art. 27, \u00a7 121. The <em>Ward </em>regulations specifically applied to a bandshell, in a particular location, and owned by the city. Moreover, sound amplification equipment was not proscribed; it merely had to be supplied by the city. Finally, the <em>Ward </em>regulations dealt with amplified noise, not unamplified speech on political and social issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The majority also cites <em>Reeves v. McConn, supra, </em>631 F.2d 377, for the proposition that a \u201ccity may protect citizens from unreasonable or disruptive levels of noise in streets.\u201d When the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit considered a petition for rehearing, 638 F.2d 762 (5th Cir.1981), however, it recognized the distinction between unaided and amplified sound. The court faced a challenge to an ordinance that prohibited the \u201camplification\u201d of \u201cobscene\u201d words or sounds. After accepting a construction of \u201cobscene\u201d that extended beyond erotic words and included \u201cindecent\u201d words, the court reasoned that a \u201csensible balance of these competing rights [speech and a right to have \u2018a reasonable means of avoidance\u2019] is to protect the speaker of obscene or indecent words only when he uses the unamplified voice____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764. Instead of supporting the majority\u2019s decision in the instant case, <em>Reeves </em>points the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Despite the majority\u2019s refusal to draw a distinction for First Amendment purposes between amplified sound and unamplified speech, it is clear that there is a constitutionally significant difference between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">Many other cases, including ones relied on by the majority, demonstrate that the majority\u2019s decision cannot be squared with First Amendment principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">Several Supreme Court cases undermine the majority\u2019s position that mere loudness, accompanied by complaints and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>warnings, is sufficient to justify the suppression of unamplified political speech. In <em>Edwards v. South Carolina, supra, </em>372 U.S. 229, 83 S.Ct. 680, the Supreme Court reversed the breach of the peace convictions of 187 student demonstrators. At noon the demonstrators walked to the South Carolina State House grounds, an area of two city blocks open to the public, to protest racial discrimination in the state. For thirty to forty-five minutes, they marched and carried placards as a crowd of 200 to 300 onlookers gathered on adjacent sidewalks. After apparently some complaints,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and after being warned by police authorities that they would be arrested if they did not disperse within fifteen minutes, one of the leaders delivered a \u201creligious harangue\u201d and the demonstrators loudly sang while stamping their feet and clapping their hands. The noise level caused by the 187 demonstrators, as described in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, was certainly greater than Eanes\u2019s speech. The Supreme Court stated (372 U.S. at 233, 83 S.Ct. at 682):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\">\u201cInstead of dispersing, the petitioners engaged in what the City Manager described as \u2018boisterous,\u2019 \u2018loud,\u2019 and \u2018flamboyant\u2019 conduct, which, as his later testimony made clear, consisted of listening to a \u2018religious harangue\u2019 by one of their leaders, and loudly singing \u2018The Star Spangled Banner\u2019 and other patriotic and religious songs, while stamping their feet and clapping their hands. After 15 minutes had passed, the police arrested the petitioners and marched them off to jail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The Court in <em>Edwards, </em>using language fully applicable to the present case, distinguished the situation before it from a conviction under a narrowly drawn regulatory statute (372 U.S. at 236, 83 S.Ct. at 684):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">\u201cWe do not review in this case criminal convictions resulting from the evenhanded application of a precise and narrowly drawn regulatory statute evincing a legislative judgement that certain specific conduct be limited or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>proscribed. If, for example, the petitioners had been convicted upon evidence that they had violated a law regulating traffic, or had disobeyed a law reasonably limiting the periods during which the State House grounds were open to the public, this would be a different case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">After pointing out that the First and Fourteenth Amendments do \u201cnot permit a State to make criminal the peaceful expression of unpopular views,\u201d the Court (372 U.S. at 237-238, 83 S.Ct. at 684-685) repeated its earlier language from <em>Terminello v. City of Chicago, </em>337 U.S. 1, 4-5, 69 S.Ct. 894, 896, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201c \u2018[A] function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea. That is why freedom of speech * * * js * * * protected against censorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest. * * * There is no room under our Constitution for a more restrictive view. For the alternative would lead to standardization of ideas either by legislatures, courts, or dominant political or community groups.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Two years later, in <em>Cox v. State of Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 536, 85 S.Ct. 453, 13 L.Ed.2d 471 (1965), the Supreme Court reversed the convictions of a civil rights demonstration leader for, <em>inter alia, </em>disturbing the peace. Cox had led about 2,000 students in a march to the courthouse in downtown Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to protest against discrimination and the previous day\u2019s arrest of twenty-three fellow students. At the noon demonstration, the students carried signs, sang songs and pledged allegiance to the flag. The demonstrators began to cheer loudly and clap when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>twenty-three student prisoners began to sing from their cells. After Cox encouraged the group to sit-in at stores that would not serve meals to blacks, the sheriff ordered the demonstrators to break up. They refused and were dispersed by tear gas. Authorities arrested Cox the next day. The Supreme Court viewed a film of the events and concluded that the \u201csinging and cheering do not seem to us to differ significantly from the constitutionally protected activity of the demonstrators in Edwards....\u201d 379 U.S. at 548, 85 S.Ct. at 460. In answering Louisiana\u2019s contention that the convictions should be sustained because of fears expressed by some witnesses that violence would erupt, the Court again pointed to <em>Terminello.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\"><em>Grayned v. Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972), is relied on by the majority in the instant case to support its concern for the well being of a \u201ccaptive audience,\u201d and to support its conclusion that sound \u201cis one of the most intrusive means of communication.\u201d Yet <em>Grayned </em>demonstrates the relevance of <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Cox </em>to the facts before us today. In <em>Grayned, </em>an Illinois antinoise ordinance forbad people, while on grounds adjacent to a school building, from making noises or diversions that disturb the \u201cpeace or good order\u201d of a school session or class. In holding that the ordinance was sufficiently narrowly tailored, and not unconstitutionally vague or over-broad, the Supreme Court emphasized that the ordinance was limited to grounds adjacent to a school building, was limited to times when school was in session, and, as construed by the Supreme Court of Illinois, was limited to prohibiting \u201cactual or imminent interference with the \u2018peace or good order\u2019 of the school.\u201d 408 U.S. at 111-112, 92 S.Ct. at 2301. Even with these specific time, place and manner limitations, the <em>Grayned </em>Court at one point stated that \u201cthe question is close\u201d as to whether the ordinance was \u201cimpermissibly vague.\u201d 408 U.S. at 109, 92 S.Ct. at 2299.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The statute under which <em>Eanes </em>was convicted, as construed by the majority today, has none of these time, place and manner limitations. Although the majority of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Court seems to believe that the requirement of a prior police warning helps to narrow the regulation of speech, the Supreme Court in <em>Grayned </em>indicated that police discretion in determining whether conduct was proscribed contributes to rendering a statute impermissibly vague. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Furthermore, in upholding the ordinance, the <em>Grayned </em>opinion drew a sharp distinction between noisy demonstrations adjacent to a school and noisy demonstrations elsewhere (408 U.S. at 120, 92 S.Ct. at 2305)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">\u201cNoisy demonstrations that disrupt or are incompatible with normal school activities are obviously within the ordinance\u2019s reach. Such expressive conduct may be constitutionally protected at other places or other times, cf. <em>Edwards v. South Carolina, </em>372 U.S. 229 [83 S.Ct. 680, 9 L.Ed.2d 697] (1963); <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 536 [85 S.Ct. 453, 13 L.Ed.2d 471] (1965), but next to a school, while classes are in session, it may be prohibited. The antinoise ordinance imposes no such restriction on expressive activity before or after the school session, while the student/faculty \u2018audience\u2019 enters and leaves the school.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At-\">The Supreme Court clearly indicated that \u201cnoisy demonstrations that disrupt\u201d constitute speech which enjoys constitutional protection in at least some places and some times. The majority\u2019s construction and application of Art. 27, \u00a7 121, totally ignores these words.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">At Eanes\u2019s May 17, 1988, trial, Judge Moylan noted that <em>Edwards </em>\u201cbears a resemblance to this case.\u201d He also stated that the issue in <em>Cox </em>was \u201cnot far removed from the issue or type of activity here____ There is simply the exercise by citizens of their First Amendment right.\u201d As previously indicated, the speech for which Eanes stands convicted was undoubtedly no louder than the cheering, clapping, and singing of 187 demonstrators in South Carolina whose convictions were reversed in <em>Edwards. </em>The \u201ccaptive audience\u201d in downtown Baton Rouge,, Louisiana, would not have even heard Eanes amidst the singing and cheering of 2,000 demonstrators involved in <em>Cox. </em>It is difficult for me to believe that the Supreme Court would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>have sustained convictions in <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Cox </em>based on broad statutes proscribing \u201cunseemly loud\u201d noises.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><em>Edwards, Cox, </em>and <em>Grayned, </em>read together, make it clear that authorities cannot invoke a general disorderly conduct statute like Art. 27, \u00a7 121, to suppress a speech simply because it is noisy.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">A state\u2019s interest in protecting its citizens from unwelcome noise may justify some narrowly drawn time, place and manner regulations of noise. No such regulations are being applied in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The relevant clause of Art. 27, \u00a7 121, does not itself contain any time or place regulations. While the majority\u2019s construction of the statute and reference to the \u201ccircumstances\u201d might embody a vague time and place component applicable in another case, <em>e.g., </em>a speech at midnight or in a residential neighborhood, no time or place regulation is applicable in the present case. Concededly Eanes\u2019s speech was at a permitted time and a permitted place.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">The majority believes that its formulation and application of the \u201cunreasonably loud\u201d standard, coupled with the need for a complaint and prior police warning, is a specific regulation of the \u201cmanner\u201d of speech, and \u201cis sufficiently narrowly tailored\u201d to be valid under First Amendment principles. Neither reason nor case law supports this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The standard adopted by the majority is, on its face, a vague one. As previously discussed, it lacks the objective specificity of the regulations of sound involved in cases such as <em>Kovacs v. Cooper, supra; Grayned v. Rockford, supra; Ward v. Rock Against Racism, supra; Reeves v. McConn, supra; </em>and others. For example, the <em>Kovacs </em>standard, in addition to the limitation \u201cloud and raucous,\u201d applied only to vehicles, only to amplified sound, and only to streets. The <em>Grayned </em>standard had express time and place limitations, coupled with a much more specific manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>limitation, namely actual or imminent interference with the operations of the school.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The regulation in <em>Ward </em>applied to a particular bandshell, in one specific location, and to amplified noise. No case cited by the majority, and no case of which I am aware, upholds the suppression of unamplified political speech, at a permitted time and place, under a vague \u201cunreasonably loud\u201d standard.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Further contributing to the vagueness of Art. 27, \u00a7 121, are the different meanings which the majority ascribes to the statutory phrase \u201cloud and unseemly.\u201d As I understand Part III A of the majority opinion, if the complaint (or perhaps the theory of the prosecution \u2014 I am not sure which) about a speech relates to its content, then the phrase \u201cloud and unseemly\u201d means speech advocating \u201cimminent lawless action and ... likely to incite a breach of the peace.\u201d On the other hand, if the complaint purportedly does not concern the content of the speech, then the words \u201cloud and unseemly\u201d mean \u201cthe volume level of protected speech\u201d (majority opinion, p. 445). This is a great deal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>flexibility for three little words. How such flexibility can be deemed to constitute a \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d regulation of speech is beyond my comprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In addition the statute, as construed by the majority, obviously suffers from overbreadth, as \u201cits reach ... prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d <em>Grayned v. Rockford, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 114, 92 S.Ct. at 2302. As discussed earlier, the standard employed by the majority would encompass peaceful but noisy demonstrations at the State House, like those involved in <em>Edwards v. South Carolina, supra, </em>and like those which regularly occur in Annapolis. The majority\u2019s standard would prohibit peaceful but noisy civil rights demonstrations in downtown areas, similar to those deemed constitutionally protected in <em>Cox v. Louisiana, supra. </em>The recent non-violent anti-government demonstrations in Eastern Europe, which have been generally praised in this country, would undoubtedly have constituted criminal activity if they had occurred in Maryland, under the test employed by the majority. The examples of protected First Amendment activity, potentially encompassed by the standard being applied to Eanes\u2019s speech, are endless.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In <em>State v. Swoboda, </em>658 S.W.2d 24 (Mo. 1983), the Supreme Court of Missouri held that a statute proscribing \u201cunreasonably and knowingly causing alarm to another person or persons not physically on the same premises by ... [l]oud and abusive language\u201d was unconstitutionally overbroad. Using language that is quite apt in the present case, the Supreme Court of Missouri emphasized that the statute \"can encompass virtually any expletive unreasonably and knowingly uttered at high volume and with high intensity, so long as a complainant is alarmed; vehement political discussion obviously contemplated by the first amendment could fall within the statute\u2019s proscription.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The complaint and police warning requirements, which the majority today engrafts upon the legislative enactment, do not transform the majority\u2019s \u201cunseemly loud\u201d standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>into a permissible narrowly tailored time, place or manner regulation of speech. If anything, the complaint and warning requirements may exacerbate the First Amendment problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Preliminarily, complaints and prior warnings by authorities have been present in many of the Supreme Court\u2019s cases dealing with regulations of activity protected by the First Amendment. The Court has not, to the best of my knowledge, given any weight to these factors in determining whether the regulation was constitutionally valid. <em>See, e.g., Edwards v. South Carolina, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Any time government authorities desire to suppress activity protected by the First Amendment, it will not be difficult for them to find complainants and to give prior warnings. The complaint and warning requirements add nothing to specificity. Whatever protection they might seem to provide against government overreaching is illusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Moreover, by making a complaint and a prior police warning statutory elements, the majority opens the door to discriminatory enforcement of Art. 27, \u00a7 121. Thus, if two speakers, at about the same time of day and in similar neighborhoods, reach the same volume, and persons complain only about one of them, a police officer can use \u00a7 121 only against the speaker who was the object of the complaints. While the complaints may be couched in terms of loudness, it is quite likely that the speech with \u201coffensive\u201d content will generate complaints and the speech with popular content, or by a popular speaker, will not.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Similarly, the prior police warning requirement may lead to the suppression of speech when there are policemen nearby, but if policemen do not happen to be in the area to give warnings, speech of comparable loudness, at the same times and places, will be exempt from the criminal statute. It is wholly irrational to make the violation of a criminal statute dependent upon the presence or absence of a police officer when the conduct takes place.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Furthermore, the prior warning requirement vests police officers with too much discretion to quell First Amendment protected activity. Empowering policemen to warn speakers, without any specific criteria, could lead to routine warnings having a chilling effect upon free speech. Also, provision of clear and explicit standards to guide law enforcement officers are necessary to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. <em>Smith v. Goquen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 572-573, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 1247, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974); <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 108-109, 92 S.Ct. at 2298-2299. This is particularly true when First Amendment activity is at stake. In <em>City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Pub. Co., </em>486 U.S. 750, 108 S.Ct. 2138, 100 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988), the Court held that a statute giving a mayor unbridled discretion over whether to permit news-racks was unconstitutional on its face. The Court emphasized that standards are needed to provide \u201cguideposts that check the licensor\u201d and make more difficult \u201cpost hoc rationalizations\u201d and the use of \u201cshifting or illegitimate criteria.\u201d 108 S.Ct. at 2144.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In <em>City of Houston, Texas v. Hill, </em>482 U.S. 451, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987), the Supreme Court held that a municipal ordinance making it unlawful to \u201cwilfully or intentionally interrupt a city policeman ... by verbal challenge during an investigation\u201d was unconstitutionally over-broad under the First Amendment. The Court emphasized that the ordinance \u201caccords the police unconstitutional discretion in enforcement\u201d for they would be free to arrest whom they chose out of a group of many who violate \u201cplain language\u201d of the ordinance daily. 482 U.S. at 466, 107 S.Ct. at 2512.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">As pointed out below in Part III, a person planning to make a speech in a particular manner, at a specific time and place, should be able to determine in advance whether his activity will be a crime. By making the criminality of the activity dependent upon a complaint and police warning, the speaker has no way of knowing in advance whether the delivering of his speech will be a crime. The elements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>complaint and prior warning render the vague \u201cunseemly loud\u201d standard even vaguer.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Finally, the majority\u2019s argument that its construction and application of Art. 27, \u00a7 121, allows for ample alternative avenues of communication is unpersuasive. Cases upholding narrowly tailored regulations of activity protected by the First Amendment have not required persons to forego the most basic form of free speech and choose less direct methods. Thus, the defendant in <em>Kovacs v. Cooper, supra, </em>336 U.S. at 89, 69 S.Ct. at 454, faced \u201cno restriction upon the communication of ideas or discussion of issues by the human voice____\u201d Eanes is not so fortunate. He must pursue less direct methods of communication, even though there was no finding by the trial court that he could have conveyed his message by alternative means without disturbing others. <em>See also City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 U.S. 789, 812, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2132-2133, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984), on which the majority relies, but where the Supreme Court noted that the sign control ordinance there involved \u201cdoes not affect any individual\u2019s freedom to exercise the right to speak and to distribute literature in the same place where the posting of signs on public property is prohibited,\u201d and where the Court emphasized the findings of the trial court that there were ample alternative channels of communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Making a speech on a public sidewalk, with the unamplified human voice, is the one form of communication in which virtually all of our citizens may engage, as it does not ordinarily involve expenditures of money. Many who have a message, and wish to convey it in accordance with their First Amendment right, may not be able to afford printing literature, making signs, the postage involved in mailings, telephoning, and the other \u201calternative means\u201d suggested by the majority. I flatly reject the majority\u2019s view that, because of \u201calternative means,\u201d suppression of an unamplified sidewalk speech on a political or social topic \u201cis of little consequence\u201d (majority opinion, p. 458).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Apart from the violation of Eanos\u2019s First Amendment rights, the majority\u2019s affirmance of his criminal conviction is inconsistent with basic principles of due process embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment and Art. 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In addition to the constitutional requirement that a regulation of protected speech be \u201cnarrowly tailored,\u201d considerations of due process mandate that <em>any </em>criminal statute \u201cgive the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning.\u201d <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 108, 92 S.Ct. at 2298-2299. We require a criminal statute to be sufficiently definite \u201cbecause we assume that a man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">In <em>Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. 115, 120, 123, 389 A.2d 341 (1978), Judge Levine for the Court stated that \u201c[t]he cardinal requirement is that a penal statute \u2018be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties,\u2019 \u201d (quoting from <em>Connally v. General Const. Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926)). The Court in <em>Bowers </em>also emphasized \u201cthat whenever a criminal statute may ... impact upon free speech rights, the void-for-vagueness doctrine \u2018demands a greater degree of specificity than in other contexts,\u2019 \u201d (quoting from <em>Smith v. Goquen, supra, </em>415 U.S. at 573, 94 S.Ct. at 1247). <em>See also In re Leroy T., </em>285 Md. 508, 510-512, 403 A.2d 1226 (1979) (holding that a statute prohibiting the possession of devices \u201ccommonly used ... for criminal use\u201d was unconstitutionally vague).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">For the reasons already set out in Part II above, the pertinent clause of Art. 27, \u00a7 121, as construed and applied by the majority today, does not inform a reasonable person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>what conduct will render him criminally liable. If one contemplates giving a political speech at noon in the downtown area of a Maryland city, and realizes that to be heard over the traffic noise he will have to use more than a conversational level, I do not know how he determines whether his unaided voice will be deemed \u201cunseemly loud\u201d and generate complaints. The same is true of one contemplating joining a rally of persons clapping and singing outside the State House in Annapolis. Unlike the individual in downtown Trenton, New Jersey, in 1947, who knew that the use of a sound truck on the streets would violate an ordinance and that the use of his unaided voice would be permissible <em>{see Kovacs v. Cooper, </em>supra), the Marylander today has no criteria to determine whether his speech will be criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The majority, recognizing that the statutory language as construed does not \u201cprovide fair notice,\u201d adds a prior police warning requirement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> I do not believe, however, that an unconstitutionally vague statute can be salvaged by judicially creating the mechanism of a police warning to operate on a case by case basis. <em>See Cearfoss v. State, </em>42 Md. 403, 407 (1875) (\u201cNo man incurs a penalty unless the act which subjects him to it is clearly both within the spirit and letter of the statute. Things which do not come within the words are not to be brought within them by construction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The mandate of due process is that a reasonable person should in advance be able to ascertain whether contemplated conduct violates a statute. It may be permissible in some circumstances for the meaning of a statute to be ascertained from prior reported cases, dictionaries, and oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>er sources, along with the statutory language. <em>Bowers v. State, supra, </em>283 Md. at 125, 389 A.2d at 347. Nevertheless, if a reasonable person cannot determine from these sources whether the contemplated activity is unlawful, the statute is invalid. At the very least, the vagueness cannot be cured by applying the warning requirement in the present case. <em>See Bouie v. Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 352-353, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 1702, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964) (\u201cwhere vague statutes are concerned, it has been pointed out that the vice in such an enactment cannot \u2018be cured in a given case by a construction in that very case placing valid limits on the statute\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Art. 27, \u00a7 121, as construed and applied by the Court today, violates due process in another, although related, respect. While the Ex Post Facto clauses of the federal and Maryland constitutions directly apply only to the acts of legislative bodies, a similar limitation applies to judicial action through the operation of the Due Process clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Bouie v. Columbia, supra, </em>378 U.S. at 352-354, 84 S.Ct. at 1702, explained this principle as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201cThere can be no doubt that a deprivation of the right of fair warning can result not only from vague statutory language but also from an unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of narrow and precise statutory language. As the Court recognized in <em>Pierce v. United States, </em>314 U.S. 306, 311, 62 S.Ct. 237, 239 [86 L.Ed. 226], \u2018judicial enlargement of a criminal act by interpretation is at war with a fundamental concept of the common law that crimes must be defined with appropriate definiteness.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">\u201cIndeed, an unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute, applied retroactively, operates precisely like an <em>ex post facto </em>law, such as Art. I, \u00a7 10, of the Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>tion forbids. An <em>ex post facto </em>law has been defined by this Court as one \u2018that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was <em>innocent </em>when done, criminal; and punishes such action,\u2019 or \u2018that <em>aggravates a crime, </em>or makes it <em>greater </em>than it was, when committed.\u2019 <em>Colder v. Bull, </em>3 Dall. 386, 390, 1 L.Ed. 648. [Footnote omitted.] If a state legislature is barred by the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause from passing such a law, it must follow that a State Supreme Court is barred by the Due Process Clause from achieving precisely the same result by judicial construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In <em>Bouie, </em>the Supreme Court of South Carolina had construed a statute prohibiting \u201centry upon the lands of another ... after notice from the owner or tenant prohibiting such entry\u201d to proscribe staying upon, as well as entering upon, the land after such notice. The United States Supreme Court concluded that while the construction could be valid for the future, it could not be applied retroactively. 378 U.S. at 362, 84 S.Ct. at 1707.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977), reversed convictions for, inter alia, transporting obscene materials in violation of a federal statute. The Court held that due process principles precluded retroactive application of new standards announced in <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), for distinguishing between hard core pornography and protected First Amendment expression. The <em>Miller </em>case had \u201cexpanded criminal liability\u201d in replacing the \u201cutterly without redeeming social value\u201d test with the \u201clacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\u201d test. <em>Marks v. United States, supra, </em>430 U.S. at 194, 97 S.Ct. at 994. Initially the Court in <em>Marks </em>stated (430 U.S. at 191-192, 97 S.Ct. at 992-993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKr\">\u201cThe <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause is a limitation on the powers of the Legislature, ... and does not of its own force apply to the Judicial Branch of government. ... But the . principle on which the Clause is based \u2014 the notion that persons have a right to fair warning of that conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>which will give rise to criminal penalties \u2014 is fundamental to our concept of constitutional liberty.... As such, that right is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The Court went on to emphasize that it had \u201ctaken special care to insist on fair warning when a statute regulates expression and implicates First Amendment values.\u201d 430 U.S. at 196, 97 S.Ct. at 995. The Court also emphasized that it was dealing with \u201csweeping\u201d statutory language, the reach of which \u201cnecessarily has been confined within the constitutional limits announced by this Court.\u201d 430 U.S. at 195, 97 S.Ct. at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">This Court affirms Eanes\u2019s conviction under a new construction of Art. 27, \u00a7 121, which goes far beyond the construction of the statute set forth in <em>Diehl v. State, supra, </em>294 Md. 466, 451 A.2d 115, and earlier cases. In addition, today\u2019s construction concededly adds new elements to the statute. This Court\u2019s action is clearly inconsistent with the due process principle applied in <em>Bouie v. Columbia, supra; Marks v. United States, supra; </em>and many other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In <em>Diehl v. State, supra, </em>a police officer named Vincent Gavin heard and saw the operator of an automobile squealing wheels on Main Street in Hancock, Maryland, at 10:25 p.m. He pulled the vehicle over in a supermarket parking lot and noted that it contained several people. When Robert Diehl got out on the passenger\u2019s side, Gavin ordered him to return to the vehicle. Gavin testified that Diehl began yelling such phrases as \u201cFuck you, Gavin\u201d; \u201cI know my rights\u201d; and \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d After people began to gather, Gavin arrested Diehl for \u201cscreaming obscenities ... and drawing a crowd.\u201d Diehl fled from the scene. When a state trooper found him half an hour later and dragged him to a police car, Diehl began to kick and scream. The State charged Diehl, <em>inter alia, </em>with disturbing a neighborhood by \u201cloud and unseemly noises\u201d in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 121. A jury convicted him of violating that statute and resisting arrest. This Court reversed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>convictions. We held, in an opinion by Judge Cole, that \u201cDiehl\u2019s speech ... cannot qualify as a <em>loud and unseemly noise </em>under the\u201d statute, because, \u201c[a]s speech protected by the First Amendment, Diehl\u2019s conduct must have advocated imminent lawless action and been likely to incite a breach of the peace in order to be proscribable by the State.\u201d 294 Md. at 472, 451 A.2d at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The majority today states that the <em>Diehl </em>test for \u201cloud and unseemly noise\u201d prohibited by the statute applies only where the conviction is based \u201con allegedly objectionable content,\u201d and that where the prosecution is based on \u201cloudness,\u201d the statutory phrase means \u201cunreasonably loud.\u201d (Majority opinion, Part III A). The majority justifies this reading of <em>Diehl </em>by arguing that loudness itself was not an issue in the <em>Diehl </em>case. The majority asserts that \u201c[a]t no time did the State argue that the loudness of Diehl\u2019s protestations violated \u00a7 121.\u201d <em>(Ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Preliminarily, I totally disagree with the Court\u2019s restrictive view of the issues in <em>Diehl. </em>Loudness was an issue in <em>Diehl, </em>and the Court there held that loudness itself was not proscribed by the statutory phrase. The <em>Diehl </em>opinion specifically referred to the appellant\u2019s argument that \u201cmere loudness is not enough to constitute disorderly conduct,\u201d 294 Md. at 470, 451 A.2d at 118. The State in its brief in <em>Diehl </em>argued that Diehl was both loud in his volume and unseemly in enhancing the prospect of chaos.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The State did not argue that the content of Diehl\u2019s speech was <em>per se </em>unseemly.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Moreover, our opinion in <em>Diehl </em>clearly rejected the idea that loudness alone, regardless of content, was prohibited by \u00a7 121. In reasoning that Diehl\u2019s speech was not prohibited, we pointed out that \u201chis words were chosen to express his outrage\u201d and that \u201c[e]ven the ... decibel level of this response was a communication that, although distasteful, should not have been surprising.\u201d 294 Md. at 471-472, 451 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>A.2d at 118. We directly held that \u201cthe statute is not intended to prevent [an outraged] citizen from loudly protesting,\u201d 294 Md. at 472, 451 A.2d 119. Moreover, in <em>Diehl </em>we quoted with approval from a California opinion which the majority today rejects,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> saying (294 Md. at 473, 451 A.2d at 119):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201cThe Supreme Court of California in construing the terminology of a statute regarding \u2018loud and unusual noise\u2019 held in <em>In re Brown, </em>9 Cal.3d 612, 108 Cal.Rptr. 465, 510 P.2d 1017 (1973), <em>cert. denied, California v. Brown, </em>416 U.S. 950, 94 S.Ct. 1959, 40 L.Ed.2d 300 (1974) that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u2018The statute, however, cannot be interpreted consistent with the First Amendment and traditional views as making criminal all loud shouting or cheering which disturbs and is intended to disturb persons. [Footnote omitted.] When the word noise in the statute is properly construed consistent with the First Amendment and traditional views, it encompasses communications made in a loud manner only when there is <em>a clear and present danger of violence or when the communication is not intended as such but is merely a guise to disturb persons. </em>[108 Cal.Rptr. at 469, 510 P.2d at 1021.] [Emphasis supplied.]\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">\u201cThe State\u2019s evidence failed to establish that Diehl\u2019s conduct, under the circumstances here, was unlawful under this first portion of \u00a7 121.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Regardless of whether the majority\u2019s decision is inconsistent with <em>Diehl, </em>it is clear that today\u2019s construction of \u00a7 121 is an entirely new one. In light of the statutory language, the <em>Diehl </em>opinion, and prior cases, neither Eanes nor anyone else could have anticipated the majority\u2019s present view of the statute. Until today, there has never been any suggestion that \u201cunseemly\u201d was a modifier of \u201cloud\u201d rather than a separate statutory element. Neither in Maryland nor elsewhere has a disorderly conduct statute worded like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>\u00a7 121 been construed or applied to prohibit protected speech simply because it is deemed \u201cunreasonably loud.\u201d Lastly, the \u201cstatutory\u201d elements of a complaint and prior police warning are admittedly brand new as of today.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">To adopt an unanticipated, unprecedented, and unwarranted construction of a criminal statute is bad enough. To apply that construction retroactively to Eanes\u2019s conduct is a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">In my view, Eanes was entitled to deliver an unamplified speech on the topic of abortion, from a public sidewalk in downtown Hagerstown, during the late morning. To punish as criminal the making of the speech, purportedly because it was too loud, distorts both the statute and our basic constitutional guarantees. Finally, today\u2019s holding represents great potential danger for Marylanders speaking on controversial topics.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Judges COLE and BLACKWELL have authorized me to state that they concur with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-11\">. <em>Abrams v.

In the absence of sufficient other criteria, a specification of decibels might help, depending upon the circumstances. <em>See Saia v.
