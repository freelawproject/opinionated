Michael W. Lindsey (Lindsey), following an incident in which Lindsey shot and killed the driver of a vehicle pursued for traffic violations. Subsequent to the incident, an administrative investigation was conducted which resulted in Lindsey being charged with violating the following three agency regulations:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">1) Improper Discharge of a Firearm at a Moving Vehicle: Chapter 22, Section II, Subsection 2-3C, Maryland State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Police Agency Patrol Manual;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">2) Prohibited Use of a Firearm: Chapter 22, Section II, Subsection 2-4, Maryland State Police Agency Patrol Manual; <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">3) Use of Excessive Force in Making an Arrest: Chapter 28, Section III, Subsection 2-1, Maryland State Police Agency Patrol Manual.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">On November 13, 1986, an administrative hearing board of the Maryland State Police (Board) found Lindsey guilty of violating the second regulation, and more specifically, of violating subsection 2-4a(3), which prohibits discharge of a firearm \u201cin any attempt to apprehend a misdemeanant.\u201d The Superintendent of the Maryland State Police adopted the findings and recommendation of the Board, terminating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Lindsey\u2019s employment, effective December 8, 1986. The Circuit Court for Charles County affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed holding, \u201cthe Hearing Board\u2019s conclusion that appellant violated subsection 2-4a(3) [prohibited use of a firearm] is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Apparently, the Court of Special Appeals found the Board\u2019s not guilty determination on the third count, relating to excessive force, to be inherently inconsistent with the guilty finding on the second charge. The intermediate appellate court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">First, the Hearing Board found that appellant was not attempting to apprehend the violator when he discharged the fatal shot. Second, the Hearing Board found appellant was acting in self defense when he fired the shot. In order to have been acting in self defense when using deadly force, he must have been faced with the violator\u2019s deadly force. Hence, the Hearing Board implicitly found that the violator was not a misdemeanant but a felon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYc\">We granted certiorari to consider the administrative appeal standard of review as applied in this case. Under the circumstances, we conclude the Court of Special Appeals improperly substituted its interpretation of the merits of the charges for that of the Board. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Lindsey\u2019s main contention is that the findings and contentions of the Board were not supported by substantial evidence. The factual background of this case involves an extensive police chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">On December 18, 1985 at approximately 11:30 P.M., Tfc. Michael White (White) was traveling southbound in an unmarked vehicle on Maryland Route 5 in Charles County, Maryland. While stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of Route 5 and Mattawoman-Beantown Road, he observed a white Pinto in the left-hand turn lane proceed through a red light. White activated his emergency equipment, first the emergency lights and then an electronic siren, in an effort to stop the driver for the traffic violation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>The Pinto continued and made a turn onto Pinewood Road, and a short distance later travelled down the wrong side of this road. The Pinto\u2019s initial speed was estimated at 35 miles per hour. White testified he then radioed the Waldorf Barrack and gave the duty officer a description of the vehicle, the tag number, and informed that officer of the fact that the vehicle was not stopping. White testified he observed other police vehicles join in the pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Lindsey, operating unit \u201cH-14,\u201d caught up with White and the Pinto on Mattawoman-Beantown Road near the Idlewood Trailer Park. As they proceeded up Mattawoman-Beantown Road, Lindsey attempted to pass the suspect vehicle on the left-hand side in an attempt to cut the vehicle off, at which time the suspect vehicle made an abrupt move to the left. Lindsey was required to take evasive action and dropped back behind the suspect vehicle. When the vehicles reached the intersection of Mattawoman-Beantown and Route 5, the Pinto took the northbound spur on Route 5, and proceeded up a grassy embankment and then back down onto Route 5. Meanwhile, Lindsey had passed a civilian vehicle in the spur on the left side and emerged in front of the Pinto. At that moment, Lindsey heard three loud pops and then a radio transmission, \u201cwatch it, he is shooting at you.\u201d The Pinto accelerated to a higher rate of speed toward the rear of Lindsey\u2019s vehicle. Lindsey testified he heard someone state, \u201cwatch it, he is going to hit you or he is trying to hit you, something to that effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The Pinto veered across the grassy median strip, proceeding northbound in the southbound lanes of Route 5. Lindsey then fired four shots from his service revolver at the right rear tire of the Pinto in an attempt to disable the vehicle. The Pinto still refused to stop and led the pursuing police officers to the back of Thomas Stone High School and crossed the parking lot at the rear of the high school where it eventually ran into a fence, coming to rest at an acute angle. White\u2019s vehicle stopped a short distance behind the Pinto at the same angle. Lindsey pulled his vehicle to the right of the Pinto with Officer Appleby\u2019s vehicle stopping behind Lindsey.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>White, who was the first to arrive on the scene, was in the process of making the arrest. Lindsey arrived moments later. As Lindsey exited his vehicle, he withdrew his service revolver. The suspect had already exited his vehicle and was attempting to flee over the fence. Lindsey shouted at him to freeze. The suspect descended from the fence and allegedly made a turning motion toward his right in the direction of Lindsey. Lindsey fired a single shot from his service revolver, striking the suspect in the back.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The suspect later died as a result of the gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Lindsey related his thought-process during the incident to the Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">[Whoever] the guy was, he was running from something, and I don\u2019t know what Mike White had tried to stop him for, ... until I found out later. He was running from something, he had already tried to run me off the road twice, somebody told me, a professional police officer was behind me, told me I was being shot at, tells me that he saw something cause I didn\u2019t see it, that he would try almost anything to get away. Cause he didn\u2019t want to be caught. I don\u2019t know if he had a stolen car ... I didn\u2019t really have any idea what he had done and ..., again, I didn\u2019t know if he had just stolen the car, if he had just killed somebody or what, but he evidently did not want to be caught.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Lindsey further testified, \u201cI didn\u2019t see his hands, I don\u2019t know what he was doing. I figured ... after being told that I was shot at, he was going after a weapon of some type.\u201d Lindsey stated that not only did he fear for his own safety, but also the safety of White and other officers at the scene. He had previously testified he never visualized anything which would indicate the suspect was carrying or holding a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>White testified that as he came through the spur off Mattawoman-Beantown Road onto Route 5, Lindsey pulled out in front of the Pinto. He heard what sounded like a gunshot. He then saw the Pinto increase its speed in what appeared to him to be an attempt to ram Lindsey\u2019s vehicle. White announced over the radio, \u201cis he shooting at you or are you shooting at him?\u201d He further testified that he was unsure as to the exact language used in this transmission. He also testified that he stated over the police radio, \u201cto watch out, he is going to try to ram you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">As to the incident at the school, White testified that as Lindsey fired the shot he hit the ground and did not refocus his attention on the suspect until he had gotten back up off of the ground. He did not clearly observe the suspect at the time of the incident. White estimated Lindsey was at least 20 feet away from the suspect at the time the shot was fired. It is significant to note that White did not carry a revolver in attempting to apprehend the suspect. White did not feel threatened because \u201cI could see both of his hands and I was able to see that he didn\u2019t have anything in his hands at that time.\u201d White never viewed the suspect\u2019s hands lower than the top rail of the six foot fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Appleby, another officer on the scene, testified that he observed the suspect vehicle during the course of the chase up Mattawoman-Beantown Road attempt to strike Lindsey\u2019s vehicle. He also observed the suspect vehicle attempt to strike Lindsey\u2019s vehicle on Route 5. Appleby went on to testify that when they reached the rear of the high school and as his vehicle came to a stop, he observed the suspect getting out of his vehicle and heard someone saying freeze or stop. He observed the suspect going up to the fence, jumping on to the fence, falling back down off of the fence, pulling his hands down, and turning in the direction of his vehicle and towards Lindsey. At that instant, he glanced down to unhook his seatbelt when he heard the gunshot. Appleby further testified he could not clearly see the suspect at the time of the shooting because of darkness. Appleby stated, however, he observed the suspect\u2019s hands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>were about chest high and his elbows were against his body. He did not see a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The defense also called Tfc. Williamson (Williamson). He testified that at the time of the incident he was listening to the radio transmissions of his fellow troopers in connection with the chase. Williamson heard White say that the suspect was shooting at Lindsey and left his position to render assistance in the chase. Williamson further testified that when he arrived on the scene Lindsey was upset and kept repeating that he heard over the radio that they were shooting at him and he thought the man had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In finding Lindsey guilty of the second charge, the Board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">[T]he Board finds by a preponderance of evidence, that on December 19, 1985, Tfc. M.W. Lindsey fired a shot from his service revolver at an unarmed suspect with his hands raised. We feel Tfc. Lindsey may have felt he was in danger; however, we feel his fears were not reasonable due to the following facts: There was much confusion as to what was said over the police radio during the chase in regard to gunshots and to their location of occurrence____ Testimony from Tfc. White indicated that he had no fear for his life and was attempting to apprehend Morris without his weapon drawn. Two of the witnesses testified that during the time immediately before Tfc. Lindsey fired, Morris did not bring his hands below his shoulders which would pose less of a threat and could possibly have been an act of submission. '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The Board separately found Lindsey not guilty of using excessive force under Chapter 28, Section III, Subsection 2-1, reasoning, \u201cthere was no evidence that Lindsey was attempting to prevent an escape. All evidence hinged on protecting himself from harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The standard of review of the Maryland State Police Hearing Board\u2019s decision is set forth in the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act. Maryland Code (1984), State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Government Article, \u00a7 10-215. Subsection (g)(3) provides that the reviewing court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision of the agency:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">In our assessment of whether the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we traditionally apply the rule that substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>State Election Bd. v. Billhimer, </em>314 Md. 46, 58, 548 A.2d 819, 825 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. - \u2014 -, 109 S.Ct. 1644, 104 L.Ed.2d 159 (1989); <em>Supervisor v.

We also must review the agency\u2019s decision in a light most favorable to the agency, since \u201cdecisions of administrative agencies are prima facie correct,\u201d <em>Bulluck, supra, </em>283 Md. at 513, 390 A.2d at 1124; <em>Hoyt v. Police Comm\u2019r, </em>279 Md. 74, 88-9, 367 A.2d 924, 932 (1977), and \u201ccarry with them the presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Bullock, supra; Dickinson-Tidewater, Inc. v. Supervisor, </em>273 Md. 245, 256, 329 A.2d 18, 25 (1974); <em>Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. 372, 378-9, 45 A.2d 73, 76 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><em>Billhimer </em>further described the substantial evidence test as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">[T]he test is a deferential one, requiring \u2018restrained and disciplined judicial judgment so as not to interfere with the agency\u2019s factual conclusions,\u2019 <em>Asbury Methodist, supra, </em>313 Md. at 625, 547 A.2d at 195; <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Nat\u2019l Bureau, </em>248 Md. 292, 309-10, 236 A.2d 282, 289 (1967). This deference applies not only to agency fact-finding, but to the drawing of inferences from the facts as well. <em>St. Leonard Shores Joint Ven. v. Supervisor, </em>307 Md. 441, 447, 514 A.2d 1215, 1218 (1986); <em>Bulluck, supra, </em>283 Md. at 513, 390 A.2d at 1124; . <em>Snowden, supra, </em>224 Md. at 448, 168 A.2d at 392. When, however, the agency\u2019s decision is predicated solely on an error of law, no deference is appropriate and the reviewing court may substitute its judgment for that of the agency. <em>Washington Nat\u2019l Arena v. Comptroller, </em>308 Md. 370, 378-79, 519 A.2d 1277, 1281-82 (1987); <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 834-36, 490 A.2d 1296, 1301-02 (1985). In brief, so long as the agency\u2019s decision is not predicated solely on an error of law, we will not overturn it if a reasoning mind could reasonably have reached the conclusion reached by the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">314 Md. at 58, 548 A.2d at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">We conclude the Court of Special Appeals misapplied the substantial evidence test in this case. The finding of guilt on the firearm charge (Subsection 2-4a.(3)) is supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>might accept as adequate.\u201d The Board\u2019s decision was not predicated on an error of law but was rather based upon an interpretation of the facts and the inferences drawn therefrom. The Board\u2019s judgment and expertise as to the impropriety of Lindsey\u2019s use of a firearm must be given great deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The Court of Special Appeals focused on two points in reaching its conclusion: 1) the Board failed to make a finding of fact of whether the suspect was a misdemeanant and that Lindsey reasonably knew that the violator was a misdemeanant; 2) that the Board\u2019s verdict was inconsistent with the finding of not guilty on another charge. The intermediate appellate court\u2019s analysis on both points is erroneous. Its analysis represents one possible evaluation of the facts and inferences contained in the record, but certainly is not the only reasonable interpretation. It was the responsibility of the Board to resolve any conflicting inferences arising from the factual record. The Court of Special Appeals improperly substituted its judgment of the merits of the charges in place of the Board\u2019s final conclusion. In order to conclude there was an inconsistency in the Board\u2019s findings, the intermediate appellate court necessarily reevaluated the factual record, and applied its judgment of the most reasonable inferences available. We are unpersuaded that the alleged inconsistency in the Board\u2019s ruling on the other charges warrants reversal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It follows that the decision of the Board and the judgment of the Circuit Court must be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
