The stop was based on possession of beer by minors. The frisk of the petitioner, Robert Lee Simpler (Simpler), produced a bong.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This resulted in Simpler\u2019s arrest, a search incident, and discovery of a small quantity of marijuana. After denying a motion to suppress, the Circuit Court for Cecil County convicted Simpler of possession of marijuana. Simpler appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which affirmed in an unreported opinion. We granted Simpler\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. As hereinafter explained, Simpler\u2019s challenge to the frisk is dispositive. Essentially, there was a lack of reasonable suspicion that Simpler was armed and dangerous when frisked.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The relevant facts are limited to those produced at the suppression hearing, <em>see Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 521 A.2d 749 (1987), which are most favorable to the State as the prevailing party on the motion. Around 8:30 P.M. on May 8,1987, Sergeant Guy Wassmer (Wassmer) of the Cecil County Sheriff\u2019s Department was in uniform and on routine patrol in the vicinity of the Winding Brook Housing Project. Riding with Wassmer in the patrol car was a young man who was an explorer scout. Wassmer saw black smoke coming from a wooded area behind the project. In order to investigate, Wassmer and the explorer scout walked toward the smoke about one half mile on a semi-clear path through the woods. They came upon a group of four young people, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>three males and a female, who were standing around an open fire and drinking Busch beer. Some of the individuals appeared to Wassmer to be underage.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">On direct examination by the State at the hearing, Wassmer testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201cI approached them and advised them of who I was ... and requested identification from each individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">\u201cQ. And in the process of obtaining identification from each individual that was there, what if any further action did you take with regard to protecting yourself and the explorer scout that was in your company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">\u201cA. I briefly patted down each subject, except for the female.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">\u201cQ. And when it came time to pat down the Defendant Simpler, what if anything did you notice or what if anything occurred at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">\u201cA. I found what I believed to be a marijuana pipe in his rear pocket with marijuana residue on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Wassmer seized the pipe and arrested Simpler. Wassmer then observed a jacket lying on a fallen log approximately five to eight feet from Simpler. Addressing the group generally, Wassmer asked who owned the jacket. Simpler said it was his. Wassmer testified that, in a search of the jacket, he found a plastic baggie containing marijuana.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">On cross-examination Wassmer related that he had had only one prior contact with Simpler when Wassmer was on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>call with another deputy. Wassmer did not even know Simpler\u2019s last name. Simpler\u2019s ID demonstrated that he was twenty-one years of age. (Simpler\u2019s date of birth is August 4, 1965.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">When defense counsel suggested that Wassmer was actually looking for drugs when he conducted the frisks, Wassmer said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">\u201cI had information that Mr. Simpler carried a knife. It\u2019s one of the kinds of knives that\u2019s used to cut carpet. My prior contact with Mr. Simpler, I had him in my car, and like I told you before, I didn\u2019t know his last name. But when he got into my car on a prior occasion, I asked him if he had any weapons on him, and he showed me that he had this knife that cuts carpet, carpeter\u2019s knife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The earlier occasion when Wassmer was in Simpler\u2019s presence was \u201cjust a contact,\u201d and not a \u201cconfrontation.\u201d Although Wassmer frisked all the males and, by consent, searched the female\u2019s pocketbook, he had no information that any person in the group, other than Simpler, had ever previously carried any type of knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Wassmer further testified on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. Now, you\u2019re saying you feared for your safety?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">\u201cA. Yes. I don\u2019t actually fear for my safety, but as a matter of routine caution, and departmental policy in transporting people, he would be frisked to make\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">\u201cQ. In transporting people?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-12\">\u201cQ. And at that time he was over 21 and you had no intention of transporting him, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-13\">\u201cA. At that time, no, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">Wassmer issued citations for the \u201cjuvenile subjects\u201d for possession of alcoholic beverages and arrested Simpler for possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">Hon. George B. Rasin, Jr., presiding at the suppression hearing, made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\u201cSo I think a step at a time, reviewing the progression of what the officer did ... was normal for a police officer to do. He made an investigation. He observed what appeared to be a violation of the law so far as juveniles were concerned. And I believe it\u2019s also somewhere a violation of either the juvenile law or the criminal law, furnishing alcohol to minors is also an offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">\u201cAnd it\u2019s normal for the officer to pat down those who were there, his training, it\u2019s normal for him if he observed something that people don\u2019t usually carry in their pockets, or if they do it\u2019s a bulky thing and the officer wants to know what it is, going in the pocket he observes something that appears to be paraphernalia. And based on his training, the inference is that he took the Defendant into custody, in effect he was arrested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The sequence of events bears on the statutory violations on which Wassmer could have acted, but the sequence is not precisely set forth in the record. If Wassmer frisked Simpler before examining Simpler\u2019s ID, Wassmer, at the time of the frisk, could have had reasonable suspicion that Simpler was under age twenty-one and possessing alcoholic beverages in violation of Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 400A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If Wassmer examined Simpler\u2019s ID before the patdown, then Wassmer could have had reasonable suspicion that Simpler had obtained the beer for the juveniles in violation of Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 401.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Sections 400A and 401 are codified under the subheading, \u201cAlcoholic Beverages \u2014 Offenses.\u201d Section 403A of that same subheading provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">\u201c(a) <em>Person under 18. </em>\u2014 Any person under the age of 18 years who violates the provisions of this subheading shall be issued a citation by a police officer authorized to make arrests and shall be subject to the procedures and dispositions provided in Subtitle 8 [Juvenile Causes] of Title 3 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">\u201c(b) <em>Person 18 or older. </em>\u2014 Any person 18 years old or older who violates the provisions of this subheading shall be issued a citation and be subject to the provisions of \u00a7 403B of this subheading.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Disposition of \u201cAlcoholic Beverages \u2014 Offenses\u201d is described in \u00a7 403B. \u201cFor purposes of [that] section, a violation of the provisions of [that] subheading is deemed a Code violation and is a civil offense.\u201d \u00a7 403B(a). A citation is to be issued to the person committing a Code violation. \u00a7 403B(b). The citation advises, <em>inter alia, </em>that the District Court of Maryland will send a summons to appear for trial to the person receiving the citation. \u00a7 403B(e)(vii). In May 1987 the maximum fine for a first offense was $100. \u00a7 403B(f). Subsection (g) provides that \u201c[adjudication of a Code violation is not a criminal conviction for any purpose, nor does it impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by a criminal conviction.\u201d Under subsection <em>(l), </em>however, \u201c[t]he State\u2019s Attorney of any county may prosecute a Code violation in the same manner as prosecution of a violation of the criminal laws of this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Thus, when Wassmer frisked Simpler, the most serious violation by Simpler of which Wassmer might have had reasonable suspicion was a civil offense for which the maximum fine, for all that Wassmer knew at the time, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>$100.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Assuming that Wassmer reasonably suspected that Simpler had obtained beer for minors, Wassmer was authorized to \u201cstop\u201d the persons gathered around the fire in order to obtain identification and to issue citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">But issuance of a citation is not a custodial arrest, and the frisk in this case is not a search incident to an arrest. Here, there was no objective basis for a custodial arrest of Simpler at the time of the frisk, and there was at that time no anticipated need to transport Simpler from the scene. The arrest in this case is based on the discovery of paraphernalia (either with or without controlled dangerous substance traces) during the patdown. The question presented here is whether, under all of the circumstances, the frisk which followed the stop was constitutionally permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The holding of <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1884-85, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 911 (1968) is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUc\">\u201cwhere a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous, where in the course of investigating this behavior he identifies himself as a policeman and makes reasonable inquiries, and where nothing in the initial stages of the encounter serves to dispel his reasonable fear for his own or others\u2019 safety, he is entitled for the protection of himself and others in the area to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">And <em>see Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1034, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 3473, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201, 1210 (1983) (a police officer may neutralize the threat of physical harm \u201cwhen he possesses an articulable suspicion that an individual is armed and dangerous.\u201d); <em>Ybarra v. Illinois, </em>444 U.S. 85, 92-93, 100 S.Ct. 338, 343, 62 L.Ed.2d 238, 246 (1979) (\u201cA reasonable belief that [the suspect] was armed and presently dangerous [is] a belief which this Court has invariably held must form the predicate to a patdown of a person for weapons.\u201d (Footnote omitted)); <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 64, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1903, 20 L.Ed. 917, 935 (1968) (\u201cIn the case of the self-protective search for weapons, [the police officer] must be able to point to particular facts from which he reasonably inferred that the individual was armed and dangerous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The suspected criminal activity itself can furnish the dangerousness justifying a frisk following a <em>Terry </em>stop. Professor La Fave puts it this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">\u201cIt is undoubtedly true, however, that in some cases the right to conduct a protective search must follow directly from the right to stop the suspect. The Court seems to take this view in <em>Terry, </em>although Justice Harlan\u2019s concurring opinion proceeds to \u2018make explicit what I think is implicit\u2019 in the majority opinion, namely, that \u2018the right to frisk must be immediate and automatic if the reason for the stop is, as here, an articulable suspicion of a crime of violence.\u2019 Lower courts have been inclined to view the right to frisk as being \u2018automatic\u2019 whenever the suspect has been stopped upon the suspicion that he has committed, was committing, or was about to commit a type of crime for which the offender would likely be armed, whether the weapon would be used to actually commit the crime, to escape if the scheme went awry, or for protection against the victim or others involved. This includes such suspected offenses as robbery, burglary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>rape, assault with weapons, homicide, and dealing in large quantities of narcotics.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">3 La Fave, <em>Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment </em>\u00a7 9.4(a), at 505-06 (1987) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Judge Moylan, writing for the Court of Special Appeals, has succinctly pointed out that \u201c[although a reasonable \u2018stop\u2019 is a necessary predecessor to a reasonable \u2018frisk,\u2019 a reasonable \u2018frisk\u2019 does not inevitably follow in the wake of every reasonable \u2018stop.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gibbs v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 230, 238-39, 306 A.2d 587, 592 (footnote omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 759 (1973). Professor La Fave has listed a number of cases where the permissible stop has not justified the succeeding frisk. Without necessarily implying our agreement with each of the cases cited, we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201cBut for other types of crimes, such as trafficking in small quantities of narcotics, possession of marijuana, illegal possession of liquor, prostitution, bookmaking, shoplifting, underage drinking, minor assault without weapons, or vagrancy, there must be, as Justice Harlan noted in <em>Terry, </em>\u2018other circumstances\u2019 present. Illustrative of the circumstances which the courts have deemed sufficient are: a characteristic bulge in the suspect\u2019s clothing; observation of an object in the pocket which might be a weapon; an otherwise inexplicable sudden movement toward a pocket or other place where a weapon could be concealed; awareness that the suspect had previously been engaged in serious criminal conduct; awareness that the suspect had previously been armed; discovery of a weapon in the suspect\u2019s possession; and awareness of circumstances which might prompt the suspect to take defensive action because of a misunderstanding of the officer\u2019s authority or purpose. Also, in an otherwise doubtful case the frisk may be justified by the fact that the investigation requires transporting the suspect in the police car to another location.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">La Fave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9.4(a), at 507-08 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The underage drinking case referred to is <em>People v. Sherman, </em>197 Colo. 442, 593 P.2d 971 (1979). There, two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Denver police officers at about 11:00 P.M. observed four apparently underage youths carrying beer bottles on a public street. The officers stopped the youths, received proof of identification and conducted patdown searches in the course of which the defendant was found to be carrying approximately one hundred phenobarbital pills. The trial court suppressed the seized pills after concluding that there was no rational basis for suspecting that the defendant was armed. The Supreme Court of Colorado affirmed without unnecessary discussion of what was essentially a finding of fact. From the standpoint of the law of stop and frisk the case stands for the proposition that a stop for underage drinking does not of itself justify a frisk. There would have to be additional circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Two decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States illustrate additional circumstances. In <em>Michigan v. Long, supra, </em>two police officers on patrol in a rural area, after midnight, observed an automobile traveling erratically and at excessive speed. The car went off the road and stopped in a shallow ditch. As the police approached on foot the suspected drunk driver was standing at the rear of the vehicle. Through the open front left door of the car, the police saw a large hunting knife on the floor of the vehicle. At that time the officers frisked the suspect. 463 U.S. at 1036, 103 S.Ct. at 3474, 77 L.Ed.2d at 1211. In <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977) (per curiam), the police stopped a vehicle because its license plates had expired. When the driver got out of the car at the direction of the officers, they noticed a bulge under the driver\u2019s coat. \u201cThe bulge in the jacket permitted the officer to conclude that Mimms was armed and thus posed a serious and present danger to the safety of the officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 98 S.Ct. at 334, 54 L.Ed.2d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The instant matter is analogous to stops of vehicles for minor traffic violations in that the stop is for the purpose of issuing a citation. Further, as in the case of a motorist who has been directed to get out of the vehicle, <em>see Mimms, supra, </em>Simpler and the three juveniles were standing in full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>view. While there undoubtedly is some risk to the police in every confrontation, <em>Terry </em>has never been thought to authorize a protective frisk on the occasion of every authorized stop. The very minor offense authorizing the stop here cannot, in and of itself, justify the frisk. To so hold would mean that every motorist issued a citation for a minor traffic offense would enjoy no constitutional protection from a protective search for weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The State in this case urges, and the Court of Special Appeals agreed, that Wassmer\u2019s knowledge that Simpler had carried a carpeter\u2019s knife on a prior occasion supplied sufficient additional circumstances to justify the frisk. But Wassmer\u2019s description of the earlier occasion when he was in Simpler\u2019s presence is devoid of any aspect of dangerousness. The record does not describe the carpet knife. The necessary inference is that it is a knife which may lawfully be carried, just as the ordinary pocket knife may lawfully be carried. On the earlier occasion, Wassmer, knowing that Simpler had the knife in his possession, continued whatever their conversation was within the close confines of a police car. There is no indication that Simpler was hostile toward Wassmer, or police officers generally, based on the prior contact between the two. There is no evidence of what Simpler\u2019s employment was, whether the knife was a job tool, or whether the contact took place at a job site during working hours. There is no evidence indicating that Simpler regularly carried the knife. This evidence of prior contact added to the civil offense does not justify the frisk in this case. To hold otherwise would mean that the police could constitutionally frisk every motorist to whom a citation was issued for a minor traffic violation if the officer knew that the motorist on some prior occasion had carried a pocket knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The circuit judge at the suppression hearing did not seem to sustain the frisk based on the evidence that Simpler had previously carried a carpet knife. Rather, the circuit judge found that it was \u201cnormal for the officer to patdown those who were there, his training____\u201d This finding does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>distinguish between the patdowns of Simpler and of the underage males. The finding echoes Wassmer\u2019s testimony that the patdowns were \u201ca matter of routine caution.\u201d Underlying the testimony and the finding is the notion that any lawful stop justifies a frisk. As we have seen above, that is not the law. Rather, the burden was on the State at the suppression hearing to demonstrate that the seizure fell within one of the well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>See State v. Wilson, </em>279 Md. 189, 194, 367 A.2d 1223, 1227 (1977). This the State failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO ENTER A JUDGMENT VACATING THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CECIL COUNTY AND REMANDING THIS CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CECIL COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS, IF ANY, CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

There is a conflict between the State\u2019s evidence at the suppression hearing and the agreed statement of facts on which the conviction was based. In the agreed statement the defense acknowledged that a bong was found in Simpler\u2019s pants pocket during the patdown, but the defense denied that that was the pipe in which the presence of marijuana was confirmed by laboratory analysis. The defense says that a second bong was found in the jacket. It is the marijuana residue in the second bong of which Simpler admitted possession in the agreed statement. The agreed statement of facts did not admit that the baggie of marijuana was found in Simpler\u2019s jacket. The defense evidence at the suppression hearing was that the baggie had been found lying on the ground a short distance from the jacket. The trial judge (Hon. Donaldson C. Cole, Jr.) based his guilty verdict on the admissions concerning marijuana in a bong found in the jacket.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\">.
