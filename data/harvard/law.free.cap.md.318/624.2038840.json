ORTH, Jr.,</author>\n<p id=\"AeI\">Judge, Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">Edward Victor sustained a disability resulting from an accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>his employment by Proctor &amp; Gamble Manufacturing Company. He was entitled to compensation as prescribed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Maryland Code (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.), Art. 101.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Victor was awarded compensation for temporary total disability, and, later, was granted a supplemental award for permanent partial disability. Shortly before the award for permanent partial disability, at age 62 years and physically able to work, he voluntarily retired from his employment at Proctor &amp; Gamble, whereupon he received $250,000 under a profit-sharing plan and his regular social security benefits. His physical ability to work continued until 29 December 1988 when his work-related condition worsened, causing him to be temporarily totally disabled. Upon Victor\u2019s petition, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission reopened the case and, upon hearing, awarded temporary total disability from 29 December 1988 \u201cand continuing.\u201d It ordered, however, that the payment of the award be suspended pending any appeal</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKC\">[b]ecause this case involves the novel issue of whether temporary total benefits, which are awarded until maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>mum medical improvement is reached, are unavailable to a claimant who has voluntarily retired. . . .[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Proctor &amp; Gamble appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City which reversed the Commission. The circuit court judge jettisoned the award of temporary total disability granted by the Commission on his determination that \u201cthe purpose of Art. 101, \u00a7 36(2) is to compensate a worker for wages he has lost due to injury.\u201d He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">The Worker\u2019s Compensation statute is not designed to provide extra retirement benefits to a claimant who has voluntarily removed himself from the work force. In this case, Claimant voluntarily retired in 1986 and subsequent to that time petitioned to reopen due to worsening of condition of his knee. It is beyond dispute that had claimant still been working, he would have received temporary total benefits for the period of time it took for him to heal or for the time he was wholly disabled and unable to work. Because Claimant retired, however, he was not going to be able to work or to earn wages even after his injury had healed. Due to his retirement, he had no expectation of receiving wages upon a return to work. Therefore, this Court concludes that a claimant who has voluntarily retired is not entitled to temporary total disability after retirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Victor noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and prayed that this Court issue a writ of certiorari. We certified the case to us before decision by the intermediate appellate court. The petition for certiorari posed the question</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">whether in a worker\u2019s compensation case a claimant who has voluntarily retired is entitled to temporary total disability benefits after retirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">We have not addressed this issue before, and, to resolve it, we rely on the language of the statute in the context of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>the goals and objectives it seeks to achieve. <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v.

We have recognized those legislative declarations in the many cases concerning the Act which have come before us.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFd\">The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was passed to promote the general welfare of the State and to prevent the State and its taxpayers from having to care for injured workmen and their dependents, when under the law as it previously existed, such workmen could not recover damages for their injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\"><em>Paul v.

Steel Products Co., </em>190 Md. 374, 379, 58 A.2d 684 (1948). The Act shall be so interpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose. Art. 101, \u00a7 63; <em>Wiley Mfg. Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. 200, 217, 373 A.2d 613 (1977). And in our consideration of the propriety of the action of the Commission, we are mindful that the Commission, not bound by \u201cthe usual common law or statutory rules of evidence or by any technical or formal rules of procedure,\u201d other than provided by the Act, is \u201cto ascertain the substantial rights of the parties and to carry out justly the spirit of this article.\u201d Art. 101, \u00a7 11. Furthermore, in any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under the Act, there is, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, a presumption by legislative command that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>claim comes within the provisions of the Act. Art. 101, \u00a7 64(a). The short of it is that the Act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtL\">should be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes. Any uncertainty in the law should be resolved in favor of the claimant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><em>Walls, </em>288 Md. at 530, 418 A.2d 1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">It is clear on the face of the Act that entitlement to compensation is based on an accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment, generally without regard to fault, which injury results in the employee\u2019s disability or death. Art. 101, \u00a7 15 <em>(see </em>note 1, supra). Whether the injury be permanent and total, \u00a7 36(1), or temporary and total, \u00a7 36(2), or permanent and partial, \u00a7 36(3), or temporary and partial, \u00a7 36(5), it is the \u201cdisability\u201d arising from the injury that calls for the compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits are referenced to disability throughout the Act. This is so not only in \u00a7 15 prescribing the duties of employers and in \u00a7 36 establishing amounts of compensation for the categories of injuries, but, for example, in \u00a7\u00a7 22 and 23 (disability from occupational disease); \u00a7 25A (occupational deafness); \u00a7 26 (duty of employee and employer to report disability from occupational disease); \u00a7 32 (agreements between railroads and employees for payment of compensation) \u00a7 35 (compensation to prisoners); \u00a7 39 (application for compensation); \u00a7 40(b) (readjustment of compensation upon aggravation of disability). Section 49A, concerning lump sum payments, speaks in terms of \u201cdisability benefits.\u201d The question is what the legislature intended by the word \u201cdisability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Although \u201cdisability\u201d with respect to an injury arising from an industrial accident is not defined in the Act, in the light of the legislative and judicial pronouncements of the purposes of the Act, the Act\u2019s mandate as to how it shall be interpreted and construed, the statutory declaration with respect to the application of the Act\u2019s provisions, and the legislature\u2019s adoption of certain presumptions in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>proceeding for enforcement of a claim for compensation, we have related \u201cdisability\u201d to \u201cearning capacity.\u201d In <em>Bethlehem-Sparrows Point Shipyard v. Damasiewicz, </em>187 Md. 474, 480, 50 A.2d 799 (1947), we said flatly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-4\">The general purpose of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is to provide compensation for <em>loss of earning capacity </em>resulting from accidental injuries sustained in industrial employment (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">To like effect is <em>Queen v. Queen, </em>308 Md. 574, 586, 521 A.2d 320 (1987); <em>Queen v. Agger, </em>287 Md. 342, 343, 412 A.2d 733 (1980); <em>Miller v. McGraw Co., </em>184 Md. 529, 540, 42 A.2d 237 (1945); <em>Paul v. Glidden Co., </em>184 Md. 114-119, 39 A.2d 544 (1944). <em>See Cox v. American Store Equipment Corporation, </em>283 F.Supp. 390, 394 (D.Md.1968). As early as 1916 the then State Industrial Accident Commission observed that \u201c[t]he primary purpose of the Compensation Act seems to be to provide compensation for loss of <em>earning power.\u201d </em>1 L.J. Harshman, <em>Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Cases, </em>reporting Claim No. 481, James C. Leonard, employee, Cambridge Mfg. Co., employer, Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of N.Y., insurer (emphasis added). With reference to occupational diseases, the legislature has defined \u201cdisablement\u201d as'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">the event of an employee\u2019s becoming actually incapacitated, either partially or totally, because of an occupational disease, from performing his work in the last occupation in which exposed to the hazards of such disease____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Art. 101, \u00a7 67(15). It then defined \u201cdisability\u201d as \u201cthe state of being so incapacitated.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In <em>Miller v. Western </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number><em>Electric Co., </em>310 Md. 173, 528 A.2d 486 (1987), a majority of the Court held that \u201cone who claims compensation for permanent partial disability produced by an occupational disease need not show actual wage loss as a prerequisite to recovery.\u201d At 187, 528 A.2d 486. Adkins, J., speaking for the Court, declared: \u201cActual incapacity from employment (whether total or partial) [and, we think, whether permanent or temporary] is the test in occupational disease cases____\u201d <em>Id. </em>We stated: \u201cThat a claimant\u2019s wages have not diminished or have increased since the onset of the disease may be relevant on the issue of actual incapacity.\u201d At 187-188, 528 A.2d 486. \u201cBut,\u201d we observed, \u201cproving actual wage loss is not a <em>sine qua non </em>of obtaining compensation for occupational disease.\u201d At 188, 528 A.2d 486. We pointed out, at 187, 528 A.2d 486, that a statute should not be interpreted so as to produce an absurd result inconsistent with its purpose, citing <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. at 516, 525 A.2d 628. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">[S]trict adherence to a wage-loss requirement has the potential for absurd results. It may deprive a physically-disabled worker of an award, and essentially penalize the worker\u2019s \u201claudable\u201d efforts to keep working. It also promotes the fiction that a worker, simply because of his level of earnings, is not suffering from a permanent [or, we believe, a temporary] partial disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-7\"><em>Miller, </em>310 Md. at 187, 528 A.2d 486.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By so defining the word the legislature assured that \u201cdisability\u201d with respect to occupational diseases was consistent with \u201cdisability\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>with respect to industrial accidents \u2014 namely, \u201cearning capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">It is true that a percentage of the pre-injury average weekly wages of the employee, subject to a certain maximum and minimum limit, is considered in determining the <em>amount </em>of the award for temporary total disability. Art. 101, \u00a7 36(2), but this does not indicate that the legislature intended that compensation be awarded for actual loss of wages as distinguished from earning capacity. When it looked to \u201cdisability\u201d as the basis for compensation, it did not speak in terms of actual loss of wages and made no comparison of pre-injury actual wages with post-injury actual wages. As we have seen, in our past constructions of the Act, we have interpreted \u201cdisability\u201d to mean \u201cearning capacity.\u201d Our present examination of the Act provides no reason to depart from that interpretation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Given that disability envisions diminished earning capacity and not actual loss of wages per se, it follows that Victor\u2019s voluntary retirement from his job at Proctor &amp; Gamble had no effect whatsoever on his entitlement to compensation for temporary total disability. We have declared that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>period of temporary total disability is the healing period, or the time during which the workman is wholly disabled and unable by reason of his injury to work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><em>Gorman v. Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pac. Co., </em>178 Md. 71, 78, 12 A.2d 525 (1940). Victor\u2019s entitlement to compensation for temporary total disability continues until he has reached maximum improvement, at which time his earning capacity could be revalued in light of his then physical condition. <em>Vigneri v. Mid City Sales, </em>235 Md. 361, 363, 201 A.2d 861 (1964); <em>Flood v. Merchants Ins. Co., </em>230 Md. 373, 375, 187 A.2d 320 (1963). <em>See </em>Art. 101, \u00a7 36(2)(ii)4. It is not disputed that at the time Victor retired he was physically able to work. The number and variety of reasons for retiring are almost unlimited. <em>See </em>2 Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 57.64(b) (1989). But here the reason Victor retired is of no moment. When his condition resulting from the injury worsened, he was found to be totally disabled, albeit temporarily. During the healing period, and until he reached maximum improvement, he was deemed under the Act to be unable to work, even if he desired to do so, because he was totally disabled. His earning capacity during that period was nil. The circuit court judge declared that \u201cbecause claimant retired ... he was not going to be able to work or to earn wages even after his injury had healed. Due to his retirement, he had no expectation of receiving wages upon a return to work.\u201d This conclusion, in any event, is simply not supported by the fact of Victor\u2019s retirement from Proctor &amp; Gamble. Leaving that employment did not forever bar him from the labor force. Until he became totally disabled, he could have sought and obtained employment elsewhere, despite that he may have been partially disabled. He was not without expectation, by reason of his retirement, of receiving wages upon a return to work. It was not his retirement that impeded his earning capacity, but the total disability resulting from his accidental injury. This being so, he was entitled to the compensation and benefits appropriate to his temporary total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>The answer to the question presented by the petition for certiorari, in accord with the order of the Commission and contrary to the belief of the circuit court judge, is \u201cyes.\u201d Victor is entitled to temporary total compensation as awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED;</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTION TO AFFIRM THE ORDER OF THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION COMMISSION;</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">JOHN J.

In an effort to effectuate the \u201cbenevolent purpose\u201d of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in favor of this particular retiree, the majority ignores the distinction between temporary and permanent disability compensation that this Court has repeatedly acknowledged. Indeed, a temporary disability period is a separate and unitary period of compensation distinguished from a permanent disability. <em>Queen v. Queen, </em>308 Md. 574, 585, 521 A.2d 320 (1987); <em>City of Baltimore v. Oros, </em>301 Md. 460, 468, 483 A.2d 748 (1984); <em>Jackson v.

While addressing other issues in <em>Queen, supra, </em>Chief Judge Murphy observed on the Court\u2019s behalf:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aag\">Differentiating between temporary and permanent disabilities, several courts have observed that temporary disability payments are a substitute for lost wages during the temporary disability period, while permanent disability is for permanent bodily impairment and is designed to indemnify for the insured employee\u2019s impairment of future earning capacity. Thus, these courts indicate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>permanent disability is not based solely on loss of wages, but is based on actual incapacity to perform the tasks usually encountered in one\u2019s employment, and on physical impairment of the body that may or may not be incapacitating. (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-5\"><em>Id. </em>308 Md. at 585, 521 A.2d 320.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I view this to be the context in which the Court held, in <em>Miller v. Western Electric Co., </em>310 Md. 173, 187, 528 A.2d 486 (1987), a matter which involved an employee who suffered from an occupational disease, that an actual wage loss is not a prerequisite to recovery for permanent disability. Indeed, the case of <em>Beth. Shipyard v. Damasiewicz, </em>187 Md. 474, 50 A.2d 799 (1947), which was relied upon by the majority to support its proposition that temporary total disability benefits are based on loss of one\u2019s earning capacity rather than wages, dealt with a workman who was permanently disfigured.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The question, then, is not what the Legislature intended by its use of the word \u201cdisability\u201d in the Act, but rather, more specifically, what sort of loss it designed temporary total disability payments to compensate. In this regard, I agree with the \u201cseveral courts\u201d alluded to above in <em>Queen </em>and would hold that temporary total payments are a substitute for lost wages during the temporary disability period, \u201cin order to enable claimant to support self and family during that period.\u201d <em>Stiennon v.

Section 36(2) of the Act exists to support \u201cinjured workmen and their dependents\u201d until they are able to return to work or are deemed permanently injured. The very word \u201ctemporary\u201d obviously presupposes a resumption of employment with a particular employer. Furthermore, as the majority notes, the amount of a temporary total award is determined by reference to the average weekly wage of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The claimant, who is 64 years-of-age, however, had ended his employment with Proctor and Gamble approximately two years before his knee injury worsened, causing the temporary disability at issue. He was receiving Social Security payments, and possessed a $250,000.00 lump sum as a result of liquidating his profit sharing plan with Proctor. While he indeed could have acquired a new job after retirement, it would not have been with Proctor. Yet, the majority essentially requires Proctor to further fund the claimant\u2019s retirement. Proctor is required to compensate someone not in its employ and who, being in retirement, suffered no loss in wages. I find this result to be totally inconsistent with the Act\u2019s purpose and intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Courts in other states that have addressed this issue have uniformly supported Proctor\u2019s position. The case from outside of Maryland which is most clearly on point, and which involves a similar statute, is <em>Stiennon v. State Accident Insurance Fund, </em>68 Or.App. 735, 683 P.2d 556 (1984). In <em>Stiennon, </em>the claimant sustained a compensable injury to his right knee in August 1979. In December 1979, he turned 65 and applied for his retirement in February of 1980. Later, in 1981, the claimant received a permanency award for his right knee. In 1982, the claimant underwent surgery. Although the insurer provided medical expenses, the claimant was denied temporary total disability since there was no loss of wages involved. The Oregon Court of Appeals noted that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u2019s statutory purpose was to compensate a claimant for wages lost because of inability to work as a result of a compensable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>injury. The Court remarked, \u201cIf the claimant has retired voluntarily following the injury, he can suffer no loss of wages, because, by definition he has no expectation of receiving wages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>683 P.2d at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">In short, I believe the majority has engaged in an \u201cearning capacity\u201d analysis where such an approach is unwarranted. As I would apply the lost-wage standard to a worker who has been temporarily disabled, I would, therefore, affirm the judgment of the lower court. The claimant, a voluntary retiree of two years duration, could suffer no loss of wages compensable by Proctor, because he had no expectation of receiving wages from his former employer. Inherent in voluntary retirement is the claimant\u2019s desire not to return to work; he is no longer a member of Proctor\u2019s labor force. Indeed, the claim for temporary total disability benefits in the absence of wage loss is a claim which seeks a remedy where there is no damage.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\">. In <em>Queen, </em>the Court went on to apply the temporary-permanent disability distinction in a divorce context, holding that \"only the portion of the husband\u2019s award compensating for a loss of earning capacity during the marriage is marital property subject to equitable distribution by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>308 Md. at 586-87, 521 A.2d 320.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
