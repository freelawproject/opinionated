We hold there is no constitutional violation under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The relevant portion of the record which contains the issue is found at the end of defense counsel\u2019s direct examination of petitioner, Ronald Nathaniel Wooten-Bey (Wooten-Bey). The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">MR. CHRISTMAS (Defense Counsel): Your honor, I think I have about five more minutes, but I\u2019m not sure. May I inquire if we might take a luncheon break, and I can finish within five minutes. I may have even less than that, if that is agreeable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-12\">THE COURT: All right. Mrs. Howard, and ladies and gentlemen, we will indeed break until 1:80 for lunch. ' In case he\u2019s fooling, normally I don\u2019t break until 1:15, but I\u2019ve already ordered the jail cases to be here at 1:00. All right. Mr. Wooten-Bey, you are a sequestered witness sir, which means you may not now discuss with anybody, including Mr. Christmas anything about your testimony on the witness stand, because you are sequestered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>MR. CHRISTMAS: I think I do have the right to talk about what I may ask him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">THE COURT: Under no circumstances may you talk to a witness under oath on the witness stand. You, or Mr. Harvey, anybody. That witness is sequestered, and under oath, and going through their testimony. As opposed to a sequestered witness outside, you can talk to. But not once the witness sequestered by the oath, they\u2019re not to be approached by anybody. And with that, we\u2019ll\u2014 please keep the admonition in mind, Mrs. Howard, and ladies and gentlemen, and we\u2019ll recess for lunch until 1:30.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">After the jury trial was completed in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County on August 4-7, 1987, Wooten-Bey was convicted of felony murder, attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, and use of handgun in the commission of a felony. On November 16-19, 1987, the sentencing phase under Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol), Art. 27, \u00a7 413(b) was held and the jury imposed a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">For the purposes of this appeal, we need only briefly discuss the factual background of the charges. On October 2, 1983, at an apartment building in Oxon Hill, Maryland, a drug dealer named Roger Porter was killed by a gunshot wound to the neck. At issue was the criminal responsibility of Wooten-Bey arising out of his participation in the incident leading to Porter\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">As the court, the parties, and court personnel were leaving the courtroom for the lunch recess, a conversation occurred regarding the judge\u2019s sequestration order. The judge apparently clarified his order, informing defense counsel that he was not forbidding all consultation between Wooten-Bey and his attorney during lunch, only consultation concerning \u201cprospective testimony.\u201d This statement is not part of the record because the court reporter had turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>off the equipment in response to the instruction \u201call rise\u201d when the judge left the bench. No further effort was made, during the course of the trial, to clarify the record concerning the judge\u2019s sequestration order.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">When the trial reconvened after lunch, defense counsel had only two brief questions prior to completing direct examination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cross-examination, redirect and recross ensued. Wooten-Bey\u2019s attorney then informed the court that his client wished to be recalled as a witness because he felt \u201crushed\u201d in his testimony. The trial judge provided Wooten-Bey an opportunity to consult with counsel. After the conference, Wooten-Bey no longer desired to retake the witness stand and the defense rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">On January 12, 1988, a hearing was held on defense counsel\u2019s motion for a new trial. Counsel claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial judge had denied petitioner his Sixth Amendment right to consult with counsel during the recess in question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the motion hearing, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auu\">I turned from the bench and stood up, and walked to the top step just to the left of where I\u2019m now sitting. When I did that, the bailiff cried all rise. And that is important, because what next happened then didn\u2019t get on the record. And I said to Mike Goldman [court reporter], how can this not be on the record, and he said it\u2019s very simple. If somebody yells all rise, I rise, and nothing gets recorded. And that is apparently what happened in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">Because as I started down the steps, Mr. Christmas was standing directly in front of the microphone on the other side of Mr. Goldman, about five feet from where I was then standing____ He had this look about him, like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>what are you doing. And I said, don\u2019t misunderstand me Mr. Christmas, I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t confer with your client. I\u2019m telling you, you will not discuss his prospective testimony with him, and I used that phrase, prospective testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">And then I left, thinking nothing more of it. That should be in the record, because that happened. Now, with that addition, it does seem however, in the memorandum you indicate the judge has not even the power to do that. I do not think that to be the law, but we\u2019ll discuss that in argument. But I want that record to clearly reflect those words were uttered in exactly that terminology.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Defense counsel responded to the trial judge\u2019s correction of the record as follows: \u201cI was originally where the clerk was, but I must say in all candor, I can not say under oath that what your honor just said was the actual words that you said. And I have a different impression, your honor.\u201d The record is silent as to counsel\u2019s actual impression. The motion for a new trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed Wooten-Bey\u2019s conviction and sentence holding in part that he \u201cfailed to show that the deprivation of counsel, which occurred during the luncheon recess, compromised his right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Wooten-Bey v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 603, 616, 547 A.2d 1086, 1092 (1988). The intermediate appellate court set forth the following reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">We agree with appellant that the trial judge erred in imposing any restriction on appellant\u2019s right to consult with his attorney during the luncheon recess. We decline, however, to impose a per se rule of reversal where the denial of access was brief, limited in scope, and where the trial judge gave counsel and appellant time to confer when it became apparent that they needed to do so, thus curing any constitutional defect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 609, 547 A.2d at 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">In <em>Perry v. Leeke, </em>488 U.S. 272, 109 S.Ct. 594, 102 L.Ed.2d 624 (1989), the Supreme Court recently addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the issue of whether a trial judge\u2019s order affecting a defendant-witness\u2019 right to consult with counsel during a court recess constitutes reversible error. The trial judge declared a fifteen minute recess and ordered that the defendant not talk to anyone, including his lawyer, during the break. This sequestration order occurred at the conclusion of defense counsel\u2019s direct examination. Defendant was charged with murder and related offenses in a criminal trial held in South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The Supreme Court initiated its analysis by referring to the rule set forth in <em>Geders v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 80, 91, 96 S.Ct. 1330, 1337, 47 L.Ed.2d 592, 601 (1976), where the court \u201cheld that a trial court\u2019s order directing a defendant not to consult his attorney during an overnight recess, called while the defendant was on the witness stand, violated his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>488 U.S. at-, 109 S.Ct. at 596,102 L.Ed.2d at 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The <em>Perry </em>court provided a survey of federal and state court decisions since <em>Geders </em>which have expressed varying views on the constitutionality of orders barring a criminal defendant\u2019s access to his or her attorney during a trial recess. 488 U.S. at-n. 2, 109 S.Ct. at 598-99 n. 2, 102 L.Ed.2d at 631-32 n. 2. On the issue of whether a defendant need establish prejudice arising out of an alleged denial, the Supreme Court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">There is merit in petitioner\u2019s argument that a showing of prejudice is not an essential component of a violation of the rule announced in <em>Geders. </em>In that case, <em>we simply reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction without pausing to consider the extent of the actual prejudice, if any, that resulted from the defendant\u2019s denial of access to his lawyer during the overnight recess. </em>That reversal was consistent with the view we have often expressed concerning the fundamental importance of the criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be represented by counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-11\"><em>Id., </em>488 U.S. at-, 109 S.Ct. at 599, 102 L.Ed.2d at 632-33 (emphasis added). <em>See, e.g., Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>U.S. 668, 684-85, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 691-92 (1984); <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 653-54, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 2043-44, 80 L.Ed.2d 657, 664-65 (1984); <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23 n. 8, 87 S.Ct. 824, 827-28 n. 8, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 342-43, 83 S.Ct. 792, 795-96, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, 804-05 (1963); <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 76, 62 S.Ct. 457, 467-68, 86 L.Ed. 680, 699-70 (1942). There is a distinction between the \u201cactual or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel altogether,\u201d and whether the quality of the lawyer\u2019s performance itself has been constitutionally ineffective. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. at 2063-64; <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, -, 109 S.Ct. 346, 353-54, 102 L.Ed.2d 300, 313-14 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Under the circumstances in <em>Perry, </em>the Supreme Court held petitioner had no constitutional right to confer with his attorney during the fifteen minute break in his testimony. In distinguishing the <em>per se </em>rule of <em>Geders, </em>the Supreme Court articulated a \u201cline of constitutional dimension\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">The distinction rests instead on the fact that when a defendant becomes a witness, he has no constitutional right to consult with his lawyer while he is testifying. He has an absolute right to such consultation before he begins to testify, but neither he nor his lawyer has a right to have the testimony interrupted in order to give him the benefit of counsel\u2019s advice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-9\"><em>Id., </em>488 U.S. at-, 109 S.Ct. at 600-01, 102 L.Ed.2d at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">The Supreme Court identified policy considerations for the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-12\">When [the defendant] assumes the role of a witness, the rules that generally apply to other witnesses \u2014 rules that serve the truth-seeking function of the trial \u2014 are generally applicable to him as well. Accordingly, it is entirely appropriate for a trial judge to decide, after listening to the direct examination of any witness, wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>er the defendant or a nondefendant, that cross-examination is more likely to elicit truthful responses if it goes forward without allowing the witness an opportunity to consult with third parties, including his or her lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6s\"><em>Id. </em>\u201cOnce the defendant places himself at the very heart of the trial process, it only comports with basic fairness that the story presented on direct is measured for its accuracy and completeness by uninfluenced testimony on cross-examination.\u201d <em>United States v. DiLapi, </em>651 F.2d 140, 151 (CA2 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 938, 102 S.Ct. 1427, 1428, 71 L.Ed.2d 648 (1982); <em>cf. </em>5 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1367 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1974) (calling cross-examination \u201cthe greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"ACh\">The <em>Perry </em>court elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">We think the judge must also have the power to maintain the status quo during a brief recess in which there is a virtual certainty that any conversation between the witness and the lawyer would relate to the ongoing testimony. As we have said, we do not believe the defendant has a constitutional right to discuss that testimony while it is in process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\"><em>Id., </em>488 U.S. at-, 109 S.Ct. at 601-02, 102 L.Ed.2d at 635. In a \u201cshort recess,\u201d \u201cit is appropriate to presume that nothing but the testimony will be discussed, [and] the testifying defendant does not have a constitutional right to advice.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at-, 109 S.Ct. at 602, 102 L.Ed.2d at 636.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">In reviewing the trial judge\u2019s order in the present case, we hold the court properly focused on restricting attorney-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>client discussion as to the testimony in progress. He expressly stated \u201cyou may not discuss with anybody, including Mr. Christmas, <em>anything about your testimony on the witness stand.\u201d </em>This interpretation is supported by the judge\u2019s recollection and comments made at the hearing on the motion for new trial. The trial judge here had the discretion to ensure the continuity of Wooten-Bey\u2019s direct testimony, to maintain the status quo, and limit the defendant\u2019s communication with his counsel concerning ongoing testimony. We find no reversible error under the circumstances of this case. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\">. At the hearing on Wooten-Bey\u2019s motion for new trial, the trial judge mentioned that the recess began at 12:15. The lunch recess lasted for a duration of one hour and fifteen minutes as the court reconvened at 1:30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\">. Counsel\u2019s interrogation involved the date of petitioner\u2019s arrest and whether he had been incarcerated since that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\">. U.S. Const., Art. VI provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall ... have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">It should be noted that petitioner has not raised a separate state constitutional ground for this appeal. <em>See </em>Md.Decl. of Rts., Art. 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b378-10\">. The interruption in <em>Geders </em>is distinguishable</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">because the normal consultation between attorney and client that occurs during an overnight recess would encompass matters that go beyond the content of the defendant\u2019s own testimony \u2014 matters that the defendant does have a constitutional right to discuss with his lawyer, such as the availability of other witnesses, trial tactics, or even the possibility of negotiating a plea bargain. It is the defendant\u2019s right to unrestricted access to his lawyer for advice on a variety of trial related matters that is controlling in the context of a long recess. <em>Id., see Geders v. United States, </em>425 U.S. at 88, 96 S.Ct. at 1335.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
