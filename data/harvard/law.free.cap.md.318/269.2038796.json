The jury imposed a sentence of death. We shall affirm both the conviction and the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">During the early evening hours on December 7, 1986, Wayne Leander Breeden (Breeden) was brutally and sav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>agely shot to death at close range. His body was found on the sidewalk outside a townhouse at 8502 Arry Place in Parkville, Maryland. Breeden was bludgeoned with the butt of a gun during the course of a robbery and was shot after attempting to stagger away from the scene. His death was immediate. The sole motivation for the murder was to take the $80.00 in cash that Breeden had on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Breeden had been in the process of completing several errands. He had first stopped to withdraw money from an automatic teller machine. From there he was to deliver a box of bathroom tiles to Mary and Kenneth Johnson, who rented a townhouse from Breeden at 8514 Arry Place. Finally, he intended to pick up a pizza and return home.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Baltimore County Officer Ronald Kuhns (Kuhns) had been dispatched that evening to Old Harford Road to investigate a call made by a police lieutenant, Richard Koller (Koller). Lieutenant Koller informed Kuhns that he had heard at least two gunshots fired from the direction of Tommy True Court and Arry Place. Officer Kuhns proceeded to the area and was immediately approached by a young man, Timmy Kaufman (Kaufman), who said that someone was hurt and in need of assistance. Kaufman\u2019s mother had noticed a man\u2019s body lying in front of their residence at 8502 Arry Place. Koller informed Kuhns that he observed a shiny foreign automobile proceed around the rear of the house, \u201cturn around quickly, came back out with its lights off ..., picked up someone and sped at a high rate of speed southbound on Old Harford Road with its lights off.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Koller noticed the very distinct taillights, the vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>tag number was NEW-672, and the car was possibly a Toyota.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">At the murder scene, police identified the victim\u2019s money clip and glasses, which were lying adjacent to the body, as well as a receipt for $80.00 from the automatic teller machine dated 12-7-86. His car was parked in front of 8514 Arry Place. Ceramic tiles were found scattered throughout the grounds. Dirt was found on the front porch of 8510 Arry Place. The flower garden there appeared to be out of order. Human blood substances were found on both the porch railing at 8510 and the sewer cover in front of 8502. A stipulation was entered into evidence that analysis of the substance found on the sewer cover confirmed its identification as human blood, but it could not be typed. There was not enough of the substance on the railing to conduct laboratory analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Dr. John Smialek, Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Maryland, reviewed the autopsy report of Breeden as written by Dr. Gregory Kaufman.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The autopsy report revealed the cause of death was a gunshot wound that had entered the right lower back area. A \u201cmissile\u201d was recovered from the left side of the front of his abdomen. The pattern of the gunpowder residue on Breeden\u2019s skin and jacket indicated that the weapon was held less than six inches from the body when fired. An extensive laceration consistent with \u201cpistol whipping\u201d was found on the right side of Breeden\u2019s head. Dr. Smialek classified this head injury as a superficial injury to the outside of the bone of the skull underneath a rectangular laceration. The injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u201cwould have most likely stunned him. But it would not necessarily have rendered him unconscious. He would have been in all likelihood able to continue after he recovered from the pain of the injury____\u201d There were abrasions to both of the victim\u2019s knees. The examiner testified that the body was rolled over while on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Lieutenant Roller further attested to his investigation following the murder. Roller had drawn a sketch of the unique taillights observed of the foreign vehicle speeding from the scene. On December 8, 1986, he took the diagram to several neighborhood car dealerships. At Nationwide Toyota, Roller spoke with a salesman concerning the diagram. He noticed a Toyota C\u00e9lica on the lot which matched the shape and size of the car seen the previous evening. After proceeding to the Parkville Police Station to get a camera, Roller returned to Nationwide and spotted a beige C\u00e9lica with tag number NCS-623. He began photographing the car believing it was the same car observed at the murder scene. Roller gave the photographs to the police and the tags were traced to Tony Michie (Michie).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Michie testified that he would occasionally \u201chang out\u201d with Collins. In October, 1986, the two had a discussion concerning ways to obtain money illegally. Michie needed money to support a drug habit which included \u201cfree base cocaine.\u201d Michie had use of a vehicle which could be used for getaway purposes. He was also in default on car payments and was being threatened with repossession. Thus, Michie approached Collins for the purpose of discussing a robbery scheme. Their plans were carried out on December 7, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Collins retrieved a .38 caliber revolver and a sawed-off rifle. They placed the rifle in a bag and appellant put the handgun in his waistband. According to Michie, the two then proceeded to find a \u201cpromising\u201d location for the rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>bery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After deciding that a restaurant and a hardware store were inappropriate, they decided to follow a car and to rob the occupants. They stopped briefly at a \u201c7-Eleven\u201d store near 33rd Street and Hillen Road. Collins noticed several individuals, withdrawing money from a nearby automatic teller machine. Breeden was followed from the time he used the bank machine until he reached the townhouses on Arry Place. Collins attacked Breeden. They \u201cclenched\u201d and began wrestling. Collins hit Breeden on the top of the head using a \u201cchopping motion.\u201d The gun went off shortly thereafter. After Collins frantically returned to the car, he stated, \u201cI only shot him in the butt, so he ain\u2019t dead.\u201d Michie testified that Collins insisted \u201che bucked and I had to bust him.\u201d This same response was relayed to Collins\u2019 sister who observed the wallet and questioned whether she could use the credit cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">During the course of the homicide investigation, Michie made three statements to the police. On December 10, 1986, he told the detectives that he would speak to them again after consulting with his attorney. Six months later, Michie informed the police that Collins was the triggerman and gave them appellant\u2019s name and address. A more detailed written statement implicating Collins was given on November 18,1987. Michie later agreed to plead guilty to a second degree murder charge and use of a handgun in a crime of violence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Michie gave his third written statement on March 2, 1988 in which he admitted that he had not been completely truthful in his November 18, 1987 statement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>He again, however, implicated Collins as being the trigger-man.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Rodney Bennett, Michie\u2019s cousin and roommate, testified concerning a conversation with Michie on December 8, 1986 at approximately 11:00 p.m. Michie told Bennett of the robbery and murder and that homicide detectives were looking for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Among other offenses, Collins was charged with first degree murder, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony and robbery with a dangerous or deadly weapon. The State notified appellant of its intention to seek the death penalty on September 21, 1987. Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1988 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 412(b). The case was removed from Baltimore County to the Circuit Court for Somerset County on October 27, 1987. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-254(b)(l). Collins was convicted of the three charges listed above after a jury trial was held on March 14-24, 1988.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The separate sentencing procedure was conducted on May 2, 1988. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 413. The jury sentenced Collins to death.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Appellant immediately filed a motion for new sentence on May 4, 1988. The circuit court later held a hearing on May 27, 1988. The judge denied the motion stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">The death penalty verdict in this case was not the consequence of an \u2018aberrant jury,\u2019 the danger against which the Supreme Court sought to protect in the case <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976). In <em>Tichnell [v. State], </em>297 Md. [432] 460, 468 A.2d 1 (1983) our Court said \u2018It is thus clear that the essential principle underlying the varieties of proportional review\u2014 is, in short, the guarantee that death sentences will be imposed in a reasonably consistent manner.\u2019 Here the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>jury reached the conclusion directed by the legislature in Article 27, Section 414, when it found no mitigating circumstances existed to the felony murder of Wayne Breeden. Thus, the Court finds that the jury\u2019s verdict was authorized by the statute and was not disproportionate given the facts of the case. No murder could have been more heinous, more premeditated and deliberate than Breeden\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">This appeal is brought pursuant to the automatic review provisions of Art. 27, \u00a7 414(a). <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-307(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\n<em>Prosecutor\u2019s Closing Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Collins maintains that the prosecutor\u2019s comments in closing argument concerning the legal corroboration of the accomplice\u2019s testimony constitute reversible error. The disputed rebuttal argument stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">Mrs. Williams: ... The judge also instructed you that the corroboration, the legal corroboration required, needs only be slight. And that corroboration, ... comes in the form of Jeff Gardner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">Mr. Tayback (defense counsel): Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">The Court: What is the objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbN\">Mr. Tayback: That is a misleading statement as to the corroboration that is necessary to find Mr. Collins guilty in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">The following colloquy occurred after counsel approached the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-14\">The Court: ... who is Jeff Gardner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-15\">Mrs. Williams: The guy in the van that sees two black males leaving the scene of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-16\">The Court: He corroborated what the man said about Tony [the accomplice] almost hittiiig the' vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-17\">Mrs. Williams: He also provides legal corroboration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">Mr. Tayback: I disagree. When you look at the law on corroboration, it says it must identify the accused with the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">Mrs. Williams: It certainly would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">The Court: I am going to overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">In <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 326 A.2d 707 (1974), we noted the general rule that \u201ccounsel has the right to make any comment or argument that is warranted by the evidence proved or inferences therefrom.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 326 A.2d at 714. This rule has been applied in the context of death penalty appeals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Jones v. State, </em>310 Md. 569, 580, 530 A.2d 743, 748 (1987); <em>vacated, </em>486 U.S. 1050, 108 S.Ct. 2815, 100 L.Ed.2d 916, <em>remanded </em>314 Md. 111, 549 A.2d 17 (1988) <em>(\u201cWilhelm </em>also recognizes that it is \u2018fundamental to a fair trial that the prosecutor should make no remarks calculated to unfairly prejudice the jury against the defendant.\u2019 \u201d Quoting <em>Reidy v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 169, 172, 259 A.2d 66, 67-8 (1969)). The appellate court should not interfere with the trial court\u2019s ruling as to the permissible scope of closing argument unless there has been an abuse of discretion of a character likely to have injured the complaining party. <em>Id. </em>[272 Md.] at 413, 326 A.2d at 714-15; <em>see also Esterline v. State, </em>105 Md. 629, 637, 66 A. 269, 272 (1907). The <em>Wilhelm </em>court set forth tests to be applied in determining whether particular closing argument comments constitute reversible error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">[I]t is unquestionably wrong for the prosecutor in his argument to the jury to refer to any matter not testified to by the witness or disclosed by the evidence in the case. Citing <em>Toomer v. State, </em>112 Md. 285, 76 A. 118 (1910).... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The Maryland Rule is that unless it appears that the jury were actually misled or were likely to have been misled or influenced to the prejudice of the accused by the remarks of the state\u2019s attorney, reversal of the conviction on this ground would not be justified. Quoting <em>Wood v. State, </em>192 Md. 643, 65 A.2d 316 (1949); <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 265, 250 A.2d 904 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\"><em>Id., </em>272 Md. at 415-16, 326 A.2d at 716. <em>Wilhelm </em>also identified three specific factors to be considered. These factors are: 1) the closeness of the case, 2) the centrality of the issue affected by the error, and 3) the steps taken to mitigate the effects of the error. <em>Id. </em>(other citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The rule in Maryland that a person accused of a crime may not be convicted based on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is well established. <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 642, 552 A.2d 896, 902 (1989); <em>Turner v. State, </em>294 Md. 640, 642, 452 A.2d 416, 417 (1982). <em>See, e.g., Brown v. State, </em>281 Md. 241, 378 A.2d 1104 (1977); <em>State v. Foster, </em>263 Md. 388, 283 A.2d 411 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 908, 92 S.Ct. 1616, 31 L.Ed.2d 818 (1972). This rule has essentially remained unchanged. In <em>Brown, supra, </em>Chief Judge Murphy reasoned for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">Not much in the way of evidence corroborative of the accomplice\u2019s testimony has been required by our cases. We have, however, consistently held the view that while the corroborative evidence need not be sufficient in itself to convict, <em>it must relate to material facts tending either (1) to identify the accused with the perpetrators of the crime or (2) to show the participation of the accused in the crime itself</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">281 Md. at 244, 378 A.2d at 1107 (emphasis added); <em>see also Wright v. State, </em>219 Md. 643, 150 A.2d 733, <em>cert. denied, </em>361 U.S. 851, 80 S.Ct. 112, 4 L.Ed.2d 90 (1959). <em>Brown </em>held that the accomplice\u2019s testimony was adequately corroborated under the circumstances. \u201cThere was testimony from the appellant\u2019s mother and daughter, and from the appellant herself, of material facts independent of the accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>plice\u2019s testimony that tended to show that the appellant was either identified with the perpetrators of the crime or participated in the commission of the crime itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>[281 Md.] at 246, 378 A.2d at 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">In this case the trial judge\u2019s instruction as to the degree of corroboration required of an accomplice\u2019s testimony was correct. The judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">In order to constitute sufficient evidence upon which a finding of guilt could be based, the testimony of an accomplice must be corroborated. By that I mean it must be supported in some way by some other independent evidence. However, such corroboration need only be slight. If there is evidence independent of the testimony of the accomplice which tends to identify the accused with the perpetrators of the crime or with the commission of the crime itself, then the testimony of the accomplice may be said to have been sufficiently corroborated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">After our review of the record, we conclude there is no question that the State presented adequate corroborative evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">While Gardner\u2019s testimony in and of itself was not sufficient to substantiate Collins\u2019 participation in the robbery and subsequent murder, it does provide further corroborative evidence tending to connect Collins and Michie to the crime. Collins was not prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s references to the evidence which tended to establish legal corroboration of Michie\u2019s testimony. The prosecutor\u2019s argument, while not wholly accurate, does not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">\n<em>Evidence of the Accomplice\u2019s Drug Charges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A_K\">Collins alleges the trial court erred when it declined to allow detailed and continued interrogation regarding drug charges brought against Michie. The police had found substantial quantities of drugs in Michie\u2019s home two days after the homicide. The judge limited evidence regarding the charges brought against Michie for two reasons: 1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Michie had not been convicted of possessing the drugs and 2) two other people were also in the house at the time the drugs were found. Collins argues that this evidence was admissible to demonstrate that \u201cMichie\u2019s motive for participating in the crime was other than the one [given on the witness stand].\u201d If Michie had substantial quantities of drugs in his possession, it was a logical inference that he was in the business of selling narcotics. This evidence would arguably be contrary to Michie\u2019s testimony that he was broke and in need of money. Collins also contends the evidence was relevant to show his motive for testifying as a state\u2019s witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We conclude the trial judge did not commit reversible error in his ruling limiting the evidence concerning Michie\u2019s pending drug charges. As the prosecutor revealed to the court at trial, the disposition of those charges was not part of Michie\u2019s agreement to testify against Collins. On appeal, Collins does not take exception to the prosecutor\u2019s proffer. Evidence establishing Michie\u2019s possible bias or motive for testifying was effectively before the jury from Michie, and from other sources. There was ample evidence of Michie\u2019s drug involvement to allow the jury to assess his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In addition, Michie thoroughly outlined his plea agreement with the State during his direct examination. Under these circumstances, the decision of the trial judge to disallow further evidence of Michie\u2019s pending narcotics charges was harmless error. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 528, 495 A.2d 1, 22 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1093, 106 S.Ct. 868, 88 L.Ed.2d 907 (1986) (\u201cIt is a fundamental rule of appellate procedure that a reviewing court will not reverse upon rulings on evidence where the ruling did not result in prejudice to the complaining party.\u201d); <em>see also Tully v. Dasher, </em>250 Md. 424, 436, 244 A.2d 207, 214 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\n<em>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Collins next argues the trial court\u2019s jury instruction on the beyond a reasonable doubt standard was erroneous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>As part of the explanation of reasonable doubt, the trial judge added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">All that is necessary is that the State prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, beyond a doubt based on reason. In other words, you must be reasonably certain of the guilt of the accused in order to convict. You can have some doubt and still have the finding of guilt. The proof necessary is that which you would act upon in important matters involving important affairs in your own personal lives or businesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Defense counsel excepted to this definition of reasonable doubt. The court then reinstructed the jury as follows: \u201cAlso in the burden of proof that the State must meet ... is proof beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty. You must be satisfied to that extent as to each element of the various charges.\u201d Counsel maintains that the wording \u201creasonably certain\u201d was misleading and significantly lowered the burden of proof. The use of the phrase \u201creasonably certain\u201d allegedly conveyed \u201ca confusing message as to a vital component of every criminal trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In <em>Poole v. State, </em>295 Md. 167, 453 A.2d 1218 (1983), we discussed the adequacy of a reasonable doubt instruction in a death penalty case and stated: \u201cIt is well settled that \u2018when objection is raised to a court\u2019s instruction, attention should not be focused on a particular portion lifted out of context, but rather its adequacy is determined by viewing it as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186, 453 A.2d at 1228; quoting <em>State v. Foster, </em>263 Md. 388, 397, 283 A.2d 411, 415 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 908, 92 S.Ct. 1616, 31 L.Ed.2d 818 (1972). In an earlier case, <em>Lambert v. State, </em>193 Md. 551, 559, 69 A.2d 461, 464 (1949), we noted that it is proper for a judge to comment or explain the meaning of reasonable doubt. \u201cA definition is not reversible error unless, by reason of peculiar circumstances or phraseology, such an instruction misleads or confuses the jury.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Lansdowne v. State, </em>287 Md. 232, 241, 412 A.2d 88, 92 (1980); <em>see also Montgomery v. State, </em>292 Md. 155, 438 A.2d 490 (1981). <em>Lambert </em>found it was not erroneous to instruct the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>that evidence is sufficient to remove a reasonable doubt \u201cwhen it convinces the judgment of an ordinarily prudent man of the truth of a proposition with such force that he would act upon that conviction without hesitation in his own most important affairs.\u201d <em>Lansdowne </em>held a trial judge must give an instruction correctly explaining reasonable doubt if requested by the accused. <em>Id. </em>[287 Md.] at 243, 412 A.2d at 93. The current version of the Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions replaces the \u201cwithout hesitation\u201d phrase with an amended term \u201cwithout reservation\u201d so that the jury will not confuse the degree of certainty needed with an immediacy of acting upon the certainty. MPJI-Cr 2:02 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In reviewing the instructions given as a whole in the instant case, including the reinstruction, we find that the trial judge repeatedly and properly focused on the term \u201creasonable doubt\u201d as the appropriate standard of proof required. The court\u2019s reinstruction emphasized that the State must prove each and every element of the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Counsel\u2019s failure to except to the reinstruction is indicative of an acceptance and approval of the amended form used. Under these circumstances, defense counsel has failed to preserve the challenge to the court\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt. Maryland Rule 4-325(e) provides that \u201cno party may assign as error the giving or failing to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\u201d We have previously applied this rule in the context of a death penalty appeal. <em>Mills v.

State, </em>14 Md.App. 538, 565-66, 288 A.2d 198, 213-14 (1972) (Where there was no objection in the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>court to a judge\u2019s supplementary instructions to the jury, the appellant could not assign error as of right.).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\n<em>Prior Consistent Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Collins avers the trial court erred when it admitted evidence of \u201cprior consistent statements\u201d made by the accomplice, Michie, to other witnesses. As part of its theory of the case, the State presented evidence that Michie and Rodney Bennett (Bennett) conspired to fabricate a story concerning Michie\u2019s involvement in the homicide shortly after Michie learned that he was wanted for questioning. Bennett was permitted to testify over counsel\u2019s objection as to alleged hearsay statements Michie made to him regarding the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Under Maryland law, evidence of a witness\u2019 prior statement, consistent with the witness\u2019 testimony as to a noncollateral matter, sometimes may be introduced if the credibility of the witness has been attacked. <em>See, e.g., City of Baltimore v. Zell, </em>279 Md. 23, 27, 367 A.2d 14, 17 (1977); <em>Cross v. State, </em>118 Md. 660, 670, 86 A. 223, 227 (1912); <em>Runge v. State, </em>78 Md.App. 23, 41, 552 A.2d 560, 569-70, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>317 Md. 613, 566 A.2d 88 (1989); <em>Finke v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 450, 494, 468 A.2d 353, 376 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 425, 474 A.2d 218, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1043, 105 S.Ct. 529, 83 L.Ed.2d 416 (1984); <em>Thomas v. Owens, </em>28 Md.App. 442, 449, 346 A.2d 662, 666 (1975); <em>see also </em>6 L. McLain, <em>Maryland Practice: Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 613.2, at 168. The prior statement is admissible not as substantive evidence but in order to rehabilitate the witness\u2019 credibility. <em>See, e.g., Borza v. State, </em>25 Md.App. 391, 410, 335 A.2d 142, 153, <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 746 (1975); 4 <em>Wigmore </em>\u00a7 1132 (rev. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">We find Bennett\u2019s testimony was properly admitted as prior consistent statements for the purpose of rehabilitating the earlier testimony of Michie concerning his initial statement to the police. Defense counsel had impeached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Michie on the fact that his initial statement to the police did not identify Collins as his accomplice. Bennett\u2019s testimony tended to corroborate the fact that Michie participated with Collins in the events leading to the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>Officer\u2019s Observations in Executing Search Warrant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1s\">Collins claims the trial court committed reversible error in allowing Officer Naylor to testify regarding his observations when he executed a search warrant of appellant\u2019s home.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Collins had contended the warrant was invalid and that Naylor\u2019s observations would need to have been suppressed as the fruit of an illegal search. <em>Arizona v. Hicks, </em>480 U.S. 321, 107 S.Ct. 1149, 94 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987). Naylor had identified a basement room as Collins\u2019 bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The trial court recognized the problem with Naylor\u2019s testimony, but permitted him to respond under the stipulation that he not identify the room in which appellant lived. Defense counsel immediately sought a mistrial which was summarily denied. The court cautioned the jury, however, through the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">[T]he comment made a moment ago by the witness, by the detective, as to where Mr. Collins may or may not have lived in that particular house, you are to ignore that. Wipe it from your minds if it is possible to do so. Don\u2019t consider it anymore during the trial of this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhE\">The prosecutor\u2019s position at trial was that her only agreement prior to trial involved her not introducing any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>objects that may have been seized pursuant to the search warrant. Contrary to Collins\u2019 arguments, the trial court did not find that the prosecutor had violated any stipulation or agreement with the defense. In good faith, the trial court resolved the problem by striking the single reference to Collins\u2019 bedroom. Under these circumstances, we find the trial judge\u2019s curative instruction was sufficient and no prejudice resulted to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">As evidenced by the circumstances of the trial, defense counsel did not argue that Collins did not know Michie. Thorpe also later testified concerning the interior of Collins\u2019 house including describing the location of appellant\u2019s bedroom. Thorpe was present in Collins\u2019 house the day he admitted killing Breeden, and testified he had been there previously. Since other evidence on the same issue was admitted without objection, no prejudice resulted to the accused. <em>Jones v. State, supra </em>[310 Md.] at 589, 530 A.2d at 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\n<em>Use of Detective\u2019s Notes for Cross-Examination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AIc\">Collins next argues the trial court erred when it ruled defense counsel was not entitled, prior to cross-examination, to obtain a copy of a statement made by Thorpe. Counsel requested a copy of that part of a written report by detective Naylor that contained references to a statement given by Thorpe to the police. The State\u2019s position at trial was that they were only required to provide copies of \u201cany written statements or grand jury testimony only after the witness has testified\u201d concerning the matters in question. The detective\u2019s report here contained a paraphrased summary of notes taken during a June 3, 1987 conversation with Thorpe. The trial judge denied the motion to produce the notes of this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">In <em>Carr v. State, </em>284 Md. 455, 397 A.2d 606 (1979), we thoroughly reviewed state and federal cases discussing the prosecutor\u2019s duty to disclose relevant and material informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>tion favorable to the defense. Specifically, the Court evaluated the extent of the duty to disclose statements of witnesses in relation to violations of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial under the Due Process Clause. We held the circumstances in <em>Carr </em>amounted to a violation of due process and required the mandate of a new trial. The Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">We have here no \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 in advance of trial. We have testimony on matters involving identity which may be inconsistent with the <em>prior signed statement </em>by this witness. It was then that trial counsel made his request for this signed statement. Every skilled advocate knows the crucial importance in such situations of cross-examination. Effective cross-examination here made it necessary that defense counsel be permitted to directly confront the witness with his inconsistent prior statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 472-73, 397 A.2d at 614-15 (emphasis added); <em>see also Leonard v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 631, 637-38, 421 A.2d 85, 89 (1980); <em>aff'd, </em>290 Md. 295, 429 A.2d 538 (1981). Later in <em>Jones v. State, supra, </em>we applied <em>Carr </em>and held that a discoverable \u201c \u2018statement\u2019 under Maryland law is one given by a witness under the circumstances set forth in \u00a7 3500(e)\u201d of the <em>Jencks Act, </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (1985). 310 Md. at 584, 530 A.2d at 751.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We held that two statements taken by the police authorities were summaries of information given to them during witness interviews. \u201cThey were neither signed nor adopted by Mrs. Jordan. Accordingly, the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>in <em>Carr </em>is inapplicable to them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>[310 Md.] at 586, 530 A.2d at 751. In so holding, <em>Jones </em>was in accord with prior decisions of the Court of Special Appeals which deny the use of police notes and investigatory summations not adopted by witnesses as their own. <em>Id.; see also Jacocks v. Montgomery County, </em>58 Md.App. 95, 472 A.2d 485 (1984); <em>Whitehead v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 428, 458 A.2d 905, <em>cert. denied, </em>296 Md. 655 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">In the present case, we conclude Thorpe\u2019s statement paraphrased in the police report was similar to the statements found non-discoverable in <em>Jones. </em>The statement here essentially was a summary of detective Naylor\u2019s interview with Thorpe. Contrary to our rule set forth in <em>Jones, </em>Thorpe neither signed, adopted or approved of the facts contained in the summary. The detective drafted the report subsequent to the actual interview. Without such ratification, the detective\u2019s notes may be classified as his work product, and are not generally discoverable. If the witness has not expressly approved of the statements, it would be unfair for the evidence to be used for impeachment purposes. Under these circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the detective\u2019s report was not discoverable prior to the commencement of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\n<em>Parole Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Appellant contends the trial court committed error in refusing to instruct the jury on the issue of parole. Counsel sought the following jury instruction at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">A sentence of life imprisonment presumptively means that the prisoner will spend the remainder of his natural life in prison, although he may be considered for parole at some point during his lifetime after having served a certain portion of his sentence. [The defendant] will be allowed or may be, excuse me, may be considered for parole at some point during his lifetime after having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>served a certain portion of the sentence. An agency known as the parole commission is empowered by statute to determine if and when and under what circumstances a prisoner may be paroled. There is no right to be released on parole. Under our law, no prisoner can be paroled unless the parole commission is of the opinion that the prisoner when released will assume a proper place in society and that his release is not contrary to the welfare of society. A prisoner released on parole may remain on parole for the balance of his life, and if he violated the terms of his parole, he can be returned to prison to serve the life sentence. It would be a violation of your duty as jurors for you to impose a penalty of death because of a doubt that the parole commission will properly carry out its responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The judge declined to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Under Md. Rule 4-325(c), \u201cthe court ... shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law____\u201d It is the responsibility of the trial judge, when requested, to give a correct instruction on every essential point of law involved in a criminal proceeding. <em>See Dillon v. State, </em>277 Md. 571, 584-85, 357 A.2d 360, 368-69 (1976); <em>Jackson v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 325, 329, 416 A.2d 1353, 1355 (1980). In <em>Doering v. State, </em>313 Md. 384, 545 A.2d 1281 (1988), we concluded that \u201ca jury seeking to determine the appropriateness of a life sentence will be aided by information correctly describing the legal and practical effects of such a sentence,\u201d including \u201crelevant and competent information concerning his eligibility for parole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411-12, 545 A.2d at 1295. This decision was made in the context of reviewing the trial judge\u2019s refusal to allow evidence at the sentencing proceeding. Here, the instruction requested by Collins\u2019 counsel was not an accurate statement of the law. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 413A; <em>Foster, Evans and Huffington v. State, </em>305 Md. 306, 317, 503 A.2d 1326, 1331-32, <em>cert. denied, </em>478 U.S. 1010, 1023, 106 S.Ct. 3310, 3315, 92 L.Ed.2d 723, 745 (1986). Under the circumstances here, we find the trial court properly refused to give the instruction as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\n<em>Closing Argument Reference to Victim\u2019s Family</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Collins maintains the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument comments regarding the victim\u2019s family were impermissible under <em>Booth v. Maryland, </em>482 U.S. 496, 107 S.Ct. 2529, 96 L.Ed.2d 440 (1987). The State\u2019s Attorney noted in her concluding remarks during the sentencing phase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">While you are back in that jury room, if you find that your strength is waivering or your conviction is waivering and you need an example of strength and conviction to look to, there it is right there (indicating). These people have sat throughout these proceedings and waited for the past 18 months for one thing, and that is justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avh\">Counsel immediately objected to this reference as improper victim impact statements. The trial court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Collins\u2019 reliance on <em>Booth </em>is not appropriate. The prosecutor\u2019s brief comments here are not comparable to the admission of a victim impact statement (VIS) during the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial. In <em>Booth, </em>the VIS provided the jury with two types of information.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> First, it described the personal characteristics of the victims and the emotional impact of the crimes on the family. Second, it set forth the family members\u2019 opinions and characteristics of the crimes and the defendant. The Supreme Court noted, \u201cThe focus of a VIS, however, is not on the defendant, but on the character and reputation of the victim and the effect on his family. These factors may be wholly unrelated to the blameworthiness of a particular defendant.\u201d <em>Id., </em>482 U.S. at 504, 107 S.Ct. at 2534, 96 L.Ed.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>449. The <em>Booth </em>Court continued: \u201cAllowing the jury to rely on a VIS therefore could result in imposing the death sentence because of factors about which the defendant was unaware, and that were irrelevant to the decision to kill.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The Supreme Court found that \u201cbecause of the nature of the information contained in a VIS, it creates an impermissible risk that the capital sentencing decision will be made in an arbitrary manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he formal presentation of this information by the State can serve no other purpose than to inflame the jury and divert it from deciding the case on the relevant evidence concerning the crime and the defendant.\u201d <em>Id., </em>482 U.S. at 508, 107 S.Ct. at 2536, 96 L.Ed.2d at 452. The Supreme Court concluded that the introduction of a VIS at the capital sentencing phase violates the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, the Maryland death statute was declared invalid to the extent it allowed consideration of VIS information. Md.Code (1957, 1986 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.), Art. 41, \u00a7 4 \u2014 609(d); <em>see </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 413(c)(iv).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Later, in <em>Mills v. Maryland, </em>486 U.S. 367, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988), petitioner claimed on appeal that the trial' judge improperly allowed into evidence statements concerning the personal characteristics of the victim, allegedly in violation of <em>Booth.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Since the majority found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>dispositive petitioner's argument that the jurors may not have understood the unanimity requirements of the sentencing instructions and jury charges, it failed to reach the VIS issue. Chief Justice Rehnquist, speaking for four dissenting justices, explained that <em>Booth </em>was not intended to preclude any reference or information about the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP6\">By contrast [to Booth], the summary admitted here gave only the barest details about [the victim] himself and no information at all about the impact of his death on others. I do not interpret <em>Booth </em>as foreclosing the introduction <em>of </em>all evidence, in whatever form, about a murder victim, and would thus conclude that the trial court did not commit error in admitting the summary in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADN\"><em>Id. </em>at 398, 108 S.Ct. at 1877, 100 L.Ed.2d at 408-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The reasoning of Chief Justice Rehnquist was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT6\">[The memorandum] did not purport to be, and the Maryland Court of Appeals found that it did not fall within the statutory requirements of, a victim impact statement under Maryland law. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1957, 1986 Repl.Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7 4-609(c). The statements summarized in the memorandum <em>did not describe the effect of the murder on the family and friends of the victim. Nor did the memorandum contain opinions and characterizations by [the victim\u2019s] brother and sister-in-law of the crime. </em>At most, this thumbnail sketch of the victim\u2019s difficult childhood and frequent encounters with correctional authorities gave the jury a quick glimpse of the life petitioner chose to extinguish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 397, 108 S.Ct. at 1876, 100 L.Ed.2d at 408 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In the present case, we rule the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not evidence, were not inflammatory under these circumstances and therefore are not properly comparable to the admission of a VIS. The comments did not describe the effects of the murder on the Breeden family. <em>See State v. Colvin, </em>314 Md. 1, 22, 548 A.2d 506, 516 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\n<em>Admissibility of Defendant\u2019s Juvenile Record and Institutional History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Collins claims the trial judge erred in permitting the jury to consider, during the sentencing phase, evidence of his juvenile record and later institutional history.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These records were part of a presentence investigation report which was admitted into evidence after certain redactions were made by the trial judge. Counsel\u2019s primary objection to the references of prior juvenile offenses was that there was no evidence to support these offenses because appellant\u2019s juvenile file had been destroyed. Therefore, the evidence was allegedly unreliable, and neither probative nor relevant. The institutional infractions included \u201cbeing out of bounds,\u201d \u201clateness\u201d and \u201cdisobedience\u201d which were part of a closed parole file. Counsel argued that these general offenses \u201creflect badly on him without him really having an opportunity to redress it.\u201d The specifics of these infractions were not detailed in the report. \u201cWithout an explanation of these terms [in the PSI] and Appellant\u2019s specific conduct, the jury was left to believe that appellant, even when institutionalized, cannot be controlled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Article 27, \u00a7 413(c)(iv) expressly provides that \u201cany presentence investigation report\u201d is admissible in a capital sentencing proceeding. In addition, Article 41, \u00a7 4-609(d) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">In any case in which the death penalty or imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole is requested under Article 27, \u00a7 412, a presentence investigation ... shall be completed by the Division of Parole and Proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>tion, and shall be considered by the court or jury before whom the separate sentencing proceeding is conducted under Article 27, \u00a7 412 or \u00a7 413.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In <em>Huffington v. State, </em>304 Md. 559, 577-78, 500 A.2d 272, 281 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>478 U.S. 1023, 106 S.Ct. 3315, 92 L.Ed.2d 745 (1986), we ruled that the prior institutional history of a defendant is admissible in a capital sentencing proceeding as part of the presentence investigation report. It is admissible because \u201cthe convicted person\u2019s reputation, past offenses, health, habits ...\u201d are appropriate considerations for the sentencing authority in a death penalty case. <em>Id. </em>at 577, 500 A.2d at 281, quoting <em>Bartholomey v. State, </em>267 Md. 175, 193-94, 297 A.2d 696, 706, <em>remanded, </em>408 U.S. 938, 92 S.Ct. 2870, 33 L.Ed.2d 759 (1972) (citations omitted). Huffington\u2019s presentence investigation report noted that he was cited for \u201c1) refusing to obey a direct order, and 2) creating a security threat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Collins contends <em>Huffington </em>is distinguishable from the present case because the report there contained one sentence explaining the facts surrounding each infraction. We disagree. The legislative mandate of Art. 27, \u00a7 413 regarding admissibility of evidence is clear. The only limit placed upon the admissibility of presentence investigation reports is in reference to \u201cany recommendation as to sentence contained in the report.\u201d Even if we were to construe the institutional history as \u201cother evidence\u201d under Art. 27, \u00a7 413(c)(v), we note that Collins had a fair opportunity to rebut or explain the circumstances concerning the institutional infractions for the jury. We find no merit in Collins\u2019 arguments regarding the admission of the appellant\u2019s institutional history.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Similarly, the information about Collins\u2019 juvenile record was properly admitted and reliable. It is the defendant\u2019s burden to establish an error in the PSI. The fact that hypothetically there may have been a mistake is insufficient to support a finding of reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>X.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\n<em>Constitutionalitv of Art 27, \u00a7 413(h)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Collins claims the use of the preponderance of the evidence standard in the Maryland death penalty statute is violative of the Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment clause and of the due process clause. Collins apparently refers to the final stage of the capital sentencing special verdict form where the jury is asked to determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances. Art. 27, \u00a7 413(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">We have previously reconsidered and reaffirmed the rule that a preponderance of the evidence test is proper in weighing aggravating and mitigating factors. <em>State v.

Under Maryland\u2019s capital sentencing scheme, the sentencing authority may not even consider the appropriateness of a death sentence unless the State has established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that one or more statutory aggravating circumstances exist. Art. 27, \u00a7 413(d). Moreover, the State has the burden of showing that aggravating outweigh mitigating circumstances. <em>Scott v. State, </em>310 Md. 277, 284, 529 A.2d 340, 343 (1987) (This Court has consistently held that the state bears the burden of persuasion under Art. 27, \u00a7 413(h)); Md. Rule 4-343(e) (Section IV). Under the circumstances of this case, we find no basis for reevaluating the rule set forth in <em>Calhoun, Foster </em>and <em>Tichnell. </em>Again, we hold the preponderance of the evidence standard is constitutionally proper in the context of Art. 27, \u00a7 413(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\n<em>Sufficiency of Charging Document</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Collins next asserts that the imposition of the death penalty in his case is unconstitutional under Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights because the charging document did not specify the statutory aggravating factor upon which the State wished to proceed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The most basic purposes of a criminal charge are to 1) accurately characterize the crime and the particular offense so as to put the accused on notice of what he is called upon to defend and 2) to prevent a future prosecution for the same offense. <em>See, e.g., Lank v. State, </em>219 Md. 433, 436, 149 A.2d 367, 368 (1959). Generally, the accused must be apprised of the nature of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The notice the State is required to serve upon the defendant in a capital case is set forth in Art. 27, \u00a7 412(b)(l)(i).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This notice includes each aggravating circumstance upon which the State intends to rely in pursuing the death penalty. Art. 21 of the Md. Decl. of Rts. does not require that this statutory notice be attached to the charging document. The proof of the aggravating circumstance(s) is always directly relevant in the sentencing phase of a capital case. We find no merit in Collins\u2019 contention regarding the sufficiency of the indictment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\n<em>Life Without Parole Sentencing Option</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Al9\">Collins maintains that the trial court erred in denying counsel\u2019s motion to have life without the possibility of parole considered as a sentencing alternative. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 412(b). He principally relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Beck v. Alabama, </em>447 U.S. 625, 642-46, 100 S.Ct. 2382, 2392-94, 65 L.Ed.2d 392, 406-08 (1980) for the proposition that an all or nothing statutory scheme is unconstitutional where the evidence warrants a lesser included offense instruction. <em>See Hook v. State, </em>315 Md. 25, 553 A.2d 233 (1989).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">We rule the life without parole sentencing option is only available for offenses occurring after the effective date of the provision, July 1, 1987. Ch. 237, Laws of 1987. The instant offense occurred prior to the effective date. Therefore, Collins\u2019 argument regarding a statutory right to the life without parole sentencing option has no merit. Here, the sentencing jury was given a proper option, either death or life imprisonment. The addition of a third alternative for life without the possibility of parole as a result of Chapter 237 of the Laws of 1987 does not render the sentencing verdict in this case any less reliable. We find no constitutional violation under the circumstances. The problem associated with the possibility of an improper compromise verdict found unconstitutional in <em>Beck </em>is not applicable in the present case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\n<em>Proportionality Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Collins urges that his death sentence should be vacated on proportionality grounds. At the hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Collins\u2019 motion for a new sentence, defense counsel submitted an exhibit consisting of separate reports allegedly involving similar factual situations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The cases generally arise out of murder committed during the course of a robbery. Counsel identified six cases, including the instant one, where robbery was the sole aggravating circumstance. Collins maintains that his death sentence is disproportionate under Art. 27, \u00a7 414(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Article 27, \u00a7 414(e) provides in pertinent part, \u201cWith regard to the sentence, [this] Court <em>shall </em>determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">(4) Whether the sentence of death is excessive or <em>disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In the process of our proportionality review function, we have considered the cases cited by appellant. We conclude both similarities and differences can be found in the respective cases. It would not be helpful to set forth the details of each case reviewed here. \u201cAlthough we have reviewed the cases cited by the defendant, we perceive no useful purpose in setting them out seriatim, with some particular facts included about each case and each defendant.\u201d <em>Foster v. State, </em>304 Md. 439, 484, 499 A.2d 1236, 1259 (1985), <em>reconsideration denied, </em>305 Md. 306, 503 A.2d 1326, <em>cert. denied, </em>478 U.S. 1010, 106 S.Ct. 3310, 92 L.Ed.2d 723 (1986) (death sentence for murder committed in course of robbery was not disproportionate to penalties imposed in similar cases where defendant committed brutal crime for personal gain, plotted it in advance, and proceeded methodically to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>carry out her plan). \u201cWhen comparing the instant case ..., both similarities and differences can be found.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">This case is an eligible death penalty offense under Art. 27, \u00a7 413(d)(10). Our analysis indicates that death penalty sentences have been imposed in a significant number of cases where the aggravating circumstance(s) involved a murder committed during the course of a robbery. Considering both the crime and the defendant, along with \u201csimilar cases,\u201d we conclude the death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate. We also find Collins\u2019 death sentence was not aberrant, arbitrary, capricious or freakish. <em>See generally Thomas v. State, </em>301 Md. 294, 334, 483 A.2d 6, 27 (1984); <em>see also, McCleskey v. Kemp, </em>481 U.S. 279, 302-09, 107 S.Ct. 1756, 1772-75, 95 L.Ed.2d 262, 284-89, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>482 U.S. 920, 107 S.Ct. 3199, 96 L.Ed.2d 686 (1987); <em>Pulley v. Harris, </em>465 U.S. 37, 54, 104 S.Ct. 871, 881, 79 L.Ed.2d 29, 42-43 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Finally, upon our examination of the record, we conclude that the death sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any arbitrary factor; that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance, and the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that the aggravating circumstances are not outweighed by mitigating circumstances. Art. 27, \u00a7 414(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">We find no reversible error in any of the contentions raised by Collins. It follows that the death sentence must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR SOMERSET COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">.
