Prior to trial, Edison filed a motion for separate trials. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City denied the motion. Trial proceeded before a jury on all of the indictments and each of their counts. The charges and verdicts thereon were as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Indictment Count Date of Offense Charge Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"AUV\">1 . 1. 16 July 1986 Murder of Ernest L.

The Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgments. <em>Edison v. State, </em>No. 1142, September Term, 1988, filed 7 April 1989, unreported. We granted the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. The writ calls upon us to determine whether the Court of Special Appeals was correct in its conclusion that the trial court erred in its insistence that all of the indictments be jointly tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The four indictments related to three incidents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">a) Indictments 1 and 2 \u2014 the murder of Ellis on 16 July 1986;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">b) Indictment 3 \u2014 the attempted murder of Officer Kane on 6 November 1986;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">c) Indictment 4 \u2014 the escape from the Baltimore City Jail on 9 February 1987.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Edison believed that each incident should be tried separately \u2014 thus, indictments 1 and 2 at one trial, indictment 3 at another trial, and indictment 4 at a third trial. He did not ask for a severance of counts within an indictment. In the proceedings in the trial court \u2014 during the hearing on his pretrial motion for severance, throughout the guilt stage of the trial and in argument at his post-trial motion for a new trial \u2014 Edison continuously objected to the joinder. He stoutly maintained in his persistent requests for severance that the joinder of the indictments was so prejudicial as to deprive him of a fair and impartial trial. But his entreaties were unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">Potential prejudice is the overbearing concern of the law of this State with respect to joint or separate trials of a defendant charged with criminal offenses. To this end, we adopted Maryland Rule 4-253(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-13\">If it appears that any party will be prejudiced by the joinder for trial of counts, charging documents, or defendants, the court may, on its own initiative or on motion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>any party, order separate trials of counts, charging documents, or defendants, or grant any other relief as justice requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">And, in ruling on a motion for a joint trial when a defendant is charged in two or more charging documents, \u201cthe court may inquire into the ability of either party to proceed at a joint trial.\u201d Md. Rule 4-253(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have observed that joinder may be prejudicial to a defendant in three important aspects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">First, he may be embarrassed, or confounded in presenting separate defenses____ Secondly, the jury may cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find guilt when, if the offenses were considered separately, it would not do so. At the very least, the joinder of offenses may produce a latent hostility, which by itself may cause prejudice to the defendant\u2019s case. Thirdly, the jury may use the evidence of one of the crimes charged, or a connected group of them, to infer a criminal disposition on the part of the defendant from which he may also be found guilty of other crimes charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\"><em>McKnight v. State, </em>280 Md. 604, 609, 375 A.2d 551 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The matter of a severance or a joinder is ordinarily committed to the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 705, 506 A.2d 580, <em>cert. denied </em>479 U.S. 873, 107 S.Ct. 38, 93 L.Ed.2d 174, <em>reh. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1001, 107 S.Ct. 611, 93 L.Ed.2d 609 (1986); <em>Graves v. State, </em>298 Md. 542, 544, 471 A.2d 701 (1984). The exercise of that discretion usually brings into play what is commonly known as the \u201cother crimes\u201d rule. \u201cGenerally, \u2018evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior criminal acts may not be introduced to prove that he is guilty of the offense for which he is on trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 633, 552 A.2d 896 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>(1989), quoting <em>Straughn v. State, </em>297 Md. 329, 333, 465 A.2d 1166 (1983). We observed in <em>Cross v. State, </em>282 Md. 468, 473, 386 A.2d 757 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">A mere cursory review of the case law ... readily reveals that there are few principles of American jurisprudence more universally accepted than the rule that evidence which tends to show that the accused committed another crime independent of that for which he is on trial, even one of the same type, is inadmissible. The law of this State is fully in accord.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">There are numerous exceptions, however, to the general rule that a defendant\u2019s other acts or conduct must be suppressed. \u201cEvidence of this type may be admitted if it tends to establish motive, intent, absence of mistake, a common scheme or plan, identity, opportunity, preparation, knowledge ... or accident,\u201d <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634, 552 A.2d 896, citing to <em>Ross v. State, </em>276 Md. 664, 669-670, 350 A.2d 680 (1976), see <em>Cross, </em>282 Md. at 473-474, 386 A.2d 757. But exceptions to the general rule are not limited to those noted in <em>Ross; </em>the <em>Ross </em>exceptions are not exclusive. For example, prior criminal conduct, with strict limitations, may be admitted to show \u201csexual propensity,\u201d <em>Vogel v. State, </em>315 Md. 458, 464-466, 554 A.2d 1231 (1989), and to show consciousness of guilt, <em>Bedford v. State, </em>317 Md. 659, 664-65, 566 A.2d 111 (1989). The admission of other crimes evidence \u201cshould be subjected to rigid scrutiny by the courts....\u201d <em>Ross, </em>276 Md. at 671, 350 A.2d 680. \u201cThe evidence proffered to the trial judge must be clear and convincing in establishing the accused\u2019s involvement in the other crimes.\u201d <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634, 552 A.2d 896, citing to <em>Cross, </em>282 Md. at 478, 386 A.2d 757. Judge Adkins, speaking for the Court in <em>Faulkner, </em>outlined a three-step procedure to be followed when a trial court is faced with the need to decide whether to admit evidence of another crime \u2014 that is, evidence that relates to an offense separate from that for which the defendant is presently on trial. \u201c[I]t first determines whether the evidence fits within one or more of the ... exceptions. That is a legal determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>nation and does not involve the exercise of discretion.\u201d 314 Md. at 634, 552 A.2d 896. \u201cIf one or more of the exceptions applies, the next step is to decide whether the accused\u2019s involvement in the other crimes is established by clear and convincing evidence____ We will review this decision to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to support the trial judge\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634-635, 552 A.2d 896. \u201cIf this requirement is met, the trial court proceeds to the final step. The necessity for and probative value of the \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence is to be carefully weighed against any undue prejudice likely to result from its admission____ This segment of the analysis implicates the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635, 552 A.2d 896 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Even though the evidence may fall within one or more of the exceptions of the \u201cother crimes\u201d rule, the trial judge still possesses discretion as to whether it should be received. <em>Id. </em>at 640, 552 A.2d 896.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">Thus \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, even though independently and substantially relevant to some contested issue, may be excluded if its probative value is exceeded by potential jury hostility or unfair prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 641, 552 A.2d 896. \u201cThe leeway of this discretion lies in the direction of excluding otherwise admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A clearly incorrect decision to admit other crimes evidence is an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>In the exercise of its discretion, the court is guided by the mutuality of evidence principle. If, in separate trials, evidence as to each individual offense would be. mutually admissible, the offenses may be joined. <em>McKnight, </em>280 Md. at 612, 375 A.2d 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">As we have seen, evidence of other criminal conduct which tends to show consciousness of guilt provides an exception to the \u201cother crimes\u201d rule. It is well settled that \u201cevidence of flight from justice is admissible to show awareness of guilt____\u201d <em>Hunt v. State, </em>312 Md. 494, 508, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>540 A.2d 1125 (1988). Judge Cole, speaking for the Court in <em>Bedford, supra </em>[317 Md.], at 664, 566 A.2d 111, observed that we had concluded in <em>Sorrell v. State, </em>315 Md. 224, 227, 554 A.2d 352 (1989), that, in Maryland, \u201c[e]vidence of flight following a crime has generally been held admissible to show consciousness of guilt____\u201d <em>See also Pettie v. State, </em>316 Md. 509, 519, 560 A.2d 577 (1989); <em>Hunt </em>[312 Md.] at 508-509, 540 A.2d 1125; <em>Huffington v. State, </em>295 Md. 1, 15, 452 A.2d 1211, <em>cert. denied, </em>478 U.S. 1023, 106 S.Ct. 3315, 92 L.Ed.2d 745 (1986); <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 716-717 n. 11, 415 A.2d 830 (1980). In <em>Davis v. State, </em>237 Md. 97, 205 A.2d 254, <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 945, 86 S.Ct. 402, 15 L.Ed.2d 354 (1965), we observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEq\">the lapse of time between the crime and the ... flight goes only to the weight to be accorded this circumstance, not to the admissibility of the [flight] as some evidence of consciousness of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 105, 205 A.2d 254. Nor does \u201c[a]ny evidence contradicting the inference of guilt derived from flight ... \u2018render the evidence of flight inadmissible, but is merely to be considered by the jury in weighing the effect of such flight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bedford </em>[317 Md.] at 665, 566 A.2d 111 quoting <em>Sorrell, </em>315 Md. at 228, 554 A.2d 352 (quoting 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence \u00a7 215 at 450).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">\u201cFlight\u201d includes an escape or attempted escape from confinement. C. McCormick, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 271 (3d ed. 1984); <em>see 2 </em>J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 276 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-8\"><em>Bedford </em>at 664, 566 A.2d 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">The pretrial motion filed by Edison alleged that he was \u201ccharged with the commission of two or more unrelated crimes, the joint trial of which would prejudice [his] right to a fair and impartial trial as to each charge.\u201d He prayed that the court \u201csever the trial of these indictments.\u201d We first look at what was before the court at the time the motion was denied. Defense counsel argued at the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>that \u201cthere is no relationship as to time or witnesses or ... the manner of the crimes being committed. There is just no relationship that would allow someone to hear an escape charge, which, obviously, is a very difficult charge to defend against when hearing a murder trial, where credibility is going to be the issue____\u201d He requested that the indictments be severed \u201cbut in any event sever the escape charge____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The prosecutor proposed a joint trial of all four indictments. The factual background leading to the indictments, he asserted, showed the propriety of his proposal. We give a precis of his factual representations. Edison was a suspect in the murder of Ellis. Warrants for his arrest were issued and the authorities were looking for him. Kane, a uniformed police officer, saw Edison (they were not strangers to each other) and Edison, realizing that the officer had \u201cspotted\u201d him, fled, pursued by the officer. Kane, \u201cin good professional manner [did not] draw his service revolver at that time, but started to give chase on foot.\u201d During the flight Edison \u201cturned and tried to fire what appeared like a gun. Nothing happened. There was no report, no explosion.\u201d Edison turned and \u201ccontinued flight looking like he was putting his gun back down in to his dip [the front of his pants].\u201d Edison was finally run to earth. A' gun was recovered from his person. It had \u201cslipped down into [his] trousers----\u201d There was \u201ca live round under the hammer with the indentation of the hammer and firing pin on the cartridge casing or primer.\u201d The prosecutor asserted that \u201cthis was a flight and that is always admissible as potential consciousness of guilt____\u201d He believed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-10\">that is competent and relevant and germane to the issue of consciousness of guilt and it also is highly relevant that we show the effects and how the arrest took place of an individual who is wanted foremost for any crime, especially, for murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">Edison, unable to make bail, escaped while incarcerated in the Baltimore City Jail awaiting trial on charges of the murder of Ellis and the attempted murder of Kane. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>prosecutor contended that if each indictment were tried separately, evidence of the offenses would be mutually admissible. At the trial of any one of the indictments, the prosecutor declared, the State would be \u201callowed properly to show the resistance to the officer, the flight from the officer, the attempt upon the officer\u2019s life, they are all germane and relevant to the investigation of the original murder of Ernie Ellis.\u201d And, the prosecutor opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHW\">Whether or not we called the indictment, we would also be allowed ... under competent evidence, because it is relevant and germane to the issue, to show the flight from the city jail____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Defense counsel suggested that \u201cit may well be that Mr. Edison did not know he was charged with the murder of Ernie Ellis.\u201d The judge indicated that would be a matter of defense. Defense counsel thought it relevant on the motion \u201cbecause there was another charge pending against [Edison] when he was fleeing that is unrelated to any of this.\u201d It was brought out that on 23 October 1986, about two weeks before the incident involving Kane, Edison had been stopped by the police and found to have a bottle of pills in his possession. He was released pending a chemical analysis of the pills. When they proved to be contraband, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Edison, but he had not been apprehended at the time Kane caught up with him. Defense counsel said even if Edison did not actually know that a warrant had been issued, he \u201ccould reasonably anticipate that there would be a warrant forthcoming.\u201d The judge suggested that \u201ca jury could reasonably infer that [Edison] was fleeing because of his murder on July 16, 1986 even though you may present to the jury testimony that there may have been other charges that Mr. Edison could have been concerned about.\u201d Defense counsel \u201cimagine[d] that the jury could [have so inferred].\u201d But he did not think that \u201cthey should be allowed to because of the possible prejudice that is going to flow to Mr. Edison from that.\u201d He thought that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">the issue of prejudice to the defendant outweighs the savings and the court\u2019s time and the expediency and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>need for truth also that the State refers to by using the flight as evidence of that. The escape itself, if not the attempt. The murder also should be severed____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The judge bought the argument of the State. Without more ado, he ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">I am going to deny the motion to sever these cases. All three cases will be tried at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">We believe that what the judge had before him was sufficient then and there to alert him that a joinder of the indictments would fatally infect the trial, so that a denial of the motion for severance would be an abuse of discretion. Assuming, arguendo, however, that it was not, as the trial progressed, in the guilt stage, where the skeletal recounting of the facts by the State at the motion hearing were fleshed out by the evidence adduced, it became more and more clear that the joinder tended to deprive Edison of the fair and impartial trial to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">We give a resume of the evidence the State put before the jury. It painted a sordid picture of life in the real world on the streets of the Cherry Hill section of Baltimore City. Underlying the crimes charged to Edison was illicit traffic in narcotics. It appeared that Cherry Hill was infested with several gangs. They were composed of drug dealers who sold to users and touters who solicited users for the dealers. The dealers compensated their touters at the end of the day in an amount which depended on the number of users referred. Each gang had a supplier from whom they obtained the contraband. The gangs had staked out territories in which they operated. But the competition was not always friendly. There was, at times, bad blood between the various gangs.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">\n<em>The Murder and Conspiracy Indictments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aiq\">Edison and his gang moved into the area. In addition to Edison, it included Steven Carter and Quint\u00edn Wiggins. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Edison gang did not respect the staked out territories. They sold wherever they pleased. Sylvester Barry and Tyrone Carr composed another dealer group. Ellis was their touter. He was a user. Edison and Wiggins offered Barry and Carr \u201clike a thousand dollars\u201d for some of the same \u201cproduct\u201d which had been supplied to Barry and Carr. Barry and Carr went to their \u201cboss\u201d but he refused to sell or permit to be sold his \u201cproduct\u201d to the Edison gang. Barry testified: \u201cthat\u2019s when the run-in came with us and Joe Edison and Quint\u00edn Wiggins and his gang.\u201d Barry was afraid of Edison:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">[T]he history that gang had and he had, Joe Edison, with carrying a gun, yes, I was afraid of him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Ellis made the mistake of telling Sharon Bagley, Carter\u2019s girlfriend, that Carter had killed someone called Reggie. Bagley told Carter what Ellis had said. Carter \u201cjust looked like a ghost or something scared him, you know, he just looked pale ... and he said if he tell you, then he\u2019ll tell the man ... the homicide people ... [the police].\u201d On 16 July 1986, Barry and Carr were approached by Edison, Wiggins and Carter near the Hillside Apartments in Cherry Hill. Ellis was nearby but out of earshot. Edison and Wiggins talked to Barry. Edison\u2019s hands were inside his \u201cdip.\u201d To Barry \u201cthat meant business.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">That mean if something that was told to you that you didn\u2019t do it, that meant your life was in danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Barry thought that his life was in danger and that Edison was armed. Wiggins told Barry that Barry and Carr were to walk Ellis to the back of the \u201c164 School playground\u201d so Edison could murder Ellis. Edison was \u201clike you better do it, man.\u201d Barry said that he would not do it and started to walk away with Carr and Ellis. However, they walked in the direction of the schoolyard. Wiggins walked close behind so they could not tip off Ellis what was going on. Wiggins was \u201clike walking to a drop-off point where Ellis would be.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">Joe Edison began dropping back behind us at that time. He came out of his pants. He fired one shot at Ernie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Ellis. It missed. It made [Ellis] turn to his left. The second shot hit [Ellis] below his eye. After Ernie hit the ground, a third shot was fired that hit him on top of his head.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Edison stood overtop of Ellis when \u201che flipped and his head hit the ground. He stopped overtop of Ernie and hit him again at the top of his head.\u201d Everybody fled. Edison ran through the woods and dropped off the gun somewhere. Later, Edison said that what he did was for all of us because Ellis was a \u201cdrug informer. He would have sent us all to jail ... Ernie was an informer.\u201d Edison\u2019s belief that Ellis was an informer was fed by the fact, as related by Egerton, and referred to by Edison in justifying the murder of Ellis, that on the day of the murder, \u201cOfficers Bradley and Shields conducted a street arrest for narcotics in the presence of Ernie Ellis and other people. Ernie was not arrested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Ellis\u2019s body was found in the schoolyard. There were two gunshot wounds, one below the left eye and one on top of the head. An assistant medical examiner, accepted as an expert in the field of forensic pathology, described them in detail to the jury. She opined that the shots were fired at close range as indicated by a gunpowder stripling pattern around the entrance holes made by the bullets. The path of the wounds was \u201cfrom upwards down and it was a straight shot.\u201d The shots occurred in a very short span of time. Two bullets were recovered from the body. The cause of death was the two gunshot wounds to the head, either of which would have been fatal. The manner of death was homicide. The autopsy report and the autopsy protocol photographs were displayed to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">A police officer, Detective Harry Egerton, accepted as an expert in the investigation of both drug crimes and homicide, was in charge of the investigation of the crime. A number of photographs depicting the body at the crime scene were admitted in evidence and passed over to the jury. Bullet fragments taken from the skull of Ellis were shown to the jury. Egerton opined that \u201cEllis had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>shot at a rather close distance with a large caliber handgun.\u201d The detective\u2019s inclination at the time was that Ellis knew his assailant. The officer\u2019s \u201cworking hypothesis\u201d gleaned from</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">[t]he gunshot wound to the eye, the left eye, was lead stipling around it, which was powder or alleged shavings from the bullet burns in a particular pattern which I\u2019ve studied before in homicide and from the geometric shape and disbursement of the stipling around the bullet hole, I had felt that whoever was the person who fired the shot into Mr. Ellis\u2019 eye was to the left of Mr. Ellis and possibly slightly to the rear of Mr. Ellis and within a reasonably close range.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The spent bullets recovered from Ellis\u2019s skull were submitted to \u201cballistics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Joseph Kopera, assigned to \u201cthe Forensic Laboratory Division of the Baltimore City Police Department, firearms identification unit, ballistics\u201d was accepted as an expert in the field of ballistics and gunpowder residue analysis. He examined the two spent bullets recovered from Ellis\u2019s body. They were .38 caliber and were fired from a revolver. Because of damage from hitting parts of Ellis\u2019s body, he was not able to compare them to a suspect gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Information received by Detective Egerton in his investigation of the homicide during the next few weeks after the murder, caused him to have Edison interviewed. Edison said that Ellis was a friend; they grew up together. Ellis was not one of Edison\u2019s customers but a touter for another gang. Edison said he was with Ellis on the evening of the homicide until about 7:30 p.m. About midnight Edison heard Ellis had been killed. Edison did not know who killed him. No one was with Ellis when Edison left him. Edison could not remember where he went after he left Ellis. Information received from interviews with four other persons proved to be conflicting \u2014 \u201c[n]o two persons said the exact same thing. Everyone said something a little different.\u201d But the information led to a Sylvester Barry, nicknamed \u201cCat.\u201d Egerton talked to Barry at length with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>result that Barry went before the Grand Jury. On 25 October 1986, Egerton obtained warrants for the arrest of Edison, Wiggins, and Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\n<em>The Attempted Murder Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Officer Darryl Kane of the Baltimore City Police Department, assigned to the Southern District drug enforcement unit, testified that on 6 November 1986, about 8:30 p.m., he was on routine patrol in uniform. He was aware of the warrant outstanding for the arrest of Edison for the murder of Ellis. He saw Edison, known to him \u201cfrom [the officer\u2019s assignment in] Cherry Hill.\u201d Edison was standing on the corner with his hand in the front of his pants \u2014 his \u201cdip.\u201d Egerton got out of his patrol car and called: \u201cJoe, come here.\u201d He did not display his revolver. Edison \u201ctook off running.\u201d Egerton informed the dispatcher through the car radio that he was \u201cinto a foot pursuit and the direction [he] was running.\u201d Edison turned around during the course of his flight and extended his left arm as if he was gripping something. The officer could \u201cjust [see] a dark object in [Edison\u2019s] hand, because of street lights in the area, most of them were out.\u201d Officer Dale Fields, of the Southern District, responding to the radio call for back-up, arrived on the scene and Edison was apprehended. He was patted down and nothing was found. So Egerton retraced the course of the flight to try to find the object that Edison had pointed at him which he believed to be a gun. While he was searching for the object, Fields informed him by radio that a more thorough search of Edison\u2019s person had disclosed a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">When Officer Fields arrived on the scene, he saw Edison running with Kane chasing him on foot. Edison was apprehended near Russell Street and the Westport ramp. Fields cuffed Edison\u2019s hands behind his back and patted him down above the waist for the officer\u2019s safety. Kane had told Fields that Edison had a gun. Fields walked Edison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>out to the ramp and conducted a thorough search. A gun was found in Edison\u2019s pants leg. \u201cIt was lodged in the pants leg, down at the ankle, on the inside of the leg.\u201d It was \u201cwedged in there____ It was in a position where it did not fall out. It was not loose. We had to go up into the pant leg to retrieve the gun.\u201d There were 6 rounds of ammunition in the cylinder. One had a dented primer.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The weapon in Edison\u2019s possession was examined by Kopera, the ballistics expert. It was a .38 caliber revolver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The gun was registered to a Henry Paul Taylor on 22 May 1971 but its whereabouts could not be traced from there until it was recovered from Edison. Kopera test fired it. The revolver was found to be operable and capable of being fired. The six cartridges in the gun were .38 caliber specials. On one of them \u201cthere was a light firing pin impression, which was on the back of the primer ... a component part of the cartridge.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">Those impressions were microscopically examined and found to be not deep enough or too light for comparison purposes meaning that that striking pin did not strike hard enough for the cartridge to go off, yet left a small dimple in it to show an attempt to fire that at one time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3F6\">The cartridge was examined by the jury. The revolver could be fired single action (the hammer pulled back by pressure on the hammer itself) or double action (the hammer pulled back by pressure on the trigger). The gun \u201cworked properly in the single and double action mode.\u201d It did not misfire upon testing it. The other five cartridges were different from the misfired cartridge. The spent bullets recovered in Ellis\u2019s head were not fired from this gun \u2014 the land and groove markings made as the bullet went through the barrel were not the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">It was not established that Edison actually knew that there was a warrant for his arrest for the murder of Ellis at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the time of his flight from Kane. In Egerton\u2019s attempt to locate Edison, he took the warrant to Edison\u2019s residence in Cherry Hill. Edison was not there and Egerton was not sure that he told Edison\u2019s mother the charge of the warrant. But she knew that it was an arrest warrant because he showed her the face of the document. He gave the mother his card and asked her</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_n\">to locate her son and have him contact me or if she could bring him in or if she could have him come in with an attorney. I gave her some options. But the main thing was that he had to turn himself in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Edison phoned Egerton that evening. Egerton told him there was a warrant for his arrest and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afd\">that he could come down to the office and I would explain to. him what it was all about and we could take care of things there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Edison said he would come in. Edison did not show up. Egerton next saw Edison after Kane apprehended him on 6 November 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">It seems, however, that on 23 October 1986, about two weeks before the incident involving Kane, Edison had been stopped by the police and found to have a bottle of pills in his possession. He was not arrested but permitted to go his way pending chemical analysis of the pills. When they proved to be contraband, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Edison. All of this was stated by defense counsel at the hearing on the motion for severance, as we have seen, part I B, <em>supra. </em>Defense counsel argued, at the time, that even if Edison did not actually know that a warrant had been issued, he \u201ccould reasonably anticipate that there would be a warrant forthcoming.\u201d During the discussion of the matter, defense counsel mistakenly indicated that Edison had been arrested when the pills were found. Edison denied that he had been arrested and released on bail. He interjected: \u201cnever locked me up. They was looking for me.\u201d So it appeared that he knew that he was wanted on a narcotics charge. But there was no evidence proffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>during the guilt stage of the trial with respect to the incident or the issuance of a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\n<em>The Escape Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">After Edison was arrested on 6 November 1986, he was confined in the Baltimore City Jail, on a no bail status, pending trials for the murder of Ellis, the attempted murder of Kane, and conspiracy to distribute narcotics. He was housed on the fourth floor of a \u201ctherapeutic community annex\u201d within the jail area. Passes could be obtained to visit the other three floors or the main jail building, connected with the annex by a tunnel. The officer on duty on the fourth floor on 9 February 1987 made a head count about 2:00 p.m. The count indicated that all the inmates in the fourth floor dormitory were accounted for although the officer did not know Edison by sight. The officer on the next shift discovered during his tour that Edison was missing. He notified his supervisor, the floor was \u201cshut down\u201d and a search for Edison was instituted. He could not be found. The Police Department was notified that Edison had escaped and recapture procedures were instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Edison\u2019s version was that about 12:15 p.m. on 9 February 1987, he \u201cgot a call from the officer that [he] got a court release.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">I packed my clothes and I left____ The officer wrote me a pass, you know, signed it, and I packed my clothes and everything and I went out the first floor, we walked from the fourth floor to the first floor, walk through the tunnel, showed the officer my pass, went upstairs through the grille, showed the officer my pass, and another grille, showed another officer my pass, then they opened the door at receiving, and showed him my pass and they put me in the bull pen then they called me, and I had to sign my name in front of the control center and give them my fingerprint, and I went to the rear gate where I had to sign my name and social security number.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>He was out at that point. \u201cAfter they lift the red gate up, you come out on Madison Street.\u201d Edison remained free until 17 September 1987 when he was apprehended. He said he was on the way to the Police Station to give himself up when the police stopped him.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The State adduced evidence to the effect that Edison had not been officially released on 9 February 1987. It introduced testimonial and tangible evidence that the records had been falsified. The records did not disclose the documents Edison claimed he signed, nor did they reflect his passage through the four grilles and two steel doors through which he would have to pass on his way to freedom. It appeared that pertinent records at the time, such as destination sheets or activity sheets, were kept, not by officers, but by inmates, referred to as \u201cinmate clerks.\u201d The destination sheet allowing him to leave the annex, was false.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The propriety of the denial of Edison\u2019s requests for separate trials of the indictments is governed by the \u201cother crimes\u201d rule. We pursue the matter in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">1) In the trial of the murder and conspiracy indictments: the admissibility of the evidence of the crimes charged in the attempted murder indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">2) In the trial of the attempted murder indictment: the admissibility of the evidence of the crimes charged in the murder and conspiracy indictments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-10\">3) In the trial of the escape indictment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-11\">the admissibility of the evidence of the crimes charged in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-12\">(a) the murder and conspiracy indictments;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-13\">(b) the attempted murder indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>In making this analysis we are mindful that a motion for judgment of acquittal was granted as to the crime of the possession of a handgun after having been convicted of a crime of violence, charged in the attempted murder indictment. Therefore, that crime is treated as if it had never been charged. We are also mindful that Edison stands acquitted under the attempted murder indictment of the crimes of the attempted murder of Kane and the use of a handgun in a crime of violence. And that no verdict was rendered on the charge of the assault and battery of Kane. But these crimes remain in play in the determination of what evidence of them is admissible at the trial of the murder and conspiracy indictments and the escape indictment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A judge is not a seer; he cannot prophesy what verdicts a jury will return. Juries have been known, as is their right, to reach a not guilty verdict, despite very strong evidence of guilt, by way of compromise, or because of disbelief in the credibility of witnesses, or for a myriad of reasons known only to the jurors. Therefore, in our analysis of what evidence is admissible in the various trials, the decision of the judge is not to be tested by the jury\u2019s verdict in hindsight, but is to be considered in the light of the proffers and evidence before,the jury at the time the judge made, or could have made, his final decision to join or separate the indictments for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">We approach the resolution of this appeal by following the three steps announced in <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634-635, 552 A.2d 896. We shall assume, for the purpose of decision, that the requirement of the first step \u2014 whether the evidence that relates to an offense separate from the offense the defendant is presently on trial \u2014 here fits, as a matter of law, within one or more of the exceptions to the general \u201cother crimes\u201d rule. With respect to the second step, the charge of possession of a handgun after having been con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>victed of a crime of violence was, as we have seen, judicially-deleted by the grant of a motion for judgment of acquittal for lack of sufficient evidence. With the exception of that charge, a scanning of the evidence adduced readily shows that it was clear and convincing with respect to Edison\u2019s involvement in the other charges in the indictments. So this appeal settles down to the requirement of the third step. Even if the requirements of steps one and two are satisfied,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">[t]he necessity for and probative value of the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence is to be carefully weighed against any undue prejudice likely to result from its admission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKb\"><em>Faulkner </em>at 635, 552 A.2d 896. This requirement \u201cimplicates the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus,\u201d we iterate,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, even though independently and substantially relevant to some contested issue, may be excluded if its probative value is exceeded by potential jury hostility or unfair prejudice. The leeway of this discretion lies in the direction of excluding otherwise admissible evidence____ A decision to admit other crimes evidence which is clearly incorrect \u201c \u2018on this question of balancing probative value against danger of prejudice will be corrected on appeal as an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 641, 552 A.2d 896 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">In a separate trial of the murder and conspiracy indictments, evidence that Edison fled when Kane tried to arrest him would be admissible as showing consciousness of guilt. But the details of the attempted murder of Kane would lend little, if anything, to the establishment of the corpus delicti' of the murder of Ellis, the conspiracy to murder Ellis, or of the criminal agency of Edison in those crimes. The details of the attempted murder would by far be too prejudicial for the slight additional probative value it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>would give. There would be no necessity for evidence as to the details of the attempted murder. Such evidence would reach beyond a showing of consciousness of guilt indicated by the flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In a separate trial of the attempted murder indictment, the fact that the police were seeking to apprehend Edison on a murder charge would be admissible to show the motive for the flight, which in turn would reflect a consciousness of guilt. Whether Edison actually knew that a warrant for his arrest for murder was outstanding was for the jury to determine. The details of the murder and conspiracy to murder- \u2014 evidence tending to establish the corpus delicti of each of those crimes, and to show that Edison was in fact the criminal agent as to them \u2014 would not be necessary to prove the attempted murder and would unduly prejudice the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">In a separate trial of the escape indictment, the only evidence relating to the murder and conspiracy indictments which would be admissible (as showing motive) would be that the reason for Edison\u2019s confinement included a charge of murder. The details of the murder and conspiracy to murder would lend nothing to the proof of the escape. There would be no necessity for such evidence and, again, it would unduly prejudice the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">In a separate trial of the escape indictment, the only evidence relating to the attempted murder indictment, which would be admissible, would be evidence that Edison was charged with attempted murder. Such evidence would tend to show that his confinement was lawful. But evidence that he fled from the arresting officer and evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>as to the details of the attempted murder would not be necessary to prove the escape. Again it would likely result in undue prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In summary, at a separate trial on each of the indictments, certain evidence, substantial in nature, of the crimes alleged in the other indictments would not be properly admissible. The mutuality of evidence test was not satisfied. The State had a strong case under each indictment, but it was not content. It chose to flavor its case by stirring all of the evidence it could muster on all the charges against Edison into one pot, and the judge went along. But what the State believed to be a clever stratagem spoiled the broth. The strategy it employed provided too strong a flavor for the liking of the Federal and State Constitutions with their guarantee of a fair trial before an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We are constrained to conclude that the trial judge did not heed our caution set out in <em>Faulkner </em>at 640-641, 552 A.2d 896, that in his judicious determination of the probative effect of the evidence versus its prejudicial impact, he must weigh carefully the necessity for and probativeness of the evidence concerning the collateral criminal acts against the untoward prejudice which was likely to be the consequence of its admission. The result of placing before the jury the vast array of testimonial and tangible evidence, which would not be mutually admissible at separate trials of the various indictments, fatally tainted all the convictions. The necessity for and the probative value of the improper evidence was far exceeded by potential jury hostility or unfair prejudice. We believe that the joinder prejudiced Edison in all three of the aspects noted in <em>McKnight, </em>280 Md. at 609, 375 A.2d 551. As he claimed, he was embarrassed, or confounded in presenting separate defenses. The jury may have cumulated the evidence of the various crimes charged and found guilt when, if the offenses were considered separately, it would not have done so. At the very least, the joinder of offenses may have produced a latent hostility, which by itself might have caused prejudice to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>case. And the jury may have used the evidence of one of the crimes charged, or a connected group of them, to infer a criminal disposition on the part of Edison from which he might have been found guilty of other crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We think that the trial judge\u2019s decision to permit a joint trial of the indictments was clearly incorrect. Therefore, it was an abuse of his discretion. The convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED;</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">\n<em>COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-10\">.
