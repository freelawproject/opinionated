It follows that, not having been parties to said foreclosure suit, and specifically prohibited by the terms of the law from intervening as their interests might appear under the allegations of the bill, said foreclosure decree cannot, therefore, be conclusive on the complainants to this suit. This would be the case, even though the complainants did not set up a charge of fraud and collusion between the complainants and defendants in said foreclosure proceedings in the conduct of said suit in said execution and sale in the district court of Humacao; for which reason the court overrules the demurrer setting up the question of <em>res </em>judicata, to which said defendants Manuel Argueso and his wife except. Said defendants are given until the next rule day to plead.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
