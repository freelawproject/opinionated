CAUSTEN, Collector of Customs at San Juan, Porto Rico, for a Review of the Decision of the Board of General Appraisers Sitting at New York, Sustaining the Protest of Cerecedo Hermanos y Compa\u00f1ia against the Said Causten\u2019s Classification and Assessment of Certain Wines Imported by Them.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\">Law,</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"AFW\">No. 369.</docketnumber>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b81-6\">1. <em>Wine imported from </em>France in cases containing twenty-four bottles or jugs, each containing less than a quart, but more than a pint, are, \u25a0under the United States tariff and provisions of the reciprocity treaty between the United States and France, subject to a duty of $1.25 per case and 5 cents additional for each pint or fraction thereof in said case, to be found by summing the excess in each bottle or jug; and the same rule applies to eases of a dozen bottles or jugs, each containing a little more or less than a quart of wine.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b81-8\">2.

The board of appraisers sustained this construction, and said (T. D. Vol. 11, No. 7, p. 28) : \u201cThe wine in question being contained in cases of twenty-four bottles, and! each bottle containing over a pint, was clearly subject to duty at $1.60 per case, and any excess beyond this quantity found in such bottles would be subject to a duty of 5 cents per pint, or fractional part thereof.\u201d The goods were classified and the duty levied upon them under \u00b6 296 of the tariff act of 1897 (30\u2018 Stat. at L. 174, chap. 11, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1654), the-pertinent portion of which reads as follows: \u201cIn bottles or jugs, per case of one dozen bottles or jugs, containing each not more than one quart and more than one pint, or twenty-four bottles or jugs containing each not more than one pint, $1.60 per case; and any excess beyond these quantities found in such bottles or jugs shall be subject to a duty of 5 cents per pint, or fractional pai\u2019t thereof; but no separate or additional duty shall be assessed on the bottles or jugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The question involved is not without difficulty, but under the rule that courts of justice must give effect to every portion of a statute, rather than to only a part of it, the court is bound to sustain the board of g\u00e9neral appraisers. It is difficult to see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>what tbe words used in the statute, \u201cand any excess beyond these quantities found in such bottles or jugs shall be subject to a duty of 5 cents per pint, or fractional part thereof,\u201d are intended to mean, unless it be that any surplus made up of small quantities found in such \u201cpint\u201d bottles, more than one pint, and in \u201cquart\u201d bottles, more than one quart, shall be subject to a duty, on the aggregate of these small quantities, of 5 cents per pint, or fractional part thereof. There could be no fractional part of a pint if the law intended, as claimed by the collector, to charge for a full additional pint for every small surplus quantity found in each bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Counsel for the government, during the hearing, claimed that, if this view of the court is sound, then importers can easily evade the law by packing their wines in cases of twenty-four bottles containing just a little less than a quart each, and thus import the difference between a pint and almost a quart at 5 cents per pint, when twenty-four pints straight in bottles would have to pay $1.60, or 6% cents per pint.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">We do not think the statute justifies this contention. We believe that the intention of the lawmakers was to charge $1.60 per dozen \u201cquart\u201d bottles, or twenty-four \u201cpint\u201d bottles of wine, in a single case or box, and that, within reasonable limits, if the quart bottles contained a little less than a quart, and the pint bottles any less than a pint, they should still pay the duty as though they contained those full quantities respectively; but that, if either of them ran slightly over the prescribed quantities, then that the surplus should be subject to a, duty at the rate of 5 cents per pint, or fraction thereof, in the aggregate. It was in evidence that \u201cquart\u201d and \u201cpint\u201d bottles are not exactly uniform in size in commerce, nor are they always filled to exactly the same level in particular shipments. In fact, it was in evidence that the measurements of the wine in question ran under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the pint (16 oz.) and over the pint as to particular bottles, and that the 17.3 fluid ounces was, in the opinion of the collector, the average of the thirty cases. The bottle exhibited to and measured before the court during this hearing ran even 17 \u25a0ounces, but it was filled to the cork.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The action of the board of general appraisers will therefore be sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
