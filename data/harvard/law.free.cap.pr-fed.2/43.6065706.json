In fact, the only evidence then before the court, so far as the record shows, was the evidence of Le Brun that the debt he owed to the judgment debtor was represented by negotiable promissory notes not yet due. ' In justification of the former judge it may be said that, when such evidence was given, he could not be certain that it was true, but it afterwards developed that the notes in fact were negotiable, and, so far as the evidence shows, had in fact been transferred for a valuable consideration to an innocent third party before they were due, and were produced here in court at the time the suit was brought against Le Brun upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The court is therefore now of opinion that the above-mentioned money is improperly in the registry of this court, and that such fact is subjecting the said Le Brun to unnecessary annoyance and expense, and that the same ought to be returned to him without delay. An order to that effect has therefore .been entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
