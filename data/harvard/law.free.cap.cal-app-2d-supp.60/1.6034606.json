J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC0\">Plaintiff, the People (hereinafter, appellant) appeal from an order dismissing a misdemeanor complaint charging defendant Joel Alvarado (hereinafter, respondent) with driving with a suspended license (Veh. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 3\">*Supp. 3</page-number>Code, \u00a7 14601.1, subd. (a)) and willfully failing to obey a lawful order by a peace officer (Veh. Code, \u00a7 2800). Appellant contends the trial court committed reversible error in dismissing the complaint in the absence of a showing that respondent suffered actual prejudice as a result of prearraignment delay. We agree with appellant\u2019s contention. The order of dismissal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\">On April 24, 1995, a complaint was filed charging respondent with driving with a suspended license (Veh. Code, \u00a7 14601.1, subd. (a)) and willfully failing to obey a lawful order by a peace officer (Veh. Code, \u00a7 2800). Respondent failed to appear for arraignment on May 15, 1995, and the trial court issued an arrest warrant. Respondent subsequently appeared on October 25, 1996; the warrant was recalled; and respondent was arraigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-7\">On November 8, 1996, respondent filed a motion to dismiss, alleging denial of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial based on the 18-month delay between the filing of the complaint and his arraignment. At the hearing on the speedy trial motion, appellant produced two letters mailed to respondent informing him of the May 15, 1995, arraignment date. However, the court found appellant had failed to justify the delay because the letters were misaddressed and appellant had made no further attempts to contact respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-8\">The trial court found respondent had failed to establish actual prejudice as a result of the prearraignment delay. However, the court concluded such prejudice was presumed in view of appellant\u2019s failure to justify the delay. The court granted respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint on speedy trial grounds. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal from the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-10\">The Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial attaches with the filing of the accusatory pleading or the arrest, whichever occurs first. <em>(Serna </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 239, 262 [219 Cal.Rptr. 420, 707 P.2d 793].)  \u201c[A] delay[] between the filing of a [misdemeanor] complaint and the arrest [and prosecution] of a defendant which exceeds [one year is] unreasonable and thus presumptively prejudicial. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 252-253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-11\">Respondent\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial attached on April 24, 1995, the date the complaint was filed. He was arraigned on October 25, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 4\">*Supp. 4</page-number>1996. Appellant concedes that the 18-month delay was presumptively prejudicial and concedes the delay was unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">Pursuant to <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>(1972) 407 U.S. 514, 530 [92 S.Ct. 2182, 2192, 33 L.Ed.2d 101], the presumptively prejudicial length of delay operates as a \u201ctriggering mechanism\u201d which necessitates inquiry into other factors. All of the factors must be balanced in order to determine whether or not there was a violation of respondent\u2019s federal right to a speedy trial. In addition to the length of the delay, the other factors which must be weighed by the trial court are: (1) the reason for the delay; (2) the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right to a speedy trial; and (3) actual prejudice to the defendant. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The foregoing factors are related and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 533 [92 S.Ct. at p. 2193].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">To prevail on a Sixth Amendment speedy trial claim, a defendant must demonstrate actual prejudice unless \u201c \u2018the first three <em>Barker </em>factors weighed heavily against the government. . . .\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Gallenkamp </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1, 18 [270 Cal.Rptr. 346].) Additionally, the United States Supreme Court has established that a trial court must consider how much time had passed beyond the \u201cpresumptive prejudice\u201d threshold. The longer the delay in arresting a defendant \u201cstretches beyond the bare minimum needed to trigger judicial examination of the [speedy trial] claim,\u201d the more weight the trial court should give to those factors favoring an accused\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>(Doggett </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 647, 652 [112 S.Ct. 2686, 2691, 120 L.Ed.2d 520].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">Here, as indicated earlier, there was a prearraignment delay of 18 months. With respect to whether the delay was justified, appellant argued it had exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to locate respondent. \u201cThe finding[] of the court[] below [is] to the contrary, however, and we review [the] trial court determination[] of negligence with considerable deference. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Doggett </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 652 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2691].) Neither party disputes that respondent asserted his right to a speedy trial in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-7\"> <em>U.S. v</em>. <em>Beamon </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 992 F.2d 1009,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is directly on point.  In <em>Beamon, </em>government negligence caused a delay of 17 months in bringing defendant Beamon to trial and a delay of 20 months in bringing defendant McMillin to trial. Both defendants timely asserted their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 5\">*Supp. 5</page-number>right to a speedy trial. The trial court found the delays were presumptively prejudicial, since they were \u201cwell over one year.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1013.) However, the court there held that the defendants still had to show actual prejudice to establish they were denied the right to a speedy trial, since \u201cthe delays in this case [were] not \u2018great.\u2019 Seventeen and 20 months are only five to eight months longer than the one-year benchmark which triggers the speedy trial inquiry under <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 1014.) \u201c[W]hile the government\u2019s negligence caused a delay long enough to trigger a speedy trial inquiry under <em>Barker, </em>the delay of 17 to 20 months is not sufficient to excuse the defendants altogether from any showing of actual prejudice.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1015.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\"><em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Beamon, supra, </em>992 F.2d 1009, indicates that the 18-month delay in this case was insufficient to excuse respondent from any showing of actual prejudice. While the trial court determined that respondent failed to show actual prejudice, it erroneously concluded such prejudice was presumed in view of appellant\u2019s failure to justify the prearraignment delay. Based on the facts herein, the trial court committed reversible error in dismissing the complaint absent a showing that respondent suffered actual prejudice as a result of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">The order of dismissal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-7\">Roberson, J., and Todd, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1304-8\">While decisions by lower federal courts on constitutional issues are not necessarily controlling, they are persuasive authority and entitled to great weight. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 80, 86 [81 Cal.Rptr. 457, 460 P.2d 129].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1305-8\">While the defendants in <em>Beamon </em>were charged with felonies, and respondent was charged with misdemeanors, the cases are analogous because the presumptively prejudicial period in both instances is one year. (See <em>Serna </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 254.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
