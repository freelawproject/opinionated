In passing it might be noted that the \u201camended order\u201d was not filed within the 30 days from the date (and filing) of the \u201cfinal decree.\u201d Maryland Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>812 a. On 14 June, the chancellor, Bowie, J., passed an order requiring Suitland, R &amp; S, Warbling Meadows, Beltway-Penn <em>and </em>Reuben and Beulah Schwartz to show cause, on or before 9 July, \u201cwhy judgments should not be entered against them, <em>pursuant to ordering paragraph No. S of the Final Decree entered herein on May 6, </em>for reasonable expenses\u201d (emphasis added) in favor of the appellees, $35,000 of which represented counsel fees. On 28 June the Schwartzes moved to quash the order as to them on the ground that they were not nor had they been parties to the action. On 1 August, however, before the motion raising preliminary objection (filed 28 June) had been heard, Suitland, R &amp; S, Warbling Meadows, Beltway-Penn <em>\u201cas well as Reuben Schwartz and Beulah Schioartz </em>(who appear pursuant to Maryland Rule 124 c)\u201d (emphasis added) in answer to the order of 14 June stated that the final decree of 6 May \u201cis without statutory authority,\u201d that \u201csaid decree is contrary to the substantive law\u201d of the state, that \u201cthere was no evidentiary or factual basis\u201d in respect of lack of substantial justification or of delay, and that the Schwartzes were not parties. On 12 August, after a hearing in open court, Judge Bowie entered five \u201cjudgments nisi.\u201d They are evidenced only by docket entries, the first of which we have set forth in full; the other four, being substantially the same, are abstracted only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-4\">\u201c1968, August 12th: Judgment Nisi entered in favor of the Defendants, Merchants Mortgage Company, Charles C.

He pointed out that the 6 May decree had been enrolled and that fraud, mistake or irregularity had not been alleged in the motion to set aside the 6 May decree, as required by Rule 625. He was of the opinion also (and the defendants-appellees conceded) that \u201cthe appropriateness of the amounts\u201d of the \u201cjudgments nisi\u201d might have been entertained but since there was no argument in this regard he declined to disturb them.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">On 24 September the attorneys for \u201cPlaintiff\u201d (in other pleadings they indicated they were acting for the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) filed an order to enter an appeal which we repeat verbatim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">\u201cEnter an appeal by the Plaintiffs, REUBEN SCHWARTZ and BEULAH SCHWARTZ to the Court of Appeals from the judgments nisi entered herein on August 12, 1968 and the denial of the motion to set aside judgments nisi entered herein on September 19,1968.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">All of the appellees have joined in a motion to dismiss the appeal which presents the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">\u201c1. Whether the order for appeal pursuant to which this appeal was taken was filed too late insofar as it attacks the final decree of May 6, because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">\u201ca. The decree of May 6 was final and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>appeal herein was not filed within 30 days of May 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">\u201cb. The finality of the decree of May 6 was not affected by Maryland Rule 605 a.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">\u201c2. Whether the order passed September 19, from which this appeal is purportedly taken, is, so far as it denied appellants\u2019 motion to set aside the final decree of May 6, an order from which no appeal is permitted by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Perhaps it should first be noted that the appeal of 11 April is clearly beyond the pale. While it was timely filed it was dismissed on 23 August and there is nothing in the record to suggest an attempt to reinstate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The appeal of 13 May obviously was in time. If the question were before us for decision something might be made of the fact that this appeal does not specify from which of the two orders of 6 May it was taken. The appeal of 6 June quite as obviously was not in time. Since both of these appeals were dismissed on 23 August the appellants are out in the cold unless, as they argue, the \u201cFinal Decree\u201d of 6 May was not really a final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">It is unnecessary, in our judgment, to spin out a long discussion or to indulge in the citation of a batch of authorities to establish the finality of the decree of 6 May. Indeed, we suspect any attempt to prove the contrary would be about as futile as shoveling smoke. Judge Bowie called it a final decree; appellants recognized its finality by filing the appeal of 13 May and they actually called it a final decree in the appeal of 6 June. Of course they thought it prudent to rename it \u201cInterlocutory Decree\u201d when they moved, on 23 August, to set aside what they now claim is the \u201cFinal Decree\u201d (the \u201cjudgments nisi\u201d) of 12 August. <em>Cf. Pinkston v. Swift, </em>231 Md. 346, 351 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Rule 605 a is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-10\">\u201cWhere more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as an original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment upon one or more but less than all of the claims only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates less than all the claims shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Appellants argue that because the amounts of the attorneys\u2019 fees were settled on 12 August the decree of 6 May adjudicated \u201cless than all claims\u201d in the case and did not therefore \u201cterminate the action as to any of the claims.\u201d The plain language of Eule 605 a indicates that \u201cclaim\u201d is used in the sense of a substantive cause of action, \u201cwhether as an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim or third-party claim.\u201d It will be recalled that in the decree of 6 May Judge Bowie held that the action was \u201cbrought without substantial justification and for purposes of delay\u201d and that he required, in the same decree, the payment of costs, reasonable expenses, \u201cincluding reasonable attorneys fees pursuant to Maryland Eule 604 b.\u201d Thus it is clear that Eule 604 b is the source of the award of counsel fees and this, to be sure, is not a counterclaim. <em>Cf. Hawkins v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., </em>250 Md. 146 (1968). But even if the award of counsel fees could be said to stem from a counterclaim its allowance was adjudicated by the 6 May decree. There remained to be done only the determination of the amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">That the order of 19 September denying the motion to set aside the \u201cjudgments nisi\u201d is not appealable seems to have been settled nearly 40 years ago. In <em>Gold Dust </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>Corp. v. Zabawa, </em>159 Md. 664, 666-67 (1930), Chief Judge Bond, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">\u201cThe refusal to reopen was a decision, of course, but it was only a decision not to interfere with a previous decision settling the merits of the claim. And it is regularly considered that a decision declining to interfere with a previous decision is not one intended to be included under a general statutory allowance of appeal from any decision. By section 30 of article 5 of the Code an appeal is allowed from any final order in equity in the nature of a final decree; nevertheless it is understood that from a final order merely refusing to reopen a previous order or decree no appeal is permitted. <em>Jacobs v. Bealmear, </em>41 Md. 487; <em>Zimmer v. Miller, </em>64 Md. 296; <em>Crane v. Judik, </em>86 Md. 63. \u2018There is a perceptible analogy between an application for a rehearing and a motion for a new trial in a court of law; and in either case the party affected by an adverse ruling cannot invoke the interposition of an appellant tribunal for the correction of supposed errors.\u2019 <em>Zimmer v. Miller, supra. </em>And although, by section 64 of article 5, appeals are allowed from all decisions of orphans\u2019 courts, it is considered that no appeals are allowed by that statute from decisions declining to reopen previous decisions. <em>Hunter v. Baker, </em>154 Md. 307, 330; <em>Megary v. Shipley, </em>72 Md. 33. \u2018.If parties could open orders or decrees, on appeal, in this indirect way,\u2019 said the court in <em>Lefever v. Lefever, </em>6 Md. 478, \u2018it would virtually amount to a repeal of the law limiting the time within which appeals should be taken, and lead to interminable litigation.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-8\"><em>See also Grantham v. County Comm\u2019rs, </em>251 Md. 28 (1968). Nevertheless we shall set the \u201cjudgments nisi\u201d aside because there are no such things in equity. Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>564. In <em>Kennedy v. Foley, </em>240 Md. 615, 620 (1965) we quoted with approval the comment of Judge Digges in <em>Pocock v. Gladden, </em>154 Md. 249, 253-54 (1928), who said, for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\">\u201c* <em>* * </em>it is our opinion that the date of a decree, in contemplation of section 36 of article 5 of the Code, relating to the time within which appeals from decrees or orders of courts of equity shall be taken, is that date upon which the decree becomes effective and binding, which can only be that date upon which it is filed and becomes a part of the public record of the case. It requires no authority to support this conclusion, as otherwise a court could sign a decree, and by inadvertence retain it in his possession until after the time allowed for appeal therefrom had passed. There is nothing binding in the decree of the court until it is filed, for the simple reason that until it is filed the court could alter or destroy it entirely and substitute some other in its place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">We added, in <em>Kennedy, </em>the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">\u201cIn our judgment * * * [the chancellor\u2019s] statements were merely oral opinions, <em>the stature of which were in no way enlarged by the docket entries. </em>* * * Under the circumstances the time for appeal * * * cannot begin to run until an order signed by the chancellor is filed with the clerk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The Schwartzes complain that they were not parties to the case and that consequently the final decree of 6 May must be inoperative as against them. It will be recalled that the bill of complaint was filed \u201cby and through\u201d them and that they signed it as \u201cstockholders.\u201d Counsel for Schwartz repesented him as being \u201creally the principal plaintiff * * * the prime owner in the four corporations.\u201d He was present in court throughout the trial. The evidence clearly indicates that the corporations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>were mere shells and that the Schwartzes personally guaranteed the payment of the mortgages. Judge Bowie found that the Schwartzes were \u201cthe real parties in interest.\u201d It is not altogether clear whether the decree of 6 May bound them to the payment of counsel fees but that question no longer requires an answer because the Schwartzes thereafter sort of backed into the jurisdiction of the court below or, as we said in <em>Metropolitan Auto Sales Corp. v. Koneski, </em>252 Md. 145, 152 (1969), they \u201cproceeded to paint * * * [themselves] into a corner.\u201d Although their motion, filed 28 June, raising preliminary objection had not yet been ruled on they answered the show cause order of 14 June and attacked the decree of 6 May on the merits. For some reason, best known to their counsel, they appeared \u201cpursuant to Rule 124 c.\u201d In this regard <em>McCormick v. St. Francis De Sales Church, </em>219 Md. 422 (1959), seems to be conclusive. Judge Henderson (later Chief Judge), for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\">\u201cMaryland Rule 124 c provides: \u2018Special appearances are abolished. The filing of a motion raising a preliminary objection shall be treated as an appearance for the limited purpose for which the motion is filed.\u2019 The Committee note indicates that \u2018This Rule abolishes the neceessity of special appearances and puts the emphasis on the nature of the defense asserted rather than the method by which it is asserted.\u2019 The rule was referred to in <em>Naylor v. Naylor, </em>133 A. 2d 74 (Md.), and <em>Naylor v. Naylor, </em>217 Md. 615, 622, 143 A. 2d 604, but we found it unnecessary to construe it. In <em>Keen v. Keen, </em>191 Md. 31, 41, we recognized that a special appearance may be filed for the purpose of questioning the jurisdiction of the court, or if it be desired to quash summons or other proceedings, but we said: \u2018if an appearance, no matter how characterized, is in effect a general appearance, it will have the result of binding the party appear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>ing in subsequent proceedings in this case.\u2019 In the instant case the assertion of defenses on the merits, in the motion to strike the declaration, was an invocation of the jurisdiction of the .court, even though, procedurally, it was improperly coupled with the motion to quash. We think the filing of the motion operated as a general appearance and constituted a waiver of the preliminary objection. A person who denies that a court has jurisdiction and asks relief on that ground cannot ask anything of the court which is inconsistent with the want of such jurisdiction. * * * We hold that the court erred in granting the motion to quash under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428-29.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">To the same effect <em>see Metropolitan Auto Sales, supra. </em>While the court\u2019s jurisdiction over them may have been touch and go up to that time (1 August) their answ\u00e9r to the show cause order locked them in once and for all.
