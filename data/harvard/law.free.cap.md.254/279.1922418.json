Mr. Lee was charged on August 17, 1968 with the violations mentioned. At the trial before the Municipal Court of Baltimore City on September 18, 1968, Mr. Lee entered pleas of \u201cNot Guilty\u201d to both charges. After hearing evidence, the Municipal Court entered findings of \u201cProbation Without Verdict\u201d and imposed pecuniary penalties, totalling $115 and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The record of the proceedings against Lee in the Municipal Court having been forwarded to the Commissioner, a hearing was held by Rudolph W. Walker, License Reviewer, on October 11, 1968 at which Mr. Lee and his counsel were present. Although the Baltimore City Court (Sodaro, J.) in its opinion stated that Mr. Lee\u2019s license was revoked under the provisions of Art. 66%, \u00a7 104 which directs a <em>mandatory </em>revocation of a license upon \u201cconviction\u201d for \u201cdriving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a narcotic drug,\u201d and this was alleged in the Commissioner\u2019s motion for certiorari and is also stated by the Attorney General in his brief filed on behalf of the Commissioner and apparently acquiesced in by the appellee; an examination of the record indicates that the License Reviewer proceeded under Art. 66%, \u00a7 105(d) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201c(d) <em>Applicant or licensee unfit or unsafe person. </em>\u2014 The Department, after due hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>may refuse, suspend or revoke the operator\u2019s license, motorcycle operator\u2019s, chauffeur\u2019s license or special chauffeur\u2019s license or the registration of any vehicle granted under this article for any violation of this article by any such applicant, licensee or registrant, and for any other cause or reason which, in the opinion of the Department renders the holder of any such license or registration an unfit or unsafe person to hold the same; provided at least three (3) days\u2019 notice by registered or certified letter to the address as shown by the records of the Department, shall be given; and further provided that said person shall have the right of appeal as provided for by \u00a7 109.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The report of the License Reviewer indicates that he, taking into consideration among other factors the proceedings in the Municipal Court against Lee, found that Lee was an \u201cunfit and unsafe\u201d person within the meaning of Art. 66%, \u00a7 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">An appeal was taken to the Baltimore City Court by Mr. Lee in accordance with Art. 66%, \u00a7 109 which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">\u201c\u00a7 109. Right of appeal to court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">\u201c(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Any person denied a license or whose license has been cancelled, suspended or revoked by the Department, except where such cancellation or revocation is mandatory, under the provisions of this article, shall have the right to file an appeal for a hearing in the matter in the Baltimore City court or in the circuit court of the county as the case may be, wherein such person shall reside and such court is hereby vested with jurisdiction to take testimony and examine into the facts of the case and to determine whether the petitioner is entitled to a license or is subject to suspension, cancellation, or revocation of license under the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>sions of this article. In the case of nonresidents the circuit court of the county or the Baltimore City court depending upon the place where such nonresident was convicted of any violation of this article, shall have jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">See also Art. 41, \u00a7 255 designating the Baltimore City Court as a reviewing court for such an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The case came on for trial on December 3, 1968 at which time the Commissioner objected to the Baltimore City Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear an appeal for a revocation of a license under the mandatory provisions of \u00a7 104, but the objection was overruled by the lower court. The case was submitted for determination of the court without the aid of a jury and was held sub curia. In the Commissioner\u2019s brief it is stated that the case was submitted to the trial court upon an agreed statement of facts, but the record does not disclose any such agreed statement. The docket entries show that the petition for appeal was filed on October 15, 1968 and the Commissioner\u2019s answer was filed on October 30, 1968 on which date the transcript of the record of proceedings before the Commissioner was filed. There is nothing in the docket entries to indicate that any agreed statement of facts was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">On December 19, 1968 the lower court filed a memorandum opinion indicating that the Commissioner should be reversed. On the same date the docket entries also show that \u201cThe decision of the Department of Motor Vehicles is hereby, <em>Reversed\u201d </em>and \u201cJudgment absolute in favor of the Plaintiff (Appellant), for costs of suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">As we have stated, the lower court\u2019s opinion is based upon the erroneous theory that the license was revoked under the mandatory provisions of \u00a7 104, rather than under \u00a7 105 (d) which, as we have observed, is the section under which the License Reviewer actually proceeded. The lower court was of the opinion that there had been no \u201cconviction\u201d in Mr. Lee\u2019s case by the Municipal Court and that the Commissioner had attempted to \u201clook be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>hind\u201d a judicial determination which was \u201clegally arbitrary and capricious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">We granted certiorari on February 3, 1969 upon the motion of the Commissioner alleging (1) that since the revocation of the license had occurred pursuant to \u00a7 104, no appeal would lie to the Baltimore City Court and (2) that the scope of the opinion of the lower court constituted an impermissible intrusion by the lower court into the administrative duties imposed upon the Commissioner by statute. For both of these reasons, as well as the alleged danger to the public safety which might result, the Commissioner urged upon us that the public interest indicated that a writ of certiorari should be issued in order to resolve these important matters. As we indicated, we did grant certiorari and the case was briefed and argued before us in regular course, but, unfortunately, upon the erroneous assumption that the appellee\u2019s license had been revoked under \u00a7 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In view of the erroneous assumption mentioned, we will remand the case to the lower court without affirmance or reversal so that further proceedings may be held to determine whether or not the Commissioner acted properly in revoking the license under \u00a7 105(d). As we do not believe that there is any doubt that the Baltimore City Court has jurisdiction under \u00a7 109 to hear appeals from a nonmandatory revocation pursuant to \u00a7 105(d), and because that question was neither briefed nor argued before us, we need not consider the question of the court\u2019s jurisdiction. But inasmuch as the record indicates that the License Reviewer considered <em>in part, </em>the imposition of the fine as some evidence of \u201cguilt\u201d on the part of Mr. Lee, we have concluded that for the guidance of the lower court upon the remand and in accordance with Maryland Rule 885, we shall indicate our opinion in regard to certain aspects of the matters briefed and argued before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">At the outset, we observed that, in our opinion, it is not proper for the municipal courts, the circuit courts for the counties or for the Criminal Court of Baltimore to make a finding of \u201cProbation without Verdict\u201d as to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>particular offense charged and at the same time impose a pecuniary penalty or fine for that offense. The two actions are inconsistent with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">We reviewed the origin and development of the concept of \u201cprobation before verdict\u201d and the present provisions of the Maryland law under Art. 27, \u00a7 641 giving that power, with the written consent of the accused, to the circuit courts of the counties and the Criminal Court of Baltimore in <em>Skinker v. State, </em>239 Md. 234, 210 A. 2d 716 (1965). We pointed out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\u201cUnlike the supension of the imposition of or the execution of a criminal sentence, which can be exercised 'only when there has been a conviction and sentence thereon, probation without verdict, if granted, avoids any finding of guilt\u2019 <em>(State v. Jacob, supra, </em>234 Md. at 455). Avoidance of the stigma of a criminal record, indeed, is the very <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>of the procedure.\u201d (234 Md. at 239, 210 A. 2d at 719)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Curiously enough the power of the Municipal Court of Baltimore City to \u201cplace persons charged on probation without finding a verdict\u201d is given by Art. 26, \u00a7 114 (Acts of 1961, Chapter 616), but there is no specific provision requiring the written consent of the accused as is required by Art. 27, \u00a7 641 in criminal proceedings in the circuit courts of the counties and in the Criminal Court of Baltimore. We express no opinion in regard to what effect the absence of this requirement in provisions governing procedure in the Municipal Court of Baltimore City may have, but, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that such consent is not required for the validity of the imposition of probation without finding a verdict in that court, we are of the opinion that our observations in <em>Skinker, </em>quoted above, are equally applicable to this procedure in the Municipal Court of Baltimore City and that the granting of probation without finding a verdict \u201cavoids any finding of guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>On the other hand, it is clear to us that the imposition of a fine or pecuniary penalty payable to the State may only be done by the Municipal Court if there is a \u201cconviction\u201d which necessarily requires a finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">In Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1951) \u201cfine\u201d in criminal law is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201cA pecuniary punishment imposed by lawful tribunal upon persons <em>convicted </em>of crime or misdemeanor. * * * A pecuniary <em>penalty. </em>* * (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">See <em>Dorsey v. Petrott, </em>178 Md. 230, 250, 13 A. 2d 630, 640 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">In 36A C.J.S. <em>Fines </em>\u00a7 1 (1961) at 431, a \u201cfine\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">\u201cA \u2018fine\u2019 is a sum expressly imposed in lieu of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment, or as any part of the punishment for an offense ; it is a pecuniary punishment imposed by a lawful tribunal on a person <em>convicted </em>of a crime or misdemeanor.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">\u201cPenalty\u201d is defined in 70 C.J.S. <em>Penalties </em>\u00a7 1 (1951) at 387, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">\u201cA penalty is a sum of money which the law exacts payment by way of punishment for doing some act that is prohibited or omitting to do some act that is required to be done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">Art. <em>66Y2, </em>\u00a7 102 requires the clerks of the various courts throughout the State to \u201cforward to the Department [of Motor Vehicles] a record of the <em>conviction </em>of any person in said court\u201d (emphasis supplied) for the violation of the motor vehicle laws. Pursuant to \u00a7 102, the records of the proceedings against Lee in the Municipal Court were forwarded to the Department as a case in which there had been a \u201cconviction,\u201d doubtless because there was a fine imposed and apparently paid by Mr. Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">The Attorney General stated in the brief for the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>missioner, without contradiction, that at least two <em>nisi prius </em>courts have held that a fine could not be imposed as a condition of probation without verdict, citing the late Judge Edwin Harlan of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City in <em>State v. Palmer </em>(Ind. 780Y/1963) and Judge Raine of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County who stated on September 21, 1966, \u201cIt is a legal bastard. It is sort of evading the issue. * * * No one has ever heard of a probation before verdict being followed by a jail sentence. That\u2019s a punitive measure and so\u2019s a fine. Both of these penalties can only be applied with a verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">It is important to observe, also, that the then Attorney General, Thomas B. Finan, now a judge of this Court, at the request of the then Chief Judge of the Municipal Court of Baltimore City, T. Barton Harrington, advised Chief Judge Harrington on May 11, 1964 (see 49 Opinions of the Attorney General 129 (1964)) that no \u201cmonetary charge, sometimes described as a \u2018fine,\u2019 sometimes as a \u2018condition of probation\u2019 \u201d other than court costs, could be imposed upon an accused granted probation without verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">It is our opinion that a monetary fine, penalty or charge payable to the State may only be imposed upon an accused if there is a finding of guilt, either after a trial on the merits or upon valid pleas of guilty or <em>nolo contendere. </em>Such an imposition is inconsistent with the granting of probation without finding a verdict. This does not mean, however, that the payment of money by way of <em>restitution </em>may not, in proper cases, be imposed as a condition of probation without finding a verdict. Such a requirement is to be distinguished from a fine or penalty payable to the State as <em>punishment </em>for the commission of a crime, and is in the nature of reparations or redress to make whole, persons who have been injured by the accused\u2019s conduct. As such, it is not punitive, and is not, like a fine, consistent only with a criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In the light of this, it appears that the Municipal Court has taken, in the same case and for the same offenses, two inconsistent actions. As we do not believe they may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>adequately reconciled, the question remains as to which one is controlling. The accused might take the position that the action of the Municipal Court should be interpreted in a light most favorable to him, but in the present case, Mr. Lee apparently paid the fine voluntarily, and took no appeal from the action of the Municipal Court in imposing the fine. It may be possible that this action, if done after explanation by, and with the advice of counsel, may be tantamount to a withdrawal of the original pleas of \u201cNot Guilty\u201d and in substance and effect (but obviously not in form) amount to the entry of a plea of <em>\u201cnolo contendere\u201d </em>accepted by the Municipal Court, thus permitting the valid imposition of the fine. The record in the present case is too meager and incomplete to enable us to express an opinion on this, inasmuch as we are not able to discover if Mr. Lee was, in fact, represented by counsel at the Municipal Court hearing and whether or not he was advised by counsel of the possible effect of acquiescing in and paying the fine. These matters may be explored upon the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Of course, the present action is in no way an attack, either direct or collateral, on the decision of the Municipal Court. Thus, for the limited purposes of the Department of Motor Vehicles, we believe that the Commissioner and his License Reviewer were justified in assuming, <em>prima facie, </em>upon receipt of the report of the Municipal Court clerk of the <em>Lee </em>case as required by the statute where there has been a <em>conviction, </em>that there necessarily was a finding of guilt by the Municipal Court for the traffic violations involved. We believe that the transmission of such a record showing the payment of the fine by the accused may be so treated by the Commissioner and that until the licensee rebuts that assumption by successful appeal to the Criminal Court of Baltimore from the Municipal Court, or otherwise, the Commissioner could proceed on the theory that there had been a conviction in the case. <em>Cf. </em>Code, Art. 661/2, \u00a7 104(c) which provides that for purposes of the mandatory revocation procedure, the forfeiture of bail or collateral shall be treated as a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>viction. The lower court indicated that the Commissioner in this case, through his License Reviewer, was attempting to look behind a judicial finding to determine the guilt or innocence of persons, but this does not appear to us to be the case. The License Reviewer was looking at two inconsistent actions of the Municipal Court, one only-consistent with no finding of guilt, the other only consistent with a finding of guilt. When the elements of (1) the report by the clerk and (2) the apparent voluntary payment of the fine by the accused are added to the consideration of the matter, the License Reviewer would have been justified, in our opinion, in proceeding under \u00a7 104 for a mandatory revocation upon a conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Because of the inherent confusion in the situation, however, he acted with commendable caution in proceeding under \u00a7 105(d) after notice and a hearing with counsel present in which he considered the possible finding of guilt resulting in a fine, paid by the accused, but also \u2014 and perhaps more importantly \u2014 he considered the facts on the merits, which led him to conclude that Mr. Lee was an unfit and unsafe person to hold his operating license. Whether or not the License Reviewer was correct in this action will abide the result in the lower court upon the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">We do not reach the question in this case of whether or not an appeal would lie to the Baltimore City Court, because, as we have noted, the License Reviewer proceeded under \u00a7 105 (d) in revoking the license and his action under this section is clearly appealable by virtue of the provisions of \u00a7 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\n<em>Case remanded to the Baltimore City Court, without affirmance or reversal, for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion, the costs to be paid by the appellant, Commissioner of Motor Vehicles.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
