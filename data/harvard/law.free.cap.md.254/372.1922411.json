Kitchen, Ramon B. Kitchen, and Terry L. Kitchen, trading as Kitchen Brothers Equipment Co., Inc. appeal from an order entered November 14, 1968, by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County granting a motion to dismiss their amended mechanics\u2019 lien claim with prejudice in equity actions D-2223, D-2261, and D-2287, which had been consolidated for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">On March 17, 1967, \u201cKitchen Bros. Equipment Co., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Inc., a Virginia corporation,\u201d filed a mechanics\u2019 lien in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County in Mechanics\u2019 Lien Docket 31, folio 438, setting forth a claim against the appellees Herbert A. Himelfarb, et al. Thereafter, on July 18, 1967, \u201cKitchen Bros. Equipment Co., Inc.\u201d filed a bill of complaint for foreclosure of its mechanics\u2019 lien in which it alleged that it was a Virginia corporation with its principal place of business at 218 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, Virginia. The appellees raised preliminary objections based on the ground that the claimant lacked the capacity to bring suit since it was not registered or otherwise qualified to do business in Maryland. The Circuit Court granted \u201cKitchen Bros. Equipment Co., Inc.\u201d thirty days to register or qualify, but no action was taken by the claimant. On March 27, 1967, the Circuit Court entered an order dismissing the bill of complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The mechanics\u2019 lien filed by \u201cKitchen Bros. Equipment Co., Inc.\u201d was amended on February 26, 1968, substituting Ronald E. Kitchen, Ramon B. Kitchen, and Terry L. Kitchen, t/a Kitchen Bros. Equipment Co., Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">On or about June 17, 1968, the appellants filed answers in the three present actions which were filed by B <em>&amp; </em>M Welding and Iron Works, Inc., United States Tile &amp; Marble Company, and John L. Renshaw, Inc. to foreclose their mechanics\u2019 liens. The three cases were consolidated' for trial at which time oral motions were made to dismiss the claim of \u201cKitchen Bros. Equipment Co., Inc.\u201d One ground for the motions was that the appellants\u2019 answers did not make the necessary allegations to properly foreclose a mechanics\u2019 lien. The pertinent parts of the appellants\u2019 answers are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201cThat in further Answer to the said Bill of Complaint, defendants state that they are the owner of a mechanics\u2019 lien against the property described in said Complaint, said lien having been filed on the 17th day of March, 1967, among the Land Records- for Prince George\u2019s County, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Maryland, in Liber 31, Folio 438, and that the amount of the said mechanics\u2019 lien is $10,680.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">On November 14, 1968, the Circuit Court entered an order dismissing the appellants\u2019 mechanics\u2019 lien with prejudice. On appeal, the appellants challenge the correctness of the court\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In oral argument before the Circuit Court, counsel for both parties cited <em>Atlantic Mill &amp; Etc., Co. v. Keefer, </em>179 Md. 496, 20 A. 2d 178, as controlling. In that case, Atlantic Mill &amp; Lumber Realty Co., Inc. filed a mechanics\u2019 lien against Keefer after Atlantic\u2019s corporate charter had been forfeited. They also filed a bill of complaint to enforce the lien to which Keefer demurred. The demurrer to the bill was sustained with leave to amend. Thereafter, one Herman Meyer, trading as Atlantic Mill &amp; Lumber Company, filed an amended complaint and also amended the mechanics\u2019 lien. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the amended bill of complaint without leave to amend. On appeal, this Court upheld the lower court\u2019s action and we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cThe original mechanics\u2019 lien, filed April 29th, 1939, was inoperative, null and void as the petitioner was not in existence and had no power to file the lien. Such petitioner not being in existence and having no authority to enforce rights acquired during the life of its charter could not file the alleged mechanics\u2019 lien, could not file the original bill of complaint for its enforcement, could not file a petition for authority to file an amended bill of complaint. The amended lien was not filed by the directors of the corporation as trustees nor by a receiver or receivers of the corporation, but by \u2018Herman M. Meyer, trading as Atlantic Mill and Lumber Company.\u2019 It therefore appears that the amended bill of complaint of \u2018Herman M. Meyer, trading as Atlantic Mill and Lumber Company,\u2019 was an entirely new action and that the amended mechan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ics\u2019 lien, an entirely new claim filed more than six months after the time fixed by statute (Code, art. 63, sec. 23) was no lien and is, therefore, not enforceable. <em>Wilson v. Wilson, </em>51 Md. 159; <em>Ortwine v. Caskey, </em>43 Md. 134, 138; <em>Trustees v. Heise, </em>44 Md. 453; <em>Wix v. Bowling, </em>120 Md. 265, at 267-269, 87 A. 759. It is contended by the appellant under the broad provisions of amendment given by Code, art. 63, sec. 32, that the amended mechanics\u2019 lien should be considered as an amendment and not as a new lien. We do not construe that section as permitting an individual to take advantage of a lien previously filed by a nonentity.\u201d 179 Md. at 500-01, 20 A. 2d at 181.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">We agree with the parties that <em>Atlantic </em>is dispositive of this case. The appellants may not take advantage of a \u201clien\u201d previously filed by a nonentity, and their attempted amendment of the mechanics\u2019 lien must be considered on its own merits. Since it was not filed until more than eleven months after the original mechanics\u2019 lien claim was filed, it is readily apparent that their attempted lien was not filed in compliance with Code (1968 Repl. Vol.), Article 63, Section 23, which requires that the claim be filed no later than six months after the claimant has furnished labor or materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\n<em>Order affirmed. Costs to be ;paid by the appellants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
