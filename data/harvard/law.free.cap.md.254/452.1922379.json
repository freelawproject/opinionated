Burgess (Burgess) and his wife. Burgess owned two German shepherd dogs. When Burgess went to feed the dogs, the boy accompanied him to the 30 foot by 50 foot run where the dogs were kept. The boy was injured in the pen. This suit was brought alleging in a single count:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">\u201c[T]hat at said time and place the Defendants in a negligent manner allowed their [G]erman shep[he]rd dog to severely bite and maul the minor Plaintiff. That the Defendants were negligent in taking the minor Plaintiff to watch and/or assist in the feeding of the said [G]er-man shep [he] rd dog, when the Defendants knew or should have known that dogs of this nature tend to be violent and oppressive when children or any person is near the area in which they are eating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">\u201cThat in addition thereto the Defendant [s] knew or should have known of the dangerous propensities of their dog and that they failed to take reasonable steps to prevent said animal from attacking and mauling the minor Plaintiff named herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">\u201cIn addition thereto the Defendants committed other acts of negligence all of which have proximately caused the severe permanent injuries to the minor Plaintiff and have caused the adult Plaintiff, his mother, to suffer and to in the future suffer loss of services of the minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Plaintiff. The Plaintiffs were in the exercise of due care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Upon motion of the defendants, summary judgment was entered in their favor. We shall affirm that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The remedy of summary judgment pursuant to Maryland Rule 610 a is proper only where there is no dispute as to a material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Horst v. Kraft, </em>247 Md. 455, 458, 231 A. 2d 674 (1967), and <em>Owens v. Simon, </em>245 Md. 404, 407, 226 A. 2d 548 (1967). As was said by Judge Niles for this Court in <em>Tellez v. Canton Railroad Co., </em>212 Md. 423, 430, 129 A. 2d 809 (1957), \u201cThe function of the summary judgment procedure is not to try the case or to decide issues of fact. It is merely to determine whether there is an issue of fact to be tried, and if there is none, to cause judgment to be rendered accordingly.\u201d Where different inferences may be drawn from undisputed facts, the party against whom the inferences are sought to be drawn is entitled to the inferences more favorable to his contentions. <em>White v. Friel, </em>210 Md. 274, 285, 123 A. 2d 303 (1956), and <em>Roland v. Lloyd E. Mitchell, Inc., 221 </em>Md. 11, 14, 155 A. 2d 691 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The undisputed facts, other than previously stated, which may be gleaned from the record are: The precise cause of the boy\u2019s injury is not known. The boy said with reference to the dog \u201cMike\u201d, \u201c[I]t seems like he did get up on my shoulder, but he didn\u2019t snap at me or anything.\u201d The boy reiterated that the dog did not bite him, although he remembered that the dog\u2019s paws were up on his shoulders. The mother testified that she looked out of the side window in the Burgess kitchen. She saw the dog\u2019s paws on the boy\u2019s shoulders. The boy and the dog were close to the fence. She did not know whether the boy was against the fence. She saw the dog\u2019s paws, but did not see the dog. She did not see the dog pawing at the boy. She did not see the dog bite the boy. After this incident she said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">\u201cMark turned around to the window and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>had a real funny look on his face, and I noticed something had happened, and I went running out of the house, and [Mrs. Burgess] was right behind me and Mark was coming out and, when he saw me, he started to run to meet me and he started crying then. I don\u2019t know how far away he was from me then. I can\u2019t remember, but I saw blood on him and I looked for something to wipe it with and there was his sweat shirt on the stoop that Mrs. Burgess gave me. I didn\u2019t know the blood was from his ear. I had no idea it was his ear, but there was a lot of blood and Randy said, \u2018Let\u2019s get him to a doctor.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Burgess was asked the question, \u201cWhen did the biting take place?\u201d, to which he replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201cThere was no biting as far as I know because they were playing. I noticed them kind of romping like a dog and a boy will do, but I never seen any biting. Now whether he got him with a claw or he did get him with a tooth, I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">They were about three or four feet outside of the gate before either Burgess or the boy noticed any blood on the boy and Burgess didn\u2019t know that any portion of the ear was missing until they were at the doctor\u2019s office. He stated unequivocally that the boy was not attacked by any dog. Thereafter, the record on deposition is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201cQ. * * * To your knowledge, is there anything, other than the dog, that would have caused him to lose a portion of his ear ? Did he cut himself on the fence or take a knife and do it ? A. I don\u2019t think he took a knife, but we have a doghouse which he could have fallen against.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201cQ. Did you see him fall? A. No, and we have a fence, but I can\u2019t say definitely that the dog did it. I can\u2019t say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>\u201cQ. Do you know that anything else did it? A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">\u201cQ. Did you see him fall against the fence? A. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">\u201cQ. Did you see him fall against the doghouse? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4f\">\u201cQ. Did you see him fall against any object whatsoever ? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">\u201cQ. As far as you know, did the boy ever leave his feet? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-11\">\u201cQ. To your knowledge, had [the dog] ever bitten anyone before, any person? A. A human being, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-12\">\u201cQ. Had he ever bitten another animal before? A. Now I can\u2019t say definitely, but no domestic animal that I know of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-13\">\u201cQ. How about undomestic? A. I can\u2019t say, but we have a lot of wild animals running around there, but I would say no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">In response to defendant\u2019s interrogatories the mother conceded that she did not know of anyone\u2019s having been bitten by the animal in question prior to the incident in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">The Maryland rule of liability was stated by Judge (now Chief Judge) Hammond for this Court in <em>Herbert v. Ziegler, </em>216 Md. 212, 139 A. 2d 699 (1958) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-16\">\u201cTo hold liable the owner of a domestic animal that has caused injury, the claimant must show that the owner knew, or by the exercise of ordinary and reasonable care should have known, of the inclination or propensity of the animal to do the particular mischief that was the cause of the harm. <em>Twigg v. Ryland, </em>62 Md. 380, 386 [1884] ; and <em>May Co. v. Drury </em>[160 Md. 143, 153 Atl. 61 (1931)], <em>Evans v. Upmier </em>[16 N.W. 2d 6 (Ia. 1944)] and <em>Lynch v. Richardson, </em>[39 N.E. 801 (Mass. 1895)], all <em>supra; Prosser, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>Torts </em>(2d ed.), Sec. 57, pp. 323-325; <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>Sec. 518.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The aforegoing was quoted verbatim in <em>Finneran v. Wood, </em>249 Md. 643, 648, 241 A. 2d 579 (1968). See also <em>Hamilton v. Smith, </em>242 Md. 599, 219 A. 2d 783 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">It is an undisputed fact that Burgess did not know of any prior attacks by this dog or any demonstration of a vicious propensity. To this point the boy and his mother state that in <em>Bachman v. Clark, </em>128 Md. 245, 97 A. 440 (1916), our predecessors allowed for injuries received by dog bite without any evidence that the dog had actually bitten people before, holding that evidence showing that the dog had growled at people prior to the incident \u201c* * * was legally sufficient to go to the jury * * <em>* </em>to show that the dog had a propensity or inclination to bite mankind * * and calling our attention also to <em>Goode v. Martin, </em>57 Md. 606 (1882). In <em>Bachman v. Clark, supra, </em>Judge Pattison for the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">\u201cIt must first be shown, in order to render the owner liable for damages to one bitten by his dog, that the dog had a vicious propensity, and second that such vicious propensity or inclination was known to its owner. But the owner\u2019s knowledge of the dog\u2019s vicious propensity need only be such as to put him on his guard and to require him as an ordinary prudent person to anticipate the act or conduct of the dog resulting in the injury for which the owner is sought to be held liable. 3 C.J. 96. The owner\u2019s knowledge of the propensity of the dog may be, and most generally is, acquired from its conduct and behavior, although such knowledge may be acquired from other persons, and in some cases the knowledge of others is imputed to the owner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">On that premise, where there was evidence that the dog wa.s always kept in an enclosure; that the dog would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>jump on people entering the enclosure; that the dog would become excited, bark and run up and down the fence, attempting to bite a stick thrust between the palings by boys upon the outside; that the dog would growl; and that the dog was always kept within the enclosure except when on a strap, our predecessors did hold there was legally sufficient evidence to go to the jury as tending to show the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the dog\u2019s vicious propensity or inclination to bite mankind. In <em>Goode v. Martin, supra, </em>our predecessors held the defendant might be presumed to have had knowledge that his dogs were fierce and dangerous from the fact that he was accustomed to keep them tied during the daytime. These cases certainly are not authority for the proposition suggested by the boy and his mother that it is not essential to establish facts which could put an owner on notice of the potentially vicious propensity of his animal. The fact that the dogs here were kept in an enclosure in a suburban area in a day when legal restrictions frequently forbid a dog\u2019s running at large cannot have the same significance that the matter of enclosure had in 1916 and 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The boy and mother claimed that they do not here rely entirely upon the line of cases dealing with \u201cvicious\u201d propensities but that Burgess was negligent when he took the boy into a place of danger because of the \u201cdangerous\u201d propensities of the dog. They had filed an affidavit from an officer of the Prince George\u2019s County police department with long time experience in the \u201cK 9 Corps\u201d that this \u201cbreed of dog can and often does behave in a very vicious manner; that this breed of dog can and will act in a vicious manner if in any way disturbed while eating\u201d and \u201cthat the owner of such an animal knows or should know of the potential dangerous propensities of this breed of dog and that such animal should not be disturbed while eating; that if such disturbance does occur, the animal will likely attack in some manner the person disturbing it, particularly if that person is not the dog\u2019s master.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Our predecessors in <em>May Co. v. Drury, </em>160 Md. 143, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>153 A. 61 (1931), considered a somewhat analogous claim. There a customer of a pet shop was bitten by an uncaged parrot. Judge (later Chief Judge) Sloan there said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u201cThe only evidence tending to show that it was vicious came from the defendant\u2019s witnesses. Harry F. Crouch, on cross-examination, was asked, \u2018Had any parrot at all ever molested any one in that store ?\u2019 and answered, \u2018The only person I know was the man that had charge of the pet shop in taking the parrots out of the cage when they were shipped from Texas sometimes putting his hand down, a strange parrot <em>* </em>* * might nip his finger.\u2019 He then stated that this parrot was shipped from Texas. This evidence is too far fetched to prove the <em>scienter </em>of the defendant. Adopting the view that the offending parrot was a domesticated or tamed bird, it is necessary for the plaintiff to show that it was possessed of a vicious propensity, and that the defendant knew of it or had reason for believing that it was not safe to let it run or fly at large in the store or shop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147-48.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Judgment in favor of the plaintiff was affirmed in that case, however, on the strength of <em>Goode v. Martin, supra, </em>since the evidence was that the birds were kept caged except when their cages were being cleaned, and they then warned customers away from the birds. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u201cIf they felt this way about it, the parrots should not have been allowed within reach of the customers. Nothing but the fear of consequences such as we have here could have inspired those having charge of the parrots to warn customers to stay away from them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">In <em>Twigg v. Ryland, </em>62 Md. 380 (1884), Chief Judge Alvey said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">\u201cThe owner or keeper of the dog or other do<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>mestic animal must be shown to have had knowledge of its disposition to commit such injury, and the burden of proving this fact is on the plaintiff, though it would be otherwise if the animal was of a nature to be fierce and untamable, such as bears, tigers, etc. <em>Spring Co. v. Edgar, </em>99 U. S. 645. <em>The notice which will charge the owner or keeper with liability for the vicious conduct of the animal must be notice that it was inclined to do the particular mischief that has been done. </em>Hence, notice that a dog is ferociously disposed towards cattle, is no notice that he will attack persons. It is not necessary to show that the owner or keeper of a vicious dog has seen the animal attack mankind; but it is sufficient to show that the vicious propensity of the animal has, in some way, been brought to the knowledge of the owner or keeper, so as to admonish him to take the necessary precaution to prevent injury in the future. Hence the question in each case is whether the notice was sufficient to put the owner or keeper on his guard, and to require him to anticipate the injury that has actually been done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385-86. (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Actually, there appears to be nothing to show that the injuries to the boy came from an attack by the dog. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the dog was responsible, we agree with the trial court' where it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201cThe Court does not accept the theory that because a German shepherd dog \u2018can and often does behave in a very vicious manner\u2019 an owner of a <em>particular </em>German shepherd dog knows or should know that his dog possesses these tendencies. There is nothing in the record to demonstrate that the particular dog alleged to have caused the injury herein was of a violent or oppressive nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The boy and his mother, in addition, assert that the trial court erred in making a ruling, without taking into consideration the points raised by their request for admission of facts, which they contend are deemed admitted because they were unanswered. Assuming, without deciding, that these points were to be considered by the trial judge in arriving at his decision, the result would not be different, since none of the points raised establishes or deals with the requisite <em>scienter </em>on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Summary judgment was properly entered for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellants to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
