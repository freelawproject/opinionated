Demo-rest (Demorest) and his wife. We shall sustain the action of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Snoots, Demorest and another on the night of August 18, 1967, had been to motorcycle races. They all had \u201ca couple of beers\u201d which was later defined to be two beers. They stopped on the way home to play the slot machines at which time Demorest and Snoots each had another beer. Although there appears to have been evidence of sleeping on the part of the passengers in the car, the parties testified that Snoots showed no visible effect of his three beers and that he appeared alert. Around midnight they stopped at a restaurant for breakfast. It serves no alcoholic beverages. Snoots there drank coffee in addition to eating. They took one passenger home. Demorest remained. on the back seat of the car after that passenger was discharged. About seven or eight miles from the point where this passenger was discharged the accident took place. Demorest\u2019s version of it was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">\u201cWe were just driving along and I must have fell asleep, and the next thing I remember was hitting the curb and waking up, going through the windshield.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">He claimed that his last recollection before the accident was that Snoots was wide awake, very alert and not having any problem with his driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>The Snoots version of the accident was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">\u201cWell, I took the normal route that I would take from Foote\u2019s house to mine. And we were going out Good Luck Road and I apparently fell asleep at the wheel, and I woke up in an instant before we hit the curb.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">He testified that he felt fine at Foote\u2019s house ten or fifteen minutes before the accident, and he had no preliminary signs or indications that he was in a sleepy condition. On cross-examination, however, the record is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">\u201cQ. You said apparently you fell asleep. You don\u2019t know whether you did for sure? A. No, not for sure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">It is the contention of Snoots here that the trial court erred in failing to rule as a matter of law that Demo-rest failed to establish negligence on the part of Snoots, \u201cin that the evidence of record established that appellees\u2019 injuries were caused when, without any reason to foresee or anticipate that he might do so, appellant suddenly fell asleep while operating the involved automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Snoots relies on a recent decision of the Superior Court of Connecticut in <em>Shanley v. Shanley, </em>27 Conn. Sup. 417, 241 A. 2d 543 (1968) denying a plaintiff passenger\u2019s motion for summary judgment in view of the fact that the defendant driver\u2019s affidavit tended to support the driver\u2019s defense that he fell asleep and his car swerved off the road and struck a pole. The court there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-10\">\u201cWhile the rule of law relative to the \u2018sleeping motorist\u2019 has been subjected to criticism, a majority of the jurisdictions agree that in automobile accident litigation if, \u2018without any premonitory signs of drowsiness, you were suddenly deprived of consciousness by the sandman or Morpheus, you were not at fault and were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>an actor\u2019 and thus legally incapable of incurring liability. Kaufman &amp; Kantrowitz, \u2018The Case of the Sleeping Motorist,\u2019 25 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 362. \u2018[BJecause negligence presupposes a voluntary act, the actor [the sleeping motorist] cannot be negligent for what he does or fails to do while he is unconscious.\u2019 2 Harper &amp; James, Torts \u00a7 16.7, p. 921. There must be an appreciation by the alleged tort-feasor of the fact that he is sleepy. See Kakluskas v. Somers Motor Lines, Inc., 134 Conn. 35, 39, 54 A. 2d 592. To put it differently, the defendant driver must be shown to be a \u2018responsible agent\u2019 in directing the course of the car, that he was negligent in exercising control, and that this negligence was a proximate cause of the collision. Badela v. Karpowich, 152 Conn. 360, 363, 206 A. 2d 838.\u201d 241 A. 2d at 544.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Snoots also relies on the decision in <em>Shirks Motor Express v. Oxenham, </em>204 Md. 626, 106 A. 2d 46 (1954) wherein this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">\u201cWe assume, without deciding, that if, without contradiction or effective challenge, there had been shown that the driver\u2019s sudden illness preceded the accident, the verdict should have been directed for the appellant. That is not this case. Here, there is a very effective challenge to the appellant\u2019s position as to the time of the onset of the unexpected illness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In <em>Smack v. Jackson, </em>238 Md. 35, 207 A. 2d 511 (1965) Judge Horney said for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">\u201cUnder Maryland Rule 552 a, a party is not entitled to a directed verdict in his favor unless the facts and circumstances are such as to permit of only one inference with regard to the issue presented.\u201d (citing cases) <em>Id. </em>at 37.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>We are not obliged to determine to what degree, if at all, the \u201csleeping motorist\u201d rule should apply in Maryland. From the lips of the defendant one may draw the inference that he was asleep or that he was not asleep. Since there was more than one inference that could have been drawn, it would have been improper to direct a verdict in his favor. Snoots did not object to the charge to the jury nor did he request any additional instructions. Accordingly, we find no error on the part of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
