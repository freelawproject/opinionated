We shall affirm Judge Cullen\u2019s disposition of the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Chertkof sought to acquire from the Railroad a 19 acre tract of land in Anne Arundel County lying for the most part between the west side of the Railroad\u2019s right of way and a small stream known as Stony Run. The tract is a little over a mile long; it is at no point as much as 400 feet wide; for much of its length it is from 25 to 100 feet wide and at one point it is only ten feet wide. The northern boundary coincides with the south side of the Baltimore-Washington Expressway. The south end appears to border on Stony Run Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In August 1965 the Railroad caused to be prepared, using one of its printed forms, an agreement which it calls an \u201coptional receipt.\u201d It states that the Railroad had agreed through \u201cW. R. Dunn, Jr., Real Estate Agent, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors\u201d to sell to the Chertkofs the property delineated on an attached plat for $10,000, of which $1,000 had been paid in cash; the balance was to be paid upon the delivery of the deed. The agreement requires the insertion in the deed, if executed, of a number of restrictive conditions seldom seen in run-of-the-mine deeds. The concluding paragraphs, being especially relevant to the issue before us, are set forth in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">\u201cThe delivery of said, deed and settlement therefor (including the apportionment of the taxes to the date of such settlement) shall be made at such place as shall be mutually agreed upon and on a day to be mutually agreed upon but <em>within thirty (30) days after Grantor has notified Grantee that said Grantor is ready for settlement; </em>and <em>upon the failure of Grantee </em>to make such settlement at the time and place so fixed, the sum paid on account will be retained by Grantor <em>as liquidated damages; </em>and thereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Grantee shall not have any interest whatever in said premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\"><em>\u201cIn the event Grantor\u2019s Board of Directors fails to approve this sale, </em>or in the event it should develop that Grantor\u2019s title to said premises for any reason is not good and marketable, clear of all liens and encumbrances, excepting as aforesaid, and Grantee shall not be agreeable to accept title of such lesser quality as the Grant- or is willing to give, <em>then the sum paid on account will be refunded to the Grantee, </em>who hereby agrees to accept same, whereupon this writing shall be cancelled and annulled and neither party hereto shall have any claim whatever against the other by reason hereof.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The agreement was sent to Chertkof along with a letter dated 2 September 1965, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">\u201cHerewith is agreement, in duplicate, covering the sale of the above mentioned property to you for consideration of $10,000.00. Will you please sign your names on the lines indicated, having two witnesses sign on the lines opposite your names and return both copies of the agreement to this office for execution on the part of the Railroad Company, together with your check in the amount of $1,000.00, made payable to the Railroad Company. The agreement will be dated when executed on behalf of our company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\"><em>\u201cIt is understood, however, that this agreement is not to be construed to be a commitment on behalf of the Railroad Company, as it is necessary to secure Executive and Board approvals before the sale can be consummated. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">\u201cAfter the agreement has been executed on the part of the Railroad Company, a copy will be returned for your file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>\u201cYour attention is expressly directed to the fact that this agreement shall be of no effect and null and void if same is not signed and returned within thirty (30) days from the date hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\">Yours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">/s/ F. J. Geist Real Estate Agent\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">VTH :naf</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Chertkof, himself a real estate broker, said he read and understood both the agreement and the letter. The agreement, signed by the Chertkofs, and a $1,000 check dated 7 September 1965 were returned to the Railroad which, by letter dated 14 September, acknowledged the receipt thereof, enclosing a fully executed copy of the agreement dated 13 September.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Frederick J. Geist, the Railroad\u2019s real estate agent in 1965 and 1966, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: When we had a sale of real estate being considered, we have to first fix in mind that there are three levels generally that the matter has to go through. We have the lowest, which is the division level, which takes a close look at the proposition. If we can get preliminary approvals from our divisional people, we send an optional form receipt of agreement to our regional level, which embraces three divisions. If the regional level sees no basic objections to the proposition as submitted to it, it comes back to the divisional level. That is, the executed optional receipt does. Then the divisional people start to progress the thing all over again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: At this point, the division has the responsibility of preparing a paper, which would be called the executive sale form letter. This is the paper which is approved by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>officers in the division, the region and the system level, prior to actual preparation and execution of a deed. As far as \u2014 I think the original question was duties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: The executive sale form letter is the responsibility of the division to prepare for submission, again through the division, then to the region and then to the system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Victor T. Hippie (VTH), Geist\u2019s assistant, whose service in the real estate department spanned 27 years, was Chertkof\u2019s only contact with the Railroad. He had been doing business with Hippie since 1958. In his \u201cpast dealings\u201d with the Railroad, Chertkof had bought \u201cmany, many properties.\u201d \u201cThey [the Railroad] were always tardy in settlement\u201d he said. \u201cThey generally notified us [of settlement] within a reasonable time; within a year, I would say\u201d he added. After receiving the signed agreement from Geist (actually Hippie) Chertkof ordered the title examination. It was completed early in December.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Geist received a letter, dated 10 January 1966, from A. J. Hafner, the Railroad\u2019s Manager of Industrial Development, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">\u201cF. J. Geist</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">\u201cThis refers to proposed sale of 19 acres, between Stony Run Road and Baltimore-Washington Expressway to Howard L. Chertkof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">\u201cMr. D. B. Lenny, Assistant General Manager, Industrial Development, Philadelphia, advised that Mr. Smucker [Vice President, Operations] is opposed to selling this land because of current industrial activity in this general area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">A. J. Hafner\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">Geist testified that he sent the letter to Hippie with the following endorsement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-12\">\u201cVTH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-13\">Tell Chertkof no (with thanks) and ccs to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>persons we wrote to for approval telling them reasons for rejection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\">FJG 1/13\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Hippie telephoned Chertkof and told him he \u201chad run into a snag.\u201d He passed on to him the contents of Hafner\u2019s letter to Geist and suggested they \u201cwait and see the outcome of this particular industrial activity, as to how it affected the premises in question, and perhaps the matter could be resolved after the industrial activity had been consummated.\u201d He said they \u201cwere in touch with each other from then on until the time that letter <em>[infra] </em>was written cancelling the sale\u201d and tendering the return of the $1,000 deposit. Chertkof denied having been told the contents of the Hafner letter but he did say that he had talked to Hippie on \u201cmany occasions\u201d between December 1965 and November 1866. He thought it was \u201cat least once every two to four weeks.\u201d In these conversations, at one time or another, Hippie revealed to him, in justification of the cancellation, plans for a high-speed rail line which might require the flattening of the curve of the main line where it passed through the property, negotiations with county authorities concerning rights of way and negotiations with others for the assembly of industrial tracts. At no time did Chertkof indicate a desire or intention to withdraw or demand the return of the $1,000 deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">On 8 November 1966 Geist (Hippie) wrote to Chertkof as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\u201cDear Mr. Chertkof:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">\u201cPursuant to telephone conversation with our Mr. Hippie, <em>we are unable to secure approval of the above sale </em>and would appreciate your arranging for all parties to the agreement to meet with our Mr. Hippie in order that we may return the money paid on account. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">\u201cIt will be necessary for Robert and Jack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Chertkof as well as yourself to be present to sign a cancellation endorsement attached to the original agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">/s/ F.

His letter follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-18\">\u201cDear Mr. Chertkof:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-19\">\u201cYours of November 15,1966:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-20\">\u201cPlease refer to this Railroad\u2019s standard optional receipt form of agreement in the subject matter dated September 13, 1965, particularly to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>the third and fourth lines thereof reading in part \u2018subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of said Grantor\u2019 and to the last paragraph on Page 2 thereof reading in part \u2018in the event Grantor\u2019s Board of Directors fails to approve this sale * * * then the sum paid on account will be refunded to the Grantee, who hereby agrees to accept same, whereupon this writing shall be cancelled and annulled and neither party hereto shall have any claim whatever against the other by reason hereof.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\">\u201cWe regret to advise you that we have been unable to secure the approval of this sale by our Board of Directors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">\u201cAccordingly, will you please arrange for the proper execution and witnessing of the attached Rider, then telephone this office, at which time we will arrange to meet with you in your office and deliver to you the $1,000 refund of down money in exchange for the executed and witnessed Rider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">Yours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">/s/ F. J. Geist Real Estate Agent\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">FJGmaf</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">At this point there should be included in this recital the resolution of the Railroad (Pennsylvania) 'adopted by its Board of Directors on 21 February 1962:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">\u201cRESOLVED that any sale of real estate or an interest therein which, in the opinion of the President, any Vice President or the General Manager, Real Estate, shall be no longer necessary for the operation of the Company\u2019s railroad, and which involves a consideration not exceeding $100,000., may be made upon such terms and for such consideration as in the judgment of the President, any Vice President or the Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>eral Manager, Real Estate, are just and reasonable, and any of them is authorized to enter into and execute in the name of the Company, under its corporate seal or otherwise, contracts or agreements for the sale of such real estate or interest therein, the authority so exercised to be reported semiannually to the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">\u201cRESOLVED that the President, any Vice President or the General Manager, Real Estate, is authorized and empowered, in the event of such sales, to execute deeds and all papers or instruments in connection therewith, to affix the corporate seal thereto, and to acknowledge and deliver the same, and take all other actions and do all other things, <em>all with the same force and effect as if a specific resolution were adopted by the Board in each case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Substantially the same resolution (\u201cthe authority so exercised to be reported to the Board at its next meeting\u201d being the only change) was adopted by the Railroad (P. B. &amp; W.) on 14 May 1962. Chertkof was familiar with these resolutions having received copies of them in connection with the purchase of other properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The Chertkofs filed their bill of complaint in Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City on 21 February 1967. Six grounds for specific performance were alleged: (a) the Directors approved the sale; (b) Board approval was unnecessary because of the resolutions; (c) the Railroad represented that the contract had been approved; (d) the Railroad unreasonably delayed notification of non-approval; (e) the Railroad waived the requirement of approval; (f) the Railroad is estopped from relying on the requirement of approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">On 12 June 1968 the case came on for trial before Judge Cullen who held it sub curia until 16 September when he filed his opinion. He said Mr. Smucker\u2019s disapproval was \u201cin essence tantamount to disapproval by the Board of Directors.\u201d The arguments based on \u201claches, waiver and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>estoppel * * * [were] ill founded,\u201d he added. He found that submission of the contract to the Directors \u201cwas a condition precedent to the formation of the contract, that the condition was complied with and was subsequently disapproved by the Board, Mr. Smucker acting as its authorized representative, [and] that as a result the contract never materialized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">It is at once obvious that the agreement gave the Railroad the option to sell or not to sell the property. Had the Directors, qua Directors, actually considered and disapproved, or failed to approve, the agreement, the Chertkofs, without question, would have been entitled to nothing but the return of their money. We think it is equally obvious, and axiomatic as well, that the Board of Directors had the right to delegate to the principal officers of the company the power and authority (within limits) to sell the Railroad\u2019s property, if in their judgment the consideration was thought to be just and reasonable and the property not needed for operations. The resolution conferring this power, authority and discretion upon the named officers was known to the Chertkofs (they had copies in their files on other properties). By its very terms the resolution endowed their acts (or non-acts) with all \u201cthe same force and effect as if a specific resolution were adopted by the Board in each case.\u201d The power and authority to sell the Railroad\u2019s land, unless otherwise limited, necessarily included the power and authority not to sell. It seems to us, for instance, that the obligation to determine whether the property is any \u201clonger necessary for the operation of the Company\u2019s railroad\u201d suggests the possibility that the officers might have to make a judgment requiring the veto of a proposed sale. <em>See generally Penowa Coal Sales Co. v. Gibbs &amp; Co., </em>199 Md. 114, 119 (1952) ; <em>Eastern Shore Brokerage &amp; Comm\u2019n Co. v. Harrison, </em>141 Md. 91, 100 (1922) ; <em>Northern Central Ry. v. Bastian, </em>15 Md. 494, 501 (1860). Ironically the Chertkofs, in paragraph 14 of their bill of complaint, insisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>that Board approval was unnecessary, that the officers had the power to make the sale and, in fact, approved it.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The Chertkofs were thoroughly aware of the Railroad\u2019s procedures. They had bought \u201cmany, many properties\u201d from the Railroad in the past. But even if that were not so the warnings in this instance were explicit. The agreement begins by providing that it is \u201csubject to the approval of the Board of Directors\u201d and it concludes with the words, \u201cIn the event Grantor\u2019s Board of Directors <em>fails to approve this sale * * </em>(Emphasis added.) The letter of transmittal, it will be recalled, reiterated in blunt and unmistakable terms the twice repeated reservation of the agreement, citing the necessity of securing <em>\u201cExecutive and Board </em>approvals before the sale can be consummated.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It can hardly be said that the Chertkofs were not in a position to know something of the magnitude and extent of the Pennsylvania Railroad System. It should not be cause for wonder, by them or anyone, that a $2,500,000,000 transportation complex with 10,000 miles of railroad should find it necessary to adopt the procedures outlined by Geist in order to avoid serious blunders in the disposition of its' surplus real estate. Keeping the right hand advised of the left hand\u2019s activities would seem to require constant care and much attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We think this aspect of the case is controlled by <em>Julius Kessler &amp; Co. v. Askin, </em>185 Md. 647 (1920). In that case Kessler\u2019s salesmen, Berkowitz and Rosenbaum, solicited an order for whiskey from Askin. The printed order, a copy of which was left with Askin, contained a notice or statement that salesmen were not authorized to make contracts other than as therein specified, and that the <em>contract was subject to the approval of the home office. </em>Askin gave his check for $250 which, together with the contract, was sent by Berkowitz to the home office. Kessler, the president, returned the check to Askin and told him that the order would not be accepted. Askin was successful in the court below but this Court reversed. Judge Burke, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>\u201c* * * or(jer gigne(i by the plaintiff gave notice to him that the authority of the salesman was limited. Precisely the same limitation was contained in the previous orders. There was no obligation assumed by the defendant under its terms until it was approved by the home office. It was not approved, and the obligation of the defendant to ship the goods never arose. There is no evidence in the case tending to show that either Berkowitz or Rosenbaum had authority to waive the condition in the order, or to make a contract binding upon the defendant. The condition expressed in the order was a reasonable one, and was intended to control the credits of the defendant company. Certainly Berkowitz had no such authority to waive this condition and we failed to find any facts upon which it could be legally inferred that Rosenbaum had such power or authority. The case is controlled by the principles announced in <em>Brager v. Levy, </em>122 Md. 554, and the undisputed facts, which we have stated, have led us to the conclusion that in the light of those principles there was no legally sufficient evidence in the case to entitle the plaintiff to recover * * <em>Id. </em>at 648-49.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\"><em>See also Longdon v. Sibley, </em>100 N.H. 373, 127 A. 2d 156 (1956); <em>Walter Pratt &amp; Co. v. G. W. Chaffin &amp; Co., </em>136 N.C. 350, 48 S.E. 768 (1904); 1 A. Corbin, <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 61, 82 (1963); 1 W. Page, <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 197 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">We are not impressed with the Chertkofs\u2019 theory of waiver. A contract cannot be created by waiver. See <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Blumberg, </em>234 Md. 521 (1964). The cases cited by the Chertkofs involve waivers of conditions under contracts already in existence. Here the contract had yet to arise. In any event we have not found in this record any evidence that the Railroad waived anything, voluntarily or otherwise. Any inference of waiver, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>in the circumstances, would have to be raised on something Hippie said or did and, it is quite evident, we think, that Hippie could not waive the necessity of approval by the Board of Directors since he had no authority to commit them to anything in the first place. Neither can estoppel operate to create a contract. See <em>Kline v. Lightman, </em>243 Md. 460 (1966). In <em>Savonis v. Burke, </em>241 Md. 316, 319 (1966), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">\u201cIt is essential for the application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel that the party claiming the benefit of the estoppel must have been misled to his injury and changed his position for the worse, having believed and relied on the representations of the party sought to be es-topped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Oddly enough the Chertkofs rebut their own argument in this regard. They took the position at trial that the sale was approved when the agreement came back from Philadelphia, which would have been about 15 September 1965. If, as they insist,- they were misled, they misled themselves. As we said in <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Blumberg, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u201cAn essential element of estoppel is that the person sought to be estopped must be guilty of some wrongful or unconscientious conduct, on which the other party has relied and been misled to his injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">We have not found any evidence of wrongful or unconscientious conduct nor any evidence of injury, other than the Title Company\u2019s charge which might have been avoided had they waited for notice of a settlement date. They were resigned to a wait of a year, which they thought not unreasonable; Geist\u2019s letter (8 November 1966) was only seven weeks beyond a full year.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The Chertkofs contend that Judge Cullen fell into er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>ror when he admitted into evidence the Hafner memorandum and certain testimony concerning it. The Railroad insists the memorandum is admissible under Code, Art. 35, \u00a7 59 (1965 Repl. Vol.). We find it unnecessary to consider its admissibility under the statute. Before the memorandum was offered in evidence, Geist testified, without objection, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: * * * but in January before we had a plan, which is necessary for the executive sale form letter, I heard that Mr. Smucker was against this sale. So I never proceeded to prepare an executive sale form letter because I couldn\u2019t have even initialed the thing myself to get the thing started.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: So you heard something about something in the organization which made you quit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Since the Hafner memorandum does little more than restate Geist\u2019s testimony the Chertkofs\u2019 objection must be treated as waived. Maryland Rule 522 d 2. In any event its admission was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The final assignment of error arises out of Judge Cullen\u2019s refusal to allow Hippie and Dunn to be called as adverse witnesses as provided in Code, Art. 35, \u00a7 9 (1965 Repl. Vol.). Since neither Hippie nor Dunn was an \u201cofficer, director or managing agent\u201d of the Railroad we think Judge Cullen\u2019s ruling was correct. <em>See Hagerstown Brewing Co. v. Gates, </em>117 Md. 348, 360 (1912). Despite his ruling, however, we cannot see how the Chertkofs were prejudiced thereby. They were in no way inhibited in their questioning of Dunn. Although Hippie was questioned at length, only one question was proscribed by the court and that, in our judgment, was of little or no importance. Moreover Hippie was called as a witness by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the Railroad giving the Chertkofs the right, of which they availed themselves, to cross-examine him.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">It seems odd to us that the Chertkofs did not address a letter to the Board of Directors of the Railroad demanding consideration of the agreement and insisting upon either approval or disapproval. We think it unlikely that the Board would have chosen to ignore such a letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.
