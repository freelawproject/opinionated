The Board, finding the film to be obscene, petitioned the Circuit Court for a determination of its obscenity in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Maryland law. The appellant, William E. Hewitt, trading as Baltimore Film Society, submitted the film to the Board for approval and licensing, was a party to the proceedings before the Board and the Circuit Court and took a timely appeal to this Court from the order of August 2, 1968. We have viewed the film as required by Art. 66A, \u00a7 19 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">At the trial in the lower court, the Board called three expert witnesses: Dr. Robert M. Vidaver, on the issues of appeal to prurient interest and contravention of contemporary community standards; Professor William R. Mueller of Goucher College and Reuben Kramer, a prominent sculptor of national reputation, the testimony of the two last mentioned witnesses being limited to the issue of redeeming social value. The appellant, Hewitt, called two witnesses in the lower court: Dr. Sol Gordon, a clinical psychologist, and Albert D. Gerber, a Philadelphia attorney and legal advisor to makers of \u201csexploitation\u201d films. We will now consider the test to be applied, the qualifications and testimony of these witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">There were three issues of mixed law and fact involved before the Board and the lower court arising from our previous decisions applying the constitutional requirements imposed by decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in regard to freedom of speech. In <em>Dunn v. Maryland State Board of Censors, </em>240 Md. 249, 255, 213 A. 2d 751, 754 (1965), Judge (now Chief Judge) Hammond, for the Court, aptly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\u201cWe think it plain that save in the rare case where there could be no doubt that the film is obscene the Board will not meet the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>persuasion imposed on it by the Constitution and the statute without offering testimony that the picture is obscene in that (a) the average person, applying community standards, would find that its dominant theme, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interest, (b) that the film goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of sex or other matters dealt with, and (c) that it is subject to proscription because it is utterly without redeeming social importance considered in light of the fact that * * sex and obscenity are not synonymous\u2019, <em>Roth, </em>354 U. S. 476, 487, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1498, 1508, and the fact that material dealing with sex in a manner that advocates ideas or has literary, scientific or artistic value or any other form of social importance may not be branded as obscenity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Our definition of obscenity \u2014 the <em>Roth-Alberts </em>test \u2014 was restated with somewhat different emphasis perhaps, by the Supreme Court in <em>A Book Named \u201cJohn Clelands' Memoirs of A Woman of Pleasure\u201d v. Attorney General, </em>383 U. S. 413, 418, 86 S. Ct. 975, 977, 16 L.Ed.2d 1, 5-6 (1966), hereinafter referred to as <em>Memoirs, </em>in which Mr. Justice Brennan, for the Supreme Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201cWe defined obscenity in <em>Roth </em>in the following terms: \u2018[W]hether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\u2019 354 U.S. at 489. Under this definition, as elaborated in subsequent cases, three elements must coalesce: it must be established that (a) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">We recognized and applied this latest statement of the applicable rule in <em>Sanza v. Maryland State Board of Censors, </em>245 Md. 319, 326-27, 226 A. 2d 317, 320-21 (1967), in which we sustained the Circuit Court and the Board in their finding that certain films, shown in an arcade in \u201cthe Block\u201d in Baltimore, were obscene. Dr. Vidaver (because of a misprint, referred to as Dr. Ridaver in <em>Sanza) </em>testified before the Circuit Court as an expert in <em>Sanza </em>and his testimony was relied upon by the Chancellor in that case and by us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The appellant conceded at the argument of the case before us that there was sufficient evidence before the Chancellor from Dr. Vidaver\u2019s testimony from which he could find that the dominant theme of the film \u201cOdd Tastes\u201d taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest. He earnestly argued in both his brief and at the oral argument that Dr. Vidaver\u2019s testimony was not sufficient to sustain the Board\u2019s burden of proof to establish that the film was patently offensive because it affronted contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters. At the threshold of the appellant\u2019s argument on this issue is the contention that Dr. Vidaver is not qualified as an expert witness to express an opinion having any probative value on the issue. We do not agree with this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Dr. Vidaver\u2019s qualifications as an expert witness are impressive and, as we have already indicated, both the Chancellor and this Court relied upon his expert testimony on this issue \u2014 as well as other issues \u2014 in <em>Sanza. </em>In <em>Sanza, </em>Judge Oppenheimer, for the Court, summarized Dr. Vidaver\u2019s qualifications as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">\u201cDr. Robert M. Vidaver is Director of Psychiatric Education for the State of Maryland, Department of Mental Hygiene. Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, he lived in the midwest during the early part of his life. He was graduated from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Columbia University and studied medicine at \u25a0 the City University of New York, interned at the University of Maryland and the University Hospital, had three years\u2019 post-graduate training at the Yale Institute and has been on the faculties of the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the University of Maryland. He was Chief of the Psychiatric Section of Medical Service, United States Army.\u201d (245 Md. at 328, 226 A. 2d at 321)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">In addition to these qualifications, Dr. Vidaver testified in the lower court in the present case in reply to a question in regard to his training in audio-visual techniques for use in treating mental-health problems:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">\u201cWell, what we were trying to do was set up a closed-circuit video-tape television system at the University of Maryland Psychiatric Institute as a means of training medical students in a variety of professional skills and psychiatric diagnosis. Included in my work was a \u2014 were trips throughout the country to hospitals, universities, and psychiatric synods that already had some use of either film or video tape in training or in treatment, and these ranged from the University of Mississippi Psychiatric Institute through those of the East and West Coast, and required me to learn something of the techniques of audio-visual communication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The film contains a series of episodes of various types of sexual perversion. It is well summarized by Dr. Vidaver in his testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">\u201c(The Court) What is its relationship to sadism, as you saw it ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">\u201c(Mr. Whiteford) I object to the Court\u2019s question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">\u201c(The Court) Overruled, because the Court saw the gory details of the knife being plunged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>in Madam Clary\u2019s bosom, and saw the unhappy scene which, I suppose, for want of a better word we would characterize this as being a tragedy, in the Greek definition, or distinction between comedy and tragedy, as the central figure fell on his own knife. What is its relationship to sadism and, of course, I am referring, also, to the blowtorch applied to the reinforcing bars to which the young Negress\u2019 hands were strapped. What is its relationship to sadism?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-4\">\u201c(The Witness) A very strong one I believe, sir. Sadism we usually talk of as being different from merely violence or aggression, in that it has sexual overtones, or is a combining of the sexual and aggressive drives. So, when we speak of a sadistic assault, meaning a- sexual encroachment of the body of another, was especially used by the producers and directors of this film to heighten the sexual excitement, to emphasize the sexual theme, to sell, to pander, as it were, the sexual qualities of the film to an American audience already somewhat dulled to ordinary sexuality; to make it more appealing and stimulating \u2014 .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">\u201cI do feel that the appeal was very cleverly used to stimulate not so much the normal sexual drive of heterosexual relations and sexual intercourse, but a variety of perverted and infantile sexual themes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">\u201cIt starts out, of course, with the appeal to the kind of incestual fantasies of mother and boy child, with Ruthie opening her breasts to the infant Charles, and then, if imagination hasn\u2019t caught on already, going through a routine with her mouth and lips that is highly suggestive of fellatio to the infant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201cFrom there, of course, there is the kind of brother-sister incestual stimulation of Melaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>and the growing Charles. Both of these had, at least, been man-woman, and have led us into this kind of heterosexual perspective. When he moved to the boarding school\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">\u201c(The Court) He said his father found out about it and sent him away to Switzerland, as I recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201c (The Witness) So you have, there, the theme of punishment for the sexual fantasy which, again, is stirring to the audience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">\u201cIn the boarding school, Thomas\u2019 sister seemingly enters\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">\u201c(The Court) Seemingly, I think, is a good word. Thomas\u2019 sister quote \u2014 I think that should be in quotes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">\u201c(The Witness) Yes, sir \u2014 since we have already seen two women in a state of relative nakedness, we are quite caught up in the expectation as viewers that this would be another woman, when suddenly she unmasks and turns out to be a boy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">\u201cThere is the sexual confrontation of both homosexuality and the fantasies of women with a penis that is, again, a kind of problem area often for adolescents and small children who are still struggling to firm up sexual identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">\u201cFollowing this, it causes the homosexual relationship between Thomas and Charles, and it is suggested, if not the actual portrayal, of fellatio and the delight thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">\u201cFrom there on, we have repeated castration themes with the implication that if you play with sex or play with yourself, you will end up much the same as the hero \u2014 literally castrated and bleeding his life away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">\u201cThese are not only sexual themes to my perspective, but have primitive and unhealthy pathological sexual themes. Far from bringing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>out any catharsis in a normal sense or a ventilation of sexual drives, it presses, pushes, stimulates the most unhealthy of sexual feelings which might be present in all of us, and most of us try our best to repress and keep in control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">\u201cSo what we are left with is the kind of stimulation in sexual areas that we have no way to discharge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In regard to whether or not the film was patently offensive as exceeding contemporary community standards, Dr. Vidaver testified that it exceeded contemporary community standards with respect to candor in motion picture films \u201cto display it for entertainment purposes.\u201d He further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\u201cIf this was a medical documentary whose audience was to be professional persons, social workers, psychiatrists, doctors, then the purpose of the film might be to display the sexual aberrations possible in society, either educational or informational. But, since they were not even accurate in their portrayal of Oriental or African culture, we don\u2019t see an educational or informational purpose, here, but an entertainment one. And the entertaining value, as I see it in the film, comes through its ability to stimulate sexual energies in the individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">\u201cI found it to be patently offensive if I had paid money to see it in the theater in the expectation of humorous satire, tragedy, what-have-you\u2014 biography \u2014 and had thrust upon me this kind of assault at unconscious feelings or drives \u2014 homosexual, regressive, perverted \u2014 under the guise of watching a panorama of human behavior, I would feel upset and disturbed, and I would find this patently objectionable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">In contrasting the treatment of sexual matters in the film, \u201cOdd Tastes\u201d with other films, including a film in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>which \u201csexual activities were displayed\u201d but which had been licensed by the State Board of Censors, Dr. Vidaver testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">\u201cThe crucial difference, though, is that it represented a natural development of the characterization and plot. We had real, live people \u2014 teenagers \u2014 portrayed; their families, their work, their school, their sport activities, their leisure, and as part of their human existence, there was the expression of sexual needs. For good or bad, morality aside, it was in the portrayal of real human beings or the attempt at it, in everyday life, that was followed through in that aspect which was sexual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">\u201cThis is diametrically different from \u2018Odd Tastes,\u2019 where we see virtually nothing about the people except their sexual proclivities. We know really nothing about any of the women or Thomas or Charles as a person \u2014 his thoughts, feelings, hates, loves, skiils, failures, foibles \u2014 we don\u2019t know them as human beings. All we know them as is as something of sexual animals. You can tell anything about the size, shape, and configuration of their buttocks, and nothing about the rest of their human existence. And this kind of an exaggeration and misshapen portrayal of the sexual drive is what gives to this picture,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\u2018Odd Tastes,\u2019 a dominant theme which is prurient \u2014 not just the portrayal of nakedness, nudity, or sexuality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">It is clear to us from Dr. Vidaver\u2019s testimony that his opinion was that the film, \u201cOdd Tastes,\u201d exceeded the limits of the community\u2019s toleration for what is shown in motion pictures, not merely that the sexual activities shown in the film would not be tolerated in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Dr. Vidaver\u2019s testimony in this regard is, in our opinion, stronger in support of his opinion on this issue than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>was his testimony on the same point which we found legally sufficient in <em>Sanza. </em>We said in Sanza:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-4\"><em>\u201cNor do we agree with the appellants\u2019 contention that there is no evidence that national standards have been affronted. While most of Dr. Vidaver\u2019s testimony went to the effect of the material on the prurient interest of the average man, he also testified that, while the gyrations shown on the films might be acceptable between husband and wife, \u2018the performance for anybody else wo-uld be beyond the bounds of propriety.\u2019 </em>Unlike the situation as to the films \u2018A Stranger Knocks\u2019 (Trans-Lux) and \u2018Loma\u2019 <em>{Dunn) </em>there was no showing by the appellants that the films had been exhibited elsewhere in the country; indeed, the appellant Sanza admitted that, as far as he knew, they had not been shown except in Baltimore. Finally, with the gloss of Dr. Vidaver\u2019s uncontradicted testimony, the pictures speak for themselves.\u201d (Emphasis supplied) (245 Md. at 333-34, 226 A. 2d at 325)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Mr. Gerber, a witness for the appellant, acknowledged that the film, \u201cOdd Tastes\u201d was more explicit in two respects than certain other films to which Mr. Gerber referred. In reply to the question, \u201c* * * Is it your testimony that you * * * see no distinction in the explicitness of the film, \u2018This Film is Censored\u2019 (which we held to be constitutionally protected in <em>Hewitt v. Maryland State Board of Censors, </em>243 Md. 574, 221 A. 2d 894 (1966)) and \u2018Odd Tastes\u2019?\u201d Mr. Gerber replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">\u201cI have already expressed one point where it differed, if that is \u2014 and I don\u2019t believe \u2014 personally, I think it is a distinction without a difference, and that is, in \u2018This Picture is Censored,\u2019 it did not show pubic hair. And I would add one other comment, to be fair and complete, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>in that I have no personal interest in these subjects \u2014 and that is, in \u2018Odd Tastes,\u2019 there is also a scene where the male touches \u2014 fingers the female breast, which is again something that is comparatively new in the making of these films. This has been the kind of thing that has been coming, but just arriving. They started out by having the male finger the thing, then the buttocks, other parts of the body, and only recently in a few pictures the breasts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In regard to whether or not the film, \u201cOdd Tastes\u201d was utterly without redeeming social importance, Dr. Vidaver testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201cI could find no redeeming social value or educational or informational aspect. One might compare it with a recent film from Massachusetts called \u2018Tillicott Follies,\u2019 which is actually under injunction in Massachusetts, and has been released by a subsidiary of the Grove Press, well-known for their anti-censorship endeavors. \u2018Tillicott Follies\u2019 shows a great deal of nakedness and brutality in one of the Massachusetts State Hospitals, and in itself is a terribly upsetting and disquieting film. But when Judge Bazelon brought it to the Hopkins, he was bringing with him a film with a social message calling for, literally, a revolution in . our mental hospitals which was portrayed so vividly in the nakedness and beatings and abandonment of these people in the State Hospitals in Massachusetts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201cWe see none of this, for example, in \u2018Odd Tastes.\u2019 There is every suggestion that drinking, dope, sex, murder is okay, just don\u2019t fall down on the knife and don\u2019t get caught.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">\u201c(The Court) Well, the police didn\u2019t even come on either murders, did they \u2014 or either homicides, I should say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">\u201c(The Witness) Yes, sir, that would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>taken time away from the next sexual theme, I guess.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The testimony of the other expert witnesses for the Board in regard to the issue last mentioned was accurately summarized by the Chancellor in his opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">\u201cMr. Reuben Kramer, a sculptor, and a graduate of the Maryland Institute, who had studied eleven years in this country and abroad art, drawing and sculpture, could find no artistic value in the film and although concededly not an expert in cinematography found no redeeming artistic value in the color film.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u201cDr. William R. Mueller, a graduate of Princeton University, who received his doctorate in literature at Harvard, and at present is a professor of English at Goucher College, who has been on the faculty of a number of colleges and who is an author as well as teacher, having published two books on the \u2018Theater of the Absurd: Testament of Samuel Beckett\u2019 as well as \u2018Ionesco and Genet: Playwrights of Silence,\u2019 found that there was no literary merit in the film \u2018ODD TASTES\u2019 that, indeed, it had \u2018no real theme\u2019 that it was a recount of the \u2018protagonist in search of maximum pleasure \u2014 a combination of sex and pain\u2019 and was merely a sequence of events with a common protagonist. He found that there was no characterization in the theme, that it was particularly \u2018humorless and unwitty\u2019 from the point of words of the script; he contrasted it with the films, \u2018A Man and a Woman\u2019 and \u2018The Graduate\u2019 and found, in his judgment, that the exclusive purpose of the film was to stimulate sexual desires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The Chancellor also summarized the testimony of the experts who testified for the appellant, Dr. Sol Gordon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>an associate professor of psychology and education at Yeshiva University and Albert D. Gerber, Esquire, a member of the Bar of Philadelphia and a writer who has specialized in the \u201cfield of pornography as affected by law,\u201d but concluded that he would accept the testimony of Dr. Vidaver and of Dr. Mueller, stating in his opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">\u201cThe Court concurs in and gives great weight to the testimony of Dr. Vidaver as well as that of Dr. Mueller; indeed, the testimony of Dr. Mueller seems to be uncontradicted or rebutted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">\u201cThe Court from the weight of the expert evidence is satisfied that to the average persons, applying contemporary community standards \u2014 regardless of whether such standards are the standards of a national community of interests, or of the community of Maryland \u2014 -the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">\u201cThe Court finds, in connection with this conclusion, that the dominant theme of the film, taken as a whole, appeal to a prurient interest in sex, that the material portrayed in the film is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters and that the material in the film is utterly without redeeming social value and that these three elements coalesce and that the Petitioner, Maryland State Board of Censors, has sustained the burden of proof imposed upon it in finding that the film is obscene in a constitutional sense and is in violation of Art. 66A, \u00a7 6b.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Our viewing of the film, \u201cOdd Tastes,\u201d itself, confirms the findings of the Chancellor in his well-considered and helpful opinion in this case. In our opinion the Chancellor correctly applied the applicable law to the facts found by him and we shall affirm the order of August 2,1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>In addition to the facts already set forth, in regard to pandering, there was evidence in the case which indicates to us that the principles announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Ginzburg v. United States, </em>383 U. S. 463, 86 S. Ct. 942, 16 L. Ed. 2d 31 (1966), and considered by us in <em>Sanza </em>are applicable in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The appellant, Hewitt, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">\u201cQ. Mr. Hewitt, at which theaters of Baltimore would the film \u2014 the motion picture, \u2018Odd Tastes,\u2019 be shown if it were approved? A. The Rex and Lord Baltimore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">\u201c(The Court) Excuse me \u2014 let me ask this\u2014 do these two theaters, the Rex and Lord Baltimore, specialize in showing what your counsel has classified as \u2018Sex-ploitation\u2019 films ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">\u201c(The Witness) Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">\u201c (The Court) And that is all that they show?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-11\">\u201c (The Witness) Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">Dr. Gordon, one of the expert witnesses for the appellant, left little doubt in regard to the titling and character of the film, \u201cOdd Tastes.\u201d He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-13\">\u201cQ. You can have it in your subconscious and drive a car and it won\u2019t come up from your subconscious? A. I think that some people have learned to cash in on what they discover to be a way that people need vicarious thrills and pleasures, and they are cashing in on that. I, myself, feel that \u2014 again, I know \u2014 I feel very strongly that if we had really good sex education, there would be virtually no interest in pornography. And I also feel very strong\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-15\">\u201cQ. We are getting off on the philosophy. A. Sorry \u2014 all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-16\">\u201cQ.

S. at 470, 86 S. Ct. at 947, 16 L. Ed. 2d at 38), has a direct bearing on the issues presented by the Roth-Alberts test as it may show an appeal to the prurient interest as well as the lack of any redeeming social value, inasmuch as where \u201cthe purveyor\u2019s sole emphasis is on the sexually provocative aspects\u201d a court could accept his evaluation and such factors \u201cmay be decisive in the determination of obscenity.\u201d <em>(Ginzburg, supra, </em>383 U. S. at 470, 86 S. Ct. at 947, 16 L. Ed. 2d at 38) As Judge Oppenheimer, for the Court, stated in Sanza:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">\u201cWe do not deem it necessary to decide whether the methods of advertising the showing of the films in the arcade and the location of the booths within the area of \u2018the Block\u2019 constitute \u2018pandering\u2019 under the <em>Ginzburg </em>doctrine. However, in determining whether the films are obscene we do consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the method in which the films are shown \u2014 the viewing in a booth by a single spectator, in the position of a peeping Tom, who feeds his coins into the machine presumably in the hope that he will be even more titillated by what will come than by what has gone before. We believe that the manner of the particular presentation is relevant to a consideration of whether the film is an appeal to prurient interest, not only under <em>Ginzburg, </em>but under the <em>Roth-Alberts </em>test before <em>Ginzburg </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>was decided.\u201d (245 Md. at 334, 226 A. 2d at 325)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The appellant earnestly argued that the <em>Roth-Alberts </em>test is no longer a viable one in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Redrup v. Neto York, </em>386 U. S. 767, 87 S. Ct. 1414, 18 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1967), and several cases in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, District Courts and a State court interpreting the decision in <em>Redrup. </em>These cases are <em>Luros v. United States, </em>389 F. 2d 200, 205 (8th Cir. 1968) ; <em>Culbertson v. California, </em>385 F. 2d 209, 210 (9th Cir. 1967) ; <em>United States v. 4400 Copies of Magazines, </em>276 F. Supp. 902 (D. Md. 1967) ; and <em>State v. J. L. Marshall News Co., </em>13 Ohio Misc. 60, 232 N. E. 2d 430 (1967), which appear to equate the holding in <em>Redrup </em>as permitting the State, except in the case of laws dealing specifically with juveniles, to proscribe material only if it is hard core pornography or if there has been \u201cpandering\u201d as set out in <em>Ginzburg, supra. </em>But see, <em>contra, United States v. Four Books, </em>289 F. Supp. 972 (C. D. Cal. 1968), in which the <em>Roth-Alberts </em>\u2014 Memoirs test was applied; <em>In re Giannini, </em>72 Cal. Rep. 655, 662, 446 P. 2d 535, 542 (1968) ; and <em>Landau v. Fording, </em>245 Cal. App. 2d 820, 54 Cal. Rep. 177, <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>388 U. S. 456, 87 S. Ct. 2109, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1317 (1967), this affirmance by the Supreme Court taking place after its decision in <em>Redrup. </em>See also Krislov, <em>From Ginzburg to Ginsberg, </em>1968 Supreme Court Review, 153, 191-92. More importantly, the Supreme Court, itself, has recently indicated in <em>Stanley v. Georgia, </em>394 U. S. 557, 89 S. Ct. 1243, 22 L. Ed. 2d 542, that <em>Roth </em>and the following cases \u2014\u25a0 including <em>Ginzburg </em>\u2014 are still presently the applicable test. In <em>Stanley, </em>the Supreme Court in an opinion written for the majority by Mr. Justice Marshall, in which Black, J. concurred and Stewart, Brennan and White, JJ. concurred in the result (this later concurrence being on the point that the search and seizure in the case was invalid and the film was improperly admitted into evidence against the accused in any event) held that a Georgia statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>prohibiting possession of an obscene film by a private citizen in his own home was void under the provisions of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. Mr. Justice Marshall, however, stated, for the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\"><em>\u201cRoth </em>and the cases following that decision are not impaired by today\u2019s holding. As we have said, the States retain broad power to regulate obscenity; that power simply does not extend to mere possession by the individual in the privacy of his own home. (394 U. S. at 568, 89 S. Ct. at 1249-50, 22 L. Ed. at 551)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>as contended by the appellant, that <em>Redrup </em>did require a finding that the State statute, not dealing specifically with juveniles, could only proscribe material which is hard core pornography (which we do not believe is the case), nevertheless in the present case we are of the opinion that the film, \u201cOdd Tastes,\u201d is indeed hard core- pornography and, as such, could be proscribed by the Maryland statute on this theory also.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">In our opinion, the most apt definition of \u201chard core pornography\u201d we have seen is that given by Judge Fuld of the Court of Appeals of New York in <em>People v. Richmond County News, Inc., </em>9 N. Y. 2d 578, 216 N. Y. S. 2d 369, 175 N. E. 2d 681 (1961), cited with approval by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Levin v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 139, 145, 228 A. 2d 487, 489 (1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U. S. 1048, 88 S. Ct. 767, 19 L. Ed. 2d 840 (1968) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">\u201cIt [hard core pornography] focuses predominantly upon what is sexually morbid, grossly perverse and bizarre, without any artistic or scientific purpose or justification. Recognizable \u2018by the insult it offers, invariably, to sex, and to the human spirit\u2019 * * *, it is to be differentiated from the bawdy and the ribald. Depicting dirt for dirt\u2019s sake, the obscene is the vile, rather than the coarse, the blow to sense, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>merely to sensibility. It smacks, at times, of fantasy and unreality, of sexual perversion and sickness and represents, * * * <em>\u2018a </em>debauchery of the sexual faculty\u2019.\u201d (9 N. Y. 2d at 587, 216 N. Y. S. 2d at 376, 175 N. E. 2d at 686)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">It is clear to us that the film, \u201cOdd Tastes,\u201d confined as it is largely to depicting sado-masochism, fits well within this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">In any event, it is clear to us that <em>Redrup </em>continues the principles enunciated in <em>Ginzburg </em>in regard to pandering and, as we have indicated, the evidence in the present case makes those principles applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">\n<em>Order affirmed,, the costs to be paid by the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
