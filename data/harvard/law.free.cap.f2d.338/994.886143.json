The employer defended upon the ground that \u00a7 51 of the Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prohibits such a contractual undertaking, and that the contract is also void because of impossibility of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-22\">The District Court entered judgment for the plaintiffs, which we affirm for the reasons stated by the District Judge. See, also, Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7\u00a7 97.61, 97.63, 97.65, 87.73. It seems plainly permissible under Maryland law for an employer to undertake contractually to supplement workmen\u2019s compensation benefits prescribed by the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since, under the contract, the parties have accepted Maryland administration and Maryland interpretation of her workmen\u2019s compensation acts and their application, the contract having only the effect of requiring supplemental payments to bring the Maryland scale up to that of the District of Columbia when the Maryland scale is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>less, there is no impossibility of performance. The contract was a valid, enforceable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Since the judgment was entered in the District Court, one of the plaintiffs has died. His death will require a recomputation of the contractual benefits due his statutory beneficiaries and some modification of the judgment order. For that purpose and for the entry of such other orders as may be appropriate, the judgment will be affirmed but remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Affirmed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1066-15\">.
