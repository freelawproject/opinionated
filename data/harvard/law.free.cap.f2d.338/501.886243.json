Under these circumstances the documents were admissible without proof that they had been made by the business from whose records they wei*e obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-21\"> If it was error for the trial court to admit opinion testimony to the effect that the automobiles were new rather than used, this would not be prejudicial error because of the much clearer indication of the new status by reason of their being designated as such on the face of documents that bore the signature of the appellant. Moreover,, on cross examination by appellant\u2019s counsel, the customs official was permitted to answer that they were considered! as new for tariff purposes. This fact having been brought out by the appellant, can not now be objected to as being irrelevant to the issue of new versus, used.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">In light of the testimony of the' president of appellant, the jury was-permitted to believe that he not only knew of the statutory requirements, if \u2022 that be necessary, but that he wilfully violated the statute by his admitted failure to affix the required statement at the-port of entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">The judgment of the trial court is; affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
