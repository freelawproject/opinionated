The basic agreement between the dealer and the bank, under which the dealer\u2019s sales were financed, was ambiguous as to the ownership of repossessed vehicles in the possession of the dealer. The basic agreement was susceptible of the construction that there was a conditional sale to the dealer of each repossessed vehicle delivered to it by the bank, as contended by the bank\u2019s insurer. It was also susceptible to the construction that there was a consignment for sale of such vehicles, the contention of the dealer\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-25\">To solve the problem, the District Court appropriately looked to the course of dealing between the parties. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>found there clear evidence supporting his finding that there had been a conditional sale of the particular vehicle and others similarly handled. The finding, not clearly erroneous, is binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">Justification of the finding and the legal conclusions flowing from it clearly appear in the District Court\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We affirm for the reasons stated there.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b773-34\"> Royal Indemnity Company v.
