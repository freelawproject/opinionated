His original contract had run for ten years. Effective as of August 8, 1957, a second contract to expire August 7, 1967, was entered into between the appellee and the Navajo Tribe and was approved by the Secretary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>of the Interior.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In November, 1963 the Secretary purported to suspend personal performance by the appellee under the 1957 contract and gave notice that the \u201ccontract will be terminated as of December 1, 1963\u201d unless the appellee \u201ccan adduce convincing evidence\u201d that the Secretary\u2019s conclusions as to suspension and termination \u201care unwarranted.\u201d At the same time, the Secretary purported to withdraw and rescind his approval of the contract and of at least eleven various amendments, previously agreed to by the Navajo Tribal Council and then approved by the Secretary. The appellee thereupon instituted suit to enjoin the Secretary from taking the proposed action. The District Court entered its order restraining the Secretary and his subordinates from terminating the appellee\u2019s contract with the Navajo Tribe, from suspending its operations or from withholding<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> payments due thereunder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Secretary has brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The Secretary argues that \u201cThe issue here is the power of the Secretary to act under any circumstances.\u201d He contends that he has general and \u201ccomplete power to supervise and regulate all Indian-White relationships except as expressly limited by Congress.\u201d Pointing to the fact that he had already approved the 1957 contract and eleven subsequent amendments, he argues that no \u201creason appears why that supervision can be exercised only by disapproval of suggested amendments and not by withdrawal of approval earlier given when circumstances require it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In opposition to the appellee\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction the Secretary filed the affidavit of one Raymond Nakai from which it appears that Tribal political activities were in some measure involved. Nakai as chairman of the Navajo Tribal Council averred as of November 26, 1963 that in a recent election the activity of the Tribal attorneys had been a major issue because \u201cNorman M. Littell exercised an ever-increasing influence over the affairs of the Navajo Tribe and deeply involved himself in most of the basic decisions made by the Tribe.\u201d He appended to his affidavit a telegram sent to him by Littell who stated that \u201cThe general counsel and legal staff are not your personal attorneys to do your bidding, right or wrong. We serve the Tribe in discharge of duties described in the attorney contract and in the Tribal Code.\u201d From countercharges and recriminations appearing in the exhibits it seems clear enough that Littell suspected Nakai of having instituted a cabal which the general counsel deemed detrimental to the best interests of the Tribe. Other material of record suggests that certain individuals, including Nakai and perhaps attorneys of his choosing, had their own reasons for seeking to oust the appellee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">The Secretary on brief states that \u201cThe matter came to a head on November 1, 1963\u201d when the Secretary informed the appellee of the suspension of his personal performance under the attorney contract and of the intended termination of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">The appellee has challenged the Secretary\u2019s assertion of power. He points to the status of the Tribe as a self-governing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u00abentity, as recognized by the Secretary \u2018.himself who tells us on brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">\u201cThe Tribe governs itself without regard to the laws of the states where the reservation is situated. Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217 (1959). This is accomplished under a Tribal Code which has been approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Cf. Oliver v. Udall, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 212, 306 F.2d 819 (1962), cert. den., 372 U.S. 908.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Appellee\u2019s complaint in the District 'Court had alleged that the Tribal Council \u201cis the governing body of the Navajo Tribe and consists of 74 delegates.\u201d Appellee\u2019s affidavit in support of his motion for preliminary injunction set forth a \u25a0detailed account of various relationships, whether by contract and amendments thereto, resolutions of the Navajo Tribal Council pertaining to the same or correspondence and memoranda pertinent to the merits of the controversy. Among the exhibits is the text of the 1957 agreement, identified as \u201cAttorney Contract.\u201d It is clear from the document that the attorneys were to \u201cperform the duties required of them under this contract upon the request and at the direction of the Chairman of the Navajo Tribal Council, subject to such instructions as he may receive from time to time from the Advisory Committee or the Tribal Council.\u201d The general counsel was bound to \u201creport to the Tribal Council at any regular or special meeting on any matters pertaining to the legal affairs of the Tribe when in his opinion or that of the Chairman, the Advisory Committee, or the Tribal Council, the best interests of the Tribe so require.\u201d The contract recited that it was executed pursuant \u201cto the authority of the Navajo Tribal Council and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,\u201d to be deemed in full force and effect upon approval by the Commissioner, as of August 8,1957. The contract provided for \u201cGeneral Counsel Services\u201d for the \u201csaid Tribe of Indians,\u201d but it also provided for \u201cClaims Services\u201d in \u201cinvestigating, formulating and prosecuting claims of the said Indians against the United States * * *\u201d specifically designating the appellee as \u201cClaims Attorney for the Tribe.\u201d Certain separate and distinct claims against the United States were listed as then pending before the Indian Claims Commission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Approved in behalf of the Secretary pursuant to \u201cSecretarial Order No. 2508, as amended (17 Fed.Reg. 1570, pursuant to Section 2103 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (25 USC 81),\u201d the contract pertinently contained a termination clause which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\">\u201c12. <em>Termination: </em>(a) The Tribal Council may terminate this contract <em>for good cause shown </em>in respect to any one or all of second parties\u2019 services as General Counsel after giving sixty days\u2019 notice to any of second parties in respect to which termination is sought, <em>the said termination to become effective upon approval </em>of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Provided, However, that in the event of <em>disagreement between the parties as to the sufficiency of the cause, the question shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Interior. </em>In such event, the parties of the second part or any one of them so terminated, shall receive compensation on the basis of the annual retainer provided for in Paragraph 4, above, prorated to the date of termination, together with such sums as may be properly due for expenses incurred prior to the date of termination; Provided, Further that if the services of Norman M. Littell or C. J. Alexander as General Counsel are so terminated by request of first party, the said Littell and Alexander and their assigns, if any, shall have the option to terminate the contract in its entirety, subject, however, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>the provisions of Paragraph (b) hereof.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">The District Court specifically found:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">\u201c5. The Navajo Tribal Council has neither terminated nor suspended its contract with the plaintiff, nor has it authorized or directed or requested the defendant or any other individual or group to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">\u201c6. The power to select attorneys to represent the Navajo Tribe is vested in the Navajo Tribal Council by 2 N.T.C. \u00a7 1173(c), and neither Chairman<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of that Council nor its Advisory Committee <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> have any such power. 2 N.T.C. \u00a7\u00a7 284, 341-344.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Finding 7 discloses that in June 1963, Raymond Nakai, then Chairman of the Council, requested the Secretary to terminate the appellee\u2019s employment as general counsel and claims attorney. In Finding 8 the judge noted that Nakai desired to substitute other attorneys for the appellee.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is no provision in the contract and none in the several amendments which in terms may be read as authorizing later termination by the Secretary once his approval shall have been gi*anted pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The Secretary thus must argue in effect, that as of November 1, 1963 he, regardless of the fact that the Tribal Council had not acted, was free to initiate against the appellee whatever \u201ccharges\u201d he might decide to assert. Then on the basis of such charges, he next had authority to suspend the appellee\u2019s \u201cpersonal performance under the Attorney Contract\u201d and to announce its termination as of December 1, 1963, unless \u201cin the interim, you can adduce <em>convincing </em>[to the Secretary\u2019s satisfaction] evidence that the [Secretary\u2019s] <em>conclusions justifying </em>[according to him] suspension and termination are unwarranted.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-15\">The Secretary can point to no statute applicable here which confers upon him any such authority. In October, 1963 the Department\u2019s solicitor by memorandum to the Secretary had advised him that the \u201cNavajo Tribal Code, title 2, section 1173 (c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-16\">\u201c \u2018No person shall be engaged to render services which are subject to the requirements of section 2103 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (25 U.S.C. 81) without the prior individual approval of the Navajo Tribal Council.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-17\">The solicitor then commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-18\">\u201cThus it is clear that authority to act effectively for the Navajo Tribe with respect to the employment of an attorney under 25 U.S.C. 81 is lodged in the Navajo Tribal Council. The <em>Advisory Committee </em>of the tribal council <em>has no authority to speak effectively for the tribe in such matters.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A41\">The solicitor further discussed a resolution of the Advisory Committee which had charged the appellee \u201cwith diverting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the services of attorneys employed for general counsel services to assist in the handling of claims work without authority to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">While the general counsel services were rendered upon an annual salary basis, compensation for claims work depended upon a contingent percentage plan related in part to \u201cthe value of the property recovered, saved, or obtained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The solicitor\u2019s memorandum discussed, <em>inter alia, </em>a case entitled Healing v. Jones.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Whether that action should have been classified as a \u201cclaims\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> case or considered part of the general counsel\u2019s normal service seems to have been in question.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The solicitor\u2019s memorandum of advice discussed other details not immediately pertinent. Clearly pointed out, however, was a remedy available <em>\u201cto the Tribe\u201d </em>under the termination clause, <em>supra. </em>If that clause be invoked by the Tribe \u201cyou would be fully justified in approving <em>the action of the Tribal Council,\u201d </em>the solicitor stated. He added that indeed, the Secretary \u201cif unauthorized payments are discovered\u201d would be fully justified in initiating the cancellation procedure by <em>recommending Tribal Council action, </em>if you desire to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">In Oliver v. Udall<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the Secretary successfully contended before us that a challenged resolution of the Tribal Council reflected the \u201cinherent sovereign power of the Tribe.\u201d His later approval of the resolution did not result in an exercise of federal power. To demonstrate the Tribe\u2019s power to enter into a contract, he argued on brief that \u201cthe Tribe can lease its own property subject to the approval of the Secretary. That does not mean the power to lease Tribal property is in the Secretary. The power of disposition, or the adoption of Tribal law and order resolutions is in the Tribe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>We are persuaded that the solicitor herein correctly recognized that the Tribe was the appellee\u2019s client, just as he properly advised the Secretary that \u201cThe governing body of the Tribe is the Tribal Council.\u201d The Tribe through that Council had validly engaged the appellee as its attorney under a contract which only the Tribal Council might terminate agreeably to the provisions of that instrument, <em>swpra, </em>page 5. We have been shown no basis upon which the Secretary rather than the Tribal Council might declare the contract at an end. We have discovered no source of power \u2014 and none has been cited to us \u2014 which vests in the Secretary a predicate for rescission by him of his previous approval granted pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 81 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">We voice no opinion on the merits. We say only that the issuance of the preliminary injunction in this unique situation was a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We find no abuse on this record. We may note that the District Court clearly contemplated that the Secretary simply lacked authority to terminate the Attorney Contract in the manner attempted and to rescind his earlier approval of the contract and the amendments thereto. The injunction is surely temporary in terms, and in effect is operative only \u201cuntil the further order of [the District Court] and pending final hearing of this cause.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We need not spell out additional details covered by the District Court\u2019s order, designed in part, at least, to preserve the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction. Since a full trial is available, we refrain from comment on the possible applicability of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 82 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\">.

The appellee points to record material tending to show that when the appellee was first employed in 1947, the Navajos were one of the most poverty-stricken tribes in the country. Today they are probably the wealthiest. The Secretary on brief, with record references, informs the court that the Tribe has extensive resources \u201cincluding $80,000,000 on deposit in the United States Treasury, and has a monthly income from mineral leases of some $800,000 to $1,000,000.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b611-11\">.

Order, December 6, 1882). The Navajo and the Hopi Tribes were authorized to commence or defend an action against each other for the purpose of determining their respective rights and interests in those lands. See H.R.Rep. No. 1942, 85th Cong., 2d Sess.; 104 Cong.Rec. 13196, July 9, 1958. Healing v. Jones, <em>infra </em>note 12, followed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b613-11\">. The Department of Justice challenged the jurisdiction of the court to hear the case and otherwise sought to protect the Government against the \u201cclaims\u201d of the contending parties. Jones for the Navajo Tribe successfully opposed the position of the Government. Healing v. Jones, 174 F.Supp. 211 (D.Ariz.1959). After extensive pretrial proceedings, the case was disposed of by a special three-judge court. The exhaustive opinion of Circuit Judge Hamley occupies some sixty-seven pages of the printed reports as he traced the history of the problems presented and explored the contentions of the respective tribes with regard to the \u201c1882 Reservation.\u201d The interest of Congressman, later Secretary, Udall was noted by Judge Hamley, 210 F.Supp. at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-17\">It is reasonable to deduce that preparation and presentation of the case by respective counsel must have entailed great skill and professional attainments of a high order. Substantial advantages were gained by the Navajo Tribe. Healing v. Jones, 210 F.Supp. 125 (D.Ariz. 1962). The Supreme Court affirmed, 373 U.S. 758, 83 S.Ct. 1559, 10 L.Ed.2d 703 (1963).
