UNITED STATES of America, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b410-5\">No. 17882.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b410-6\">United States Court of Appeals Eighth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b410-7\">Nov. 24, 1964.</decisiondate>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b410-8\">Reheraing Denied Jan. 7, 1965.</otherdate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b410-13\">Before JOHNSEN, Chief Judge, and MATTHES, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b410-14\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">In order not to leave open appellant\u2019s attack upon his conviction, the appeal pending from his filing of notice of appeal to the denial of his <em>motion </em>under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 to vacate sentence will be permitted to be docketed without payment of fee, and the appeal will thereupon be dismissed as not involving any substantial question for review and so legally being frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-16\">The history of appellant\u2019s conviction and of his attacks thereon is set out in Roe v. United States, 307 F.2d 508 (C.A. 8, 1962) and Roe v. United States, 325 F.2d 556 (C.A. 8, 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-17\">In the latter case, we reversed the District Court\u2019s denial without a hearing of appellant\u2019s second motion under \u00a7 2255 and remanded the matter \u201cwith directions to appoint counsel for appellant and to hold a hearing on appellant\u2019s mental competency at the time he entered his plea on April 28, 1961.\u201d 325 F.2d at 558-559.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-19\">This appeal is from the determination thereafter made by the District Court that appellant was at the time of his conviction and sentencing mentally competent and able to understand the proceedings against him and to assist in his own defense. That determination was arrived at after a full hearing in which appellant was both present and represented by counsel and \u201cwas given full opportunity to present any and all evidence concerning his mental capacity at the time he entered his plea\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-20\">The Court\u2019s Memorandum and Order summarizes the evidence which was before it on the hearing and clearly demonstrates that it was entitled to make the determination which it did. In addition to its appraisal of the expert testimony, the Memorandum and Order points out that \u201cFurthermore, this Court has had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the petitioner at two separate hearings\u201d, and that \u201cAt no time has petitioner shown any overt symptoms of mental illness, but on the contrary appeared oriented as to time and place, aware of the nature of the proceedings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>and able to assist his counsel in presenting his claims\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">On the situation thus existing, it seems obvious that the attempt to challenge the trial court\u2019s determination does not present any substanial question for review and could only have a futile result.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
