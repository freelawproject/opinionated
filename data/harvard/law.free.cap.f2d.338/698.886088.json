Indeed, all of the appellant\u2019s contentions but one are too insubstantial to warrant discussion. The one possible exception is the appellant\u2019s contention that it has been deprived of due process of law for the reason that its records were lost or destroyed during the approximately six-year interval between the time the contract provisions were changed at its request and the time suit was brought with the result that it is now unable to establish its assertion that the contract change actually resulted in no saving to it whatever. This contention, in spite of verbal embellishments couched in terms of deprivation of a constitutional right, is really nothing more than an assertion of laches as a matter of law. It is well settled, however, that the United States is not subject to the defense of laches in enforcing its rights. United States v. Summerlin, 310 U.S. 414, 416, 60 S.Ct. 1019, 84 L.Ed. 1283 (1940), and cases cited. The opinion of the District Court needs no elaboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
