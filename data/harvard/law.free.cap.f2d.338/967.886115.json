They assert that the prohibition should be limited to sale of merchandise or deals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which <em>are </em>to be used in lottery schemes and not extended to those which <em>may </em>be so used without their control or knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-8\">The order is not overbroad, however, when read in the light of language used in the Commission\u2019s opinion pursuant to which the order was issued. There the following enforcement policy was announced :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-9\">\u201cMounting merchandise on a board for display purposes is a neutral device which may be useful in many sales situations not involving the sale or distribution of the goods so mounted by a game of chance or lottery device. In those instances, where the deals on their face indicate no other purpose than display, these devices will not, without more, be construed as coming within the terms of the order's prohibition. Where a deal has obvious utility for legal uses, we will not hold such a device as inherently designed or intended for the prohibited use, although it could be employed for illegal purposes. In this connection, we note that deals as such are not basic to the illegal practices which the Commission has challenged in this proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-11\">\u201cOn the other hand, if the design of the board indicates by the legend affixed thereto, or in some other manner, that it has been arranged to facilitate the merchandising of products by way of gambling schemes or lottery devices, or if a deal is sold in conjunction with punchboards or other devices with inherent appeal to the public\u2019s gambling instinct, then the Commission may well determine, depending on other relevant facts, that the sale of deals under such circumstances is within the scope of the order\u2019s prohibition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1040-20\">. A \u201cdeal\u201d is a trade term for merchandise mounted and numbered by the distributor on a large board for use with punchboards having more than one winning number,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
