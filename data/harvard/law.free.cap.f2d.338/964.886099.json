A vehicle operated by appellee Fihelly at approximately 55 miles per hour in the extreme right hand lane of the three lane south bound portion of the Turnpike collided with a vehicle operated by appellant in a lane or between lanes to the left and front of Fihelly\u2019s vehicle when appellant\u2019s car veered to the right as Fihelly\u2019s vehicle was about to overtake it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-24\">On conflicting evidence, the district judge found appellant negligent and appellant\u2019s negligence a proximate cause of the accident. The district judge did not make a definite ruling upon the question of Fihelly\u2019s negligence raised by appellant\u2019s defense of contributory negligence because that question involved a construction of state law on which the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia had not spoken; but, again on conflicting evidence, the district judge found that the asserted negligence on the part of Fihelly was not an efficiently contributing cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-25\">We have examined the evidence relevant to the issue of whether any negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>gence on the part of Fihelly caused or contributed to the happening of the accident and we cannot say that the finding of the district judge was clearly erroneous, Rule 52, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; Johnson, Administratrix v. United States, 336 F.2d 801 (4 Cir. 1964); United States v. Still, 120 F.2d 876 (4 Cir. 1941), cert. den., 314 U.S. 671, 62 S.Ct. 135, 86 L.Ed. 537 (1941). Therefore, the judgment of the lower court is</p>\n<p id=\"Af_\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
