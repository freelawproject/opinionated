Respondents contend that the first of these prohibitory clauses is inapplicable to section 1 of article 5 for two reasons. First, they assert that the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u201cany person\u201d in this provision of their contract refers to individual truckers who have no employees, and argue that an agreement to refrain from doing business with such individuals is not an agreement to refrain from dealing in the products \u201cof any other <em>employer.\u201d </em>Second, they assert that the milk products involved are those of the respondent employer, and argue that there is thus no agreement to refuse to handle the products \u201cof any <em>other </em>employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">As to respondents\u2019 first contention, the record before the Board contained uncontradicted testimony that at least six to eight independent distributors doing business within the area affected by the collective bargaining agreement were in fact employers. The Board could properly conclude that the unqualified language of section 1 of article 5 applied to these distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">As to respondents\u2019 second contention, we think the rationale of National Labor Relations Board v. Servette, Inc., 377 U.S. 46, 84 S.Ct. 1098, 12 L.Ed. 2d 121 (1964), requires that the term \u201cproducts of any other employer\u201d in section 8(e) be read to include services furnished by an employer performing a distribution function.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This conclusion is implicit in National Labor Relations Board v. Milk Wagon Drivers\u2019 Union Local 753, 335 F.2d 326 (7th Cir. 1964). See also Bakery Wagon Drivers and Salesmen Local Union No. 484 v. National Labor Relations Board, 116 U.S.App. D.C. 87, 321 F.2d 353 (D.C.Cir. 1963); Highway Truck Drivers &amp; Helpers Local 107 etc. v. National Labor Relations Board, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 312, 302 F.2d 897 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">As the Supreme Court pointed out in Servette, \u201ca primary target of the 1959 amendments was the secondary boycotts conducted by the Teamsters Union, which ordinarily represents employees not of manufacturers, but of motor carriers.\u201d 377 U.S. at 55, 84 S.Ct. at 1104. Section 8(e) would fall short of achieving its purpose if the Teamsters Union and a trucking company could agree with impunity that the latter would not interchange traffic with a non-union trucking company, on the theory that the latter\u2019s transportation service was not a \u201cproduct.\u201d Both Congressman Landrum and Congressman Griffin pointed to this type of agreement as illustrative of the wrong which Congress sought to remedy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">As noted in Servette, such terms as \u201cproduced\u201d and \u201cproduction\u201d are commonly used in legislation to apply to the distribution of goods. 377 U.S. at 55-56, 84 S.Ct. 1098. The legislative history of section 8(e) is replete with references indicating that Congress meant to include all forms of economically productive effort within the term \u201cproduct.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the language of the second clause of section 8(e) plainly includes services, and there is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that Congress intended the application of the two clauses to differ in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">2. Even if the first clause of section 8(e) were inapplicable, section 1 of article 5 of respondents\u2019 contract would fall within the language of the second prohibitory clause. Respondents\u2019 contention to the contrary is premised upon the fact that the second clause of section 8(e) applies only to agreements \u201cto cease\u201d doing business, whereas sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>'tion 1 of article 5 is an agreement \u201cto refrain\u201d from doing business. Respondents offered evidence that the parties intended this contract provision to apply \u2022only to future arrangements, and that no respondent-employer had been required to terminate existing arrangements with distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Some commentators have accepted the \u2022distinction which respondents draw,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but most have rejected it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are satisfied that the latter position is correct. The legislative history offers compelling evi\u2022dence that Congress intended no difference in meaning in its use of \u201ccease\u201d and \u201ccease and refrain\u201d in the two prohibitory clauses of section 8(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Section 8(e) originated in a floor proposal, offered by Senator Gore, prohibiting agreements by unions and common \u2022carriers by which the latter agreed to \u201ccease or refrain from handling or transporting any of the products of any other \u2022employer.\u201d Senator McClellan expressed \u2022concern that this language might be cir\u25a0cumvented by an agreement to refuse to \u25a0do business with another employer. Such an agreement would effectively stop the transportation of that employer\u2019s \u25a0products, but would not fall literally within the description of an agreement to stop \u201chandling or transporting\u201d those products. To meet this problem, Senator Mc\u25a0Clellan suggested the addition of the language, or to cease doing business. The amendment was accepted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the second prohibitory clause of section 8(e) was added for the sole purpose of avoiding a possible subject-matter limitation upon the agreements prohibited. Nothing in the legislative materials suggests that either House intended to limit the reach of this broadened, \u201ccatch-all\u201d clause to agreements affecting existing business relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">\u201cCease\u201d and \u201crefrain\u201d are commonly treated as synonymous,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and were so used throughout the legislative proceedings. When Senator McClellan suggested the addition of the second clause, Senator Gore twice restated the section as it would read after amendment, and each time used \u201ccease\u201d <em>and </em>\u201crefrain\u201d in both clauses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The word \u201crefrain\u201d was omitted from the second clause in the final printing of the Senate bill. This version was copied in later bills without comment on the omission, and, it may be fairly assumed, with no intention that the omission be accorded greater significance in the application of section 8(e) by the courts than it was accorded during the consideration of the section by Congress<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">We conclude that section 1 of article 5 falls within the language of section 8(e) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Respondents\u2019 legislative-purpose argument runs as follows: Section 8(e) was intended to reach only agreements of the \u201chot cargo\u201d variety, which bind a neutral employer to boycott another employer with whom the union has its real dispute. Such agreements are banned because they bring unfair pressure upon the employer having a dispute with the union, involve neutral employers and employees in labor disputes not their own, and spread labor disputes from their primary situs. Section 1 of article 5 is not such an agreement, but rather prohibits subcontracting of bargaining unit work to outside employers to protect the job opportunities of the employees of the signatory employers. Since its purpose is to provide job protection, and not to bring pressure to bear upon other employers to affect their labor policies, the contract provision is primary in nature and does not fall within section 8(e)\u2019s ban on secondary boycotts.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">We agree that section 8(e) is not to be applied literally to prohibit all union-employer agreements limiting subcontracting. More particularly, an agreement which restricts subcontracting to protect the job opportunities of the employees of a signatory employer, and not to apply secondary pressure upon third-party employers, may be beyond the purpose of section 8(e) and excepted from its proscription.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">But section 1 of article 5 of respondents\u2019 contract does not fall within this exception. Subcontracting is permitted if the third party has signed a union contract, prohibited if he has not, Whether the pressure of a boycott by a signatory employer will be applied to a. third party depends entirely upon the latter\u2019s relationship with the union. The-thrust of this boycott agreement is secondary, and the provision is therefore contrary to the purpose as well as the letter of section 8(e). Meat and Highway Drivers Local Union No. 710 v. National Labor Relations Board, 335 F.2d 709, 717 (D.C.Cir. 1964); Truck Drivers Union. Local No. 413 etc. v. National Labor Relations Board, 334 F.2d 539, 548 (D.C. Cir. 1964); Dist. No. 9, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists etc. v. National Labor Relations Board, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 287, 315 F.2d 33, 36-37 (1962); Comment, 62 Mich.L.Rev. 1176, 1193 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Respondents seem to argue that section-1 of article 5 falls within the exception to-section 8(e) because it preserves the job-opportunities of employees within themulti-employer bargaining unit by prohibiting subcontracting to any employer-outside that unit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But if this argument were accepted, the exception to section-8(e) would permit precisely what the-section itself was intended to prohibit:an agreement by an employer to boycott, another unless the latter entered into a. union contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">Since section 8(e) forbids the agreement itself \u201cwhether activated or in suspense\u201d (Employing Lithographers of Greater Miami, Fla. v. National Labor Relations Board, 301 F.2d 20, 30 (5th Cir. 1962); see also Truck Drivers Union Local No. 413 etc. v. National Labor Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>lations Board, 334 F.2d 539, 542 (D.C. Cir. 1964)), it would make no difference if there were no existing non-signatory concerns which might be affected by the boycott agreement. Here, however, the record disclosed that there were,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and that it was the union\u2019s intention to require them to sign the contract.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Since respondent employer-producers control most of the dairy products distributed in the area affected by the contract,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> their agreement not to do business with independent contractors who did not adhere to the collective bargaining agreement would make resistance to union demands by the latter a practical impossibility. Section 1 of article 5 thus involves signatory employer-producers directly and decisively in the union\u2019s dispute with existing non-signatory distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Section 2 of article 5 of the collective bargaining agreement is a particular\u00edzation of the general prohibition of section 1 with respect to the transfer of existing distribution routes. The employer agrees that he will not subcontract existing distribution \u201cwithout the prior consent of the Union unless after such transfer, the work or services transferred will be performed by an employer who is, or prior to such transfer agrees to become, a signatory to this agreement.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">The difference between this provision and section 1 is that subcontracting to non-signatories is conditioned upon union consent rather than being barred absolutely. Limitation of the consent requirement to transfers to non-signatories gives the agreement a secondary character.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Respondents point to the fact that the General Counsel did not challenge the first sentence of section 2. They assert that this provision is indistinguishable in principle from the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>sentence (as well as from other challenged provisions), and argue that for this reason the attack upon the second sentence must fail. We need not stop to consider the differences between the two provisions, the soundness of the General Counsel\u2019s justification for challenging one but not the other, or whether the Board might have considered the lawfulness of the provision not attacked by the General Counsel. Cf. Frito Co., Western Division v. National Labor Relations Board, 330 F.2d 458 (9th Cir. 1964). It is the function of the Board and the court to determine the legality of the provisions that are in issue, and the General Counsel\u2019s decision not to challenge other provisions is irrelevant to that problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Respondents suggest that the second clause of section 8(e) of the Act is inapplicable to section 2 of article 5 because the latter applies only to transfers between employers, and the \u201cany other persons\u201d language in the second clause of section 8(e) excludes employers. We think the context clearly indicates that the referent of \u201cother\u201d in the second clause of section 8(e) is not the primary employer of clause 1, but rather the contracting employer. This is necessarily so in the first clause. Moreover, in its amendments of section 8(b) (4) (B), Congress indicated its understanding that \u201cperson\u201d is to be read broadly to include employers.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">Section 3 of article 5 of the agreement particularizes section 1 with respect to the subcontracting of new or additional distribution by respondent employers.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">Subsection (a) permits the subcontracting of new distribution when it will be performed by an employee of a signatory employer, and is invalid on its face for reasons we have discussed. Subsection (c), in itself, may also impose unlawful secondary pressures upon non-signatory distributors. But, in any event, section 3 as a whole is to be read in the light of section 1 of article 5 and the intention of the parties.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As we have said, section 3 is a particularization of the unlawful general agreement in section 1, rendering it more specific and creating limited exceptions to it. Whether or not exceptions (b) and (c) would violate section 8(e) as independent agreements, we need not decide. They are integral, dependent parts of the unlawful agreement and must fall with it.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">Section 4 of article 5 provides that hauling from a processing plant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>a depot, federal government installation, or another processing plant, when not performed by employees subject to respondents\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, must be performed by persons operating under a collective bargaining agreement with a local of the Teamsters Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Since section 4 conditions subcontracting upon the union\u2019s relationship with the subcontractor rather than upon economic conditions in the bargaining unit, it is primarily in aid of the union\u2019s organizing efforts outside the bargaining unit, and is prohibited by section 8(e).

The legislative history of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (B) offers further evidence that \u201ccease\u201d and \u201crefrain\u201d in the two clauses of \u00a7 8(e) are to be treated as synonymous: The first clause applies to agreements to boycott an. \u201cemployer,\u201d which, under the definition of that term in \u00a7 2 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, excludes railroads, political subdivisions, non-profit hospitals, and agricultural operations, among others. However, the second clause applies broadly to any \u201cperson,\u201d which would include the employers excluded from the narrow statutory definitions. Prior to 1959, \u00a7 8(b) (4) (B) used only the term \u201cemployer.\u201d The loophole which the narrow definition of this term created was corrected in the 1959 amendments. However, unless the two clauses of \u00a7 8(e) are given equal scope, the \u201cemployer\u201d loophole which Congress was at pains to close in \u00a7 8(b) (4) (B) will have been introduced in \u00a7 8(e) by the same amendatory statute.

During the last five years there has been a constant increase in the number of such distributors doing business in Hie area affected by the contract. Both union and employer witnesses testified that the union considered independent distributors not bound by the contract to be a threat to the union and its members, because respondent employer-producers were not required to assure such distributors, or their employees, a guaranteed work week, overtime pay, vacation benefits, pensions, and other advantages which the contract required respondent employer-producers to provide their own employees doing the same work. The employer witness testified that union representatives stated during collective bargaining that the union intended to secure the signatures of the independent contractors to the collective bargaining contract. The union witness testified, \u201cWe feel we want to have everybody in the same competitive contract conditions.\u201d About half of the independent distributors in the area had in fact signed the contract at the time of the hearing before the examiner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b101-13\">.
