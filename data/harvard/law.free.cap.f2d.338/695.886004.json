He was charged in each of counts four and five with willfully misapplying certain funds intrusted to him as an officer of the bank, in violation of \u00a7 656, Title 18 of the United States Code. He has appealed from his convictions on these counts and the sentences imposed, on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support a verdict of guilty on either of the counts and because the court made certain errors in its charge to the jury. An examination of the transcript of the trial proceedings shows, however, that there was ample evidence on the basis of which the jury was warranted in finding that the accused was, beyond a reasonable doubt, guilty on both of the counts in question. The errors asserted with respect to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
