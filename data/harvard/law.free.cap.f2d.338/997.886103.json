To establish disability under the act, the claimant must demonstrate an \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity.\u201d The Hearing Examiner found that appellant\u2019s physical impairments did not prevent him from performing non-strenuous work not requiring education for skill and concluded that disability within the Act was not established. The Appeals Council denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-15\">After a careful review of the record, we are convinced that the Hearing Examiner applied correct legal standards and that his findings are supported by substantial evidence. Consequently, the judgment appealed from must be and it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
