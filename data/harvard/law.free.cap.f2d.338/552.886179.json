In the District Court, as here, appellant was represented by able and experienced counsel. The primary contention on appeal is that the District Judge in his charge, to which no objection was made, reflected the court\u2019s conclusion that there was no real issue as to the fact that appellant\u2019s blows caused the death of decedent. However, from the outset defense counsel seemed to concede this fact, for in his opening statement he told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-22\">We will show that in the process of defending himself the defendant reached behind him and grabbed a baseball bat and struck the fatal blow to the deceased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-23\">And after we establish these facts, we hope, ladies and gentlemen, that it will prove to you beyond any doubt that the homicide in this particular case was committed in self-defense of the person of James Richardson.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al_-\">Defense counsel\u2019s closing argument continued the theory of the case as one of self-defense and made no claim that appellant had not caused the death in question. We cannot conclude that the court\u2019s charge in these circumstances was error warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-24\">Secondly appellant urges that the crime of manslaughter as a lesser included offense should not have been submitted to the jury. But defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>submitted \u00f1o suggestions in response to the court\u2019s request for instructions and objected to the manslaughter instruction only after the charge had been completed. The record reveals much conflict in the testimony of numerous witnesses called by both sides and the evidence as a whole was such as to support a verdict of either second degree murder or manslaughter. We have considered other contentions of appellant and find no error which warrants disturbing the verdict and judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
