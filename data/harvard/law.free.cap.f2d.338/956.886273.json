The Commissioner had previously found (and had contended before the Tax Court for) a deficiency of $36,496.51. The dispute turns upon whether or not salaries. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>and bonuses paid to the corporation\u2019s two principal officers and stockholders were or were not \u201creasonable\u201d within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code of 1954, \u00a7 162(a) (l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">Two brothers, Nick and Charley Savko, were recipients of the salaries and bonuses and paid personal income taxes thereon. They had organized the corporation late in 1955 to engage in the building, construction and excavating business in which both had considerable prior experience. It is undisputed that through their joint efforts in estimating jobs, in getting business, in laying out work and supervising it, they were personally responsible for the considerable success of <em>the </em>company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">The financial picture of the taxpayer company is shown in these figures:</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">\n<em>Year Ending June 30 Gross Receipts Net Income (Loss) Total Compensation to Savkos</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">1957 $461,666.10 $(11,273.85) $62,500</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">1958 555,672.88 26,205.24 49.000</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">1959 775,916.01 38,683.27 52.000</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-22\">The Commissioner\u2019s and the Tax compensation was as follows: Court\u2019s treatment of the Savkos\u2019 total</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-23\">\n<em>Commissioner Tax Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-24\">\n<em>Taxable Year Ended June 30 Compensation Allowed Tax Deficiency Compensation Allowed Tax Deficiency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-25\">1957 $26,000.00 $ 6,873.11 $49,000.00 $ -0-</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-26\">1958 26,000.00 16,103.40 49.000. 00 4,096.79</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-27\">1959 26,000.00 13,520.00 52.000. 00 -0-</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-47\">The Tax Court on this record held amounts paid each of the Savko brothers in 1957 \u201cwas unreasonable as compensation for services actually rendered * * * to the extent of $6,750 each.\u201d It thus appears that the Tax Court allowed $24,500 as \u201creasonable\u201d compensation to each officer for the first year of operation of the company at a time when the company showed a loss. This was the same compensation which the company paid to each brother in the following year \u2014 the first year when the company showed a profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-52\">Under this record we cannot say that the Tax Court\u2019s determination was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Rule 52(a) Fed.
