The statute involved is 26 U.S.C. (I.R.C.1954) \u00a7 2055 (1958 Ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">There is no dispute as to the facts which are set forth in the findings of the trial commissioner. In 1955 the testator executed a will in which the bequest in issue read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">\u201cFourth, I give devise and bequeath to my son Harry Henderson Lamson, Jr., the sum of Twenty thousand dollars. ($20,000.00)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The will also contained specific bequests of $10 to the testator\u2019s son, Harry Curtice Lamson, and of $10,000 to his daughter-in-law, Rosemarie Lamson. The residue of the estate was devised to a son, George Hunter Lamson, who was also named as executor. Upon the death of the testator in 1956, the will was admitted to probate without contest and distribution of the estate was made pursuant to the terms of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Harry Henderson Lamson, Jr., the testator\u2019s son and the recipient of the specific bequest quoted above, entered the Capuchin Order of the Roman Catholic Church in 1947. He was no longer known in the church by his original name but had become known as \u201cFather Solano\u201d, Padres Capuchinos. He was subsequently ordained a priest, and in 1950 took the final oath of absolute poverty. This vow requires the person taking it to give any property thereafter acquired to the church. At the time he signed the will and at the time of his death, the decedent knew that his son had taken a vow of poverty and was acquainted with the terms and conditions of the vow. After the will was probated, Father Solano transferred his bequest to the Capuchin Order, which the parties concede to be a qualified beneficiary under section 2055.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">The purpose of section 2055 was stated by the Supreme Court in Y.M.C.A. v. Davis, 264 U.S. 47, 44 S.Ct. 291, 68 L.Ed. 558 (1924), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-17\">\u201cCongress was thus looking at the subject from the standpoint of the testator and not from the immediate point of view of the beneficiaries. It was intending to favor gifts for altruistic objects, not by specific exemption of those gifts but by encouraging testators to make such gifts. Congress was in reality dealing with the testator before his death. It said to him: \u2018If you will make such gifts, we will reduce your death duties and measure them, not by your whole estate, but by that amount, less what you give.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-19\">The testator, and he alone, must provide for the charitable bequest and the fact that the proceeds of a bequest are used by a beneficiary for charitable purposes does not bring the bequest within the statute. Mississippi Valley Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 72 F.2d 197 (8th Cir. 1934); Levey v. Smith, 103 F.2d 643 (7th Cir. 1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-20\">In applying these principles, several cases involving facts that are similar to those before us have been decided adversely to the taxpayer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s principal argument is that, since the decedent knew his son would be obligated to transfer the proceeds of his inheritance to the Capuchin Order, the bequest to the son was a transfer \u201cto or for the use of\u201d the Capuchin Order. However, the fact that the decedent anticipated that his son would transfer the bequests to the religious order is not, standing alone, sufficient to establish that the decedent intended to make a gift to the order or to create a constructive trust for its benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">In Cox v. Commissioner, 297 F.2d 36 (2d Cir. 1961), the Second Circuit had before it a will in which the decedent bequeathed a portion of her estate to her son, Lewis, who was a Roman Catholic priest. The will was executed in 1941 and, although Lewis had entered the Society of Jesus as early as 1934, he did not take his last or solemn vows of poverty until 1950. After the testatrix learned that her son could not own or retain the property, she wrote a letter to her attorneys in 1953 in which she recognized her son\u2019s obligation to transfer the bequest to the Jesuit Order and expressed her satisfaction that the Order would receive the inheritance. The court held that the will in which Lewis was explicitly named as legatee was too plain to permit a resort to processes of construction to ascertain the intent of the testatrix and refused to find that the will had made Lewis a constructive trustee for the religious order. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">\u201cAfter she [testatrix] learned of Lewis\u2019 subsequent renunciation and assignment to the Society, there was no mistake or representation which induced her to leave her original bequest unchanged. Instead, she did so knowing, as she said in the letter to her attorney quoted above, that Lewis \u2018will be only too happy to <em>pass it on </em>to the order * * *.\u2019 (Emphasis supplied.) It was Lewis\u2019 renunciation and assignment which was to be the operative dispositive act \u2014 -as the testatrix plainly recognized. She did not, as she readily might have done, by her will create-any interest of any kind, equitable or legal, conditional or executory, in. the Society.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">In Estate of Barry v. Commissioner, 311 F.2d 681 (9th Cir. 1962), the decedent executed a will in 1947 in which-he made a specific bequest to one of his sons, Joseph F. Barry, S. J. The son had been a member of the Jesuit Order since 1935 and the initials \u201cS.J.\u201d indicated his membership in the Order. Retook his first perpetual vows in 1937 and his final vows in 1952, when he agreed, that whatever property might devolve to him would be transferred to the Society. The testator was aware of this-before his death in 1955 and believed: that any property he bequeathed to his son would ultimately be transferred to-the Society. In declining to hold that' the bequest was made to a constructive-trustee for the use of the religious order, the court reached the same result as in Cox v. Commissioner, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">In the absence of fraud, misrepresentation or other circumstances which-would support the creation of a constructive trust, we must look to the provisions of the will itself to ascex-tain the-intent of the testator. The specific bequest to Harry Henderson Lamson, Jr., is absolute on its face. The will shows a pattern of testamentary disposition that is family oriented, without mention of the Capuchin Order or reference to any charitable purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">The facts before us may well px\u2019esent\u2019 a weaker case than the facts in the cited' cases. The testator knew of the vow which his son had taken at the time the-will was written. If, as plaintiff asserts, decedent intended to make a gift to the-religious order, it would seem that he-would have given some indication of this; at the time the will was executed when he might readily have expressed such an-intention. Furthermox\u2019e, we do not have-here, as in Cox and Barry, evidence of statements by the testator that he was-satisfied the charity would receive the-property bequeathed to his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>It would be interesting to speculate whether the testator would have disinherited his son had he left the religious -order, as he was free to do, before the .testator\u2019s death. However, we need not indulge in such speculation, because we 'have concluded that the evidence in this -case shows that the testator intended to make an unconditional bequest to his son, Harry Henderson Lamson, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">We find that no constructive trust was established for the benefit of the Capuchin Order. Any rights of the \u2022Order to the funds bequeathed to the son rose outside the will by contract. St. Benedict\u2019s Order of New Jersey v. Steinhauser, 234 U.S. 640, 34 S.Ct. 932, 58 L.Ed. 1512 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">For the reasons stated, the estate is mot entitled to the charitable deduction \u2022claimed, and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-9\">. Section 2055 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">\u201c(a) In general.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">For purposes of the tax imposed by section 2001, the value of the taxable estate shall be determined by deducting from the value of the gross estate the amount of all bequests, legacies, devises, or transfers * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-13\">\u201c(2) to or for the use of any corporation organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">The word \u201ctransfers\u201d as used in the statute relates only to transfers made by a decedent in contemplation of death or to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death. Taft v. Commissioner, 304 U.S. 351, 357, 58 S.Ct. 891, 82 L.Ed. 1393 (1938). The words \u201cfor the use of\u201d as used in the statute are intended to convey a meaning similar to that of \u201cin trust for\u201d. Cox v.
