Smith Contracting Company, Inc. Jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship. As the appellant\u2019s truck was being backed into a parallel parking position, it struck another parked vehicle and propelled it into the appellee who was standing in front of a third parked vehicle, causing substantial and painful injuries. Thirty special issues were submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-22\">The appellant complains chiefly of the instructions by the Court, the submission of the special issues, and the answers of the jury, all of which resulted in a verdict and judgment against it. We have carefully considered the record, briefs, and all of the contentions of the parties. We fail to find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-23\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
