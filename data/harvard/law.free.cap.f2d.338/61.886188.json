He instituted an action for damages in the District Court for personal injuries basing jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship. The case was tried to the court without a jury. The District Judge adopted findings of fact and conclusions of law and rendered a judgment against defendant for $10,000 damages for personal injuries and $1,000 for medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-25\">In this appeal, liability is not an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-26\">Defendant contends that the proof of aggravation of a pre-existing heart condition was inadequate under Kentucky law in that it did not spell out the amount or proportion of aggravation; that the testimony of the medical expert on this subject was not positive and that the District Judge went too far in questioning a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-27\">In our judgment, there was substantial evidence to support the findings of fact by the District Judge. They are not clearly erroneous. The medical testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>mony was adequate. The District Judge was not a mere umpire. His function was to see that justice was done. The \u25a0questions that he asked in this case were within the bounds of propriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
