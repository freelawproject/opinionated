As to this there is clearly no genuine issue. The detailed factual affidavits, adduced in support of the Bank\u2019s motion, F.R.Civ.P. 56, were not controverted as to the critical fact that Appellant executed a note for $10,000 which amount was delivered to a third party (Sovereign Resources, Inc.) pursuant to Appellant\u2019s express written direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-25\"> The balance of the case concerns Appellant\u2019s allegations that the note, although purporting to bind him, was actually executed because he was assured that the corporation, the recipient of the funds under his note, had adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>collateral, and that he would never be held personally accountable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a matter of Texas law, this allegation states no defense. Under the familiar accepted Texas principles, this parol evidence would not be admissible because it negates the very obligation of the writing. Jones v. Hubbard, Tex.Civ.App. writ ref. n.r.e., 1957, 302 S.W.2d 493; Howeth v. Davenport, Tex.Civ.App. writ ref. n.r.e., 1958, 311 S.W.2d 480. The cases urged by Appellant, McFarland v. Shaw, State Banking Commissioner, Tex.Com.App. (opinion adopted), 1932, 45 S.W.2d 193; Dallas Teachers Credit Union v. Sweeny, Tex.Civ.App. writ dism\u2019d, 1959, 326 S. W.2d 244, are not to the contrary, and this ease does not come within them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1068-12\">. This same allegation also serves as the basis for Appellant\u2019s arguments that lie signed the note only as guarantor or surety, or that he was fraudulently induced to make the note. As to these, the record also demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
