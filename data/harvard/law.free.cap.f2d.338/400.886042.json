Appellant was indicted in a four count indictment involving the sale of \u201cdilaudid,\u201d a narcotic. Counts II and IV were dismissed, and appellant convicted on Count I, sale of dilaudid without written order (26 U.S. C. \u00a7 4705(a)), and Count III, sale of dilaudid not in or from a stamped package (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a)). The sentence imposed was concurrent on the two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-15\">Jurisdiction below rests on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231; here on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-16\">But one alleged error is raised on this appeal. It relates to each of the counts. It is that the indictment was defective in that it failed to name the purchaser of the drug, \u201cor in the alternative good and sufficient reason for said omission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-21\">The record discloses that a motion for a bill of particulars was filed by appellant in the trial court. No direct request was made of the government to name the purchaser of the drug \u2014 but appellant requested that all parties present at the charged sale be named. (Clk\u2019s Tr. p. 13.) This motion for a bill of particulars <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was granted and the information supplied \u2014 including the name of the purchaser (Clk\u2019s Tr. p. 18) (identified not by the bill of particulars, but as such purchaser by the evidence at the trial. R.T. pp. 24-25; pp. 77-80). Thus we note the name of the purchaser was supplied to appellant, but do not suggest, of course, that a defective indictment can be cured by any bill of particulars. Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 770, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-22\">The only question for our determination is whether the failure to name the purchaser of a specified narcotic drug, allegedly sold by appellant at a specified place on a specified day, renders the indictment defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-23\">We hold it does not. An indictment, of course, must \u201capprise the defendant, with reasonable certainty of the nature of the accusation against him.\u201d United States v. Simmons, 96 U.S. 360, 362, 24 L.Ed. 819 (1877). It must \u201cinform the accused of the specific offense\u201d coming under the general description of the statute. United States v. Hess, 124 U.S. 483, 487, 8 S.Ct. 571, 573, 31 L.Ed. 516 (1888).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-24\">Appellant primarily relies on Lauer v. United States, 320 F.2d 187 (7th Cir. 1963). The court there had for consideration a conviction on one count only \u2014 \u25a0 a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(a). Relying on United States v. Simmons, supra, and Larkin v. United States, 107 F. 697 (7th Cir. 1901),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court in Lauer, su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>.pra, states that \u201c[t]he identity of the \u25a0purchaser of the narcotic is not an element of the offense of unlawful sale proscribed by 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705(a),\u201d but \u201cis a factor \u2018central to every prosecution \u25a0under the statute\u2019,\u201d citing Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 764-766, 82 S.Ct. 1038.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">We have heretofore ruled against appellant\u2019s position with respect to a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a marijuana conviction. (Rivera v. United States, 318 F.2d 606 (9th Cir. 1963).) Lauer, supra, distinguishes '.between a marijuana sale and a narcotic sale requiring a written order from a seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Judge Browning upheld Rivera\u2019s conviction on the authority of United States v. Debrow, 346 U.S. 374, 74 S.Ct. 113, 98 L.Ed. 92 (1953); Young v. United States, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 414, 288 F.2d 398 (1961); Blumenfield v. United States, 284 F.2d 46, 49-50 (8th Cir. 1960); and Young v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 54, 212 F.2d 236 (1954), saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">\u201cThe indictment alleged the offense substantially in the words of the statute, which sets forth all -the essential elements of the crime; -* -* The indictment thus alleged an offense, and identified the particular conduct upon which the \u25a0 charge was based to the extent nec- \u25a0 essary to protect appellant from \u2022 double jeopardy and to tell him what he must be prepared to meet. This \u25a0was enough to satisfy constitutional standards * * (Id. 318 F. 2d at 607.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-18\">The tenth and eighth circuits have refused to follow Lauer, supra, in Clay v. United States, 326 F.2d 196 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (1963) and Jackson v. United States, 325 F.2d 477 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-19\">In Llamas v. United States, 226 F. Supp. 351 (E.D.N.Y.1963), the trial court held that the identity of purchasers is not an element of the crimes charged (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174), and need not be supplied a defendant. It held that United States v. Simmons, supra, and Larkin v. United States, supra, \u201csupport the government\u2019s position.\u201d The second circuit affirmed <em>per curiam </em>(United States v. Llamas, 327 F.2d 657 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-20\">The most recent cases we find are directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-21\">In Taylor v. United States, 332 F.2d 918, 921 (1964), the eighth circuit had before it marijuana sales, not under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a, but 26 U.&amp;.C. \u00a7 4742(a) charging the \u201ctransfer [of] a quantity of marijuana <em>not pursuant to a written order of the person to ivhom said marijuana was transferred </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-23\">After citing the cases reviewed above, the eighth circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-24\">\u201cWe likewise decline to follow Lauer and hold that the information herein as to Counts 1 and 3 was not fatally defective through failure to name the transferee.\u201d (Id. at 921.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-25\">Finally, the sixth circuit in United States v. Dickerson, 337 F.2d 343 (de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>cided September 29, 1964), distinguished Lauer, criticizing the rule, but not the result.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\u201cThe holding in Lauer that the name of the purchaser is \u2018central\u2019 to the offense is not borne out by the language of the statute. The statute makes the act of sale the central fact of the offense, and the lack of the required order form another important requisite. Whereas here the indictment alleges specific facts sufficient to identify the act of sale, and specifically alleges that no order form was furnished, we believe \u2018the cause of the accusation\u2019 has been made known.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u201cThe rationale of Lauer is founded upon two United States Supreme Court cases; Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962) and United States v. Cruikshank, et al., 92 U.S. 542, 563, 23 L.Ed. 588 (1875). Neither case involved narcotics sales, and we do not find any analogy between the instant indictment\u2019s failure to name a narcotics purchaser and the deficiency of the congressional contempt indictment in Russell and the civil rights conspiracy indictments in Cruikshank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjX\">\u201cThe reversal of the convictions in the Russell ease (upon which it seems to us the Seventh Circuit relied heavily in Lauer) was due to the fact that as to the offenses charged the indictments allowed the prosecution to change positions to the prejudice of the defendants during trial and appeal. The court there held that there was an \u2018uneertainty and unfairness\u2019 in the prosecutions based on the indictments concerned. Russell v. United States, supra at 369 U.S. 766, 82 S.Ct. 1038.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">\u201cIn the instant case we clearly have no such situation. No unfairness or uncertainty is argued to us. No prejudice to defendant\u2019s rights is shown. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">\u201cWe do not, of course, know from the Lauer opinion just what the terms of the indictment dealt with therein actually were. It may well have lacked particularity to such a degree that absent the name of the purchaser it did not inform defendant of \u2018the cause of the accusation.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">\u201cOur disagreement with Lauer, therefore, is not necessarily with its result, but with the rule which some of its readers have deduced therefrom that all naroctics indictments under similar statutes are constitutionally defective unless the purchaser is named.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">\u201cObviously, the purchaser\u2019s name is one simple device for lending desired particularity to the indictment. But we regard the purchaser\u2019s name in a narcotics indictment as just one means \u2014 and sometimes perhaps not the most desirable \u2014 of informing defendant of the particular conduct complained of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-14\">\u201cThe courts are not unaware of the hazards attendant upon testimony of informants in narcotics cases. The United States Supreme Court in Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957), held that failure to disclose the name of an informer at trial was reversible error because unfair to defendant under the circumstances of that case. But it also declined to say that the informer\u2019s identity need to be divulged in all cases, even at trial. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-15\">\u201cThe Seventh Circuit in Lauer also cited United States v. Simmons, supra. The Simmons case held:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-16\">\u201c \u2018Since the defendant was not charged with using the still, boiler, and other vessels himself, but only with causing and procuring some one else to use them, the name of that person should have been given.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-17\">\u201cThe distinction appears obvious to us. In Lauer and in our instant case the defendants were themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>charged with committing the offense \u2014 not procuring some one else to commit it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s argument pertaining to Fifth Amendment due process suggests that by the failure to name the purchaser, defendant was deprived of information he needed in order adequately to prepare for trial. He does not, however, claim that he was ever in doubt as to who was alleged to be the purchaser of the drugs. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We hold that Count I of the indictment here attacked complies fully with the requirement of our Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (18 U.S.C.) Rule 7 (c), as construed by the Supreme Court. United States v. Debrow, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">We need only add that Count III of the indictment differs from Count I, in that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a) makes no mention of \u201c[any] person to whom such article is sold,\u201d as is contained in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(a). The conclusions controlling our disposition of Count I are <em>a priori </em>controlling as to Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-17\">. There is a reference in the bil\u00ed of particulars to the presence of one John Doe, \u201ca person unknown to plaintiff\u201d; who allegedly accompanied defendant to the scene of the sale, but did not otherwise participate, either as seller or purchaser.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-27\">. In Simmons, supra, the defendant \u201cwas not himself charged with using a still, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>boiler, or other vessels for the purpose of distilling,\u201d but with \u201ccausing and procuring someone else\u201d to use them. In Larkin, supra, an alleged mail fraud was charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b474-13\">. Russell, supra, involved the failure of indictments to state the question under congressional committee inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b474-14\">. Clay v. United States, involved a conviction under the same section (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(a)) and the same ground of attack was used \u2014 that the name of the purchaser was not given. The court refused to follow Lauer, supra, stating: \u201cThe statute ,[\u00a7 4705(a)] makes no provision or requirement with respect to the identity of the person to whom an illegal sale is made and we must therefore conclude, as the court did in the Lauer case, that the identity of such person is not an element of the offense\u201d \u2014 hence the indictment was not defective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b474-27\">. Jackson v. United States, involved a heroin sale, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174; \u201cquite similar\u201d to the \u00a7 176a marijuana conviction of Rivera. \u201cThus, Lauer may be distinguishable * * * but * * * we are not bound by Lauer and do not choose to follow it.\u201d (325 F.2d p. 479)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
