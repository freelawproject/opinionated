Appellants prayed for a declaration that the film was not obscene, for an order restraining appellees, from interfering with exhibition of the film, and for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-23\">\u201c[T]he accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief\u201d (Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)) \u201c * * * precludes dismissal for insufficiency of the complaint except in the extraordinary case where the pleader makes allegations which show on the face of the complaint some insuperable bar to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>lief.\u201d Wright, Federal Courts 250 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The district court thought such an insuperable bar was posed by the rule of Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U.S. 157, 63 S.Ct. 877, 87 L.Ed. 1324 (1943), that federal courts will enjoin threatened state criminal prosecution \u201conly on a showing of danger of irreparable injury \u2018both great and immediate\u2019 \u201d, and that such a showing is not made out where \u201cit does not appear from the record that petitioners have been threatened with any injury other than that incidental to every criminal proceeding brought lawfully and in good faith * * *.\" (id. at 164, 63 S.Ct. at 881).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Appellants dispute the applicability of Douglas v. City of Jeannette on several grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">(1) Unlike the complaint in Douglas v. City of Jeannette, the present complaint alleges that appellees, acting under color of state law, \u201cdeliberately set about to achieve the suppression of publications deemed \u2018objectionable\u2019 and succeeded in [their] aim;\u201d and such \u201cinformal censorship may sufficiently inhibit the circulation of publications to warrant injunctive relief,\u201d though the means used are \u201cthreats of prosecution.\u201d Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 67, and n. 8, 83 S.Ct. 631, 638, 9 L.Ed.2d 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">(2) In Douglas v. City of Jeannette, plaintiffs themselves were threatened with prosecution, and there was nothing to indicate that their constitutional claims could not be fully determined in the state criminal proceeding. 319 U.S. at 164, 63 S.Ct. 877. In the present ease, appellees\u2019 threats are directed solely against potential exhibitors of the film; appellants themselves are not threatened with a criminal prosecution in which they might challenge appellees\u2019 determination that their film is obscene and obtain a judicial determination by the state court, ultimately reviewable in the Supreme Court of the United States, of the constitutionality of appellees\u2019 interference with the film\u2019s exhibition. Cf. Moss v. Hornig, 314 F.2d 89 (2d Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">(3) In Douglas v. City of Jeannette, plaintiffs sought to enjoin the prosecution. In the present case, appellants do not seek to enjoin prosecutions, but only threats of prosecution which have resulted in suppression of appellants\u2019 film with no opportunity to obtain a judicial test of the constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">(4) The complaint in Douglas v. City of Jeannette sought only injunctive relief, and was dismissed solely for \u201cwant of equity.\u201d 319 U.S. at 166, 63 S.Ct. 877. In the present case, appellants seek not only equitable relief but also substantial damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\"> Appellants\u2019 arguments demonstrate that the bar of Douglas v. City of Jeannette may not prove \u201cinsuperable.\u201d No more need be decided. It would be inappropriate to attempt finally to determine whether appellants would be entitled to relief upon a supposed state of facts encompassed within the broad boundaries of their pleading. To do so, as Judge Brown has pointed out, would involve \u201celucidating legal responsibilities as to facts which may never be.\u201d Shull v. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 313 F.2d 445, 447 (5th Cir. 1963). An advisory opinion as to a necessarily hypothetical case is particularly undesirable where, as here, the applicable legal principles are in a formative and uncertain state. \u201c[A] case of this importance, in a field where the law remains unsettled, ought not to be disposed of upon a mere motion to dismiss without opportunity to develop what the precise facts are.\u201d Builders Corp. of America v. United States, 259 F.2d 766, 773 (9th Cir. 1958) (Judge Pope, concurring). See also Marshall v. Sawyer, 301 F.2d 639, 647 (9th Cir. 1962), and cases cited; Arfons v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., 261 F.2d 434 (2d Cir. 1958); Fair v. United States, 234 F.2d 288, 296 (5th Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\"> The county attorney suggests that he was entitled to dismissal under the rule that prosecuting officers are im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>mu\u00f1e from suit under the Civil Rights Act for conduct in the performance of their quasi-official duties. See e. g., Agnew v. Moody, 330 F.2d 868, 869 (9th Cir. 1964), and cases cited. However, prosecutors are not immune from suit under the Act simply as a matter of status wholly without regard to the nature of their conduct. See, e. g., Lewis v. Brautigam, 227 F.2d 124, 128-129, 55 A.L.R.2d 505 (5th Cir. 1955). The county attorney did not submit the present contention to the district court. If he had, and if the district court had held the allegations of the complaint insufficient under the immunity rule, appellants would have been entitled to an opportunity to amend, no responsive pleading having been filed. In these circumstances, we will not consider the adequacy either of the allegations as they now read or as they might be supplemented by amendment. Breier v. Northern California Bowling Proprietors\u2019 Ass\u2019n, 316 F.2d 787, 790 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
