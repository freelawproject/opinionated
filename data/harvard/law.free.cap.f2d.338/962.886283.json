Upon the appeal of American President Lines from paragraph No. 3 of the judgment of the District Court, judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-17\">2. Upon the appeal of the United States from paragraph No. 2 of the said judgment, judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-18\">3. Upon the appeal of the United States from paragraph No. 6 of said judgment, judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-19\">The remaining issue is as to the amount of \u201ccumulative net voyage profits\u201d due to the United States as \u201cadditional charter hire\u201d under a bare-boat charter in effect during the years 1946 to 1955. The obligation arises under that provision of the charter included pursuant to \u00a7 709(a) of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 2010 (1936), 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1199(a) (1958).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant realized net profits during the years 1948 through 1952 and net losses during 1953 through 1955. The sole question upon this appeal is whether, under \u00a7 709(a), the losses are to be carried back and offset against the earlier profits in determining \u201ccumulative net voyage profits.\u201d The District Court held that they were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-20\">This precise question was considered in United States v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. (4 Cir. 1962) 308 F.2d 866, cert. denied (1963) 372 U.S. 944, 83 S.Ct. 937, 9 L.Ed. 969, and was determined in accordance with the contentions of appellant. We agree with the reasoning and holding in that case. Accordingly we conclude that the carryback of losses is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>proper, since, as held in that case at page 874:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-4\">\u201c\u00a7 709 permits and requires the cumulation of profits and losses <em>over the period of the charter </em>as the basis of the calculation of additional charter hire * * (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">Upon this issue, judgment is reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this order and holding.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1035-13\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1199:</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
