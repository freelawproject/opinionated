Snow, an inmate of the Oregon State Penitentiary, tendered a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon seeking damages against Clarence T. Gladden, the warden of said penitentiary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jurisdiction was asserted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) and (4), it being alleged that the claim arose under 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 1983 (1958).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-13\">Snow, in his complaint, alleged that he had been incarcerated in the Oregon State Penitentiary since October 6, 1959, pursuant to a judgment rendered in the Oregon state courts. He further alleges that in January, 1961, a prison doctor made a diagnosis that he had an ulcer and directed that he be fed upon an ulcer diet. Snow alleges that he received this ulcer diet for approximately a year and a half until on or about June 30, 1962, at which time he was ordered to be confined in the isolation quarters of the penitentiary where he remained until he was released from isolation on February 24, 1964. He further alleges that he did not receive his ulcer diet for a period from approximately the 25th of September, 1962, until the 24th of February, 1964. He further alleges \u201cthat by reason of the aforesaid refusal defendant acting under the color of state law and through his duly authorized agents has denied plaintiff the equal protection of the law; aggravated plaintiff\u2019s ulcer condition, and caused plaintiff great physical pain and mental anguish.\u201d The prayer of his complaint asks for some $15,000 in damages and for an order to the defendant \u201cto cease and desist from refusing to give plaintiff his ulcer diet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-18\">The district court made an order permitting the filing of the complaint in forma pauperis and then held that the complaint \u201cfails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action or upon which the court can grant any relief, and, further that the subject matter of said complaint is frivolous.\u201d, and dismissed the complaint. A timely appeal was taken to this court which has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-19\">Appellant\u2019s complaint alleges that appellant has been denied the equal protection of the laws. On this contention the complaint is deficient in that there is absent an allegation that the purpose of the acts complained of was to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>criminate between appellant and others. Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 10, 64 S.Ct. 397, 88 L.Ed. 497 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\">Even if we consider that appellant\u2019s claim arises under the due process clause appellant is entitled to no relief. There are no sufficient allegations of any serious bodily injury to appellant or any showing of any right entitling him to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">Prison authorities have wide discretion as to the treatment of prisoners. Weller v. Dickson, 314 F.2d 598, 602 (9th Cir. 1963) (concurring opinion of Duniway, J.) and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">We see no error in the action of the district court dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1072-14\">. With the complaint Snow also moved to file and prosecute the complaint in propria persona and in forma pauperis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1072-15\">. \u201c\u00a7 1983.
