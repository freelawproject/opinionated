A loss was sustained as a result of an accident in which, one person was killed and two injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-22\">The District Court concluded that the-liability of the two companies should be-prorated in accordance with a provision common to both policies with respect to-\u201cother insurance,\u201d and directed that Liberty bear three-eighths of the loss and' National five-eighths. We detect no error in the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the trial court. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
