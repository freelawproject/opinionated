Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir., 232 F.2d 142, the record in this case does not warrant such disposition. The inferences drawn by the Tax Court were fully warranted by the evidence including considerable oral testimony. The fact determinations thus made may not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. This they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-29\">We need not decide whether the houses which were rented while being held \u201cfor sale\u201d were subject to depreciation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Commissioner allowed depreciation on a straight line basis on a 33% year life. This was not disturbed by the Tax Court. Its determination to permit this item to stand is not appealed by the Commissioner. We therefore also let it stand. The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
