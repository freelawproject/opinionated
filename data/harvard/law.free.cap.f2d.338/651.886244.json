The one count indictment charged them with unlawfully removing certain merchandise while said merchandise was in customs custody and control in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 549. That section provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">\u201cWhoever maliciously enters any bonded warehouse or any vessel or vehicle laden with or containing bonded merchandise with intent unlawfully to remove therefrom any merchandise or baggage therein, or unlawfully removes any merchandise or baggage in such vessel, vehicle, or bonded warehouse or otherwise in customs custody or control; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-11\"><em>\u201c </em>*** <em>\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">Both defendants moved to dismiss the indictment contending that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute an offense against the United States. The motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\"> We believe that felonious intent is necessary to a conviction under the statute in question. Since the indictment failed to allege that intent, the trial court erred in not granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-15\">It is true that felonious intent is not an essential ingredient in every crime and criminal regulation. United States v. Behrman, 258 U.S. 280, 42 S. Ct. 303, 66 L.Ed. 619 (1922); United States v. Balint, 258 U.S. 250, 42 S.Ct. 301, 66 L.Ed. 604 (1922). Both those cases, however, involved the sale of narcotics, and it is only with respect to such offenses as those, so-called \u201cpublic welfare offenses,\u201d that intent may be dispensed with. A crime such as the one presently under consideration, on the other hand, which is substantially a statutory codification of common-law larceny, may not be deprived of its common-law element of intent. Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952). Accordingly larcenous intent' \u2014 knowledge of a wrongful act \u2014 may not be dispensed with.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-16\">The Government argues that the requirement of knowledge is satisfied, both in the statute and in the indictment, by the use of the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d. We do not agree. It would seem to us that \u201cunlawfully\u201d is a conclusion of law meaning \u201ccontrary to law\u201d and no more. We do not interpret it as meaning \u201cknowingly.\u201d Indeed, it would seem to us that the indictment as it is phrased would support the conviction of a person who innocently removed goods from customs custody and control before their release, mistakenly thinking the appropriate papers complete when they were not. This is not a case where other allegations in the indictment compel an inference of intent. Portnoy v. United States, 1 Cir., 1960, 316 F.2d 486, cert. den. 375 U.S. 815, 84 S.Ct. 48, 11 L.Ed.2d 50; Madsen v. United States, 10 Cir., 1947, 165 F.2d 507. Of the cases cited by the Government as being to the contrary, we have not found one which clearly holds that \u201cunlawfully\u201d <em>alone </em>will suffice to imply an element of intent. See Morissette v. United States, supra, 342 U.S. at 264, 72 S.Ct. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-17\">Many sections of Title 18, Chapter 27 \u2014Customs\u2014of which \u00a7 549 is a part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>include the requirement of felonious intent, for example: section 541 \u2014 \u201cknowingly\u201d ; section 542 \u2014 \u201cfraudulent,\u201d \u201cwithout reasonable cause to believe the truth,\u201d \u201cwillful\u201d; section 543 \u2014 \u201cknowingly\u201d; section 544 \u2014 \u201cintent\u201d; section 545 \u2014 \u201cknowingly and willfully, with intent to defraud,\u201d \u201cfraudulently or knowingly,\u201d \u201cknowing\u201d; section 546 \u2014 \u201cfor the purpose of,\u201d \u201cknowledge or reasonable grounds for belief\u201d; section 548\u2014 \u201cfraudulently\u201d; section 550 \u2014 \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d; section 551 \u2014 \u201cwillfully,\u201d \u201cfor the purpose of\u201d; section 552 \u2014 \u201cknowingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Furthermore, the penalty provided in Section 549 is a fine not more than $5,000 or imprisonment not more than two years, or both. Accordingly, Title 18, \u00a7 1 U.S.C. makes a violation of Title 18, \u00a7 549 a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Judgment will be entered in each case vacating the judgment of the district court, setting aside the verdict and remanding the ease to that court with instructions to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
