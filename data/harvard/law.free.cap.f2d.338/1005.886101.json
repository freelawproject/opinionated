The chief contention of the defendant is that the evidence presented against him is not legally sufficient to sustain the convictions because, (a) the evidence shows that a quarterly excise tax return was filed for the period involved; (b) a failure of the evidence to show that such taxes were due and payable; and (c) there was not sufficient evidence to establish wilfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-28\">Our review convinces us that there is no merit in the contentions of the defendant; the evidence amply supports the jury verdict of guilt; and the defendant received a fair and impartial trial. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
