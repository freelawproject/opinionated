The action is predicated upon the provisions of Section 1(20) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1(20)). The issue arising from the complaint and answer was whether the operation of Southern over the private track owned and maintained by Peabody was such that it constituted an \u201cextension\u201d of Southern\u2019s line of railroad within the meaning and application of Section 1(18) of the Act (49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1(18)).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-16\">Substantially all of the facts involved were stipulated. The case was tried to the court which incorporated its findings of fact and conclusions of law in a memorandum decision reported as New York Central Railroad Co. v. Southern Railway Co., (D.C.N.D.Ill., E.D.) 226 F.Supp. 463. The District Court entered a judgment order denying the injunctive relief sought, and the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-17\">District Judge Julius J. Hoffman\u2019s opinion is well-reasoned and reflects both a discerning analysis of the issue presented for determination and a sound appraisal of the decisions relied upon by the parties as precedents pertinent to its resolution. Examination of the record satisfies us that the factual findings of the District Court are supported by substantial evidence and we are convinced that the court\u2019s conclusions represent applications of correct legal criteria. We adopt Judge Hoffman\u2019s opinion and affirm the judgment order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
