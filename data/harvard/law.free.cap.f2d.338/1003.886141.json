The first is the sufficiency of the evidence, NLRB v. Truitt Manufacturing Co., 1956, 351 U.S. 149, 76 S.Ct. 753, 100 L.Ed. 1027, that the employer was claiming financial inability to meet the Union wage demands. The other was the question whether the Union\u2019s reduced wage demand made a month later constituted a waiver. As to the first, it was a pure fact question and ends there. As to the second, bearing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>mind the requirement that waiver of rights under the Act must be clearly established, NLRB v. Item Co., 5 Cir., 1955, 220 F.2d 956, 958-959; cf. Sinclair Refg. Co. v. NLRB, 5 Cir., 1962, 306 F.2d 569, 575, the Board\u2019s rejection of waiver was likewise sufficiently founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">Enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
