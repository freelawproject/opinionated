The petitioner is a prisoner held under the authority of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the -only question of any substance which he raises was as to the proper interpretation of a Pennsylvania statute, a question which he presented to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and which it decided against him. Com. ex rel. Goins v. Rundle, 1963, 411 Pa. 590, 192 A.2d 720, cert. den. Goins v. Rundle, 375 U.S. 959, 84 S.Ct. 449, 11 L.Ed.2d 317. We are not able, as the district court was not, to discover that any of the petitioner\u2019s rights under the federal Constitution have been denied him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-20\">The order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
