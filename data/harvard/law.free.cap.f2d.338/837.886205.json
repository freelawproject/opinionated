It based its denial of plaintiff\u2019s motion for an injunction on the ground that it was \u201cwithout power to grant injunctive relief because of \u00a7 4 of Norris-LaGuardia [Norris LaGuardia Act],<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> since this is a 'case involving or growing out of a labor dispute,\u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> within the meaning of the Act. Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, 370 U.S. 195, 182 S. Ct. 1328, 8 L.Ed.2d 440 (1962).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A63\">The sum of the District Court\u2019s view <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is that the Norris-LaGuardia limitations on jurisdiction of federal district courts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>which the Supreme Court held in Sinclair extends to \u00a7 301 in cases growing out of labor disputes, do not divest these courts of <em>subject matter jurisdiction </em>of such cases, viz., <em>the capacity to take cognizance of, </em>or <em>to entertain, </em>but merely strip them of <em>power </em>to grant injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The view stated disregards the critical fact that in Sinclair, the Supreme Court, in holding that the jurisdiction conferred by \u00a7 301 was subject to the jurisdictional limitations enacted by the earlier NorrisLaGuardia Act, expressly ruled at page 215, 82 S.Ct. at page 1339:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-5\">\u201cThe District Court was correct in dismissing Count 3 of petitioner\u2019s complaint <em>for lack of jurisdiction </em>under the Norris-LaGuardia Act.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">We can only construe the phrase \u201clack of jurisdiction\u201d as embracing within its ambit <em>subject matter jurisdiction </em>and accordingly hold that the District Court erred in failing to grant the motion to remand in the instant case on its reasoning that it had <em>subject matter jurisdiction </em>under \u00a7 301 within the \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d provisions of \u00a7 1441. It merits observation that the background factual situation which constituted the basis of the injunctive action in Sinclair was on all fours with that existing here, as appears in Note 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">It may be pointed out anent the holding in Sinclair, that the Supreme Court, some 36 years earlier, in General Investment Company v. New York Central Railroad Company, 271 U.S. 228, p. 230, 46 S.Ct. 496, p. 497, 70 L.Ed. 920 (1926) succinctly defined jurisdiction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APn\">\u201cBy <em>jurisdiction </em>we mean <em>power to entertain the suit, </em>consider the merits and <em>render a binding decision thereon </em>* * *.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">It is fair to assume that Congress in its use of the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in the Norris-LaGuardia Act in 1932 was aware of the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>\u201cjurisdiction\u201d six years earlier, in the foregoing case.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">The Norris-LaGuardia Act in its title declared that it was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-5\">\u201cAN ACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-6\">\u201cTo amend the Judicial Code and to <em>define and limit the jurisdiction of courts sitting in equity, </em>and for other purposes.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">In Section 2 \u2014 \u201cDeclaration of the public policy of the United States\u201d \u2014 it was stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-8\">\u201cIn the interpretation of this Act and in determining the <em>jurisdiction and authority </em>of the courts of the United States, as such <em>jurisdiction and authority </em>are herein defined and limited, the public policy of the United States is hereby declared as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-9\">\u201c * * * therefore, the following definitions of, and limitations upon, <em>the jurisdiction and authority </em>of the courts of the United States are hereby enacted.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">In State of Minnesota v. Northern Securities Company, 194 U.S. 48, 24 S.Ct. 598, 48 L.Ed. 870 (1904) the Supreme Court made it clear that the term <em>jurisdiction </em>as used in the Removal Statute means the power <em>to take cognizance </em>of the case upon removal from a state court and <em>to decide it upon its merits. </em>There, an action was brought by the State of Minnesota against the defendants, to annul an agreement and suppress a combination alleged to exist between the defendant corporations, upon the grounds that the agreement and combination were in violation of the laws of Minnesota, and of the anti-trust laws of the United States. The action was removed from the state court to the circuit court of Minnesota on the ground that it was \u201cone arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States,\u201d and was subsequently dismissed by the circuit court on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">The Supreme Court <em>sua sponte </em>raised the question as to whether the case was removable although all the parties to the action \u201cdeemed the case a removable one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">In so doing it stated at page 63, 24 S.Ct. at page 601:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-16\">\u201cIf the record does not affirmatively show jurisdiction in the circuit court, we must, upon our own motion, so declare, and make such order as will prevent that court <em>from exercising an authority not conferred upon it by statute. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-17\">\u201cWe proceed, therefore, to inquire whether the circuit court <em>could take cognizance of this case </em>upon removal from the state court, and <em>make a final decree upon the merits.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-18\">After noting that it was the \u201cgeneral policy of these acts [removal statutes], manifest upon their face, and often recognized by this court, to <em>contract the jurisdiction </em>of the circuit [district] courts of the United States\u201d, it was said at pages 64-65, 24 S.Ct. at page 602:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ath\">\u201cThese cases establish, beyond further question in this court, the rule that, under existing statutes regulating the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, a case cannot be removed from a state court as one arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, unless the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, bill, or declaration shows it to be a case of that character. \u2018If it does not appear at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>the outset,\u2019 this court has quite recently said, \u2018that the suit is one of which the circuit court at the time its jurisdiction is invoked could <em>properly take cognizance, </em>the suit must be dismissed.\u2019 Third Street &amp; Suburban R. Co. v. Lewis, 173 U.S. 457, 460, 43 L.ed. 766, 767, 19 Sup.Ct. Rep. 451.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">It_is of compelling significanee-here that in Northern Securities, the Supreme Court reversed the denial of remand below on the ground that the removed action did not \u201creally and substantially involve a dispute or controversy within the jurisdiction of the circuit court <em>for the purposes of a final decree </em>* * * \u201d and, \u201cThat being the case, the circuit court, following the mandate of the statute [predecessor of the present \u00a7 1447 (c)], should not have proceeded therein, but should have remanded the cause to the state court.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">In the instant case the complaint alleged that the union had violated the \u201cno-strike\u201d clause of its collective bargaining agreement in the course of a labor dispute, and thus it appeared \u201cat the outset\u201d that the District Court could not, under Sinclair, \u201cproperly take cognizance of this case upon removal from the state court, and make a final decree <em>upon the merits.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">It cannot be gainsaid that had the plaintiff initially brought suit in the District Court under \u00a7 301, alleging in its complaint a cause of action for breach of its collective bargaining agreement, in the course of a labor dispute, and praying for injunctive relief, that the action would have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under Sinclair.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">To say then that a District Court has <em>subject matter </em>jurisdiction<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of a cause of action, so as to authorize it to <em>take cognizance </em>of it under the provisions of the Removal Statute, when it does not in the first place have jurisdiction to entertain and decide it upon its merits, is to give sanction to an exercise in futility.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">Or putting it another way, for a court to say that it has <em>subject matter jurisdiction </em>enabling it to take cognizance of a case, and then to rule that although the case has merit, it is without judicial power, viz., jurisdiction, to grant a final decree on the merits, is to pursue, what Mr. Justice Frankfurter once character-\u2019 ized, in another context, \u201ca fox-hunting theory of justice that ought to make Bentham\u2019s skeleton rattle,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and to do violence to the holding in General Investment Company v. New York Central Railroad Company, supra, that \u201cBy jurisdiction we mean power to entertain the suit, consider the merits and render a binding decision thereon.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">It has been settled for almost a century that federal statutes should be construed and applied so as to avoid \u201cinjustice\u201d or \u201cabsurd consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">In United States v. Kirby, 7 Wall. 482, pp. 486, 487, 74 U.S. 482, pp. 486, 487, 19 L.Ed. 278 (1869) it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-20\">\u201cThe authority by which judicial officers take cognizance of and decide causes * * * the power to hear and determine a cause. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-16\">\u201cAll laws should receive a sensible construction. General terms should be so limited in their application as not to lead to injustice, oppression, or an absurd consequence. * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>The reason of the law, in such eases, should prevail over its letter.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">In United States v. Katz, 271 U.S. 354, p. 357, 46 S.Ct. 513, p. 514, 70 L.Ed. 986 (1926) in which Kirby was cited with approval, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-5\">\u201cAll laws are to be given a sensible construction; and a literal application of a statute, which would lead to absurd consequences, should be avoided whenever a reasonable application can be given to it, consistent with the legislative purpose. * * * In ascertaining that purpose, we may examine the title of the act (citing eases) * * * and the legislative scheme or plan by which the general purpose of the act is to be carried out. (citing cases).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Here the denial of remand not only led to the \u201cabsurd consequence\u201d of leaving the District Court with a case on its judicial hands without judicial power to \u201cmake a final decree on its merits\u201d, but also to these serious consequences:</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">It rendered an \u201cinjustice\u201d to the plaintiff in that it deprived it of the benefit of the temporary injunctive relief granted by the state court under state law, prior to the case\u2019s removal, and foreclosed it from the available remedy of a permanent injunction; it ousted the state court of its jurisdiction to apply state law in a field not pre-empted by Congress, in contravention of the historic comity doctrine which proscribes avoidable direct conflicts between federal and state courts; and it thwarted the Congressional policy intended to have \u00a7 301(a) \u201csupplement\u201d and \u201cnot to displace\u201d or \u201cto encroach upon the existing jurisdiction of the state courts\u201d in suits for violation of collective bargaining contracts in industries affecting interstate commerce. Charles Dowd Box Co., Inc. v. Courtney, 368 U.S 502, 509, 511, 82 S.Ct. 519, 7 L.Ed.2d 483 (1962).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar6\">\u201cTie common sense of man approves the judgment mentioned by Puffendorf, that the Bolognian Law which enacted, \u2018That whoever drew blood in the streets should be punished with the utmost severity,\u2019 did not extend to the surgeon who opened the vein of a person that fell down in the street in a fit. The same common sense accepts the ruling cited by Plowden, that the Statute of 1 Edward II., which enacts that a prisoner who breaks prison shall be guilty of a felony, does not extend to a prisoner wlio breaks out when the prison is on fire\u2014 \u2018for he is not <em>to be </em>hanged because lie would not stay to be burnt.\u2019 And we think that a like common sense will sanction the ruling we make, that the Act of Congress which punishes the obstruction or retarding of the passage of the mail, or its carrier, does not apply to a case of temporary detention of the mail caused by the arrest of the carrier upon an indictment for murder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">Elaboration of these serious consequences must yield the right of way <em>to </em>the resolution of this transcending question:</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">Assuming, arguendo, that the NorrisLaGuardia Act did not deprive the District Court of \u00a7 301(a) <em>subject matter jurisdiction, </em>was the action here \u201cfounded on a claim or right arising under the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States\u201d, so as to make it removable, \u201cwithout regard to the citizenship or residence of the parties\u201d, within the meaning of \u00a7 1441(b) of the Removal Statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">If the answer to that question is that the removed state action was <em>not </em>\u201cfounded on a claim or right arising under\u201d \u00a7 301(a), it will require the reversal of the denial of remand, independent of the resolution of all the other questions presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">In 1821 the Supreme Court was first called upon to decide when a case \u201carises under a law of the United States\u201d in the landmark case of Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 5 L.Ed. 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">Speaking for the Court, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall there said (p. 379):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-17\">\u201cA case in law or equity consists of the right of the one party, as well as of the other, and may truly be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>said to arise under the constitution or a law of the United States, <em>whenever its correct decision depends on the construction of either.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) \\</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">It is of compelling significance here that in so holding the Supreme Court rejected the contention that a case <em>arises </em>under the Constitution or a law of the United States <em>merely </em>because it is founded on a right conferred by the Constitution or a federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">1 In doing so the Chief Justice said (p. 379):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-6\"><em>\u201cIf </em>it [the intention of the contention] be to maintain that a case arising under the constitution, or a law, must be one in which a party comes into court to demand something conferred on him by the constitution or h law, <em>we think the construction too narrow.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">In amplification of the rule stated, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the Court, in Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 822, 6 L.Ed. 204 (1824), declared that a case <em>arises </em>under the constitution or laws of the United States when <em>\u201cthe title or right set up by the party may be defeated by one construction of the constitution of law of the United States and </em>[o?-] <em>sustained by the opposite construction.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">More than a half century later, the Supreme Court, in Little York Gold-Washing and Water Company, Limited v. Keyes, 96 U.S. 199, 24 L.Ed. 656 (1878), applied the principles declared in Cohens and Osborn, in construing a provision in the Eemoval Act of 1875,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> for removal of suits \u201carising under the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">It there held (pp. 203-204):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-10\">\u201cA cause cannot be removed from a State Court simply because, in the progress of the litigation, it may become necessary to give a construction to the Constitution or laws of the United States. <em>The decision of the case must depend upon that construction. </em>The suit must, in part at least, <em>arise out of a controversy between the parties in regard to the operation and effect of the Constitution or laws upon the facts involved.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGt\">\n<em>******</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgqX\">\u201cBefore, therefore, a circuit court can be require to retain a cause under this jurisdiction, it must in some . form appear upon the record, by a statement of facts, \u2018in legal and logical form,\u2019 such as is required in good pleading, 1 Chit.Pl. 213, that the suit is one which <em>\u2018really and substantially involves a dispute or controversy\u2019 as to a right which depends upon the construction or effect of the Constitution, or some law or treaty of the United States.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">In Starin v. New York City, 115 U.S. 248, 6 S.Ct. 28, 29 L.Ed. 388 (1885) orders of the circuit court remanding a case which had been removed from a New York court, were appealed on the ground that the suit was one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">With respect to that contention the Court said (p. 257, 6 S.Ct. p. 31):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-14\">\u201cWe will first consider whether the suit is one which arises under the constitution or laws of the United States; for, if it is not, the order to remand was right * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-15\">\u201cThe character of a case is determined by the questions involved. Osborn v. Bank of U.

Such is the effect of the decisions on this subject.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">In affirming the circuit court\u2019s remand of the removed case, the Court further stated (p. 258, 6 S.Ct. p. 32) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-5\">\u201cThe decision of these questions [presented by the removed ease] does not depend on the constitution or laws of the United States. <em>There is nothing in the constitution or laws of the United States entering into the determination of the cause, which, if construed one way, will defeat the defendants, or, in another, sustain them.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">In Shulthis v. McDougal, 225 U.S. 561, 569, 32 S.Ct. 704, 706, 56 L.Ed. 1205 (1912) the Court, following its declaration that \u201cjurisdiction cannot rest on any ground that is not affirmatively and distinctly set forth\u201d in the complaint, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-7\">\u201cA suit to enforce a right which takes its origin in the laws of the United States <em>is not necessarily, or for that reason alone, one arising under those laivs, for a suit does not so arise unless it really and substantially involves a dispute or controversy respecting the validity, construction, or effect of such a law, upon the determination of which the result depends.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">In Gully v.

That is the basis for the decision in Sinclair, supra, and probably why the majority was careful to say that federal courts are barred from granting injunctions, under the 1947 Act [\u00a7 301 (a)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-16\"><em>\u201cIt places no such restriction on state courts.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-17\">In sum, we are of the view that Sinclair did no more than hold that, in an action under \u00a7 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, a <em>court of the United States, </em>because of the strictures of \u00a7 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act is without jurisdiction to enjoin a union\u2019s breach of the \u201cno-strike\u201d provisions of its collective bargaining agreement in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute; that the Norris-LaGuardia Act, enacted as it was under Congress\u2019 constitutionally granted power to regulate the jurisdiction of inferior federal courts, limits only the jurisdiction of such courts; that the Act did not preempt the field with respect to litigation of the type here involved; and Congress cannot constitutionally limit the remedial powers of state courts where it has not preempted the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">On the score of the statement that Congress clearly evidenced by the terms of the Norris-LaGuardia Act its intent to limit only jurisdiction of <em>a court of the United States, </em>it must be pointed out that in other legislation concerning jurisdiction Congress has manifested, by appropriate terms, its intent to extend its sweep to include state as well as federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-19\">For example, in \u00a7 204(d) of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 32, 50 U.S.C.A.App. \u00a7 924(d) it was provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-20\">\u201cExcept as provided in this section, <em>no court, </em>Federal, State, or Territorial, shall have jurisdiction or power to consider the validity of any \u25a0 such regulation * * *, or to stay, restrain, enjoin, or set aside * * any provision of this Act * * (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>Again, in \u00a7 1406 of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, 70 Stat. 574, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1406, in which immunity was granted to witnesses, it was provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-4\">\u201c * * * nor shall testimony so compelled be used as evidence in any criminal proceeding * * * against him in <em>any </em>court.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">The term <em>any court </em>was construed in Reina v. United States, 364 U.S. 507, 81 S.Ct. 260, 5 L.Ed.2d 249 (1960) to embrace state as well as federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">It is of high relevance here that in Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 12 S.Ct. 195, 35 L.Ed. 1110 (1892) it was held that the immunity provisions of \u00a7 860 of the Revised Statutes did not extend to the states because it provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-9\">\u201cNo pleading of a party, nor any discovery or evidence obtained from a party or witness by means of a judicial proceeding in this or any foreign country, shall be given in evidence, or in any manner used against him or his property or estate, in any court of the United States, in any criminal proceeding, or for the enforcement of any penalty or forfeiture:\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">The Court there held that <em>any court of of the United States </em>means only federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">To the foregoing this may be added:</p>\n<p id=\"Ay4\">Assuming arguendo that the cause of action in the instant case asserted an action under \u00a7 301(a), it is settled that a state court enforcing a federal right is not \u201cto be treated as a Federal court, deriving its authority not from the state creating it, but from the United States.\u201d Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Railroad Company v. Bombolis, 241 U.S. 211, 222, 36 S.Ct. 595, 598, 60 L.Ed. 961 (1916). It was there held that a state court enforcing rights under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act of April 22, 1908 could, under a state statute, accept a less than unanimous jury verdict even though a federal court could not have done so in a Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act suit: because of the requirement of the 7th\u00a1 Amendment that a jury\u2019s verdict must be-unanimous. In so holding the Court pointed out that the 7th Amendment by its terms related only to <em>\u201cany Court of the United States\u201d </em>and accordingly was. \u201cnot concerned with state action, and\u2019. deal[s] only with Federal action.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b928-13\">Further, if it is now \u201cfederal law\u201d, as-Judge Hastie thinks it is, that state-courts cannot issue injunctions of the-type here involved, this court cannot assume that the Pennsylvania court will? act without regard to the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-14\">The question of limitation of state-court jurisdiction here is appropriately one for the decision of the Pennsylvania, court and can be presented and determined there, subject, of course, to the-ultimate reviewing power of the Supreme Court of the United States. Kohn v. Central Distributing Co., 306 U.S. 531, 534,. 59 S.Ct. 689, 83 L.Ed. 965 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-15\">In H. J. Heinz Co. v. Owens, 189 F.2d 505 (9 Cir. 1951), where it was held that, the district court had correctly dismissed! a complaint, which sought a declaratory judgment that a patent was either invalid! or not infringed and that a state court, decree to the contrary, and its pending enforcement, \u201cconstituted an unlawful encroachment on federal jurisdiction-under the [federal] patent laws,\u201d our brother Hastie, there speaking for the Court, said (p. 509):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6k\">\u201c * * * the entire matter is now before the state court in the proceedings which are now pending. Decision upon that court\u2019s power will be explicit or necessarily implied in whatever it may do.

McCarroll, in holding that the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, which deprive a <em>court of the United States </em>of jurisdiction to issue an injunction to restrain a breach of a collective bargaining agreement, in a case arising out of a labor dispute, are not applicable to state courts, said (315 P.2d p. 332):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-14\">\u201cThe Norris-LaGuardia Act is in terms drawn as a limitation on the courts of the United States. \u2018No court of the United States,\u2019 declares section 1, \u2018shall have jurisdiction to issue any * * * injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute * * *,\u2019 and a court of the United States is defined in section 13(d) as \u2018any court of the United States whose jurisdiction has been or may be conferred or defined or limited by Act of Congress, including the courts of the District of Columbia.\u2019 29 U.S.C.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 101, 113(d). The statute aimed to restrict the federal equity power, and was justified constitutionally on the basis of Congress\u2019 power to regulate the jurisdiction of the federal courts. * * * It did not limit the remedial power of the state courts * * * and could not constitutionally have done so since its prohibition was not restricted to injunctions in labor disputes affecting interstate commerce or any other subject over which Congress has paramount power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-8\">\u201cSection 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act does not embody any policy that requires a state court enforcing rights created by that section to withhold injunctive relief. The principal purpose of section 301 was to facilitate the enforcement of coEective bargaining agreements by making unions suable as entities in the federal courts, and thereby to remedy the one-sided character of existing labor legislation. * * * We would give altogether too ironic a twist to this purpose if we held that the actual effect of the legislation was to abolish in state courts equitable remedies that had been available, and leave an employer in a worse position in respect to the effective enforcement of his contract than ho was before the enactment of section 301.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-10\">\u201cNothing in the nature of the rights created by section 301 requires that injunctive relief be denied in their enforcement. Such relief would of course not impair any federal contract right, nor would it expand it in conflict with any policy that we have been able to discern in the statute. To the contrary, the principal purpose of the statute is to encourage the formation and effective enforcement of collective bargaining agreements. See Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Alabama, 77 S.Ct. 912. The restriction on the remedies available in the federal courts arises not from any poEcy in the Labor Management Relations Act itself but from the Norris-LaGuardia Act, and the poEcy of that statute as we have seen is confined to the federal courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">In Philadelphia Marine Trade Association the court held that neither the Labor Management Relations Act nor the Norris-LaGuardia Act deprives state eourts of equity of their traditional power to require performance of contractual obligations by the process of injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">In General Building Contractors\u2019 Association it was earEer held that neither \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act nor the Norris-LaGuardia Act deprived the state courts of jurisdiction to issue an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">In so doing the court said with respect to the Norris-LaGuardia Act at page 80 of 370 Pa., at page 254 of 87 A.2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-16\">\u201cNor is the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 101, of any benefit to-appellants.

That assumption is stated in the first sentence of the majority opinion and repeated thereafter. In my view, it has led the \u25a0court into error.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">The majority opinion begins by characterizing this action as \u201ca suit based solely on a state-created right, to enjoin the defendant union\u2019s violation, in the course of a labor dispute, of the \u2018no-strike\u2019 provision of its collective bargaining agreement * * My fundamental disagreement is with the characterization of this as \u201ca suit, based solely on a state-created right\u201d. I think that Local 174, Teamsters, etc. v. Lucas Flour Co., 1962, 369 U.S. 95, 82 S.Ct. 571, 7 L.Ed.2d 593, makes federal labor law which, by force of section 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, has superseded local law, the sole basis and exclusive determinant of rights such as are asserted here between labor and management under a collective bargaining contract in an industry affecting commerce. While Charles Dowd Box Co., Inc. v. Courtney, 1962, 368 U.S. 502, 82 S.Ct. 819, 7 L.Ed.2d 483, held that a state court may entertain such a suit as this, that case implied and Local 174, Teamsters, etc. v. Lucas Flour Co., supra, thereafter squarely held that the action in whatever forum contested, arises out of and is controlled by federal labor law. The majority opinion here misconstrues the Dowd case as sanctioning an application of state law. But Dowd does no more than approve litigation in a state forum where federal law must be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">The federal labor law which governs such cases as this is emerging and achieving fromulation from ease to case. In Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, 1962, 370 U.S. 195, 82 S.Ct. 1328, 8 L.Ed. 2d 440, the Supreme Court considered whether federal labor law permits the enjoining of a strike called in violation of a collective bargaining agreement containing a no-strike clause. The Court decided that section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act and section 4 of the Norris-La Guardia Act, considered together, require the conclusion that federal labor law does not permit such an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">The present case is indistinguishable from the Sinclair Refining case, except for the fact that one was filed in a federal district court and the other in a state court. But Local 174, Teamsters, etc. v. Lucas Flour Co., supra, teaches that in this area federal labor law is controlling in either forum. And in the Dowd opinion, 368 U.S. at 506, 82 S.Ct. at 522, the Court quoted with approval the language of Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills, 1957, 353 U.S. 448, 457, 77 S.Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972, that \u201cstate law, if compatible with the purpose of \u00a7 301, may be resorted to in order to find the rule that will best effectuate the federal policy\u201d, but \u201c[a]ny state lav/ applied * * * will be absorbed as federal law * * When this conception is applied to the present problem, we find that any state law authorizing the enforcement of a no-strike clause by injunction is incompatible with and, therefore, cannot be absorbed in federal labor law. For the Sinclair Refining case has decided that the Norris-La Guardia Act restriction upon the enjoining of peaceful strikes is a definitive part of the federal labor policy which section 301 requires courts to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">The foregoing analysis can be avoided only by arguing that a state \u201cremedy\u201d by way of injunction is sufficiently distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>from and consistent with the federal contract \u201cright\u201d which it would redress so that controlling federal policy would not be offended by state injunctive relief. But the argument that federal labor policy under section 301 would be well served by and, therefore, should sanction the enjoining of violations of no-strike clauses, was fully and clearly stated in the dissenting opinion in Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, 370 U.S. at 215, 82 S.Ct. 1328. This argument did not persuade the majority of the Court. I do not see how controlling federal labor policy could have been less offended if the Sinclair Refining injunction had been sought in a state court rather than a federal court. I conclude, therefore, that neither a state court nor a federal court may grant injunctive relief in such a case as this. See Aaron, Strikes in Breach of Collective Agreements, Some Unanswered Questions, 1963, 63 Colum.L. Rev. 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The foregoing conclusion is relevant to the principal issue presented by this appeal, whether this suit was removable from the state court to the federal district court. As a practical matter, if my analysis is correct, removability does not deprive the plaintiff of injunctive relief to which it would otherwise have been entitled, for federal labor law precludes such relief in any forum. Yet, it is this supposed deprivation which the majority characterize as an \u201cinjustice\u201d and seek to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">More technically, the right to remove, or the necessity for remand, depends upon whether this case is founded on a federal \u201cclaim or right\u201d and whether the action is one \u201cof which the district courts have original jurisdiction\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(b). This is a federal claim and cannot be anything else because Congress, by enacting section 301, caused federal labor law to supersede state law as the exclusive legal basis for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements in industries affecting commerce. Local 174, Teamsters, etc. v. Lucas Flour Co., supra; Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills, supra. Whether a district court would have had \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d of this action depends upon the sense in which the elusive concept of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d applies to the interdiction of injunctive relief which results from the mandate of the Norris-La Guardia Act. On this question, the authorities are shai'ply divided and the Supreme Court has not yet spoken. I am persuaded that the preclusion of injunctive relief or \u201cequity jurisdiction\u201d, by force of the Norris-La Guardia Act, is not an ouster of such \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d of the district court over the parties and the subject matter as the removal statute contemplates and, in this kind of case, section 301 creates. The classic exposition of this position by Professor Chafee is so familiar, clear and fully reasoned that anything more than a citation of his analysis would be supererogation. Chafee, Some Problems of Equity, 1950, ch. 8 and 9. Accord, S. E. Overton Co. v. International Brotherhood, W.D.Mich. 1953, 115 F.Supp. 764; Pocahontas Term. Corp. v. Portland Bldg. &amp; Construction Trade Council, D.Me.1950, 93 F.Supp. 217. The authorities which express a contrary view, and some which, properly understood, do not, are cited and discussed by the majority, but to me they are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Summarizing, I think the question of removability affects no substantive issue here because a state trial court, no less than a federal district court, would be bound to apply federal labor law and deny injunctive relief as was done in the Sinclair Refining case. However, the technical question of removability is in issue and must be decided. In my view, this action asserts a federal claim originally cognizable in a federal district court and, therefore, was removable and properly removed under section 1441(b) of Title 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
