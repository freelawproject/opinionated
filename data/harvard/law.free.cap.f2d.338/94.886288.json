The contract was awarded to plaintiff on April 13, 1950, and was terminated for default by the contracting officer on October 24, 1950, on the ground that plaintiff had so failed to make progess as to endanger performance of the contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-17\">The contract provided for <em>desired </em>delivery dates, the first being 120 days after date of the contract and continuing at intervals, the last being 381 to 410 days after the date of the contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The contract also provided for the furnishing by the government of a substantial amount of defendant-owned tooling and dies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the time the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>contract was awarded to plaintiff, this government-owned equipment was located at the plants of three government contractors who were producing for defendant the same type of tanks which\u2019 plaintiff was to supply. Under the contract, the tooling and dies were to be delivered by defendant to plaintiff at or near plaintiff\u2019s plant in Pine Meadows, Connecticut, for use in connection with the work to be performed. The contract did not specify any particular dates upon which delivery of the tooling and dies were to be made. However, it contained a clause which provided for an equitable adjustment under the \u201cChanges\u201d provision of the contract in case that the tanks could not be produced without the government-furnished material.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no dispute in this case that the tanks could not be produced without the government-furnished tools and dies and this fact was known by the plaintiff and defendant. As stated earlier, at the time the contract was awarded to the plaintiff, a vast majority of the necessary tooling was still in use by the various government contractors. Plaintiff was completely unaware of this, although this fact was known to defendant. It was not until July that the last of the necessary tooling was delivered to plaintiff \u2014 almost four months after the contract was entered into.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">In this case, plaintiff seeks to recover $76,496.11,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as compensation for the wrongful termination for default by defendant of its contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiff contends that its inability to perform the contract stems from the fact that defendant unduly delayed in delivering the government-owned tooling and dies to be used as government-furnished materials in connection with the work to be performed under the contract. Consequently, plaintiff, in effect, argues that since its inability to perform under the contract is due to causes beyond its control, the termination for default is to be converted pursuant to paragraph (g) of section 15 of the contract into a \u201cTermination at the Option of the Government\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, as such, it is entitled to recover what amounts to termination costs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendant, on the other hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>contends that even if there was an unreasonable delay on the part of the government (which it denies) plaintiff\u2019s failure to perform under the contract does not stem from the alleged delay but was attributable to its inability to obtain the necessary financing which in turn was due to its poor financial position. To this plaintiff replies that its inability to get the necessary financing was due to the worsening of its financial position occasioned by the government\u2019s failure to supply the necessary tooling, since during this period the plant was practically idle, resulting in unproductive overhead. Defendant has asserted a counterclaim to recover its excess costs incurred by reason of the repurchase of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">There are certain factors present in this case which clearly bring into focus the legal and factual questions which, we think, are controlling in this case. It is clear from the entire record that at the time defendant terminated plaintiff\u2019s right to proceed under the contract for default, plaintiff was not in a position to complete performance under the contract.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is also clear that plaintiff\u2019s inability to perform under the contract was ultimately due to its failure to obtain the necessary financing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, it is equally clear to us as plaintiff contends that defendant unreasonably delayed in delivering the government-furnished material without which plaintiff could not start production under the contract. In this respect we note that the government did not supply plaintiff with all of the necessary tooling until four months after the contract was awarded to plaintiff, although on repeated occasions plaintiff notified defendant that it needed prompt delivery of the tooling. Defendant knew or should have known that the necessary tooling would not be available within a reasonable time after the contract award, since this same tooling was still in use by the other government contractors. Furthermore, the defendant has not shown any outside intervening factor which prevented it from a prompt delivery. Under such circumstances, we think that defendant negligently failed to furnish the required materials in time so that plaintiff could economically perform the contract. This, we think, constitutes a breach on the part of the government of its obligation under section 25 of the contract. See Peter Kiewit &amp; Son Co., Inc. v. United States, 151 F.Supp. 726, 731, 138 Ct.Cl. 668, 674-675 (1957) and cases cited therein.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cf. Commerce International Co., Inc. v. United States, Ct.Cl., 338 F.2d 81, this day decided. The defendant cannot cure its breach here by the simple expedient of extending the time of delivery. William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship &amp; Engine Bldg. Co. v. United States, 41 Ct.Cl. 164 (1906) reversed on other grounds, 206 U.S. 118, 27 S.Ct. 676, 51 L.Ed. 983 (1907). Whether it constitutes a material breach converting the termination for default to one for con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>venienee, depends on whether or not plaintiff was ready, willing and able to perform the contract when the breach occurred. See Donnell-Zane Co. v. United States, 75 Ct.Cl. 368 (1932); Brundage v. United States, 66 Ct.Cl. 708 (1929). The answer to this, we think, depends on whether or not plaintiff could have obtained the necessary financing at the time the alleged breach occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"> The financial ability and capacity of a contractor to perform a government contract is generally a matter within his control and responsibility. Therefore, inadequate financial resources which lead to a default in performance of the contract do not generally excuse nonperformance and as a result the government is absolved of any liability under the contract. See McBride &amp; Wachtel, Government Contracts, \u00a7 36.20. However, financial ability to perform a government contract does not mean that the contractor must have on hand adequate cash to pay for the entire cost of performance. Nor can we requii'e the small government contractor to have at its disposal the same financial resources as the giant industrial institution. We think the contractor must have available at the time of the contract award reasonable financial resources in the light of business custom and practice either on hand or through its customary lines of credit, to finance the expected cost of production. See Appeal of West Coast Lumber Corp., ASBCA 1131, 6 C.C.F. 61477 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">At the time the contract was entered into plaintiff\u2019s financial position was weak. Without a very substantial loan, it would have been impossible for plaintiff to perform the contract in suit. Plaintiff was aware of this and during the months prior and subsequent to the awarding of the contract, plaintiff sought financial assistance from various lending institutions. Defendant was also aware of plaintiff\u2019s financial position and knowing this, nevertheless, awarded the contract to the plaintiff. The Bristol Bank and Trust Co., plaintiff\u2019s source of financing on prior occasions, stated, in a letter to the Navy, that it would arrange to make the necessary funds available to plaintiff. The Bank\u2019s vice-president, who also represented the Bank on plaintiff\u2019s board of directors, testified that the bank was ready to make the necessary funds available to plaintiff. He testified further that the bank declined to finance the instant contract because of the delays by defendant in delivering the tooling, causing plaintiff\u2019s plant to become and to remain virtually idle during this period which in turn aggravated plaintiff\u2019s already precarious financial position.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\"> Defendant would have us ignore this testimony. It argues that plaintiff\u2019s failure to obtain the necessary financing did not stem from the government delay but was attributable to plaintiff\u2019s poor financial position. Defendant in support of this contention has introduced into the record financial statements, of plaintiff showing that at the time the subject contract was awarded to plaintiff, it had a deficit of current assets over current liabilities.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">As stated earlier, there is no doubt that plaintiff\u2019s financial position was very strained. However, plaintiff has introduced testimony from a bank official that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>in spite of this the bank was willing to make the necessary funds available to plaintiff. There are certain factors in the record which seem to buttress this testimony. The bank officer, on cross-examination, indicated that the type of financing which was contemplated was based on the assignment of the government contract to the bank. He stated that in this type of security arrangement the bank looks more to the ability of the contractor to perform the contract, rather than the applicant\u2019s financial position. The record discloses that plaintiff\u2019s physical facilities were more than adequate to perform the contract. Defendant itself confirmed this on its preaward survey of plaintiff\u2019s plant. Moreover, immediately after the contract award, plaintiff enlarged and adapted its physical facilities to the expected government equipment. The bank official further testified that in determining the \u2022contractor\u2019s ability to perform the contract, the bank looked to see if the subject contract was adequately bonded. The record discloses that the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company furnished a $200,000 performance bond to defendant conditioned upon the faithful performance of the contractor. He indicated that this factor would counteract the detrimental effect of the deficit in plaintiff\u2019s financial position.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">It is apparent to us from the entire record that at the time of defendant\u2019s breach the bank was willing to make the necessary funds available to plaintiff in spite of the fact of plaintiff\u2019s strained financial position. Moreover, because of \"the nature of the security arrangement, the bank had to have assurances that the performance of the contract could be .started before it could enter into the loan arrangement. When defendant failed to deliver the necessary tooling on time, the bank declined to make the necessary funds available. This in turn caused plaintiff\u2019s default. Consequently, we must find that plaintiff\u2019s default was from causes beyond its control or negligence, and as a result the termination for default is to be converted into a \u201cTermination at the Option of the Government\u201d pursuant to paragraph (g) of section 15 of the contract. See Appeal of Facs .Products, Inc., ASBCA Nos. 3336 and 3601, 57-1 BCA 1215 (1957). Accordingly, judgment is entered for plaintiff in the amount of $76,496.11. Defendant\u2019s counterclaim is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\">. Lynch Brothers, Incorporated, a Connecticut Corporation, by amendment to its charter changed its name to Litchfield Manufacturing Corporation.

The Commissioner has found that in the performance of work up to the time of the termination for default, plaintiff had spent the sum of $76,496.11. This amount has been verified by defendant pursuant to pretrial procedures under Rules 28(b) (2) and 28(b) (3) and is not in dispute in this ease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\">.

We are not concerned here with the situation which confronted us in Klein v. United States, 285 F.2d 778, 152 Ct.Cl. 8 (1961), and Goldwasser v. United States, Ct.Cl., 325 F.2d 722, decided December 13, 1963. In those cases we allowed breach of contract damages where the contracting officer wrongfully terminated for defahlt government contracts which were <em>not </em>in default. Here plaintiff is seeking termination costs (no portion of the sum claimed includes a profit factor) on the grounds that although it was in default, its default was caused by defendant\u2019s actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b169-5\">. In reply to defendant\u2019s notice of intention to terminate for default plaintiff stated that \u201c[w]e must admit that we have failed to show sufficient progress to indicate that we will be able to maintain the delivery schedule.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b169-6\">. The decision of the bank not to finance the project forced plaintiff to ask for an arrangement under chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. Under such a situation plaintiff\u2019s matei-ialmen and subcontractors refused to deliver the material and subassemblies to plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\">. In the past we allowed recovery in the ICiewit line of eases based on an implied obligation on the part of the government not to willfully or negligently interfere witb tbe contractor in the performance of his contract. In allowing breach of contract damages, we required plaintiff to show negligent or willful conduct on the part of defendant in failing to promptly make available government-furnished materials. In those cases, the \u201cgovernment-furnished material\u201d clause did not contain a provision for an equitable adjustment in the event of a government delay. Since in this ease we find that there was a breach on the part of the government under the test postulated in Kiewit, we do not go into the effect of the \u201cequitable adjustment\u201d provision in a situation where the contractor fails to prove negligent conduct on the part of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">. Our Trial Commissioner has found that, nevertheless, the bank was willing to make the necessary funds available to plaintiff. This factual determination by our Trial Commissioner who had the opportunity to judge the credibility of the witness shall be presumed to be correct (Rule 48, now Rule 66) unless defendant makes a strong affirmative showing to the contrary. Here plaintiff has introduced specific testimony of a witness which supports the recommended finding. Defendant has countered with a theoretical argument in support of its position that the bank would not have made the necessary funds available because of plaintiff\u2019s poor financial position. Under these circumstances, we must accept the trier\u2019s evaluation. Davis v. United States, Ct.Cl. No. 179-50, decided February 14, 1964, slip op. pp. 4-5; Commerce International Co., Inc. v.
