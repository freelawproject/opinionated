Two counts of the indictment, charging sales of narcotics, were attacked on the ground that the identity of the purchaser was not shown. The district court rejected this contention and we are in agreement with its view. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>While it has been held that an indictment so drawn is defective<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the majority and, we think, the better rule<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">None of the other specifications of error were preserved for review on appeal although the appellant was represented at the trial by counsel of his own selection.

The judgment and sentence of the district court are</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-15\">. Lauer v.
