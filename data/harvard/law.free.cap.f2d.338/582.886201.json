Defendants appeal from the judgments of conviction and the penalties imposed. They raise two issues on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-20\"> Defendants Cefalu and Librizzi charge prejudicial error arising from a denial of their pre-trial motion to dismiss the indictment because of their appearance as witnesses before the grand jury which subsequently indicted them and defendant Palmisano.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-21\">It appears from their affidavits filed in support of their motion to dismiss and from the record that on March 6, 1962 they were ordered to appear before the Captain in charge of vice of the Milwaukee Police Department at 9:00 a. m.; they did so appear and were told to wait there; they waited until 11:15 a. m., at which time they were served with a subpoena to appear before a grand jury which had been called for the purpose of investigating gambling activities in the Eastern District of Wisconsin.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-22\">Cefalu and Librizzi appeared at the grand jury room and were called about 5:00 p. m. that day. They were represented by counsel. When they appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>before the grand jury, they were each advised of their constitutional right to refuse to answer any question that might tend to incriminate them. Each defendant claimed his rights under the Fifth Amendment and, except to state his name, address, occupation and where he attended school, refused to testify before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">On March 21, 1962, Special Agent Cur-ran of the Federal Bureau of Investigation filed a sworn complaint before a United States Commissioner charging all three defendants with violations of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7262, supra. Warrants were issued. They were arrested the next day and released on bail. On March 30, 1962, they were granted a reduction of bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">On March 30, 1962, the grand jury returned the instant indictment against the three defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Following a hearing on December 21 and 26, 1962, the motion to dismiss filed by Cefalu and Librizzi was denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Defendants assert (in their affidavits) that they have reason to believe that on the same day they were subpoenaed to appear before the jury that other witnesses appeared and gave testimony concerning alleged gambling activities of defendants. They contend that the ultimate constitutional question is whether at the time of their compelled attendance they were <em>probable </em>defendants or merely <em>potential </em>defendants, citing United States v. Keenan, 7 Cir., 267 F.2d 118 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">Under the circumstances present in the instant case, we deem this distinction, however it might be resolved, to be unimportant. Defendants were represented by counsel. They were admonished concerning their constitutional rights. They elected to invoke the privilege and refused to testify. They exercised the \u201coption of refusal\u201d guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and gave no testimony concerning the subject under inquiry or related to the subsequent indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">We find no authority to support defendants\u2019 claim that their compelled appearance before the grand jury, under the particular circumstances present here, was violative of Fifth Amendment rights requiring a dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">There is overwhelming authority to the contrary. The underlying rationale of these authorities is that the privilege accorded one called before a grand jury is the election to refuse to give testimony which might tend to show he had committed a crime. It is not designed to effect a prohibition against inquiry by an investigative body.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">We hold that the district court did not err in denying defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">The second issue raised by defendants is whether, in view of the enactment of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1952 and 1953,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the registration and occupational tax provisions of the tax on wagers, supra, compel the disclosure of incriminating information and are thus violative of the privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">We feel our recent decision in United States v. Zizzo, 7 Cir., 338 F.2d 577 (October 19, 1964) to be dispositive of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In Zizzo, one defendant registered as required by 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4412. The registration was admitted in evidence and defendants were convicted of violations of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1952 and 1953. Defendants argued there that since they were required by law to register, the use of this registration as evidence violated the privilege against self-incrimination. Judge Duffy, speaking for the court, in rejecting this argument quoted from Lewis v. United States, 348 U.S. 419, 422, 75 S.Ct. 415, 99 L.Ed. 475 (1955) as follows : \u201c \u2018If petitioner desires to engage in an unlawful business, he does so only on his own volition. The fact that ht may elect to pay the tax and make the prescribed disclosures required by the Act is a matter of his choice. There is nothing compulsory about it, and, consequently, there is nothing violative of the Fifth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Zizzo, supra, 338 F.2d at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Section 1952 prohibits travel in interstate commerce with the intent to, <em>inter alia, </em>promote gambling and thereafter performing or attempting to perform an act to promote gambling.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">Defendants in the instant case attempt to distinguish Zizzo and Lewis on the ground that the very act of registration is performing an act to promote gambling. Defendants cite Communist Party of United States v. United States, D.C. Cir., 331 F.2d 807 (1964) in support of this proposition<em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">Defendants contend that if they have traveled in interstate commerce with the intent to promote gambling and thereafter register pursuant to 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4412, the act of registering is an act which completes the crime proscribed by Section 1952. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">The act of registering is merely a statement of future intent. It is not in itself an act, which promotes or otherwise facilitates gambling, within the meaning of Section 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">This case is unlike Communist Party, where \u201c \u2018the act of registering is necessarily incriminating whether or not any information other than the registrant\u2019s name is supplied * * *.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 813, quoting from Russell v. United States, 9 Cir., 306 F.2d 402, 410 n. 16 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-16\">We hold that the act of registering as required by 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4412 is not an incriminating act contemplated by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1952 and, based upon our holding in Zizzo, the act of registering does not violate the Fifth Amendment since the registrant may freely choose whether to subsequently engage in the unlawful activities proscribed by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-17\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-9\">. \u201c\u00a7 4401.
