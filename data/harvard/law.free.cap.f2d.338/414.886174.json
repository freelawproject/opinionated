Clerical employees at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">2. Mechanical employees performing' repair and maintenance work at the gins-during the dormant season when no ginning is in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">Judge Henley, who heard this case-without a jury, in a well-considered opinion reported at 234 F.Supp. 825, determined that \u00a7\u00a7 13(a) (10) and 13(a) (18) exemptions are based upon the activity of the employees with respect to whom the exemption is claimed, not upon the activities of the employer, and that the-, exemption granted by each of said sections is limited to those employees who were engaged in actual ginning operations during the period for which the exemption is claimed. The court held that clerical workers were not engaged in ginning at any time and that mechanical employees engaged in the repair and maintenance work about the gin plants during the off-season, when no ginning is done, were not engaged in ginning and hence such employees were not exempt from the operation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-18\">All questions raised upon this appeal are fully considered, discussed and correctly resolved in the trial court\u2019s opinion. The facts, the pertinent statutes,, the administrative interpretation, the-supporting authorities and the basis of decision are all well stated by Judge Henley in his opinion. We affirm upon the basis of such opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
