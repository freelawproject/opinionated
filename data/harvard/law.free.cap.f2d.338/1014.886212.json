United States District Court for the-Northern District of California dismissing without hearing appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and was-argued by counsel. The record shows-that at all times during appellant\u2019s state-trial and appeal he was represented by counsel, and that he participated as a. witness in the trial. On appeal the State-Supreme Court affirmed his conviction, People v. Atchley, 53 Cal.2d 160, 346 P.2d. 764 (1959), and thereafter certiorari was. granted by the United States Supreme-Court. After briefs were filed therein and oral argument was heard, the United States Supreme Court entered the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-22\">\u201cAfter hearing oral argument and fully examining the record, we conclude that the totality of circumstances as the record makes them manifest did not warrant bringing the case here. Accordingly, the writ is dismissed.\u201d Atchley v. California, 366 U.S. 207, 81 S.Ct. 1051, 6 L.Ed.2d 233 (1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-23\">We find no lack of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-24\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
