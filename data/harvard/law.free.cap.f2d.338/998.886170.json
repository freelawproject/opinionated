The Hearing Examiner concluded that she had not established that her mental and physical impairments, either singly or in combination, were of such severity as to preclude her from engaging in any substantial gainful activity during the effective time of her application. The Appeals Council denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-12\"> We are convinced from a careful study of the record that this conclusion rests on a sound basis, and that it is supported by substantial evidence. There the matter ends. Clinch v. Celebrezze, 5 Cir., 1964, 328 F.2d 778.</p>\n<p id=\"AMi\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
