Jurisdiction over Hoechst-Uhde was attempted by constructive service, delivery of a summons having been made under a state statute upon the Secretary of State of the State of Mississippi. Vulcan-Cincinnati filed a cross-claim against Hoechst-Uhde. The district court relied heavily on Mississippi Wood Preserving Co. v. Rothschild, 5th Cir. 1953, 201 F.2d 233, and decided that the activities of Hoechst-Uhde were not such as brought it within the Mississippi statute permitting the constructive service of process on any non-resident corporation not qualified to do business in Mississippi but \u201cwho shall do any business or perform any character of work or service in this state * * *.\u201d Code Miss.1942, \u00a7\u00a7 1437-1438. The opinion of the district court, reported at 224 F.Supp. 11, with which we are in agreement, sets forth the reasons for its action. See also Walker v. Savell, 5th Cir., 1964, 335 F.2d 536. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"A9h\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
