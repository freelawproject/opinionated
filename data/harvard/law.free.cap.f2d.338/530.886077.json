He asks reversal of his conviction on two grounds: (1) admission by the trial court of hearsay evidence from a policeman, and (2) disclosure in open court of the division of the jury during deliberation, followed by a coercive supplemental instruction to the jury. We reverse on the latter ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-23\">The Government\u2019s evidence showed that a wallet was picked from the pocket of a man on a crowded bus. A policeman was allowed to testify that a woman had told him she had seen the appellant with a wallet in his hand immediately after the victim\u2019s pocket was picked. The woman was also a Government witness, and in her testimony she affirmed the officer\u2019s hearsay. Pursuant to our prior opinions, we find no prejudicial error. Copes v. United States, 119 U.S.App.D.C.-,-F.2d-,-(No. 18,131, decided May 21, 1964), slip opinion p. 6; Baber v. United States, 116 U.S. App.D.C. 358, 324 F.2d 390 (1963); Harrod v. United States, 58 App.D.C. 254, 29 F.2d 454 (1928). See also 4 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) \u00a7 1130. For cases on both sides of this issue, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Annot., <em>Extrajudicial Identification, 71 </em>A.L.R.2d 449 (1960); see particularly <em>id. </em>at p. 485 n. 13 for collection of cases holding <em>contra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">It should be noted, however, that the danger of prejudice from hearsay testi'mony has not disappeared simply because some courts and text writers have found it admissible under some circumstances. In the ascertainment of truth, cross-examination remains the chosen instrument of the common law, and hearsay, particularly in support of, or partial replacement of, another witness\u2019 testimony, tends to undermine its effectiveness. In spite of the storied resourcefulness of trial lawyers, none has yet demonstrated an acceptable means for cross-examining hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The jury here, after five hours of deliberation, was unable to agree. Its foreman asked the trial judge two questions: \u201cIf the defendant is involved beyond a reasonable doubt, he is guilty?\u201d and \u201cCan the [two] alternate jurors replace the minority voters?\u201d The trial judge answered these questions in open court and then gave the jury his version of the so-called Allen<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charge. Shortly thereafter the jury returned to the courtroom with a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The jury\u2019s effort to replace its dissenting members made it unmistakably clear to the court, and to the public generally insofar as it was represented in the courtroom, that two jurors were hanging the jury. The pressure on this minority was further increased by the following colloquy between the court and the jury foreman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-15\">\u201cThe Court: * * * Now who is the foreman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-16\">\u201cThe Foreman: I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-17\">\u201cThe Court: Will you rise, please. Don\u2019t tell me how you stand, that is, which way, and don\u2019t tell me numerically how you stand, but is it a clear minority or are you more or less evenly divided ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-18\">\u201cThe Foreman: It\u2019s a clear minority, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-19\">\u201cThe Court: A clear minority?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-20\">\u201cThe Foreman: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-21\">\u201cThe Court: You may be seated. I think then that I will say this to you: * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-22\">Then, so that the \u201cclear minority\u201d would understand their duty as jurors, and over the objection <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of defense counsel, the following supplemental charge was addressed to them along with the rest of the jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-23\">\u201cThe object of the jury system is to secure unanimity by a comparison of views and discussion among the jurors themselves. It is by no means true that opinions of jurors may not be changed by conference in the jury room. Every juror should listen with deference to the arguments of the other jurors and with a distrust of his own judgment \u2014 or at least a questioning, which is a better way to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>put it \u2014 a questioning of his own judgment, if he finds that the majority of the jury take a different view of the case from that which he himself takes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">\u201cNo juror should go to the jury room with a blind determination that the verdict should represent his own opinion of the case at the moment; nor should he close his ears to the arguments of the other jurors who are equally as honest and intelligent as himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">\u201cYou should examine the issues submitted to you with an open mind and with candor and with proper regard and deference to the opinions of each other, and with a disposition to being convinced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u201cSince some jury will have to decide this case some time, and there is no reason to suppose that clearer or more convincing evidence, one way or the other, will ever be produced in addition to that which you have heard, and there is no reason to suppose that the questions of law will change or be more clearly defined, if much the larger number of jurors take one view of the matter, then the minority should question their own views since it is not in agreement with most of the others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">\u201cNevertheless, you are instructed that the verdict of the jury should represent the opinion \u2014 honest and candid opinion \u2014 of each individual juror. The verdict must be the conscientious verdict of each individual juror and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusion of his fellow jurors simply because the minority is outnumbered. But when you find yourselves in a distinct minority, you should, as I have said, question the soundness of your reason for being in the minority. Don\u2019t forsake it just because you want to agree, but do forsake it if you test it again and find it wanting in reason and in logic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">\u201cNow I will ask you to resume your deliberations and see if you can reach a conclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">A long time ago, in Burton v. United States, 196 U.S. 283, 307-308, 25 S.Ct. . 243, 250, 49 L.Ed. 482 (1905), with reference to the practice of inquiring into the division of the jury, the Supreme Court commented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">\u201cWe must say in addition, that a practice ought not to grow up of inquiring of a jury, when brought into court because unable to agree, how the jury is divided; not meaning by such question, how many stand for conviction or how many stand for acquittal, but meaning the proportion of the division, not which way the division may be. Such a practice is not to be commended, because we cannot see how it may be material for the court to understand the proportion of division of opinion among the jury. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">Some time later, in Brasfield v. United States, 272 U.S. 448, 450, 47 S.Ct. 135, 71 L.Ed. 345 (1926), the jury having failed to agree after some hours of deliberation and the trial court having inquired how it was divided, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-13\">\u201cWe deem it essential to the fair and impartial conduct of the trial, that the inquiry itelf should be regarded as ground for reversal. * * Such a practice, which is never useful and is generally harmful, is not to be sanctioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-14\">\u201cThe failure of petitioners\u2019 counsel to particularize an exception to the court\u2019s inquiry does not preclude this Court from correcting the error, x x <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-15\">It is true that in <em>Brasfield </em>the trial court asked, and was advised, how the jury was divided numerically. Here the jury\u2019s question disclosed the numerical division and, under the circumstances, the trial court\u2019s repeated reference to the \u201cclear minority\u201d on the jury was at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>as coercive as the colloquy condemned in <em>Brasfield.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">After the two dissenting jurors in this case had been rebuked by their fellow jurors, who proposed that they be discharged from the jury, they were then told by the judge, among other things, that \u201c[n]o juror should go to the jury room with a blind determination that the verdict should represent his own opinion,\u201d and that \u201cwhen you find yourselves in a distinct minority, you should, as I have said, question the soundness of your reason for being in the minority.\u201d In this setting, it was not surprising that the jury returned to the courtroom shortly with a unanimous verdict of guilty. It would indeed take a strong-willed jur- or to maintain his position under this -type of pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Whatever may be said for the continuing validity <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the often criticized <em>Allen </em>charge, even in its pristine formulation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> unquestionably the supplemental charge given to these two dissenting jurors is impermissible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is nothing in the <em>Allen </em>charge<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which tells a juror that he should not go \u201cto the jury room with a blind determination that the verdict should represent his own opinion.\u201d Nor is there any \u201clegal rule that the majority of jurors have better judgment than the minority.\u201d Green v. United States, <em>supra </em>Note 1, 309 F.2d at 855. Indeed, a mistrial is as much a part of the jury system .as a unanimous verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">In view of the possibly coercive effect on the jury of the supplemental charge given in these circumstances, appellant\u2019s conviction may not stand.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APE\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">WILBUR K.

The colloquy concerning this objection between the trial court and defense counsel follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">The Court: * * * Now, since they refer specifically to a minority, I think I\u2019d better give them my own version of the \u2018Allen\u2019 charge, which will probably sink you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-l\">\u201cMr. Nelson: It would sink me. You see, if you answered their question and let them deliberate for a little while \u25a0 \u2014 I don\u2019t like the Allen charge, particularly in this instance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATis\">\u201cTins Court : I have known it to work both ways, though usually it works for the Government. But there ought to be a verdict in this case. There\u2019s no sense in trying this again. I think I will answer these two questions and then I\u2019ll give them the \u2018Allen\u2019 charge.
