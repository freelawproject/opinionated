Petitioners, hereafter taxpayers, are scientists who received during the tax years payments from a nonprofit organization, The Institute for Muscle Research, Inc., hereafter Institute. Throughout the periods in question taxpayers were engaged in research, at the Institute\u2019s laboratory in Woods. Hole, Massachusetts. They were paid,, monthly, what the Institute termed \u201cawards.\u201d While taxpayers were undoubtedly chosen initially on the basis, of their experience and achievements, their selection was not based upon any formal competition, or as a result of any contest. Their research activity at the-laboratory was required to be, according to the undisputed testimony of the Institute\u2019s director of research, \u201csomething-which contributed to our common ideas.\u201d If it did contribute, the \u201cawards\u201d might, continue indefinitely. On the other hand if performance failed to live up to the director's \u201cexpectations,\u201d or if a taxpayer chose to work elsewhere, his \u201caward\u201d terminated forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-15\">The Tax Court held that the-payments received from the Institute were not tax exempt within 1954 I.R.C. \u00a7 74 because it found that they were conditioned on the \u201crendering of] substantial future services.\u201d Sec. 74(b) (2). This finding was warranted. The court was not obliged to take at its face value taxpayers\u2019 claim that they were not rendering services to the Institute, but were simply engaged in research that would benefit, as one of them put it, \u201cmankind.\u201d Obviously within the meaning of this statute, cf. Robertson v. United States, 1952, 343 U.S. 711, 72 S.Ct. 994, 96 L.Ed. 1237, it could benefit both. It is equally clear that taxpayers could be found to be receiving wages for work currently performed as distinguished from a true award, prize or gift for past performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-16\">We have reviewed taxpayers\u2019 procedural and evidentiary questions and do not find them to call for discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-17\">Judgment will be entered affirming the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
