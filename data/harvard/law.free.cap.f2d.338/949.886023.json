(Finding 6, Tr. p. 58.)-Appellant sells at retail metal trophies usually given at horse shows or amateur-rodeos as prizes. Appellees manufacture- and sell such trophies wholesale. The cowboy trophy figurine was created byappellees at appellant\u2019s request to portray a cowboy figure holding a non-existent, horse\u2019s rein. The trial court held (1) there had been no infringement of the-copyright; (2) such similarity as exists-between the orginal figure, manufactured' for appellant by appellees, and appellees\u201d subsequently produced figure, \u201cis merely the result of identity of a cowboy figure* as commonly depicted;\u201d (Finding 7, Tr. p. 58) and (3) \u201cthe minimal requirements of the law of copyright to show deliberate copying have not been shown to&gt; exist in this case.\u201d (Finding 8, Tr. p.. 58.) These three findings were made-following the court\u2019s written decision to-the same effect (Tr. p. 56) and are each: alleged to be error on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-25\">Jurisdiction existed below pursuant to-17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a) and (b), and exists with this court on-this appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-26\">Appellant is the owner and holder of a Certificate of Copyright Registration, No. Gp 36,325, issued January 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>1963, on a cowboy trophy figurine. (Appellant\u2019s Ex. D.) The trial court so found (Finding 4, Tr. p. 58). But the trial court did not pass upon the validity of the copyright. Though challenged by appellees below, it was unnecessary to rule on the validity of the copyright, in view of the court\u2019s finding there was no infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Appellant urges upon us that \u201ccasual observation of the respective figures * * * reveals a highly significant similarity\u201d; that \u201cthe figures are identical in all essential features\u201d; and hence \u201cthat the accused figure infringes the \u25a0copyrighted figure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">\u201cA Chinese copy\u201d is not required, says appellant, citing Contemporary Arts, Inc. v. F. W. Woolworth Co., 193 F.2d 162 (2d Cir. 1950), affirmed 344 U.S. 228, 73 S.Ct. 222, 97 L.Ed. 276. We agree. We also agree that \u201c[T]he question of infringement is dependent upon the question whether the ordinary reasonable person would fail to differentiate between the two works or would consider them dissimilar by reasonable observation,\u201d although we fail to find such language (so quoted in appellant\u2019s brief) contained in Hein v. Harris, 175 F. 875 (2d Cir. 1910) (erroneously cited as 177 F. in such brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">But an ordinary reasonable person, here represented in the person of the trial judge,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has ruled the two figures are \u201csimilar in some respects,\u201d (Finding 5, p. 58), but that they are not \u201cthe same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">This finding is a finding of fact. Hirsch v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 17 F.Supp. 816 (S.D. Cal.1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">In coming to his conclusion the trial judge is supported in the record by the testimony (a) of the appellees\u2019 president, Ernest O\u2019Brien, as to eleven specific differences in the two figures (Tr. pp\u201e 79-82); (b) by the testimony of Kyle (Tr. p. 110); (c) the testimony of Kemp (Tr. p. 138); (d) the testimony of Duncan (Tr. p. 146). Appellant\u2019s position is supported only by his suggestion that a look at the two figurines reveals their identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\"> Our only problem is to determine if the trial court\u2019s conclusion on this question of fact was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Nimmer on Copyright, \u00a7 140, p. 606. We have commented frequently on the inappropriateness of substituting our judgment for that of the trial judge on questions of fact. The more vague the test, the less inclined are we to intervene. Caddy-Imler Creations, Inc. v. Caddy, 299 F.2d 79 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">And we note from our own observation that there is at least one striking dissimilarity between the two figures: the angle of extension of the right arm from the body. We cannot hold the trial court\u2019s findings claimed to be errors 1 and 2 were \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">Appellant urges the court\u2019s finding that there was no deliberate copying by appellees of his cowboy figurine is \u201cunrealistic,\u201d because access was proved. Access is important, and should be given due weight by the trier of fact, but is not decisive. To make proof of access the one controlling factor would eliminate the necessity for proof of any real identity or similarity. \u201cNoteworthy\u201d similarity must still be found. Bradbury v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 287 F.2d 478 (9th Cir. 1961). Here it was not. And, of course, originality is essential. Here it was disputed, but no finding was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-14\">Appellant raises questions as to originality, unfair competition, statutory notice, measure of damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees. None of these matters are properly before us. The court found no unfair competition (Finding 8, Tr. p. 56), and his finding is not alleged as error. Originality and statutory notice of eopyight go to the question of validity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>which was not passed upon in the court below, as it was unnecessary. Attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and damages simply are not in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1023-15\">.

Zunino-Altman, Inc., 203 F.Supp. 649 (S.D.N.Y.1962), aff\u2019d per curiam 301 F.2d 286 (2d Cir. 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
