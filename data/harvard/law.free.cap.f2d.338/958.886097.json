These pror visions, among other things, prohibit strikes or threats of strikes against any person to require him \u201cto cease doing business with any other person.\u201d Respondent disputes the findings as not based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-20\">The original complaint was filed by a subcontractor, The Berti Company, to which a general contractor, the Malan Construction Company, had assigned the erecting of nailable metal studs on a Cleveland construction job involving building a Veterans\u2019 Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-21\">The Berti Company employed members of the Wood, Wire <em>&amp; </em>Metal Lathers International Union on the Cleveland job and the respondent Carpenters\u2019 Union claimed the work on the studs referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-22\">After submission of this dispute to the National Joint Board for Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes, a decision favorable to respondent Carpenters\u2019 Union resulted. Berti, however, refused to be bound by the award and continued to employ members of the Lathers\u2019 Union on the disputed work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-23\">Respondent\u2019s steward talked to the job stewards of other trades\u2019 employees on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>the project, describing the dispute, his fellow union members\u2019 dissatisfaction and in one case enlisting help. Respondent\u2019s business agent also talked to the prime contractor stating that respondent\u2019s members would probably walk off the job unless Berti gave the stud work to the carpenters. On Berti\u2019s refusal, a strike of two-day duration occurred involving all of the carpenters on the job and involving picketing of the main entrances of the building site with signs which stated \u201cOn Strike. This Contractor Unfair to Carpenters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">Respondent Union, while contending with vigor that it was entitled to the work involved, argued also that the strike was a \u201cwildcat strike\u201d on the part of the individual carpenters concerned and that the Union was in no way organizationally responsible for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">After a hearing before a trial examiner, the NLRB entered its Decision and Order which included this basic finding of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-7\">\u201c* * * [W]e find that Respondents are responsible for the picketing on June 29 and thereafter, and that such picketing, with an object of forcing Malan, Ceco, Irsay, Doan, and other employers engaged in the project to cease doing business with Berti, was (1) inducement and encouragement of employees of these employers; and (2) restraint and coercion of the employers themselves, in violation of Section 8(b) (4) (i) and (ii) (B) of the Act. * * * \u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">The finding of facts in relation to such an issue (herein a secondary boycott) is peculiarly the function of the National Labor Relations Board. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">This court\u2019s review of NLRB findings is limited to determining whether or not on the whole record we can say that there is no substantial evidence to support the findings. N. L. R. B. v. Universal Camera Corp., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). The merits of the Carpenters\u2019 Union primary dispute with The Berti Company are argued with vigor by respondent. The statute does not, however, permit either the Board or this court to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">On consideration of this record, particularly those portions which deal with the strike and with the activities and statements of respondent\u2019s business agent, Welo, and steward, Burstein, and the testimony of Malan\u2019s project manager, Wagers, we are unable to say that \u201cno substantial evidence\u201d supports the findings of fact of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">Accordingly, a decree will issue enforcing the order of the National Labor Relations Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1030-24\">. Title 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b) (4) (i) and (ii) (B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
