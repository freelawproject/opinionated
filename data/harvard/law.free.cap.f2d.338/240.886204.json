The material provisions of both policies are identical. It is conceded that the policies are in force, that they covered plaintiff\u2019s bowling establishment which was de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>stroyed by fire on July 14, 1962, and that each insurer is liable for one-half of the business interruption loss covered by their policy. The controversy is with respect to the scope of the coverage provided by the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s landlord, pursuant to provisions of the lease, cancelled the lease after the fire. It is stipulated that the building could have been repaired or replaced by November 11, 1962. It is conceded that the policies provide for business interruption for the period from July 15 to November 11, 1962. It is established that plaintiff\u2019s net earnings from the operation of his business for said period, aside from the losses by reason of league bowling for the remainder of the season, amounted to $8,094.80. Judgment was entered based upon damages in such amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">It is plaintiff\u2019s contention on this appeal that he sustained an actual loss of $19,266.24 above the amount for which judgment was entered, which additional damages were caused by his loss of earnings from league bowling for the entire 1962-63 season. In support thereof, plaintiff has produced accountants\u2019 figures and projections based upon past earnings covering the period from November 11, 1962, to April 30, 1963, the end of the league bowling season.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The basic facts are undisputed. Prior to the fire, plaintiff operated a twenty-lane bowling alley in Bettendorf, Iowa. In conjunction therewith, he operated a bar, a restaurant and a shop where bowling equipment was sold. Plaintiff\u2019s trade consisted of open bowling and league bowling. Open bowling is casual or walk-in bowling. League bowling provides the paramount source of revenue for plaintiff\u2019s alleys as well as for bowling alleys in general. League bowling is highly organized. A league is a group of four or more teams of bowlers, each team ordinarily consisting of five members. During a league season which commences in early September and extends to the end of April, a league will bowl weekly as a unit, each of the teams bowling a three game series with another team in the league, such competition rotating within the league on a round robin basis. Throughout the season the same time each week, upon the same alley, is reserved for the league on a seasonal basis. The leagues are charged $1.35 per member for three games played each night and payment is made for each member of a participating team, including members absent and not bowling. About two and one-fourth hours is required for two teams to complete a three game series. Payment for league bowling is made during the bowling or immediately thereafter on a cash basis, usually by the team captains or by a league official. The rate charged per line for league bowling is the same as that, charged for open bowling.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">At the close of each bowling season, each league holds a meeting and among other things usually arranges with a bowling alley proprietor for its activities, for the next season. Such arrangements, are oral but are specific with respect to the day, hour and lanes reserved for each week. In Rogers\u2019 case, all teams using his facilities in 1961-62 had made arrangements prior to the fire to use his. alleys for the 1962-63 season, which pretty well used up his available capacity. Commitments are usually honored for the entire season. Shifts from one bowling alley to another during a season-are seldom made.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Rogers contends that because of the fire he was unable to reopen in time for the commencement of the league season in September and by reason thereof he lost league bowling for the entire 1962-63 season. The trial court agreed, stating : \u201cThe plaintiff in this case has without question shown that league bowling constituted a substantial portion of his. business and in addition created luncheon and bar business. It has also been shown that because the rebuilding of the leased premises would not have been completed' until November 11, 1962, the contemplated 1962-1963 league bowling business, was lost.\u201d The court then properly goes, on to state: \u201cHowever, the issue in this case is not whether plaintiff suffered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>seasonal loss, but whether he suffered a loss insured against by the terms of the policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">As grounds for reversal, the plaintiff urges:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">1. The court erred in holding that only a portion of appellant\u2019s actual loss was sustained prior to the November 11, 1962, repair date.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">2. The court erred in failing to give any consideration to the rules relating to the construction of insurance contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Plaintiff complains that the court erred in not considering the well-established rules of construction requiring insurance contracts to be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer, and the further rule that where ambiguity exists, parol evidence may be admitted to ascertain the true intention of the parties. It is firmly established in Iowa and elsewhere that, such well-established rules do not come into play unless the contract is ambiguous. Iowa Nat\u2019l Mut. Ins. Co. v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. of New York, Iowa, 128 N.W. 2d 891; Randolph v. Firemen\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., Iowa, 124 N.W.2d 528; O\u2019Neil v. Glens Falls Ind. Co., 8 Cir., 310 F.2d 165, 167; Roth v. Western Assur. Co., 8 Cir., 308 F.2d 771, 774; see Annot. 83 A.L.R.2d 885, 896, 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">In the Randolph case, the Iowa court found the policy unambiguous and reversed judgment for the insured. In response to the argument that the policy should be liberally construed in favor of the insured and that parol evidence should be admitted to ascertain the true meaning of the contract, the court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">\u201cNeither of these rules can be in real dispute, and citation of authorities would be a waste of time and paper. But neither of them comes into play unless it may fairly be said there is a real ambiguity in the terms of the policy.\u201d 124 N.W.2d 528, 529.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">In our present case, the court specifically determined that the language of the contracts was not ambiguous and hence it was unnecessary to resort to rules of construction applicable to ambiguous insurance contracts. We do not understand that plaintiff disputes the foregoing legal principles. Plaintiff seeks relief upon the basis that the court\u2019s determination that there is no ambiguity is erroneous. We fully agree with the trial court that the policies are free of ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">The material policy provisions bearing upon coverage read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-13\">\u201c2. In the event of such damage or destruction this Company shall be liable for the ACTUAL LOSS SUSTAINED by the Insured resulting directly from such interruption of business, but not exceeding the reduction in Gross Earnings less charges and expenses which do not necessarily continue during the interruption of business, for only such length of time as would be required with the exercise of due diligence and dispatch to rebuild, repair or replace such part of the property herein described as has been damaged or destroyed, commencing with the date of such damage or destruction and not limited by the date of expiration of this policy. Due consideration shall be given to the continuation of normal charges and expenses, including payroll expense, to the extent necessary to resume operations of the Insured with the same quality of service which existed immediately preceding the loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-14\">\u201c5. Gross Earnings: For the purpose of this insurance \u2018Gross Earnings\u2019 are defined as the sum of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-16\">(a) Total net sales, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-17\">(b) Other earnings derived from operations of the business,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-18\">less the cost of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-19\">(c) Merchandise sold, including packaging material therefor,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-20\">(d) Materials and supplies consumed directly in supplying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>service (s) sold by the Insured, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">(e) Service(s) purchased from outsiders (not employees of the Insured) for resale which do not continue under contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">No other costs shall be deducted in determining Gross Earnings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">In determining Gross Earnings due consideration shall be given to the experience of the business before the date of damage or destruction and the probable experience thereafter had no loss occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">\u201c8. Special Exclusions: This Company shall not be liable for any increase of loss which may be occasioned by any local or state ordinance or law regulating construction or repair of buildings or structures, nor by the suspension, lapse or cancellation of any lease or license, contract or order, nor for any increase of loss due to interference at the described premises by strikers or other persons with rebuilding, repairing or replacing the property or with the resumption or continuation of business; nor shall this Company be liable for any other consequential loss or remote loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The trial court, in holding that the additional sums plaintiff here seeks to recover are not within the insurance coverage, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">\u201cThe policies provide that the companies are liable \u2018for the actual Loss Sustained * * * for only such length of time as would be required * * * to rebuild * * * the property.\u2019 This provision fixes the period of time for which an insured can recover and prevents recovery of earnings which would have been lost after the business could have been reopened. The Court finds that plaintiff\u2019s recoverable loss of gross earnings is $8,094.80. This figure represents the gross earnings lost from all divisions of plaintiff\u2019s business from July 14, 1962 to November 11, 1962, including the loss of league bowling and incidental sales during such period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-14\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s recovery must be restricted to the loss of income that would have been earned during the reconstruction period, even though there may have been a substantial additional, but uninsured, loss consisting of reduction in income subsequent to the date of full restoration. It is common knowledge that a business interruption for any extended period may, and often does result in a loss of customers, some for a short, period, some for longer periods and some permanently. A \u2018cut off\u2019 date is a necessity. Otherwise, claims would be opened to a degree of speculation which would be absurd. There would be no available method to determine with any degree of accuracy the amount of such losses. See George W. Clarke, \u2018Problem Claims under Business Interruption Policies\u2019, Practical Lawyer (May 1958).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-15\">\u201cAnother provision in the policy further supports the Court\u2019s position. The company\u2019s liability cannot exceed \u2018the reduction in Gross Earnings less charges and expenses which do not necessarily continue during the interruption of business.\u2019 Gross earnings are defined as the \u2018Total net sales, and other earnings derived from operations of the business.\u2019 The evidence shows that a bowler\u2019s fees were paid on each-occasion while bowling, or immediately afterwards, whether he was engaged in league or open bowling. Plaintiff is seeking to recover loss of sales which he anticipated would occur after the reconstruction date. Profits anticipated from sales after November 11, 1962, are not \u2018net sales\u2019 or \u2018earnings derived\u2019 but rather expectancies in form, and, consequently, are not within the coverage provisions of the policies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s argument that the separation of the reduction in Gross Earnings clause above quoted by commas from the time limitation expresses an intent not to tie such provision in with the time limitation is without merit. In the Randolph case, supra, the Iowa court states that punctuation marks are ordinarily of little aid in construing contracts and that punctuation will not control over words or change a meaning which is plain from a consideration of the whole document.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Additional support is found in paragraph 8 for the trial court\u2019s construction. Said paragraph provides that the insurer shall not be liable for any increase in loss which may be occasioned \u201cby suspension, lapse, or cancellation of any lease or license, contract or order\u201d, and further provides against liability for \u201cany other consequential loss or remote loss.\u201d Thus, if plaintiff should be right in his contention that he had a valid and enforceable contract with the league for the 1962-63 season, the provisions just set out would exclude recovery for any anticipated profits with respect to the portion of the contract to be performed after November 11, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Plaintiff concedes that with respect to a normal business operation, such as a grocer, clothier or a hotel, the policy is unambiguous but urges that the provisions really do not fit his situation. Plaintiff concedes that he has found no cited cases dealing with construction of the business interruption clause which support his position. We do not doubt that the consequences of a fire interruption with respect to effect upon business after restoration may be more serious in some businesses than in other businesses. However, we find no basis for finding that the interpretation of the coverage varies with the type of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the trial court erred in determining that the plain language of the policies precludes recovery for the additional damages he here seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
