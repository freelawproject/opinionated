His motion was denied without hearing by the District Court for the Western District of Washington and he has taken this, appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-25\">Sole ground for relief is that contrary to his instructions his trial counsel failed to take an appeal from judgment. Accordingly under Rules 37(a) (2) and 45 (b) F.R.Cr.P., his right to appeal was lost. United States v. Robinson (1960) 361 U.S. 220, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259. He asserts that this has resulted in a loss-of a basic constitutional right for which loss he is entitled to a remedy under \u00a7 2255. As support for his contention he-relies upon Dodd v. United States, (9 Cir.. 1963) 321 F.2d 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>'That case is distinguishable. There 'the petition set forth numerous allegations of error and of matters occurring \u25a0on trial which, if proved, might be \u25a0deemed a denial of basic rights. There are no allegations of such prejudice here. Indeed, the petition alleges no error \u25a0-whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
