He claimed that the suspension was unjustified and sought to recover his wages for the period of suspension. His claim was submitted to the National Railroad Adjustment Board where, after the representatives of the parties had deadlocked, a referee decided in favor of the railroad. D\u2019Elia then brought this action in the district court seeking a review of the determination of the National Railroad Adjustment Board. The district \u25a0court granted defendants\u2019 motion for .summary judgment and D\u2019Elia appealed. We affirm the action of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-13\">The only claim which D\u2019Elia presses here is that the Board failed to \u25a0afford him due process of law when it \u25a0used as a basis for its decision <em>\u201ca </em>transcript made by a prejudiced hearing officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-15\">The initial hearing in D\u2019Elia\u2019s case was held by a representative of the employer railroad. This is the procedure provided in the collective agreement between the railroad and D\u2019Elia\u2019s union and it is the procedure contemplated by the Railway Labor Act. See Subsection First (i) of Section 3, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153. Under the Act, D\u2019Elia was entitled to a completely impartial hearing only when the case reached the referee designated to sit with the Board. As long as the final hearing officer was impartial the requirements of due process were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-16\">The fact that the Board had before it the transcript of the proceedings before the employer\u2019s hearing officer does not in itself import any denial of due process, and D\u2019Elia has failed to show any particulars in which the transcript presented his case unfairly or in which he was harmed by the Board\u2019s use of the transcript. In short, D\u2019Elia\u2019s conclusory allegations as to a denial of due process are wholly insufficient to resist the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
