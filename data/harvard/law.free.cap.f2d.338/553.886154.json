As to identification, the Government offered one witness who testified that around 11:30 P. M. on the date stated in the indictment he watched appellants as they passed the premises several times. He then saw appellant Jones drive a truck to the side door where one of the appellants was observed \u201cin the entrance\u201d or \u201cin the vicinity\u201d of the door. The witness then noticed that the side doors of the truck were open and \u201ctwo men was in there working, or doing something, some activity in the truck.\u201d Later he saw the truck being driven away.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In her opening statement the prosecuting attorney told the jury that the Government\u2019s witness \u201cobserved one of [the defendants] come out from the doorway of that store. He observed them apparently working in or loading something into their Volkswagen truck.\u201d But the proof did not bear this out. The witness did not testify that he had seen one of the defendants \u201ccome out from the doorway\u201d or that he had seen them \u201capparently working in or loading something into their Volkswagen truck.\u201d The prosecuting attorney nevertheless pressed the point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201cQ. Now, you observed one of the defendants coming out of the side doorway, you\u2019re talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know whether he was coming out. He was in the vicinity of the side door.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">On re-direct the prosecuting attorney asked the same witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-14\">\u201cQ. Now, sir, when you observed a person coming out of that entranceway and then the activity, the working or loading activity in the truck, where were you at that time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-15\">\u201cA. Well, I didn\u2019t say\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-16\">\u201cMr. Sternberg [counsel for defendant Jones] : Your Honor, I must object to the form of the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-18\">\u201cThe Court: We will strike that question and the jury will disregard it. I do not remember any testimony about any loading activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-19\"> Thus on three separate occasions during a one-day trial, Government counsel sought to shore up obvious weaknesses in the Government\u2019s case. It is true that the court instructed the jury that the opening statement of counsel was not evidence. It is also true that the answers to the questions containing the factual assertions denied them and that the jury was instructed to disregard one of the questions. Nevertheless, we are not in a position to say, in a case as paper-thin as this one appears to be,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the suggestions contained in the opening statement and in the questions were not responsible, in some degree at least, for the convictions in these cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Under the circumstances, the convictions must be set aside and the cases remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Since the cases are remanded for retrial, a word should be said about the instructions given by the trial court. The court\u2019s definition of \u201creasonable doubt\u201d included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">\u201c* * * [I]f * * * you can truthfully say that you have an abiding conviction of the defendants\u2019 guilt, or either of their guilt, such as you would be <em>willing to act </em>upon in the more weighty and important matters relating to your personal affairs, then as to such defendants you have no reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">\u201cWe think this section of the charge should have been in terms of the kind of doubt that would make a person <em>hesitate to act, </em>see Bishop v. United States, 71 App.D.C. 132, 137-138, 107 F.2d 297, 303, rather than the kind on which he would be <em>willing to act.\" </em>Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 140, 75 S.Ct. 127, 138, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954). (Emphasis added.) See also Egan v. United States, 52 App.D.C. 384, 393, 287 F. 958, 967 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1801 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-9\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2202 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b626-10\">. It is generally held that whether improper conduct of Government counsel amounts to prejudicial error depends, in good part, on the relative strength of the Government\u2019s evidence of guilt. McFarland v. United States, 80 U.S.App. D.C. 196, 150 F.2d 593 (1945); and see People v. Morton, 21 Ill.2d 139, 171 N.E.2d 592 (1961), and People v. Carr, 163 Cal.App.2d 568, 329 P.2d 746 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"ASt\">. We are also troubled by tactics used by Government counsel to impeach the appellants\u2019 testimony. On three occasions during cross-examination of appellant Jones, Government counsel misstated Jones\u2019 testimony on direct. Whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>intenclecl or not, this may well have created the impression in the jury\u2019s mind that Jones\u2019 answer on cross contradicted his testimony on direct. On cross-examination \u00f3f appellant Campbell, Government counsel suggested that Campbell had threatened the witness who had identified him at the lineup. No evidence was offered to substantiate this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"AV2\">Another tactic, the propriety of which we need not consider for decision in this case, involved the use, for impeachment purposes, of petty misdemeanor convictions (drunk and disorderly conduct), unrelated to the traits of honesty or truthfulness. Compare Bostic v. United States, 68 App.D.C. 167, 94 F.2d 636 (1937), with Clawans v. District of Columbia, 61 App.D.C. 298, 62 F.2d 383 (1932). See also Campbell v.
