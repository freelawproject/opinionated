It is contended that the trial judge erroneously denied the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress his confession. The highlights developed at the hearing on that motion may be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">Miss Helen Dadian, a part owner of the Embassy Hotel on Sixteenth Street was in the kitchen about 12:30 P.M. on May 17, 1963 when the appellant entered. She recognized him as Tony Washington, previously employed at the hotel. She asked \u201cWhat are you doing here ?\u201d Panic-stricken by such unexpected confrontation, as he later said, the appellant tried to choke her and finally beat her with a: hammer. The appellant disappeared briefly. Presently the appellant reappeared, demanded money, and again with the hammer struck her several times.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-15\">Miss Dadian noticed that the telephone wires had been cut and called from a-window for help. Detective Boyd responded and recovered pieces of wire<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which had been used in the strangling, the hammer with which the victim had' been battered and a cardboard box from which money had been stolen. Based upon her having named \u201cTony Washington\u201d as her assailant, the detective went, to the appellant\u2019s mother who told him that her son went under the name of Francis Theodore Proctor and supplied a photograph of him. The following-day the officer obtained an arrest warrant for Francis Theodore Proctor, also-known as Tony Washington. His search-for the appellant was fruitless throughout the next week. He requested Officer Bader of the Tenth Precinct to look for the appellant and turned over to him a. photograph of the wanted man.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-16\">On the evening of May 25, 1963, Officer Bader encountered the appellant at. a grille. The appellant testified that the-officer asked him his name and that he-responded his name was \u201cDonald \u2014 called me James Brown, and some call me-Tony.\u201d The officer showed him the picture, but the appellant said it was not a picture of himself. The officer asked\u2019 the appellant if he would help \u201cget it straightened out. I told him yes.\u201d Officer Bader then telephoned for Officer Boyd who was in charge of the case. The-latter received the call over the radio, and in a cruiser drove to meet Officer Bader and the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Detective Boyd testified he told the appellant that he had a warrant charging assault with a dangerous weapon \u201cfor a Francis T. Proctor, alias Tony Washington, also called Sonny, and that if he were the man that he was going to be arrested under that warrant and charged; and he stated that his name wasn\u2019t Francis Proctor and that his name wasn\u2019t Tony Washington, that, however, he was called Tony by some of his friends and that in order to avoid being charged, since he wasn\u2019t the right man, that he would be willing to get it straightened out right then.\u201d The officer then asked if the appellant would be willing to go with him to the Sixteenth Street residence of a sister of Miss Dadian to see if she could identify him. He said \u201cYes, he would be quite willing because he didn\u2019t want to be charged under that warrant.\u201d In furtherance of his plan to escape identification, the appellant showed the officer documents bearing the name of Don Ameche Miller, including a North Carolina driver\u2019s license, a D. C. unemployment card and a draft registration card.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Confrontation at the home of the victim\u2019s sister was inconclusive; she was unable to identify him other than to say he looked like the man.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">\u201cThe Court: Then, up to that time it was just a question of their asking you if you would come with them while they straightened the matter out; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">\u201cThe Witness: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8M\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">\u201cQ. They were trying to establish your identity, weren\u2019t they, who you were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">\u201cA. That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The officer told the appellant: \u201cWell, the only way that we can positively identify you would be to take you to the Dunbar Hotel where your mother and father live,\u201d and he said \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a mother and father, they are both dead,\u201d but he said, \u201cIf that\u2019s the end of it, let\u2019s go over there and finish it off so that I won\u2019t be charged.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-12\">\u201cBefore making a statement you are advised of your constitutional rights, that you do no have to make a statement, that any such statement may he used against you in the event of a trial, that any statement made by you is made of your own free will without any threats or promises being made to you; after being so informed do you wish to make a statement? Answer: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-15\">When the officer knocked on the door and was admitted to the appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s rooms, she said \u201cSonny, what have you done?\u201d The officer said \u201cIs this your son?\u201d and she said \u201cYes, it is.\u201d The appellant said to her \u201cWoman, I never seen you before in my life.\u201d The appellant\u2019s stepfather also identified Proctor. Thereupon, the officer informed the appellant that there was no longer any doubt in his mind that he was the right man and that he was being placed under arrest. The officer told the appellant that anything he said would be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-16\">The appellant was then taken to the precinct and turned over to the officer whose duty it is to book and search prisoners. The appellant\u2019s wallet was produced. There were the North Carolina driver\u2019s license in the name of Don Ameche Miller, the draft card and the unemployment card which the appellant had previously shown to the officer. Also, however, in another compartment of the wallet was a Social Security card bearing the name of Francis Theodore Proctor. The officer showed that card to the appellant who then said \u201cYes, I\u2019m the guy that you\u2019re looking for, I\u2019m the fellow that hit that woman up on Sixteenth Street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-17\">The detective read to the appellant a paragraph<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on a statement form advising him of his rights and \u201cthat was the third time he had been advised.\u201d The appellant then related the incidents of the day of the crime which were written down by Detective Warner as another officer was preparing a statement of facts for the court and a line-up sheet for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Detective Bureau. The two detectives sat at adjoining desks, so that \u201cthe processing of the defendant was still going on while the statement was being also taken from him in the same room.\u201d Realizing that his ruse had failed, the appellant had spontaneously confessed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The trial judge denied the motion to suppress the confession.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We are satisfied that there was no ei'ror.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-17\">. Her wounds having required some fifteen stitches, the victim ultimately spent 22 days in-the hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-11\">. The paragraph reads as follows:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b608-9\">. The exact time involved did not appear at the hearing on the motion to suppress, but at the trial Detective Boyd explained that the whole procedure might have taken \u201c10 or 15 minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Writing for a unanimous court in Jackson v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 181, 184, 313 F.2d 572, 575 (1962), Judge Edgerton pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">\u201cThe critical period is that between arrest and confession. \u2018Detention <em>after </em>a confession plainly does not affect its admissibility.

He said in substance \u201cI\u2019m the guy that you\u2019re looking for who hit that woman up on 16th Sti'eet.\u201d This confession was not written down.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-22\">Instead of being taken to a magistrate-immediately after he had been booked and had confessed, Proctor was taken upstairs to the \u201cDetective\u2019s room\u201d, where-for 50 minutes one officer filled out various forms and another officer obtained and typed a second confession.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This, written confession was introduced in evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Proctor was fingerprinted, photographed, and locked up until the-following morning, Sunday, when he was placed in a line-up. He was not presented to the Commissioner until Monday morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-23\">After an arrest the \u201cnext step in the proceeding is to arraign the arrested person before a judicial officer as quickly as possible so that he may be advised of his rights and so that the issue of probable cause may be promptly determined. The arrested person may, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>\u2022course, be \u2018booked\u2019 by the police. But he is not to be taken to police headquarters in order to carry out a process \u2022of inquiry that lends itself, even if not' so designed, to eliciting damaging statements to support the arrest and ultimately his guilt.\u201d Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 454, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1359, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479 (1957). A \u201cconfession is inadmissible if made during illegal detention due to failure promptly to carry a prisoner before a committing magistrate.\u201d Upshaw v. United States, 335 U.S. 410, 413, 69 S.Ct. 170, 172, 93 L.Ed. 100 (1948). In my opinion Proctor\u2019s written confession was made during unnecessary delay and should have been excluded. Cf. Spriggs v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. -, 335 F.2d 283, 1964.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-17\">. When Boyd said \u201cthe whole procedure might have taken ten or fifteen minutes\u201d, I think he was not referring, as the court suggests, to \u201cthe processing of the defendant * * * while the statement was also being taken from him\u201d, but to the time between his oral confession at \u201cbooking\u201d and the <em>T)eginning </em>of the confession that was later obtained and reduced to writing. His words \u201cten or fifteen minutes\u201d were used in the following context. \u201cQ How long after the incident that you just described which took place at the booking desk was this statement taken down in typewritten form? A Well, as soon as we got up to the Detective Office and got out to [sic] these forms and carbon paper and sat down at the typewriter and began the procedure which might have been ten or fifteen minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-26\">Boyd testified that Proctor was booked at 10:55 p. m. and then taken to the detectives\u2019 room. Boyd was asked: \u201cNow, approximately how long did you stay in this room?\u201d He answered: \u201cApproximately fifty, fifty-five minutes.\u201d He said \u201cthe statement was completed, I believe, at * * * 11:50.\u201d It is undisputed that Proctor had confessed orally at about 10:55 while he was being booked. The written statement was completed and time-stamped at 11:50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-29\">. It does not purport to be a record of the earlier oral confession.
