United States, 117 U.S. App.D.C. 206, 328 F.2d 178 (1963), on appeal from this appellant\u2019s conviction of assault with a dangerous weapon, we remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court in Campbell v. United States, 365 U.S. 85, 81 S.Ct. 421, 5 L.Ed.2d 428, (1961), and our cases of Saunders v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 345, 348, 316 F.2d 346, 349 (1963), and Hilliard v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 86, 317 F.2d 150, 151 (1963). The purpose was to have an inquiry by the court as to the producibility under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(e) (2) (1958) of statements of Thomas Butler and Pauline Smith, who-had testified for the prosecution. Their statements had been given to a clerk of a grand jury unit of the United States Attorney\u2019s office, herein as a matter of convenience referred to as the clerk, an agent of the government. The statements were transcribed by the clerk in typewriting during the interviews. The court had denied defense counsel\u2019s request for their production, made after the witnesses had testified on direct examination. The court ruled the statements were not substantially verbatim accounts of what the witnesses had said to the clerk, adding that they were in noway inconsistent with their testimony at the trial. We held that if they were substantially verbatim recitals they were producible, unless no prejudice resulted from non-production. An appropriate judicial inquiry into producibility not having been held we remanded, the fate of the conviction to depend upon the result of such an inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">On the remand the required hearing was held. The court found, and It is not contested, that the statements were recorded contemporaneously with their making. But the court also found that they are not substantially verbatim-, are merely summaries of the witnesses\u2019\u2019 accounts of the crime, contain only the-substance and highlights of the accounts-given to the clerk by the witnesses, and). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>also, that in any event the failure to produce was not prejudicial to appellant. The court accordingly ruled that the judgment of conviction should stand. The case is now before us on appeal from this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">With all deference we are unable to agree that defense counsel was not entitled to the statements in aid of his conduct of the defense. Since it is not disputed the statements met the requirement of the Jencks Act as having been \u201crecorded contemporaneously\u201d with their making, the issues are whether they were \u201csubstantially verbatim\u201d recitals and, if so, whether the failure to make them available to the defense was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">I. A perusal of the statements strongly indicates that they set forth a running account of what the witnesses said to the clerk, though transcribed largely in the third person. The transcription is a graphic description of events upon the basis of which the indictment was returned and the trial proceeded. It contains idiomatic language, .at one point set off by quotation marks, indicative of verbatim transcription, with abbreviations to aid in the expedition of transcription; and on their face the statements appear to be complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">It is true that at the hearing on remand the clerk testified the statements were \u201cmy version\u201d of what the witnesses told him, but this we interpret in the context of the clerk\u2019s testimony as a whole, from which it appears he meant that when the witness said, for example, \u201cI hit\u201d him, the clerk transcribed it \u201cHe hit\u201d him. He said that normally he talks to the witness, then turns around and writes \u201chis version\u201d of what the oral statement was. Butler and Smith both testified that the clerk was typing while they were giving their statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">It was brought out that the clerk held Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Law degrees, that he considers the statements he obtains from such grand jury witnesses important for the purpose of affording the staff of the United States Attorney\u2019s office opportunity to know what the case is all about in presenting it before the grand jury and, if the case advances to indictment, to give the one who prepares the indictment the necessary information; that the clerk tries to be accurate in taking down the essentials ; and that to him \u201csubstantially verbatim\u201d means \u201cexactly,\u201d \u201cword for word,\u201d \u201cevery i and every t.\u201d This, however, is really \u201cprecisely verbatim,\u201d a degree of accuracy which the Jencks rule does not require as a condition to producibility. In taking these statements the clerk further testified he gets down the essential part, the heart of the testimony, tries to put down the substance of the witnesses\u2019 testimony, and everything in the statement is something the witnesses said.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Toward the end of the clerk\u2019s testimony the court said to him, \u201cAs I gather it, detail, in the sense of minutia, you don\u2019t bother with it. You want to get the basic facts.\u201d The clerk answered, \u201cThat is correct, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">In Palermo v. United States, 360 U.S. 343, 350, 79 S.Ct. 1217, 3 L.Ed.2d 1287 (1959), it is said that in determining the producibility of statements under the Jencks Act the issue is whether a statement can be fairly said to be the witness\u2019 own so that it would not be unfair to allow the defense to use it to impeach the witness. Clearly, it seems to us, this test is here met. To repeat, \u201csubstantially verbatim\u201d does not mean \u201cprecisely verbatim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">The Government suggests several factors by which to judge whether a statement comes within the Jencks Act: (1) the extent to which it conforms to the language of the witness; (2) its length in comparison with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>length of the interview; (3) the lapse of time between the interview and its transcription; (4) the appearance of the substance of the witness\u2019 remarks; (5) the use of quotation marks; and (6) the presence of the comments or ideas of the interviewer. These are guidelines to aid in the application of the test announced in <em>Palermo, </em>and it is not suggested that the eases cited to support the importance of these factors require conformity with each. Nevertheless we think their application to the present case supports the producible character of the statements. We also give weight to the trial court\u2019s findings of the purposes for which the statements were obtained, to give the United States Attorney presenting the case before the grand jury an idea of exactly what information the witness had, to provide the indictment writer and the government\u2019s trial attorney with accurate information and also, on occasion, to provide a means for impeaching a witness who changes his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The knowledge of the clerk of the use to be made of the statements tends to support their accuracy. That this is so is illustrated by a change he made in one of the statements to insure accuracy. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>The testimony as to how the statements were contemporaneously recorded also lends support to the view they were substantially verbatim, as does a comparison between the length of the statements in relation to the probable length of the interviews. The trial court found, moreover, that the clerk would not change a witness\u2019 words where to do so would materially alter the purport of the witness\u2019 statement, and, finally, the ungrammatical construction of the sentences, contrasting with the educational qualifications of the clerk, indicates he was making substantially verbatim transcriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> II. On this review we may not rule against the findings of fact of the trial judge unless we conclude they are clearly erroneous. Campbell v. United States, 373 U.S. 487, 493, 83 S.Ct. 1356, 10 L.Ed.2d 501 (1963); Palermo v. United States, <em>supra, </em>360 U.S. at 353, 79 S.Ct. 1217. However, a finding that written statements are or are not producible under the Jencks Act as substantially verbatim recitals of witnesses\u2019 oral statements is not an ordinary finding of fact; it is a factual conclusion arrived at by applying a legal standard to the other facts found. To the extent that this conclusion is based upon the application of an erroneous rule of law or is inconsistent with the facts upon which it purports to rest then it is clearly erroneous. In holding, as we do, that the trial court erred in finding that the statements were not producible, we accept the court\u2019s basic findings of fact. We do not accept, however, the court\u2019s finding that the statements were \u201cnot substantially verbatim, but were merely [the clerk\u2019s] summary of the witnesses accounts.\u201d Such a conclusion, we think, is the result of the application of an erroneous legal standard, and is inconsistent with the subsidiary findings upon which it is based and the evidence as a whole. We keep in mind, in the practical application of the Jencks Act, \u201cThe command of the statute is * * * designed to further the fair and just administration of criminal justice, a goal of which the judiciary is the special guardian.\u201d Campbell v. United States, 365 U.S. 85, 92, 81 S.Ct. 421, 425, 5 L.Ed.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Being clear, but with deference, that the statements are producible under the Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we conclude that the conviction must be set aside and a new trial granted, unless the error in not requiring production was harmless, a question we now consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>III. The case is unlike Rosenberg v. United States, 360 U.S. 367, 79 S.Ct. 1231, 3 L.Ed.2d 1304 (1959), where the error of the trial court in not making a producible statement available was held to be harmless because the same information was available to the defense in another form. The statement involved was a letter of the witness written prior to trial stating that in order to refresh her failing memory she would need to reread the original statement she had given to the F.B.I. Thus in <em>Rosenberg </em>the subject matter of the statement was the single fact of loss of recollection. As the Court pointed out,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\">\u201c[T]he same information which was contained in the letter was revealed to defendant\u2019s counsel by statements made by [the witness] under cross-examination and upon questioning by the trial judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">360 U.S. at 370, 79 S.Ct. at 1234. In our case, however, the producible statements contain a running account of the events surrounding the commission of an alleged offense, not an isolated item of information otherwise obtained by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The issue of credibility of the witnesses for the defense vis-a-vis those for the prosecution was important. Defendant took the stand and gave quite a different version from that given by Butler and Smith of the events which led to his indictment. His testimony was corroborated by that of another witness. If believed this version of the affair might have persuaded the jury that Butler, who in fact shot the defendant but claimed to have done so to protect one Hicklin from an attack by defendant, was not to be believed, and that the facts did not require conviction of defendant. We do not intimate that the jury would have so concluded. If there were discrepancies between the statements and the testimony of Butler and Smith given at the trial, as we find to be the case, then the failure to make the statements available to defense counsel deprived him of the right effectively to conduct the defense as contemplated by the Jencks rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">There were a number of such discrepancies. Both Butler and Smith testified defendant hit Hicklin only once with a bar stool, whereas both said in their statements that defendant hit Hicklin a second time with the bar stool. In this respect the statements may have been more favorable to defendant than the witnesses\u2019 trial testimony, but this is not decisive under the Jencks Act. The issue is whether counsel should have had the choice of using the statements to test the witnesses\u2019 credibility; that is, in the present context, to test whether the witnesses gave true accounts of what occurred. This should be considered along with the defendant\u2019s testimony that he was chased out of the bar by Butler who was brandishing a pistol and that if he, the defendant, hit Hicklin at all it was by bumping him when he was trying to get out the door.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">The error, therefore, in denying the request of the defense for production of the statements was not harmless. See Clancy v. United States, 365 U.S. 312, 81 S.Ct. 645, 5 L.Ed.2d 574 (1961), where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">\u201cSince the production of at least some of the statements withheld was a right of the defense, it is not for us to speculate whether they could have been utilized effectively. As we said in Jencks v. United States, supra, 353 U.S. [657] 667, 77 S.Ct. [1007] 1013 [1 L.Ed.2d 1103];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-13\">\u201c \u2018Flat contradiction between the witness\u2019 testimony and the version of the events given in his report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>is not .the only test of inconsistency. The omission from the reports of facts related at the trial, or a contrast in emphasis upon the same facts, even a different order of treatment, are also relevant to the cross-examining process of testing the credibility of a witness\u2019 trial testimony.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuN\">365 U.S. at 316, 81 S.Ct. at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\">. The evidence further shows that to make the transcription of Mr. Butler\u2019s statement conform more accurately to what the witness had said the clerk corrected his transcription by changing the sen-fence, \u201cthen at one time he threw a glass of beer on the floor and broke the bottle and glass,\u201d to read \u201cthen at one time he threw a glass of beer on the floor and the bottle too.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-5\">. As we pointed out in our first opinion in this case, the produeibility of the statements is not affected hy the self-serving declaration found at the top of each stating that: \u201cThe following is a summary of the witness conversation not read to or by the witness it is not intended to be a substantially verbatim account \u2014 ws.\u201d (Lack of punctuation as in original.) See Williams v. United States, <em>supra, </em>328 F.2d at 180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">. There are other discrepancies. As examples, Butler on the stand placed defendant\u2019s arrival at the grill \u201caround about five o\u2019clock\u201d whereas in liis statement he placed it \u201cstarting at 7 PM\u201d; Butler testified that he had always liked defendant and had no grudge against him. but in his statement he referred to Mm as a \u201cmember of a gang that buys whiskey outside and drinks same in the streets <em>* </em>* * and then comes into the grill and starts trouble,\u201d that he had told him to get out and that \u201che did not want him in there.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b363-6\">Wilbur K. Miller, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AVs\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Whether the majority are correct in holding Stitely\u2019s summaries of his interviews with the prospective Government witnesses, Butler and Smith, were producible under the Jencks Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> depends upon whether the summaries are \u201cstatements\u201d as that statutory term is defined in subsection (e) of the Act, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">\u201c(e) The term \u2018statement\u2019, as used in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section in relation to any witness called by the United States, means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">\u201c(1) a written statement made by said witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">\u201c(2) a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by said witness to an agent of the Government and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Admittedly, the summaries are not written statements made by the witnesses and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by them, so they are not \u201cstatements\u201d as defined in paragraph (1) of subsection (e). It follows that the Stitley summaries can be held to have been producible only under paragraph (2) of subsection (e); that is, if they are recordings (or transcriptions of recordings) which are \u201csubstantially verbatim\u201d recitals of oral statements made by Butler and Smith to Stitely and recorded contemporaneously by him. The majority analyze the Stitely summaries and then <em>hold they are </em>\u201cstatements\u201d under paragraph (2), but they do not reproduce them. As I think the structure and language of the summaries show they are not such \u201cstatements,\u201d I quote them exactly as they were typed by Mr. Stitely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-13\">\u201cRoy T.

The evidence shows that the statements taken by Mr. Stitely were not substantially verbatim, but were merely Mr. Stitely's summary of the witnesses\u2019 accounts of the crime and contained only the substance, essentials and highlights of the account. The statements were written in a third person narrative, and not in the language of witnesses Butler or Smith, except where quotation marks appear. Mr. Stitely never records anything that the witness does not say and never changes the witnesses\u2019 wording where to do so would materially alter the purpose of the witnesses\u2019 statement. It was not the intention of the Clerk to take full detailed statements, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>only sufficient facts so that the Assistant United States Attorney appearing before the Grand Jury could make an orderly presentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">\u201c20. The statements of Mr. Butler and Mrs. Smith, as recorded by Mr. Stitely (Exhibits 3 and 4) were read to the witnesses at the hearing before this Court. Each witness testified that his respective statement represented the substance of what he had told Mr. Stitely. Mrs. Smith qualified her testimony by noting that her statement did not contain one item that she recalled she narrated to Mr. Stitely: the fact that Butler had fired a warning shot into the mirror prior to shooting Williams.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">By holding that the summaries are substantially verbatim recitals of the witnesses\u2019 interviews with Stitely, the majority, in effect, say findings 19 and 20 are clearly erroneous, and substitute for them their own contrary findings. I suggest that no amount of analysis by the majority can show the above quoted summaries to be substantially verbatim recitals of the oral statements made to Stitely. My opinion is that the findings of the able and experienced trial judge are not clearly erroneous but clearly correct, and that, therefore, we are bound by them even though some of us would have made different findings from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">It will be observed that Mr. Stitely noted in each summary that \u201cit is not intended to be a substantially verbatim account,\u201d and appended his initials to the notes. His statement is amply borne out, as I have said, by the summaries themselves. Plainly, they contain simply the substance of the interviews as recorded in Stitely\u2019s language \u2014 not that of the witnesses. The presence of the two brief sentences attributed by Stitely to the witness Butler emphasizes the fact that the remainder of the Butler summary \u2014 practically all of it \u2014 was not verbatim, or even substantially so.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">\u201cVerbatim\u201d means \u201cword for word\u201d or \u201cin the same words.\u201d The adverb \u201csubstantially,\u201d in the sense it is used in the term \u201csubstantially verbatim,\u201d is defined thus:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">\u201c4. In all essential characters or features; in regard to everything material; in essentials; to all intents and purposes; in the main.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtI\">So, the statutory term \u201csubstantially verbatim\u201d means \u201cword for word in all essentials, in everything material, to all intents and purposes.\u201d I suggest that one who reads the summaries with the foregoing definition in mind will realize immediately that they are not \u201csubstantially verbatim\u201d recitals of oral statements made by the prospective witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">That Congress did not intend the Jencks Act definition of the word \u201cstatement\u201d to include documents such as are now being considered is shown by the legislative history of the Act. The Senate version of the bill extended the types of statements covered to include \u201ctranscriptions or records of oral statements\u201d made by the witness to an agent of the Government. Had the legislation passed in that form, the Stitely summaries probably could be held to have been producible. But the bill did not pass in that form. The House conferees insisted that a document not signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the witness should not be a producible statement unless it were a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by the witness. This appears in the following paragraph of the Conference Report made by the House managers:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-12\">\u201cAnother difference discussed by the conferees concerned the provisions of the Senate bill, which extended the types of statements covered by the bill to include \u2018transcriptions or records of oral statements\u2019 made by the witness to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>agent of the Government. To remove any doubt as to the kinds of statements affected by the bill as agreed to by the conferees, a new paragraph \u2018e\u2019 was added to the proposed section 3500 of title 18 of the United States Code expressly defining the term \u2018statement\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">So, the Senate definition of the word \u201cstatement\u201d was rejected, and the much more restricted definition proposed by the House was included in the statute finally adopted. My colleagues push the Jencks Act much further than Congress intended. They construe it as though the definition of \u201cstatement\u201d in the Senate version of the bill had become law. I think it quite clear that the summaries were not producible.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Having held that the District Court erred in refusing to require production of the summaries, the majority further hold that the error was not harmless like that in the <em>Rosenberg </em>case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but prejudiced appellant by depriving him \u201cof the right effectively to conduct the defense as contemplated by the Jencks rule.\u201d The majority\u2019s idea that appellant was prejudiced is based solely on their statement that there were discrepancies between the summaries and the testimony of Butler and Smith given at the trial. I suppose they mean that, had the summaries been made available to appellant at the trial, he could have used them effectively in the cross-examination of Butler and Smith for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">That might have been possible if there actually were discrepancies between the summaries and the testimony of the two witnesses. I have carefully compared the summaries with the trial testimony, and I find no discrepancies between them. To be sure, there are differences: the testimony was quite detailed, for it covers many pages of the reporter\u2019s transcript, while each summary is on a single page. This was recognized by the trial judge in his finding that \u201cAny discrepancies are attributable to the incomplete nature of the statements recorded by Mr. Stitely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">A discrepancy would not have aided appellant in attempting to impeach Butler and Smith unless it had been more than a mere difference \u2014 unless it had amounted to a disagreement, a discordance, or a variance. None such appears here. The majority recite three differences between the summaries and the testimony which they say are \u201cdiscrepancies\u201d: (a) that the summaries said the appellant struck his victim twice with a bar stool, while the witnesses testified that he struck him only once with the stool; (b) that the summary of Butler\u2019s irterview said appellant arrived at the bar \u201cstarting at 7 PM,\u201d while he testified that it was \u201caround about five o\u2019clock\u201d; (c) that Stitely\u2019s summary of Butler\u2019s interview said appellant was a trouble-maker, while Butler testified he had always liked appellant and had no grudge against him. These are points of difference but they are not discrepancies which could have enabled appellant to impeach Butler and Smith on cross-examination. The exact hour of appellant\u2019s arrival at the bar and whether he struck his victim once or twice with the bar stool seem to me to be of little moment. And there is nothing inconsistent between Stitely\u2019s Butler summary that appellant was a troublemaker, and Butler\u2019s testimony that he had no grudge against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">I find nothing substantial in the summaries which was not in the testimony of Butler and Smith at the trial. Hence, requiring production of the summaries would have given the appellant no information in addition to that which he obtained from the direct examination of the witnesses. That being true, the following language of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the <em>Rosenberg </em>case, <em>swpra, </em>360 U.S. at page 371, 79 S.Ct. at page 1234, is particularly applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">\u201c * * * However, when the very same information was possessed by defendant\u2019s counsel as would have been available were error not committed, it would offend common sense and the fair administration of jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>tice to order a new trial. There is such a thing as harmless error and this clearly was such. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The majority\u2019s quotation from the <em>Clancy </em>case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which in turn quotes from the earlier <em>Jencks </em>case, does not help them; for here there was not only no flat contradiction between the summaries and the testimony, but also there was no omission from the summaries of salient facts related at the trial, no \u201ccontrast in emphasis upon the same facts,\u201d and no \u201cdifferent order of treatment.\u201d There is simply nothing in the Stitely summaries which would have aided in the cross-examining process of testing the credibility of trial testimony. Moreover, their <em>Clancy </em>quotation is a bit of <em>obiter dictum, </em>for the Supreme Court did not reach the harmless error point in that ease, as its opinion shows, 365 U.S. at page 316, 81 S.Ct. at page 648</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\u201cWe put to one side <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>United States, </em>360 U.S. 367, 79 S.Ct. 1231, 3 L.Ed.2d 1304, where a failure to produce a document was considered to be harmless error under the particular circumstances of that case. <em>We do not reach the harmless error point </em>because, if applicable, it is relevant only to the report of one of the agents, not to those of the other two. * * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">But here, there was no information in the summaries which had not been obtained by the appellant from the direct testimony of the two witnesses, as I have said. As in the <em>Rosenberg </em>case, the information in the documents withheld was otherwise conveyed to the appellant. Hence, we cannot \u201cput to one side\u201d the <em>Rosenberg </em>case, as the Supreme Court did in the <em>Clancy </em>opinion. The particular circumstances which justified the <em>Rosenberg </em>ruling of harmless error are similar to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">On the question whether the appellant was prejudiced because the summaries were not made available to him, District Judge Schweinhaut made these specific findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">\u201c23. The failure to produce Exhibits 3 and 4 for use of defense counsel during the trial was not prejudicial to defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">\u201c24. The witnesses\u2019 statements before Mr. Stitely, the Grand Jury, the petit jury and this Court are not significantly different. Any discrepancies are attributable to the incomplete nature of the statements recorded by Mr. Stitely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-11\">\u201c25. The evidence shows that impeachment of either witnesses Butler\u2019s or Smith\u2019s credibility at trial could not have been accomplished by the use of the statements (Exhibits #3 and 4).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">I think it significant that when the summaries were requested by the defendant at the trial, the judge examined them and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-13\">\u201c * * * They are written in summary form. That doesn\u2019t come under the Jencks rule. I looked at them while I had it here, and none are in the first person, don\u2019t purport to be the statement in the language of the witness. The story is the same in substance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">Then, when counsel insisted that \u201cbeing in the first person is only one of the criterion [sic],\u201d the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-16\">\u201c * * * Here is what I think I better do, to save time, and it will serve your purpose. I will follow these statements as the witnesses testify. If I find anything inconsistent in this summary, I will let you know before you cross examine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZf\">Hence, the trial judge was thoroughly familiar with the summaries and testimony and carefully compared them. At the hearing after remand, he again compared the summaries with testimony given by the witnesses on three occasions, and thereupon made the findings quoted above. I suggest that they are correct and controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>As the majority discern discrepancies which would have made the summaries useful to appellant for impeachment purposes, they are rejecting the quoted findings as clearly erroneous. As I have said, my opinion is that the record shows them to be clearly correct, and so I must dissent on the prejudice point as well as the issue of producibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">All the findings of fact made by the trial judge and the conclusions of law he drew therefrom, which I think are accurate and correct, should be examined in the consideration of this case. For that reason, I append to this dissent the complete text of the findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">This matter having come before the Court on a remand from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for further proceedings consistent with their opinion <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>117 U.S.App.D.C. 206, 328 F.2d 178, decided December 12, 1963), evidence, testimony and argument by counsel having been adduced in open court, the Court makes the following Findings of Fact:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">1. The defendant was convicted by a jury of assault with a dangerous weapon (22 D.C.Code 502) and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of two or six years. From that judgment he appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">2. The Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the cause for a hearing to determine whether the statements of Roy Thomas Butler and Mrs. Pauline Smith, transcribed by the Grand Jury Clerk should have been produced at trial in accordance with the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500, and if so whether failure to so produce was prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">3. A full hearing was held on Friday, January 24, 1964, at which the defendant was present in open court and represented by three able court-appointed counsel. Five witnesses appeared and testified in the following order: (1) Mr. Donald S. Smith, Assistant United States Attorney, (2) Mr. Wilmer R. Stitely, Chief Clerk in the Grand Jury Division of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, (3) Mr. Roy Thomas Butler, (4) Mrs. Pauline Smith, and (5) Mr. Robert X. Perry, Assistant United States Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">4. Five documents were introduced and admitted into evidence as exhibits: (1) a blank Grand Jury Statement form No. USA-9x-65, (2) a blank Witness Attendance Certificate form No. USA-798, (3) the statement of Roy Thomas Butler, (4) the statement of Pauline Smith, and (5) the Government\u2019s trial folder.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">5. When a case is scheduled for presentation to the Grand Jury, all witnesses are ordered to report beforehand to the office of the United States Attorney, Grand Jury Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">6. There, their statement is taken by the Chief Clerk of the Grand Jury, Mr. Wilmer R. Stitely, or by one of his two assistants.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">7. Mr. Alexander L. Stevas, when Assistant United States Attorney in charge of the Grand Jury Division, instructed Mr. Stitely and his assistants to type on the statement, Form No. USA-9x-65, the following: \u201cThe following is a summary of the witness\u2019 conversation not read to or by the witness. It is not intended to be a substantially verbatim account,\u201d followed by his initials.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-18\">8. The clerk sees all witnesses in one case in a group, but takes their statements individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-19\">9. Mr. Stitely will usually either type the statement in full after the witness has completed his statement or type a portion of it after the witness has partially completed his statement, completing the statement after the witness has given the remainder. One of these procedures was followed in this case and the witnesses remained in Mr. Stitely\u2019s office until he completed the statement he took from the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-20\">10. The Assistant United States Attorney uses the statement as transcribed by the clerk to make an orderly presentation of the evidence to be offered through that witness to the Grand Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>11. The statements are taken by the Grand Jury Clerk for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">(a) To aid the Assistant United States Attorney in presenting the ease to the Grand Jury in an orderly fashion;</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">(b) To enable the indictment writer to properly draft the indictment, without the necessity of requiring the transcription of the Grand Jury testimony;</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">(c) To enable the Assistant United States Attorney, who is assigned to try the case, to prepare and present it in Court. The statements are, on occasion, used to impeach the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">12. Mr. Robert <em>X. </em>Perry presented this case to the Grand Jury (Exhibit 5). Should any inconsistencies, which Mr. Perry deemed material, have come to his attention, he would have corrected them. Mr. Perry made the following corrections, relative to the statements in question:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">(a) The symbol for the Greek letter delta was inserted to indicate the defendant in line 8 of the first long paragraph of Mr. Butler\u2019s statement, next to the word \u201chis\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">(b) The abbreviation \u201cMS\u201d was changed to \u201cMF\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">13. In taking the statements it was not Mr. Stitely\u2019s intention to record an account which would be \u201csubstantially verbatim.\u201d By \u201csubstantially verbatim\u201d he testified that he meant exactly identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">14. Mr. Stitely has been employed by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, Grand Jury Division, as a clerk for the past 33 years. He is presently the Chief Clerk and has so been for the last five years. Mr. Stitely is a graduate of the National Law School. His civil service classification is GS-9. His principle duties are the taking of statements of witnesses prior to their testifying before the Grand Jury. Exhibits 3 and 4, in this case, were taken by Mr. Stitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">15. Mr. Stitely corrected the statement of Mr. Butler (Exhibit 3), by changing the sentence \u201cthen at one time he threw a glass of beer on the floor and broke the bottle and glass\u201d to the following: \u201cthen at one time he threw a glass of beer on the floor and the bottle too.\u201d These were the only changes made by Mr. Stitely regarding Mr. Butler\u2019s statement, and were made on the typewriter.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">16. Where the witness used obscene language, Mr. Stitely used abbreviations.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">17. The evidence shows that the statements (Exhibits #3 and 4), taken by Mr. Stitely, were not read to or by Mr. Butler or Mrs. Smith, nor were they seen or signed by either witness, nor in any way adopted or approved by them, prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">18. The evidence shows that none of the handwritten notations on either statement (Exhibits #3 and 4) were those of either Mr. Butler or Mrs. Smith, but were the notes of Mr. Stitely and Mr. Perry.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-18\">19. The evidence shows that the statements taken by Mr. Stitely were not substantially verbatim, but were merely Mr. Stitely\u2019s summary of the witnesses accounts of the crime and contained only the substance, essentials and highlights of the account. 'The statements were written in a third person narrative, and not in the language of witnesses Butler or Smith, except where quotation marks appear. Mr. Stitely never records anything that the witness does not say and never changes the witnesses\u2019 wording where to do so would materially alter the purport of the witnesses\u2019 statement. It was not the intention of the Clerk to take full detailed statements, but only sufficient facts so that the Assistant United States Attorney appearing before the Grand Jury could make an orderly presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-19\">20. The statements of Mr. Butler and Mrs. Smith, as recorded by Mr. Stitely (Exhibits #3 and 4) were read to the witnesses at the hearing before this Court. Each witness testified that his respective statement represented the substance of what he had told Mr. Stitely. Mrs. Smith qualified her testimony by noting that her statement did not contain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>one item that she recalled she narrated to Mr. Stitely: the fact that Butler had fired a warning shot into the mirror prior to shooting Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">21. The witnesses Smith and Butler testified at the hearing before this Court as to their version of the occurrences on the evening of the alleged crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">' 22. In this case, the record of the statement which Mrs. Smith gave to Mr. Stitely (Exhibits #3 and 4) recites that it is the \u201csubstance\u201d of her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">23. The failure to produce Exhibits 3 and 4 for use of defense counsel during the trial was not prejudicial to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">24. The witnesses statements before Mr. Stitely, the Grand Jury, the petit jury and this Court are not significantly different. Any discrepancies are attributable to the incomplete nature of the statements recorded by Mr. Stitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">25. The evidence shows that impeachment of either witnesses Butler\u2019s or .Smith\u2019s credibility at trial could not have been accomplished by the use of the statements (Exhibits #3 and 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Wherefore, The Court concludes as a matter of law that:</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">1. The duty of determining whether or not statements are producible under the Jeneks Act rests upon the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">2. Neither of the statements was read to or by the witnesses or signed or otherwise adopted by them within the meaning of Subsection (e) (1) of the Jeneks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, and thus were not producible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">3. Both statements were \u201crecorded contemporaneously\u201d with their \u201cmaking\u201d, however, neither was \u201ca substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by\u201d the witness within the meaning of Subsection (e) (2) of the Jeneks Act, and thus were not producible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">4. No pi'ejudice resulted to the defendant as a result of not having the statements at trial (assuming <em>arguendo </em>they were producible).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">5. The judgment of conviction and sentence should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"A2Y\">/s/ H. A.
