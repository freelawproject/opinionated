His offense level was increased for a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation that was deemed a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). He was sentenced to 70 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-20\">Rueda contends that his prior Texas burglary was not a crime of violence because Texas law too broadly defines the \u201cowner\u201d of a habitation as a person with merely \u201cgreater right to possession\u201d than the criminal actor. We review only for plain error because the issue is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>557 F.3d 200, 205 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-21\">In <em>United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>we rejected the same contention made by Rueda, holding that the \u201cgreater right to possession\u201d definition does not make Texas burglary broader than generic burglary. 704 F.3d 410, 411-12 (5th Cir.2013) (applying plain-error review). Rueda\u2019s argument is thus foreclosed, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
