The government has moved to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction, or in the alternative, to summarily deny the petition. We will grant in part and deny in part the motion to dismiss. To the extent we have jurisdiction, we will grant the motion to summarily deny Fakhouri\u2019s petition as it presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Fakhouri is a native and citizen of Morocco. He entered the United States in 1989 on a valid non-immigrant visa. In 2008, Fakhouri was convicted in Pennsylvania of two counts of delivery of a controlled or counterfeit substance and related drug offenses. He was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of two to five years, of which he served the full five years. As a result of his offenses, Fak-houri was charged with removability pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(a)(1), which provides for the expedited removal of aliens convicted of aggravated felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Fakhouri applied for withholding of removal, as well as deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) determined that Fakhouri\u2019s drug offense constituted a \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii), which renders him ineligible for withholding of removal. The IJ also concluded that Fakhouri had not shown a likelihood of torture either by his family, or by the Moroccan government or with its acquiescence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2); <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 174-75 (3d Cir.2002). The IJ thus denied both applications for relief and ordered Fakhouri removed. On appeal, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Fakhouri has filed a petition for review, and has moved to stay his removal. The Government opposes the stay and has filed a motion to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction, or in the alternative, to summarily deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">In its motion to dismiss, the Government argues this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider Fakhouri\u2019s petition in light of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), which precludes review of certain discretionary decisions of the Attorney General. It acknowledges, however, that this Court may entertain constitutional challenges and questions of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). While some of Fakhouri\u2019s claims fail to raise \u201ccolorable violations\u201d of the Constitution, <em>see Jarbough v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>483 F.3d 184, 189 (3d Cir.2007), his petition does present questions of law which we have jurisdiction to review. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">Fakhouri first challenges the IJ\u2019s determination that his drug offense was a \u201cparticularly serious crime.\u201d We have jurisdiction to review this determination. <em>See Alaka v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>456 F.3d 88, 101-02 (3d Cir.2006). An alien is considered to have committed a particularly serious crime if he has been convicted of an aggravated felony for which he has been sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of at least five years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii). Fakhouri does not dispute that he was convicted of an aggravated felony. Moreover, a sentence of two to five years is functionally equivalent to a sentence of five years for purposes of im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>migration consequences. <em>See Bovkun v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 166, 170-71 (3d Cir.2002). Therefore, as the IJ concluded, Fakhouri\u2019s conviction is, <em>per se, </em>a \u201cparticularly serious crime.\u201d <em>See In re Y-L, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 270, 273 (BIA 2002). Accordingly, his argument that he can present \u201cextraordinary and compelling circumstances\u201d to demonstrate that his offense was not a \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d is unavailing. <em>See id. </em>at 276-77 (delineating extenuating circumstances under which an alien may be able to rebut the <em>presumption </em>that a drug trafficking conviction is for a \u201cparticularly serious crime.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Fakhouri sets forth several due process claims. Specifically, he maintains that the IJ allowed him \u201conly minimal procedural testimonial and fail[ed] to review documents and evidence to support his application,\u201d and that the BIA failed to make a pronouncement on his credibility. In reviewing a CAT application, an IJ must consider \u201call evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(3). We have jurisdiction to review claims that the IJ failed to consider certain evidence. <em>See Green v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>694 F.3d 503, 508 (3d Cir.2012). Fakhouri assumes that the IJ did not assess all of his evidence because it was not all discussed in the decision. The IJ\u2019s thorough opinion supports his statement that he looked \u201cat this case as closely as possible.\u201d At the hearing, the IJ indicated that he was \u201cvery familiar with [Fakhouri\u2019s] case,\u201d including Fakhouri\u2019s declaration \u2014 a 20-page statement \u2014 which Fakhouri insists supports his claim. There is simply no indication that the IJ failed to consider any relevant evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Huang v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>620 F.3d 372, 388 (3d Cir.2010) (the IJ and BIA need not \u201cdiscuss every piece of evidence\u201d presented by an applicant).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Fakhouri next asserts that he failed to meet his burden of proof on the CAT claim because he was limited in his presentation of evidence before the IJ. \u201cAt the core of due process are the requirements of notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Jarbough, </em>483 F.3d at 190. The hearing was initially set for March 14, 2013, but was held two weeks later on March 28, 2013. As the IJ indicated, Fakhouri \u201cexpressed some surprise\u201d that the hearing was being held on that day because he had not received notice of the rescheduled date. Fakhouri conceded, however, that he was prepared and indicated that the hearing should proceed. A.R. at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Fakhouri\u2019s claim that the IJ failed to sufficiently cross-examine him is also unavailing. The IJ has a duty to establish and develop the record. <em>Toure v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 310, 325 (3d Cir.2006); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(l). At the preliminary hearing, the IJ informed Fakhouri of his right to present evidence in the form of testimony, witnesses, and documentation. A.R. at 185-86. At the hearing, the IJ specifically questioned Fakhouri about his fear of returning to Morocco. A.R. at 29-30. The IJ\u2019s duty, however, does not relieve Fakhouri of his ultimate burden of proving his entitlement to relief under CAT, which is well established. <em>See Lavi-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>ra <em>v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>478 F.3d 158, 166 (3d Cir.2007). Fakhouri does not allege that he was prevented from presenting any particular evidence, nor do we perceive that the IJ limited his testimony in any manner. Accordingly, the IJ did not violate his duty to develop the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Finally, Fakhouri argues that the BIA failed to make a pronouncement on his credibility and to \u201cverify\u201d his evidence. A review of these alleged constitutional claims reveals they are not colorable. The BIA specifically acknowledged that the IJ had found Fakhouri credible, and it did not discount his testimony. The essence of Fakhouri\u2019s arguments relates to how the IJ, and the BIA on review, weighed the evidence; these are arguments which we lack jurisdiction to consider. <em>See Jarbough, </em>483 F.3d at 190 (\u201cRecasting challenges to factual or discretionary determinations as due process or other constitutional claims is clearly insufficient to give this Court jurisdiction under \u00a7 [12521(a)(2)(D).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Based on the foregoing, we will grant in part and deny in part the motion to dismiss. To the extent we have jurisdiction, we will summarily deny the petition for review. Petitioner\u2019s motions for a stay of removal, for appointment of counsel, \u201cfor injunctive/declaratory relief, motion for reconsideration, and request for certified administrative record,\u201d and \u201cfor less filing number of the brief copies &amp; motion for extension for such filing\u201d are denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-5\">. The only specific evidence Fakhouri alleges that the IJ failed to consider was regarding human rights abuses by Moroccan Security Forces. The evidence he presented, however, involved alleged abuses by Security Forces against (1) individuals advocating for the independence of the Sahrawi people and demonstrating in opposition to continued Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara, A.R. at 306-08, 310-11, 328, 331, 351, and (2) migrants and asylum seekers, A.R. at 330, 333-34. The only other evidence in the record is alleged abuses during the arrest of an individual who posted a picture of the Prince Moulay Rachid on Facebook, A.R. at 314. None of this evidence is relevant to Fak-houri's CAT claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
