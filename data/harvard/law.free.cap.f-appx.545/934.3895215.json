After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-17\">At Schatz\u2019s trial, the government called Detective Charles Ramos of the Special Victims Unit of the Boykin Beach, Florida, Police Department. Ramos testified that, during his investigation, he posed as a 15-year-old boy on a mobile phone social-networking application called Boya-hoy. The program allows users to locate other users nearby, view those users\u2019 online profiles, and send and receive instant messages. Ramos established an account using the name \u201cRick,\u201d uploading a photograph of another officer, who was 15 years old in the photo, as Rick\u2019s profile picture. Boyahoy\u2019s application restricts users to those over 18, so Ramos entered a birthday indicating Rick was of age. In Rick\u2019s profile, however, Ramos entered, \u201cI\u2019m 18 years old minus three years. Get it? Hee-hee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-18\">Ramos testified that he soon received an instant message from an individual named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>Gary (later identified as Schatz). Schatz\u2019s profile stated that he \u201cwould like to find a nice boy to chill with.\u201d Detective Ramos, playing the role of Rick, exchanged messages with Schatz. In one, Schatz asked whether Rick was in college. Rick answered that he was in high school and was planning on attending college \u201c[i]n a couple of years.\u201d Soon, Schatz sent Rick his telephone number, and the two exchanged text messages. In three of those exchanges, Rick made reference to being only 15 years old. Schatz asked Rick if they could meet, suggesting they have sex. Ramos apprehended Schatz at the location where Schatz had agreed to meet Rick.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">At trial, the government also called Richard Klein, who testified that, beginning when he was 12, he had sexual interactions with Schatz. He testified that his mother found out when he was 14 and called police. Initially, Klein told police what happened but recanted his testimony days later. Klein testified that, when he recanted, he was still under Schatz\u2019s persuasion. He continued to see Schatz until he was about 15 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Schatz also testified, denying he knew \u201cRick\u201d was 15 years old. He said he believed Rick to be at least 18 because he was on Boyahoy, which banned underage users, and because he looked 18 in his photograph. Schatz said he never looked at Rick\u2019s profile statement about being underage and that he was distracted when Rick told him he was 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">The jury ultimately found Schatz guilty, and the district court sentenced him to 264 months\u2019 imprisonment. This is Schatz\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">Schatz first contends the district court erred by failing to state on the record the specific reasons for admitting Klein\u2019s testimony, which the government introduced under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), before admitting it (rather than, as the court did, afterwards). Although Schatz objected to the introduction of Klein\u2019s testimony, he did not object to the timing of the court\u2019s enunciation of its reasons for doing so. Accordingly, we review the court\u2019s failure to give specific reasons for admitting the testimony beforehand only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Madruga, </em>810 F.2d 1010, 1014 (11th Cir.1987) (\u201c[T]o preserve objections to admissibility of evidence, [the] objection must state specific grounds; otherwise, review is only for plain error.\u201d). To reverse, we must find \u201c(1) error, (2), that is plain, ... (3) that affects [the defendant\u2019s] substantial rights,\u201d and \u201c(4) [that] seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1202-03 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">Schatz relies on <em>United States v. Youts, </em>229 F.3d 1312, 1318 (10th Cir.2000), in which the Tenth Circuit stated \u201cthat the court\u2019s Rule 404(b) articulation must occur <em>prior </em>to its decision whether to admit the evidence.\u201d This is \u201cto ensure that the decision to admit or exclude be made <em>only after </em>issues and reasons are exposed and clearly stated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The reasoning in <em>Youts </em>is persuasive, but, unfortunately for Schatz, <em>Youts </em>could not make the error he identifies plain. \u201cIt is the law of this circuit that, at least where the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003). As a result, we cannot reverse Schatz\u2019s conviction on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">Schatz next argues the district court limited his cross-examination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>Klein in violation of his rights under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. We review a district court\u2019s limitation of cross-examination for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>26 F.3d 1533, 1539 (11th Cir.1994). The district court abuses its discretion if the jury would have had a \u201csignificantly different impression of the witness\u2019 credibility had counsel pursued the proposed line of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">At trial, Schatz\u2019s counsel cross-examined Klein, attempting to establish that Klein had a strong motive to lie, including a financial interest (a potential civil suit against Schatz) and a retributive interest. Schatz argues the district court limited counsel\u2019s lines of questioning, and, as a result, he was unable to expose Klein\u2019s credibility problems. We do not agree. Schatz\u2019s counsel asked Klein <em>four times </em>about a potential civil suit, but Klein responded that he had not contemplated a civil suit against Schatz and that no one in his family had pressured him to do so. The government even asked Klein whether he was seeking civil damages against Schatz when he finally gave a sworn statement against Schatz in 2009, and Klein replied that he was not. Schatz\u2019s counsel also elicited testimony about Klein\u2019s potential retributive interests in testifying against Schatz. On cross-examination, Klein admitted he eventually sought criminal charges against Schatz three years after he originally recanted his story to police but no prosecution followed. He admitted he wanted to testify against Schatz in this case and that his mother wanted him to testify as well. Defense counsel clearly had the opportunity to, and did, pursue the lines of cross-examination Schatz now says he was denied. That Klein did not answer in the way Schatz wanted is of no moment. Schatz identifies nothing further he could have presented that may have changed the jury\u2019s view of Klein\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">Schatz next asserts the district court erroneously declined to declare a mistrial during Detective Ramos\u2019s testimony. Ramos described his investigation after Schatz\u2019s arrest and told the jury he obtained a search warrant for Schatz\u2019s mobile phone. Counsel for the government asked \u201chow that works,\u201d and Ramos responded: \u201cAs most phones do ... this phone had a pass code lock.Since we did not know the password for the phone and the defendant did not give it to us[,] we enlisted the help of Google.\u201d Schatz objected, arguing Ramos was improperly commenting on his right to remain silent and moved for a mistrial. The court denied the motion but gave the following curative instruction to which counsel did not object:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-11\">The last answer by Officer Ramos did implicate Mr. Schatz\u2019s right to remain silent. I instruct you that this was entirely improper under the United States Constitution where a defendant has the right to remain silent. The court orders that answer stricken from the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-12\">I further instruct you to disregard the answer and you are not to consider the answer in deciding this case for or against the government or for or against Mr. Schatz.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">We review a district court\u2019s refusal to declare a mistrial based on a comment regarding a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Dodd, </em>111 F.3d 867, 869 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cA comment is deemed to be a reference to a defendant\u2019s silence if it was the prosecutor\u2019s manifest intention to refer to the defendant\u2019s silence or if it was of such a character that the jury would natu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>rally and necessarily understand it to be a comment on the defendant\u2019s silence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Schatz contends Ramos must have intended to comment on Schatz\u2019s silence. And he argues the jury necessarily would have understood Ramos\u2019s statement as a comment on his silence. Finally, Schatz asserts the court\u2019s curative instruction did more harm than good by drawing attention to Ramos\u2019s impermissible comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">We do not agree that Ramos\u2019s one-off comment, combined with the court\u2019s curative instruction, demanded a mistrial. Ramos made the comment to preface his technical discussion of how he went about extracting incriminating information from Schatz\u2019s mobile phone. And there is no manifest intention to comment on a defendant\u2019s silence \u201cif some other explanation for [the] remark is equally plausible.\u201d <em>United States v. Swindall, </em>971 F.2d 1531, 1551-52 (11th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). There is also no indication the jury necessarily would have understood-the statement to be a comment on Schatz\u2019s silence. Ramos did not say Schatz refused to give his password, and he did not discuss Schatz\u2019s failure to do so at length. This is especially so in light of the court\u2019s curative instruction, which Schatz cannot show was plainly erroneous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Dodd, </em>111 F.3d at 870 (\u201cWhere the district court gives a curative instruction, the district court\u2019s refusal to declare a mistrial will not be overturned unless the evidence is so highly prejudicial as to be incurable.\u201d). The court struck Ramos\u2019s entire answer from the record and asked the jury not to consider it at all in deciding Schatz\u2019s guilt or innocence. \u201cWe presume that juries follow the instructions given to them.\u201d <em>United States v. Townsend, </em>630 F.3d 1003, 1013-14 (11th Cir.2011). The district court accordingly did not abuse its discretion in declining to declare a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">Next, Schatz asserts the government\u2019s misconduct during closing argument resulted in prejudice warranting a new trial. He contends the government improperly shifted the burden of proof, alluded to evidence not in the record, and made an unfounded personal attack. We review <em>de novo </em>claims of prosecutorial misconduct. <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cTo establish prose-cutorial misconduct, (1) the remarks must be improper, and (2) the remarks must prejudicially affect the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhen the record contains sufficient independent evidence of guilt, any error is harmless.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">Even assuming the government\u2019s comments at closing argument were improper, we conclude any error was harmless because there was sufficient independent evidence of Schatz\u2019s guilt. A defendant is guilty of attempted enticement if he, using any means of interstate commerce, knowingly attempts to entice a minor to engage in any sexual activity. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b). Detective Ramos testified that Schatz, using his mobile phone (a means of interstate commerce), initiated contact with Ramos\u2019s alias, Rick. Schatz asked Rick to meet him, said they could have sex, and coordinated the details of the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-13\">Schatz\u2019s defense was that he did not do any of this knowing Rick was a minor, but the government presented overwhelming evidence of intent as well. Schatz continued talking to Rick even when Rick said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>three times that he was only 15 years old. In one exchange, Rick said, \u201cbeing 15 I have not done much,\u201d and asked whether that was alright. Schatz responded: \u201cFor sure.\u201d Klein\u2019s testimony corroborated Schatz\u2019s intent to pursue a minor. Further, the jury was entitled to disbelieve Schatz\u2019s testimony that he did not know Rick was a minor and consider Schatz\u2019s denial as substantive evidence of his guilt. <em>See United States v. Kendrick, </em>682 F.3d 974, 985 (11th Cir.2012). Because overwhelming independent evidence supported each element of a \u00a7 2422(b) conviction, any error during closing argument was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Finally, Schatz argues the errors detailed above cumulatively denied him the right to a fair trial. \u201cThe cumulative error doctrine provides that an aggregation of non-reversible errors (ie., plain errors failing to necessitate reversal and harmless errors) can yield a denial of the constitutional right to a fair trial, which calls for reversal.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1223 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe harmlessness of cumulative error is determined by conducting the same inquiry as for individual error \u2014 courts look to see whether the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were affected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Schatz cannot prevail on his claim that cumulative error deprived him of a fair trial. As we detailed above, the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">For the foregoing reasons, Schatz\u2019s conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-5\">. The government contends Schatz invited any error in the court\u2019s curative instruction by affirmatively stating he did not object to it. We are doubtful the doctrine of invited error applies. In any event, because we conclude Schatz\u2019s contentions fail even if we choose to review them for plain error, we decline to conclude the error was invited.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
