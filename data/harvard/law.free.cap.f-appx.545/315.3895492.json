Over his objection, the district court applied a 16-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to Guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because Orta Lopez had been previously removed following a conviction of a felony constituting a crime of violence. Following a two-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, Orta Lopez\u2019 total offense level was 22; combined with his criminal-history category of III, his advisory Guidelines sentencing range was 51 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court varied downward and sentenced Orta Lopez, <em>inter alia, </em>to 40 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">First, Orta Lopez contends: his felony conviction for burglary of a habitation falls under Texas\u2019 \u201cgreater right to possession\u201d theory; therefore, it does not constitute a conviction for generic burglary under <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); and, accordingly, it is not a conviction for burglary of a dwelling under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 and not a crime of violence. Orta Lopez\u2019 claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir.2013), which rejected an identical argument and affirmed a 16-level sentencing enhancement under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1). <em>Morales-Mota </em>was decided after the Government filed its brief. In his reply brief, Orta Lopez concedes this issue is foreclosed, but continues to raise it in order to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Second, Orta Lopez contends the court erred in failing to award him a third point for acceptance of responsibility. He asserts the Government improperly denied the additional level based on his refusal to plead guilty pursuant to an agreement wherein he waived his appellate rights. As Orta Lopez concedes, his contention is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 378-79 (5th Cir.2008); he raises the issue only to preserve it for possible further review. <em>(Newson </em>held a district court cannot award a reduction under Guideline \u00a7 3E1.1 unless a motion is filed by the Government; the Government, however, can decline to move for an additional acceptance point based on defendant\u2019s refusal to waive his appellate rights. <em>See id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Third, Orta Lopez contends the court plainly erred in convicting, sentencing, and entering judgment against him under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), because he was not deported following an \u201caggravated felony\u201d conviction, as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). He urges the sentence be vacated and remanded for resentencing or, in the alternative, the judgment be reformed. The Government agrees the judgment erroneously reflects a conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), but it contends the judgment should be reformed to reflect a conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(1) (removal subsequent to other-than-aggravated felony conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Having failed to raise the issue in district court, Orta Lopez acknowledges review is only for plain error. E.g., <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 368 (5th Cir.2009). Orta Lopez must therefore show, <em>inter alia, </em>a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Orta Lopez\u2019 Texas conviction of burglary of a habitation does not qualify as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) because he was sentenced to deferred-adjudication probation. <em>E.g., id. </em>at 369. Orta Lopez concedes, however, he cannot show that the error affected his substantial rights because his sentence, which was below the advisory Guidelines range, did not exceed the statutory maximum under \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>E.g., id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>AFFIRMED. The judgment is REFORMED to reflect conviction and sentencing under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
