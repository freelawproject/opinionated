Moton, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Sergeant K. Walker on Moton\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Walker was a correctional officer at the Florida facility where Moton was incarcerated. Moton contends that Walker violated his rights under the Fourth and Eighth Amendments by conducting an unwarranted strip search of him and violated his rights under the First Amendment by retaliating against him for filing grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">As part of a routine cell inspection, Walker conducted a visual body cavity search of Moton that required him to remove his clothing. Walker instructed him to bend at the waist, spread his buttocks, and cough, and he had to perform those actions three times. Moton alleges that the search was unjustified because Walker never accused him of possessing contraband, and Walker had \u201ca lewd, sadistic, malicious smile on his face\u201d while conducting the search. In addition to contending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>that the search violated his Fourth and Eighth Amendment rights, Moton contends that Walker conducted it to retaliate against Moton for filing grievances about prison conditions. Walker wrote two disciplinary reports based on Moton\u2019s conduct during the search, and Moton alleges that those reports were false and that Walker wrote them to retaliate against Moton for filing grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The district court concluded that Walker was entitled to summary judgment on all claims because Moton had failed to show any genuine issues of material fact and because Walker was entitled to qualified immunity on all of the claims. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, viewing all of the facts in the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n, </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1161-62 (11th Cir.2006). We may affirm a district court\u2019s judgment on any ground supported by the record. <em>Bircoll v. Miami-Dade Cnty., </em>480 F.3d 1072, 1088 n. 21 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">\u201cQualified immunity protects government officials performing discretionary functions from suits in their individual capacities unless their conduct violates clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Whittier v. Kobayashi, </em>581 F.3d 1304, 1307 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). To receive qualified immunity, an official must first establish that he was engaged in a discretionary function when the allegedly wrongful acts occurred. <em>Id. </em>If the official was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the official is not entitled to qualified immunity. <em>Crosby v. Monroe Cnty., </em>394 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.2004). In order carry that burden, \u201cthe plaintiff must show two things: (1) that the defendant has committed a constitutional violation and (2) that the constitutional right the defendant violated was \u2018clearly established\u2019 at the time he did it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">We use two methods to determine if a right is clearly established. <em>Fils v. City of Aventura, </em>647 F.3d 1272, 1291 (11th Cir.2011). The first one \u201clooks at the relevant case law at the time of the violation\u201d to determine whether \u201ca concrete factual context exists so as to make it obvious to a reasonable government actor that his actions violate federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration and quotation marks omitted). The second method considers \u201cthe officer\u2019s conduct, and inquires whether that conduct lies so obviously at the very core of what the [constitution] prohibits that the unlawfulness of the conduct was readily apparent to [the officer], notwithstanding the lack of fact-specific case law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">Moton alleges that in conducting the search, Walker violated his Fourth Amendment rights because the search was unreasonable and his Eighth Amendment rights because the search constituted sexual abuse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[P]risoners retain a constitutional right to bodily privacy.\u201d <em>Fortner v. Thomas, </em>983 F.2d 1024, 1030 (11th Cir.1993). Even so, the Supreme Court and this Court have held that strip searches, including body cavity inspections, are not a violation of an inmate\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights when they are conducted after a contact visit or upon the inmate\u2019s entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>to a facility as long as the searches are conducted in a reasonable and non-abusive manner. <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (searching inmates after a contact visit); <em>Powell v. Barrett, </em>541 F.3d 1298, 1314 (11th Cir.2008) (en banc) (searching inmates upon entry).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Walker was acting within his discretionary authority as a corrections officer when he conducted the search. He stated in his affidavit \u2014 and Moton did not contradict him \u2014 that officers routinely conducted searches of inmates\u2019 cells and those searches sometimes included strip searches and visual body cavity inspections. Under Florida law, prison authorities may conduct strip searches, including a visual inspection of the inmate\u2019s rectum, when inmates arrive, after inmates have contact with the public, after inmates attempt an escape, and \u201cat any time when they are suspected of carrying contraband.\u201d Fla. Admin. Code \u00a7 33-602.204(2)(b), (2)(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In <em>Powell </em>we made it clear that \u201c[t]he <em>Bell </em>decision means that the Fourth Amendment does not require reasonable suspicion for [body cavity inspection strip searches] in detention facilities.\u201d 541 F.3d at 1308. We concluded that some courts had misinterpreted <em>Bell </em>as \u201crequiring, or at least permitting lower courts to require, reasonable suspicion as a condition for detention facility strip searches, especially those that involve visual body cavity inspections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1306. We explained that a court must consider four factors in balancing the need for the search against the invasion of personal rights: \u201cthe scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1305 (quotation marks omitted). We then explained that the final two factors \u201cmerged into one heavy consideration\u201d in the <em>Bell </em>case \u201cbecause the searches took place in a detention facility, and the justification for them was the critically important security needs of the facility.\u201d Mat 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">It is clear from our ease law that a visual body cavity search of an inmate after he has had contact with the outside world is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, even if the search is not justified by reasonable suspicion. Moton, however, was searched not after contact with the outside world but as part of a routine search of his cell. Our case law has not established that a visual body cavity inspection as part of a routine search is constitutional under the Fourth Amendment, but more importantly, our case law has not clearly established that such a search is unconstitutional. Given our strong statement in <em>Powell </em>that a prison official does not need reasonable suspicion to conduct a visual body cavity inspection and the strong considerations given to the prison\u2019s need to maintain security, we cannot say that a reasonable officer in Walker\u2019s position would have believed that he was violating Motoris Fourth Amendment rights merely by conducting the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Motoris only remaining ground for asserting a Fourth Amendment violation, then, is that the search was conducted in an unreasonable manner because Walker required Moton to expose his rectum three times. The search, which was conducted in Motoris cell while his cellmate waited outside, followed the procedure required by Florida law, including being conducted by an officer of the same sex and being conducted out of view of the inmate population. Fla. Admin. Code \u00a7 33-602.204(2)(e). It is not clearly established that requiring an inmate to bend over, spread his buttocks, and cough, and requiring him to complete those actions three times, is an unreasonable and abu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>sive search. <em>Cf. Evans v. Stephens, </em>407 F.3d 1272, 1281-82 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that a strip search was unconstitutional because inmates were searched in an abnormal place, little privacy was observed, each inmate was penetrated by an object in front of the other, and the officers used threatening and racist language). Because Moton\u2019s clearly established rights under the Fourth Amendment were not violated, Walker is entitled to qualified immunity on Moton\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">A prison official\u2019s sexual abuse of a prisoner may violate the Eighth Amendment because sexual abuse has \u201cno legitimate penological purpose, and is simply not part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society.\u201d <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1111 (11th Cir.2006). To prove an Eighth Amendment violation based on sexual abuse, a prisoner must show that he suffered an injury that was objectively and sufficiently serious and that the prison official had a subjectively culpable state of mind. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Boxer X, </em>we concluded that \u201ca female prison guard\u2019s solicitation of a male prisoner\u2019s manual masturbation, even under the threat of reprisal, does not present more than de <em>minimis </em>injury\u201d and affirmed the dismissal of the Eighth Amendment claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Even if Sergeant Walker lacked a legitimate penological purpose in conducting a strip search of Moton and his alleged smile revealed a \u201csubjectively culpable state of mind,\u201d there was no evidence that Moton suffered any injury that was objectively more serious than the injury in <em>Boxer X </em>that we found to be de <em>minimis. See Boxer X, </em>437 F.3d at 1111. Because there was no constitutional violation, Walker is entitled to qualified immunity on Moton\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Under the First Amendment, a prison official may not retaliate against an inmate for exercising his free speech rights, including the right to complain about the conditions of confinement and to file prison grievances. <em>Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1248 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cAn inmate may maintain a cause of action for retaliation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 by showing that a prison official\u2019s actions were <em>the result of </em>the inmate\u2019s having filed a grievance concerning the conditions of his imprisonment.\u201d <em>O\u2019Bryant v. Finch, </em>637 F.3d 1207, 1212 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation marks and brackets omitted). To establish causation, the plaintiff must show that the defendant was \u201csubjectively motivated to discipline\u201d the plaintiff for exercising his First Amendment rights. <em>Smith v. Mosley, </em>532 F.3d 1270, 1278 (11th Cir.2008). A prisoner who claims that the defendant\u2019s retaliatory conduct was writing false disciplinary reports cannot maintain that claim if, after he is given due process, he is \u201cconvicted\u201d of the behavioral violation alleged in the reports and there is \u201cevidence to sustain the conviction.\u201d <em>O\u2019Bryant, </em>637 F.3d at 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">As a result of Moton\u2019s behavior during the search, Walker wrote two disciplinary reports, alleging that Moton failed to comply with orders and threatened Walker. According to Walker, when he asked Moton to bend at the waist, Moton refused to comply, saying, \u201cFuck this shit. I ain\u2019t doing it,\u201d and then told Walker, \u201cI\u2019ve got a natural life sentence. I\u2019ve got nothing but time. I\u2019ll get you.\u201d Moton, unsurprisingly, disputes this, but he was found guilty of the conduct at a disciplinary hearing based on the testimony presented by another officer and an inmate, which corroborated much of Walker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>statement. Moton makes no argument that the disciplinary hearing did not afford him due process or that there was no evidence to support his conviction for the behavioral violation. Therefore, Moton cannot maintain a claim that the disciplinary reports Walker wrote constituted retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Moton\u2019s retaliation claim based on the search itself also fails because he has not offered any evidence that his grievance filings caused Walker to conduct the search. In his complaint and in his brief to this Court, Moton identified several officers who allegedly targeted him because he frequently files grievances, and he asserts that there was a \u201cculture\u201d in Florida Department of Corrections that frowned upon filing grievances. None of those allegations, however, links Walker with the other officers who allegedly retaliated against Moton. Apart from his own bare, conclusory allegations, Moton offers no evidence that Walker was part of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to target him because of the grievances he had filed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Harris v. Ostrout, </em>65 F.3d 912, 916 (11th Cir.1995) (affirming summary judgment against the inmate when he \u201cproduced nothing, beyond his own conclusory allegations,\u201d suggesting that the officer was motivated by retaliatory animus).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">The only evidence that sheds light on Walker\u2019s motives does not lead to a reasonable inference that he chose to search Moton because of Moton\u2019s grievance filing. Moton alleges that Walker had a \u201clewd, sadistic, malicious\u201d smile on his face during the search. He also alleges<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that Walker was not assigned to his dorm on the day of the search and did not log in as required when he entered Moton\u2019s dorm. It is also true that Walker has not offered any evidence that he believed Moton possessed contraband other than his vague statement in his affidavit that \u201cit was determined that a strip search of [Moton and his cellmate] was necessary.\u201d Even if we assume that Walker acted without reasonable suspicion and was targeting Moton (an assumption undermined by the fact that Walker conducted a strip search of Moton\u2019s roommate as well), Moton has not asserted any facts showing that Walker wanted to target him because he had filed a lot of grievances. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Walker on Moton\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-9\">. Although Moton also purported to appeal the district court's denial of his motion to alter or amend judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), he makes no argument on this point and so has abandoned it. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhile we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a pro se litigant are deemed abandoned.\") (citation omitted). For the same reason, he has abandoned any argument that the district erred in finding that his claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were moot as a result of Walker\u2019s retirement and Moton\u2019s transfer to another prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\">. Moton argued to the district court that the search also violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights, but because he did not make any argument about that on appeal, he has abandoned that claim. <em>See Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b883-6\">. Moton makes much of the fact that, after he had filed several grievances, he was limited to five per day. But there is no evidence that Walker was involved in that decision or even that the policy was implemented as a punishment instead of as cost-saving measure, which is the reason the warden gave for it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b883-7\">. Moton submitted a motion for discovery of Walker\u2019s duty assignment the day of the search, but the district court did not rule on it. Moton argues that the district court abused its discretion in not granting that motion. Because we conclude that Walker is entitled to summary judgment even assuming the truth of Moton\u2019s allegation that Walker was not assigned to Moton\u2019s dorm that day, his discovery request, if granted, would not have enabled him to show a genuine issue of material fact. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting summary judgment before ruling on Moton\u2019s discovery motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a) (\"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b883-12\">.Moton\u2019s motion for leave to file a reply brief out of time is GRANTED, and that brief was considered in reaching this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
