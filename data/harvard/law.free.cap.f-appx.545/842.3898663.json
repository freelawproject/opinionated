They contend that the district court erred in determining that the State Farm automobile policy issued to Veronica and Gabriel Baldassini did not cover the bodily injuries that Fiallo suffered as a result of an accident involving a vehicle driven by Sol Baldassini.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">In 2010 fifteen-year-old Sol Baldassini was driving along the streets of the Village of Key Biscayne, Florida in a 2009 E-ZGO ST Express, a four-wheel electric vehicle manufactured by Textron, Inc., the parent company of E-Z-GO. The vehicle\u2019s owners had left it in the care of the Bal-dassinis while away on a trip, and Sol, the daughter of Veronica and Gabriel, had taken it for a ride. While driving the vehicle Sol accidentally hit Fiallo, pinning him between the ST Express and his truck. Fial-lo was seriously injured and brought claims for his injuries against Sol, her parents, and the owners of the vehicle. The owners, who are not parties to this lawsuit, had insured the ST Express under a State Farm recreational vehicle policy, and they submitted a claim for which State Farm paid Fiallo $100,000. Having no recreational vehicle policy, the Baldassinis sought coverage under their State Farm automobile policy instead. State Farm denied their claim on the ground that the \u201cgolf cart involved in [the] loss does not qualify as a car.\u201d The Baldassinis then settled with Fiallo, assigning him their right to pursue coverage under their insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">After that assignment, State Farm filed a declaratory judgment action against Fiallo and the Baldassinis in federal district court seeking a declaration that the ST Express was not a \u201ccar\u201d under the Baldassinis\u2019 insurance contract. Fiallo and the Baldassinis answered the complaint and counterclaimed for breach of contract. After considering cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment for State Farm, finding that the contract was unambiguous and that the vehicle was not covered by it. Fiallo and the Baldassinis now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Hamilton v. Southland Christian Sch., Inc., </em>680 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir.2012). We also review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation of contract provisions. <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Holcim (US), Inc., </em>548 F.3d 1352, 1356 (11th Cir.2008). Florida law governs our interpretation of the contract here. <em>See Fernandez v. Bankers Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>906 F.2d 559, 564-65 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-18\">This case hinges on whether the ST Express fits within the definition of \u201ccar\u201d in the Baldassinis\u2019 State Farm contract. That contract defines a car as \u201ca land motor vehicle with four or more wheels, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>which is designed for use mainly on public roads.\u201d Because the parties agree that an E-Z-GO ST Express \u201cis a land motor vehicle with four or more wheels,\u201d the only question we must decide is whether it was \u201cdesigned for use mainly on public roads.\u201d If the answer is yes, Fiallo and the Baldas-sinis can defeat summary judgment (and possibly win summary judgment themselves) because the contract will cover the vehicle. Alternatively, they can overcome summary judgment if the definition is ambiguous, because ambiguities in insurance contracts are interpreted in favor of the insured. <em>Garcia v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>969 So.2d 288, 291 (Fla.2007). Here, however, Fiallo and the Baldassinis cannot prevail because the contract\u2019s meaning is plain and the vehicle in question is not covered by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Under Florida law, \u201cinsurance contracts are construed according to their plain meaning.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>969 So.2d at 291 (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Harrington v. Citizens Prop. Ins. Corp., </em>54 So.3d 999, 1001 (Fla.App. 4th DCA 2010) (\u201cInsurance policy terms must be given their everyday meaning and should be read with regard[ ] to ordinary people\u2019s skill and experience.\u201d). As one Florida District Court of Appeal has explained, the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cdesigned for use\u201d is that an object has been made for a particular purpose so that it can be used for that purpose with reasonable efficiency and safety. <em>Am. Emp. Ins. Co. v. Yeomans, </em>356 So.2d 1281, 1285 (Fla.App. 2d DCA 1978) (\u201c \u2018[Djesigned for use with\u2019 seems to us to connote an object planned with a particular use in mind and so manufactured as to serve that use with reasonable efficiency and safety.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Another Florida District Court of Appeal has interpreted the phrase \u201cmainly on public roads\u201d to mean that a vehicle is \u201cprimarily\u201d used on \u201cpublic highways.\u201d <em>See State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Becraft, </em>501 So.2d 1316, 1317 (Fla.App. 4th DCA 1986) (\u201cUnquestionably, the dune buggy involved here was primarily designed for use off the public highways, albeit it was usable on such highways, and was licensed therefor, and on occasion used thereon.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Applying the everyday meaning of the phrase \u201cdesigned for use mainly on public roads\u201d to the ST Express can lead to only one conclusion. That vehicle was not designed for use mainly on public roads. Its manual says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-8\">These vehicles are <em>designed </em>and manufactured <em>for off-road use. </em>They do not conform to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and are not <em>equipped for operation on public streets.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">(emphasis added). Textron, the manufacturer, even placed a sticker on the ST Express\u2019 dashboard warning against driving the vehicle on highways. It also did not equip the ST Express with a number of safety features required by law for passenger cars driven on public roads: a brake system acting on all wheels, a windshield meeting applicable glazing requirements, a windshield defrosting and defogging system, a compliant transmission shift lever, an outside rearview mirror, and a compliant seatbelt assembly and anchorage system. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 571. Nor did the owners or anyone else make modifications to the vehicle to make it roadworthy, such as increasing its maximum speed beyond its original limit of 16.5 miles per hour.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Angelotta v. Sec. Nat. Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number><em>Co., </em>117 So.3d 1214, 1216-17 (Fla.App. 5th DCA 2013) (holding that, by modifying a golf cart to exceed 20 miles per hour, the owner had converted it into a vehicle capable of being operated on public roads); <em>Becraft, </em>501 So.2d at 1318 (holding that an owner converted an off-road dune buggy into an on-road vehicle when he. modified and licensed it for use on Florida highways). As a result, the ST Express would be banned from interstate highways in the at least twenty-five states that require vehicles to drive 40 miles per hour or faster. <em>See </em>Victor Muchuruza <em>&amp; </em>Renatus N. Mus-sa, <em>Speeds on Rural Interstate Highways Relative to Posting the W mph Minimum Speed Limit, </em>7 J. Transp. &amp; Statistics, nos. 2/3, 2004, at 71, 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">All of this establishes that, even though the ST Express has some safety features, like brake lights, that would minimize some of the dangers of driving it on a highway, it is not, as the policy language requires, \u201cdesigned for use mainly on public roads.\u201d Because unambiguous policy terms are enforced as they are written, <em>see Garcia, </em>969 So.2d at 291, and because the ST Express does not fit within the plain meaning of the definition of \u201ccar\u201d in State Farm\u2019s contract, that contract does not cover Fiallo and the Baldassinis\u2019 claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-5\">. A 1998 final rule of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration set the minimum top speed for on-road \"golf cars\u201d at 20 miles per hour. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, 63 Fed.Reg. 33,194, 33,209 (June 17, 1998) (to be codified at 49 C.F.R. pt. 571). Florida law also sets the minimum top speed for <em>on-road </em>golf carts, or as they are now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>known \u201clow-speed vehicles,\u201d at 20 miles per hour. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fla.

The ST Express lacked the top speed that federal and Florida law require for road use vehicles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b867-8\">. We note that Fiallo and the Baldassinis argue that, if the ST Express is not a car under State Farm\u2019s definition, the terms \"car\u201d and \"private passenger car\u201d in the contract become superfluous. We disagree. A vehicle may be \"designed for use mainly on public roads\u201d (and therefore a car under State Farm\u2019s definition) yet not be \"designed solely to carry persons and their luggage\u201d (which is an attribute of private passenger cars under its definition). For example, a \"car\u201d might have the primary purpose of carrying cargo, materials, or tools.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A2Mc\">.
