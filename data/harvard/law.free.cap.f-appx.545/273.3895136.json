He was sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of 20 years of imprisonment. Thomas now seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal to chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>lenge the denial of his motion for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). By so moving, Thomas challenges the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">To the extent that Thomas contends that the provisions of the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA), which amended the amounts of crack needed to trigger statutory minimum sentences, should apply to him, the district court lacked authority to reduce his sentence below the statutory minimum sentence of 20 years. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 578-81 (5th Cir.2010). Accordingly, Thomas\u2019s argument that he is entitled to a reduction in light of the FSA is without merit. <em>Cf. Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2335-36, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012) (\u201c[I]n federal sentencing the ordinary practice is to apply new penalties to defendants not yet sentenced.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Thomas\u2019s argument that the district court erred by not considering the mitigating factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when determining whether to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is likewise unavailing. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). To the extent that Thomas seeks to challenge his original sentence on the basis that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, arguments challenging an original sentence are not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Because Thomas has failed to demonstrate a nonfrivolous issue for appeal, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24. The appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
