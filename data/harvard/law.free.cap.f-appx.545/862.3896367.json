Harris, a pre-trial detainee, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his pro <em>se </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint, filed as \u201cnext friend\u201d on behalf of his father, Rudolph Harris, Sr. In the original complaint, Mr. Harris alleged that his father\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the execution of a search warrant at his father\u2019s home. The district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice for lack of standing, finding that Mr. Harris had failed to prove that he was the appropriate next friend to his father. On appeal, Mr. Harris argues that the district court improperly dismissed his complaint because he met the next friend standard, and alternatively, that he should have been given the opportunity to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>dismissals of cases for lack of standing. <em>See Scott v. Taylor, </em>470 F.3d 1014, 1017 (11th Cir.2006). Dismissal of an <em>in forma pauperis </em>complaint is proper if the action or claim fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). The standards that apply to a dismissal under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) apply to a dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>See Leal v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">A district court is usually prohibited from dismissing a complaint <em>sua sponte </em>if it has failed to provide notice of its intent to dismiss or provide an opportunity to respond. <em>See Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1057 (11th Cir.2007). Nonetheless, even if a party does not have notice that the district court is considering a dismissal, the court may dismiss an action without notice if the complaint is patently frivolous or if amendment would be futile. <em>See Tazoe v. Airbus S.A.S., </em>631 F.3d 1321, 1336 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">Generally, plaintiffs may not sue on behalf of third parties. <em>See Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, however, provide that an incompetent person who does not have a duly appointed representative may sue by a \u201cnext friend.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(c)(2). Next friend standing is not granted automatically to whoever seeks to pursue an action on behalf of another. <em>See Whitmore v. Arkansas, </em>495 U.S. 149, 163, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990). First, the next friend must provide an explanation\u2014 such as mental incompetence or disability \u2014 as to why the real party in interest cannot appear on his own behalf. <em>Id. </em>at 163, 110 S.Ct. 1717. Second, the next friend must be truly dedicated to the best interests of the person on whose behalf he seeks to litigate. <em>Id. </em>at 163-64, 110 S.Ct. 1717. \u201c[I]t has been further suggested that the \u2018next friend\u2019 must have some significant relationship with the real party in interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 110 S.Ct. 1717.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">Next friend status has been denied in several cases based on a purported next friend\u2019s failure to demonstrate his \u201ctrue dedication\u201d to the best interests of the real party in interest. <em>See Sanchez-Velasco v. Sec. of Dept. of Corr., </em>287 F.3d 1015, 1029 (11th Cir.2002) (overruling district court\u2019s grant of next friend status to a party who appeared to be motivated by personal interest in opposing imposition of the death penalty); <em>Hauser ex. rel. Crawford v. Moore, </em>223 F.3d 1316, 1322 (11th Cir.2000) (expressing reservations about granting next friend status to parties who appeared to be motivated by their own desires to block imposition of the death penalty, but ultimately declining status based on failure to prove incompetency).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">A party seeking to establish next friend status bears the burden of clearly establishing the propriety of such status and thereby justifying the jurisdiction of the court. <em>See Whitmore, </em>495 U.S. at 163-64, 110 S.Ct. 1717. While the \u201ctrue dedication\u201d test may be satisfied when a close relative seeks to act as next friend, there may be reasons to doubt a relative\u2019s true dedication to the best interests of the real party in interest. <em>See Hauser, </em>223 F.3d at 1322 (noting reservations about whether inmate\u2019s biological mother, who gave him up for adoption, was dedicated to his best interests).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-15\">We conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Mr. Harris\u2019 complaint. Whether Mr. Harris\u2019 father\u2019s dementia is a sufficiently adequate explanation as to why he cannot appear on his own behalf is not at issue on appeal. Nevertheless, Mr. Harris has not demonstrated that he was the proper party to pursue the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>action on behalf of his father. Although our cases have never held that a party must be in the <em>best </em>position to bring a complaint on behalf of another, we have expressed reservations about granting next friend status to a party who is not the \u201cmost logical\u201d individual to litigate the case. <em>See Hauser, </em>223 F.3d at 1322 (stating that inmate\u2019s \u201cmost logical\u201d next friend was his court-appointed counsel and not his biological mother). In this case, Mr. Harris\u2019 sister, and not Mr. Harris, is the \u201cmost logical\u201d next friend. To begin, it is evident from the complaint that Mr. Harris\u2019 sister manages their father\u2019s economic and medical needs. Mr. Harris\u2019 own confinement in prison also casts serious doubt upon the propriety of awarding him next friend status, since his incarceration would impede his ability to effectively pursue the interests of his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Additionally, Mr. Harris has not established that he is dedicated to his father\u2019s best interests. The district court noted that Mr. Harris\u2019 current confinement arose out of the search he now attempts to challenge on his father\u2019s behalf. Mr. Harris, therefore, \u201chas a conflict of interest between representing the interests of his father and representing his own interest in challenging the validity of his arrest and current detention.\u201d D.E. 21 at 1. As it was clear from the complaint that Mr. Harris lacked standing, dismissal of his complaint without prejudice was appropriate. And because the dismissal was without prejudice, nothing prevented Mr. Harris from amending the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The district court\u2019s order of dismissal without prejudice is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
