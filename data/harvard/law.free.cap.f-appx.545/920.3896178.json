Golden received 360-months imprisonment while retaining his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence. The evidence Golden seeks to suppress is a warrant affidavit, which led to the discovery of the pornographic materials in question. The warrant was issued with the intent of collecting evidence of sexual abuse of a child less than 12 years of age. <em>See </em>Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-6-69.1 (1975). The affidavit mainly relied on statements from the victim of the aforementioned crime along with additional facts supplemented by the child\u2019s father. The crucial facts alleged Golden took pictures of the then 11-year-old victim while simultaneously removing the child\u2019s clothing. Golden argues on appeal that (1) the affidavit did not establish the reliability and credibility of the statements of the minor victim because the statements of the child were uncorroborated and inherently unreliable and (2) there was an insufficient nexus between the suspected offense in the affidavit and the evidence sought to be seized. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Golden\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Probable cause for a search warrant is established when the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d creates a \u201cfair probability\u201d that \u201cevidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>649 F.3d 1222, 1245 (11th Cir.2011) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such a probability exists when, under the circumstances, a reasonably prudent person would believe that the place contains evidence of a crime. <em>Id. </em>When a warrant is sought based on information provided by an informant, the issuing court engages in a \u201cbalanced assessment of the relative weights of all the various indicia of reliability (and unreliability) attending an informant\u2019s tip.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 234, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). While \u201can informant\u2019s \u2018veracity,\u2019 \u2018reliability\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 are all highly relevant in determining the value of his report,\u201d they are not \u201centirely separate and independent requirements to be rigidly exacted in every case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230, 103 S.Ct. 2317.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">When a warrant was issued based on the statement of a victim, this Court views the warrant with considerably less skepticism than one based on the statement of an anonymous informant. <em>United States v. Martinelli, </em>454 F.3d 1300, 1307 (11th Cir.2006). In the distinguishable context of a civil suit, this Court previously opined that statements of minor victims are not categorically unreliable or incredible, and that officers may seek a warrant based on the uncorroborated statement of a minor victim. <em>See Lowe v. Aldridge, </em>958 F.2d 1565, 1567, 1571 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">Golden has failed to prove the statements in the affidavit were in any way unreliable or lacked credibility. The information provided by the victim in this case was detailed, prompt, and certain facts were corroborated by the victim\u2019s father. Further, the victim was not a young child but rather an 11-year-old fully capable of understanding the gravity of the situation. The child and child\u2019s parents had no motive to falsify any information contained in the affidavit and rapidly reported the incident to police. Finally, the uncorroborated statements of the victim, despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>being 11 years old, is more than sufficient to justify a finding of probable cause, especially when considering the child\u2019s level of specificity and timeliness in reporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Golden\u2019s argument that there was an insufficient nexus between the conduct alleged in the affidavit and the evidence sought to be seized is unpersuasive. The Fourth Amendment requires a nexus between the item seized and the suspected criminal behavior. <em>Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 307, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967). The nexus is clearly established in this case. The search warrant authorized officers to search Golden\u2019s residence for evidence of sexual abuse of a child less than 12 years of age. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-69.1. Investigators were authorized to seize \u201cany electronic device capable of storing, capturing, recording, or viewing digital images\u201d for evidence of \u201csexual contact\u201d with the victim. <em>See id. </em>Sexual contact is defined as \u201c[a]ny touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person not married to the actor, done for the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either party.\u201d Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-6-60(3). Since the victim believed pictures were taken after hearing clicking noises and seeing flashes of light while being inappropriately touched by Golden, a search for electronic devices capable of storing visual evidence of his illicit conduct constitutes more than a sufficient nexus between the allegation and the electronic evidence sought to be seized. Therefore, Golden\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-6\">. \"We review a district court's denial of a defendant's motion to suppress under a mixed standard of review, examining the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and the district court\u2019s application of law to those facts <em>de novo.\" United States v.
