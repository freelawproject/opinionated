Rowe contends that the BIA deprived her of her due process rights by issuing a form order that incorrectly identified the type of relief she had sought, making it impossible to determine whether the BIA properly followed its own regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">As an initial matter, we are obligated to review our subject matter jurisdiction over Rowe\u2019s petition for review. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). We generally lack jurisdiction to review any claim by \u201can alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense\u201d covered in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2), which was the conceded basis for Rowe\u2019s removability. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). We also lack jurisdiction to review any claim by an alien regarding the granting of relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), which is the statutory basis for the waiver of inadmissibility that Rowe sought. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). Rowe\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance violated her due process rights, however, is a constitutional claim, which we retain jurisdiction to consider. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>constitutional challenges. <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). When the BIA issues a summary affirmance of an IJ\u2019s opinion under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s opinion as the final agency decision. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">To ensure due process, the BIA is required to follow its own regulations when exercising its discretion and issuing a decision. <em>See United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, </em>347 U.S. 260, 267-68, 74 S.Ct. 499, 503-04, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954). We have rejected a due process challenge to the BIA\u2019s one judge affirmance-without-opinion procedure. <em>See Lonyem, </em>352 F.3d at 1342 (recognizing that the Supreme Court\u2019s directive that absent constitutional constraints, \u201cadministrative agencies should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Regulations provide that a single BIA member may affirm an IJ\u2019s decision without opinion if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-6\">... the Board member determines that the result reached in the decision under review was correct; that any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial; and that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-7\">(A) [t]he issues on appeal are squarely controlled by existing Board or federal court precedent and do not involve the application of precedent to a novel factual situation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-8\">(B) [t]he factual and legal issues raised on appeal are not so substantial that the case warrants issuance of a written opinion in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)\u00ae. We have recognized that \u201cunder the INS regulations, no entitlement to a full opinion by the BIA exists,\u201d and the issuance of a one-sentence order is not \u201cevidence that the BIA member did not review the facts of [the petitioner\u2019s] case.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">Rowe\u2019s due process rights were not violated just because the BIA issued a form order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 1288-89. In the caption of the case the BIA did misidentify the form of relief that had been applied for as \u201casylum,\u201d but nothing in the record indicates that the BIA entirely failed to review Rowe\u2019s appeal or deviated from the regulatory requirements in determining whether the appeal met the criteria for the summary affirmance procedure. <em>See id. </em>at 1289. The BIA\u2019s order explicitly stated that the IJ\u2019s decision was the final agency decision, and the IJ\u2019s detailed 20-page opinion showed that he carefully considered Rowe\u2019s application for a \u00a7 212(h) waiver. Nothing in the record persuades us that the BIA actually believed it was considering the denial of an asylum application instead of a \u00a7 212(h) waiver of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">Additionally, Rowe makes no argument that her case did not fit the regulatory requirements for the affirmance-without-opinion procedure. The IJ\u2019s decision recounted Rowe\u2019s and her husband\u2019s testimony in detail and considered letters that Rowe had submitted to the court. In accordance with precedent, the IJ balanced the adverse factors evidencing Rowe\u2019s undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented on her behalf in order to determine whether a grant of relief in the exercise of discretion would be in the best interest of the United States. <em>See In re Mendez-Moralez, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 296, 299-300 (BIA 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>After discussing in detail the evidence presented, the IJ concluded that the adverse factors outweighed the positive ones. His decision states that he denied Rowe\u2019s application because she failed to show extreme hardship to her qualifying relatives and she did not warrant relief as a matter of discretion. Those conclusions involved the application of statutes and existing BIA precedent and did not involve any novel factual situation, making summary affirmance appropriate under BIA regulations. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(i)(A). Furthermore, in Rowe\u2019s appeal to the BIA, she merely challenged the IJ\u2019s factual determination that she had not shown extreme hardship, as well as the IJ\u2019s discretionary denial. For those reasons, the factual and legal issues raised on appeal were not so substantial that the ease warranted issuance of a written opinion. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(i)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
