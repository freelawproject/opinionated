California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Munoz-Munoz has not filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-18\">The record does reveal a clerical error in the judgment which stated the offense of conviction as \u201cPossession With Intent to Distribute a Quantity Exceeding Fifty (50) Grams, that is, Approximately 1.3 Grams of Methamphetamine,\u201d where the indictment, the guilty plea, and the district court at sentencing recognized the offense of conviction as possession with intent to distribute a quantity exceeding 50 grams, that is, approximately, 1.3 kilograms, of methamphetamine. The judgment should be corrected to reflect that Munoz-Munoz was convicted of possession with intent to distribute a quantity exceeding 50 grams, that is, approximately, 1.3 kilograms, of methamphetamine. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-23\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. This matter is REMANDED for correction of the clerical error pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b317-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
