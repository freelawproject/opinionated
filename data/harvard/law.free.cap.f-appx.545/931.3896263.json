After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">Prescott argues that he is entitled to a sentence reduction notwithstanding his status as a career offender, and that he should be resentenced based on the lowered mandatory minimum and statutory maximum sentences under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d). Citing to <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), he argues that his sentence was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), which was amended by Amendment 750. Prescott argues that we should not rely on our decision in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012), in the instant case because it relies unduly on Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Freeman, </em>does not specifically address career offenders, and lacks any in-depth analysis of the FSA\u2019s background. Prescott further argues that he was entitled to be resen-tenced under the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory penalties for crack-cocaine offenses. In his reply brief, Prescott argues that <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374 (11th Cir.2012), and <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535 (11th Cir.2013), are distinguishable from his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1319. Section 3582(c)(2) provides that a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-18\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>we held that a career offender is not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where a retroactive guideline amendment reduces his base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>based. 541 F.3d 1328, 1330 (11th Cir. 2008). In <em>Lawson, </em>we rejected a career offender\u2019s argument that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman, </em>the holding of <em>Moore </em>was overruled, such that he was entitled to a sentence reduction based on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750, despite his sentence being based on the career offender guideline. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1319-21. In <em>Freeman, </em>the question before the Supreme Court was whether defendants who entered into Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. Neither the plurality opinion nor Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Freeman </em>addressed defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Thus, <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule Moore\u2019s holding that a career offender was not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where his guideline range was not lowered by a retroactive amendment because it was not \u201cclearly on point\u201d to the issue that arose in <em>Moore. Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Accordingly, we held that Lawson, a career offender, was not entitled to relief based on Amendment 750 and \u00a7 3582(c)(2), as his guideline range based on \u00a7 4B1.1 was not reduced by Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">In <em>Berry, </em>we addressed the applicability of Amendment 750 and the FSA in the context of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. 701 F.3d at 376-77. Berry was convicted of a crack cocaine offense and sentenced in 2002, and his initial guideline range was 360 months to life imprisonment, which was based on his status as a career offender under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), not on the drug quantity tables in \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 376. On appeal, we held that the district court did not have the authority to grant Berry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 750 had no effect on Berry\u2019s initial guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment or his guideline sentence of life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 377. In addition, we rejected Berry\u2019s argument that he was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under the FSA, determining that the FSA was not an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress. <em>Id. </em>Thus, it did not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction in Berry\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>Even assuming that Berry could bring his FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, his claim still failed because he was convicted and sentenced in 2002 and the FSA did not apply retroactively to his 2002 sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">In <em>Hippolyte, </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments (1) that Congress intended for the FSA to apply to drug-crime sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and (2) that it would be inconsistent to apply the more lenient sentencing ranges of Amendment 750, but keep the harsh pre-FSA mandatory m\u00ednimums in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding involving a defendant sentenced before the FSA\u2019s enactment. 712 F.3d at 539-40, 542. We determined that <em>Berry </em>was indistinguishable from Hippolyte\u2019s case, and, thus, the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory penalties did not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">Here, Prescott was not eligible for a reduced sentence under Amendment 750 because he was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Amendment 750, which only amended \u00a7 2D 1.1, did not operate to lower Prescott\u2019s Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. Regardless of the effect of Amendment 750, as a career offender, Prescott remained subject to a total offense level of 34 in light of his stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>utory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii) (2000); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The asserted reduction in Prescott\u2019s Guidelines range was wrought solely by the FSA, which is not a Guidelines amendment and, therefore, cannot serve as the basis for a sentence reduction. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. Moreover, Prescott cannot benefit from the FSA because he was sentenced prior to its enactment. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372; <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">The FSA does not apply to Prescott\u2019s case, and he has not shown that he is entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because he has not shown that an amendment to the Guidelines has the effect of reducing his sentence. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Prescott\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
