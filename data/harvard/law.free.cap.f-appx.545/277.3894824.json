We have reviewed the record on appeal, including, <em>inter alia, </em>the extensive transcript and the 64-page Memorandum Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge which patiently sets out in extreme detail the relevant facts and findings regarding Catching\u2019s conditions, principal among which are chronic fatigue syndrome and fybromyalgia. In the end, we find no reversible error, concluding that, as the Commissioner\u2019s brief summarizes, \u201cCatching fails to prove that her alleged chronic fatigue syndrome and fi-bromyalgia equated to medically determinable impairments\u201d and \u201cfails to point to any medical evidence that suggests chronic fatigue syndrome or fybromyalgia caused additional functional limitations not already included in the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity finding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
