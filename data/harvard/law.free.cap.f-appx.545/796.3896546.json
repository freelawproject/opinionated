No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-16\">Briefly stated, Cosby\u2019s complaint challenged the foreclosure proceedings on his house. Cosby named over 20 defendants, including the lending bank, various bank employees, the bank\u2019s law firm, a state court judge, and other parties involved in some capacity in the lending and foreclosure process.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-17\">The district court granted Cosby leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Then, construing Cosby\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint liberally, the district court identified \u2014 correctly\u2014 only three potential federal claims raised in Cosby\u2019s complaint: (1) that Defendants violated willfully the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681q, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005, by requesting Cosby\u2019s credit report without his written permission; (2) that Defendants conspired to deprive Cosby of his constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, 1985, and 1986; and (3) that Douglas County Superi- or Court Judge Robert James aided other Defendants by failing to rule on Cosby\u2019s motions and by denying Cosby a hearing. The district court dismissed Cosby\u2019s purported federal claims for failure to state a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>claim and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Cosby\u2019s state law claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under section 1915(e)(2), accepting the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">A court \u201cshall dismiss\u201d a case filed <em>in forma, pauperis </em>if the court determines that the complaint \u201cfails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). A complaint fails to state a claim if it fails to plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The complaint need not include detailed factual allegations, but it must set forth \u201cmore than labels and conclusions [or] a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1964-65. \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The FCRA makes it unlawful for a person to \u201cknowingly and willfully obtain[] information on a consumer from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses.\u201d <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681q. Because Cosby has failed to allege sufficiently that Defendants obtained his credit report under false pretenses and because nothing in the FCRA requires a consumer\u2019s prior written permission before requesting a credit report, Cosby failed to state a claim for relief under the FCRA. In addition, Cosby cannot state a claim for relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005: a criminal statute with no implied private right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">About Cosby\u2019s second purported federal claim, Cosby failed to allege specifically enough how Defendants violated his federal constitutional rights. Cosby asserted only that Defendants denied him his constitutional rights \u201cbecause of racial bias\u201d and that Defendants used \u201cracial statements.\u201d These vague conclusory allegations state no claim for relief. <em>See Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1965. Likewise, Cosby has failed to plead facts sufficient enough to support the plausibility of his claim against Judge James.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">Because the district court dismissed properly Cosby\u2019s federal claims, it abused no discretion by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Cosby\u2019s remaining state law claims. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Raney v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>370 F.3d 1086, 1089 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cencouraging] district courts to dismiss any remaining state claims when ... the federal claims have been dismissed prior to trial.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">On appeal, Cosby argues that the district court erred in not offering him an opportunity to amend his complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cA district court\u2019s discretion to dismiss a complaint without leave to amend is \u2018severely restricted\u2019 by Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), which di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>rects that leave to amend \u2018shall be freely-given when justice so requires.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bryant v. Dupree, </em>252 F.3d 1161, 1168 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted). Thus, \u201c[wjhere a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim,\u201d the district court must permit a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff to amend the complaint at least once before dismissing the action with prejudice. <em>Bank v. Pitt, </em>928 F.2d 1108, 1112 (11th Cir.1991), <em>overruled on other grounds by Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., </em>314 F.3d 541 (11th Cir.2002) <em>(en bane).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">In his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, Cosby said he intended to amend his complaint and asked the court to allow him to do so. Because a responsive pleading was never served in this case, Cosby had the authority, as a matter of course, to file an amended complaint even without the district court\u2019s permission. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). Furthermore, the district court never denied Cosby\u2019s request for leave to amend nor did it otherwise prevent Cosby from amending his complaint. Despite Cosby\u2019s stated intentions about amending and despite having ample time (35 days elapsed between the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to dismiss Cosby\u2019s complaint and the district court\u2019s order of dismissal) and opportunity to prepare an amendment, Cosby simply failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">In addition, nothing evidences that Cosby might word his complaint more carefully or allege additional facts that might make his complaint sufficient to state a claim that is plausible on its face. Although Cosby\u2019s complaint contained a detailed factual history of his ease, it was void entirely of facts supporting federal causes of action. Cosby never described in the district court what proposed changes he would make to fix his complaint and, instead, argued that his original complaint was sufficient as drafted.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">On appeal, Cosby has legal counsel. And Cosby\u2019s counseled appellate brief advances not one additional fact or proposed change that \u2014 if it was included in an amended complaint \u2014 might state a federal claim for relief. Never has Cosby, even with counsel, provided sufficient factual support for plausible federal claims. So, we cannot say the district court committed reversible error by failing to invite Cosby to amend his complaint before dismissing this civil action. <em>See Vanderberg, </em>259 F.3d at 1327 (affirming the district court\u2019s denial of <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs motion to amend his complaint in part because plaintiff alleged no \u201cnew facts from which the district court could have concluded that Plaintiff may have been able to state a claim successfully.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\">. Cosby\u2019s argument that the district court erred in transferring his case and, thus, lacked jurisdiction, is without merit. Although Cosby\u2019s case was reassigned to a judge stationed in the Rome Division, the case remained docketed in the Atlanta Division of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b820-8\">. Because the district court dismissed properly Cosby's complaint, Cosby\u2019s motion to con-solv\u00edate this case with another civil case he had filed was rendered moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b820-13\">.We reject Cosby's argument that the district court violated his due process rights by dismissing his case before he amended his complaint. <em>See Vanderberg v. Donaldson, 259 </em>F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir.2001) (\"Plaintiff cites no authority, nor do we know of any, which supports his contention that constitutional due process requires that a plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>always be afforded a chance to amend his complaint.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
