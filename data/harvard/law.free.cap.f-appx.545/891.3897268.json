Edwards, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration of an order granting in part his motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Edwards raises two issues in his appeal. First, Edwards argues that the district court failed to consider his post-sentencing rehabilitation at his \u00a7 3582(c) proceeding, which could have led to a sentence below the advisory guideline range. Second, Edwards argues that the district court should have ordered the Bureau of Prisons to credit him for time served in pretrial detention. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Simms, </em>385 F.3d 1347, 1356 (11th Cir.2004). <em>Pro se </em>pleadings are construed liberally. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">Edwards\u2019s first argument is that the district court failed to consider his post-sentencing rehabilitation during his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding because it was too focused on selecting a sentence that \u201cmirrored\u201d his original sentence. Edwards suggests that if the district court had considered his rehabilitation, he would have received a sentence below the amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides that a district court may modify a term of imprisonment that was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the United States Sentencing Commission. A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, and \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis omitted); <em>see also </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) (providing that all other guidelines determinations remain unaffected). In reducing a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), \u201ca district court may lower a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended guidelines range only if the original sentence was below the original guidelines range because the defendant provided substantial assistance to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir.2012); <em>see also </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Edwards\u2019s motion for reconsideration. First, the district court explicitly considered Edwards\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitation in reducing his sentence. Indeed, the district court\u2019s order stated that the court had \u201cconsidered public safety as well as post-sentencing information in imposing this sentence.\u201d Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>ond, the district court was not authorized to reduce Edwards\u2019s sentence below his minimum amended guidelines range. Section lB1.10(b)(2) states that a court shall not reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended guideline range in a \u00a7 3582(e)(2) proceeding unless it reflects a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities. <em>See also Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1207. That being the case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Edwards\u2019s motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Edwards\u2019s second argument is that the district court should have granted his motion for reconsideration because it failed to order the Bureau of Prisons to credit him for time served in pretrial detention. This argument fails because a claim for time-served credit is properly brought under \u00a7 2241 after the exhaustion of administrative remedies. <em>See United States v. Nyhuis, </em>211 F.3d 1340, 1345 (11th Cir.2000). Because there is no indication that Edwards has exhausted his administrative remedies, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant a motion for reconsideration. <em>See United States v. Flanagan, </em>868 F.2d 1544, 1546 (11th Cir.1989) (observing that \u201cthe granting of credit for time served is in the first instance an administrative, not a judicial, function\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Based on the above, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-9\">. Edwards argues that the district court could have reduced his sentence under <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011). In <em>Pepper, </em>the Supreme Court held that when a defendant's sentence has been vacated on appeal, a district court at resentencing may consider and impose a below-guidelines-range sentence based on evidence of the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitation. <em>Id. </em>at 1241. <em>Pepper </em>does not apply here, however, because Edwards\u2019s sentence was not set aside on direct appeal. Edwards instead sought a reduction in his sentence in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. Therefore, <em>Pepper </em>does not apply to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
