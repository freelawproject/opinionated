He argues that the sentence is greater than necessary to effectuate the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that the district court abused its discretion in imposing the sentence in view of his cancer and the policy considerations of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.4. He also asserts that the seriousness of his crime was mitigated by his motive for committing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-21\">The 60-month within-guidelines imposed by the district court is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The record reflects that the district court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant. See \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Doran\u2019s arguments do not establish that the district court committed any error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-55 (5th Cir.2008). Nor has Doran shown that his health issues mandated a lower sentence under the precedent of this circuit. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008) (determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>that a lesser sentence was not warranted for a defendant who suffered from sickle cell amenia, Hepatitis C, blackouts, and upper respiratory illness); <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>430 F.3d 230, 240-41 (5th Cir.2005) (holding that defendant\u2019s HIV-positive status did not constitute an extraordinary medical condition warranting a lesser sentence); <em>United States v. Winters, </em>105 F.3d 200, 208-09 (5th Cir.1997) (holding that defendant\u2019s sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammation of multiple organs, was not an exceptional medical condition requiring a lesser sentence). His disagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed and with the district court\u2019s weighing of the sentencing factors does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66; <em>Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
