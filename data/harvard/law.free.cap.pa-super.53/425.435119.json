Williams died on June 6,1911.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-8\">On rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, Whitehead, P. J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-9\">The action in this case was brought to recover a sum alleged to be due upon a policy of insurance issued by the defendant upon the life of Samuel N. Williams for the use and benefit of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-10\">The defendant filed an affidavit of defense, in which it admits the contract set out in the plaintiff\u2019s statement, but contends that the full amount of said policy should not be paid because, at the time of the death of the insured, there was due the defendant three-quarters of a year\u2019s premium.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-11\">The plaintiffs entered a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-12\">The policy of insurance was issued to the insured on April 21, 1896, and the insured died on June 6, 1911.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-13\">The only question to consider in disposing of this rule is the construction to be put upon the following language:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-14\">\u201c Less the balance (if any) of the payments for the current year of the death of the insured, and any indebtedness of the insured or beneficiary to the Association.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-15\">When did the current year commence for the advance payment of the yearly premiums under this clause of the contract?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The defendant claims that the current year commenced April 21, the date of the policy, and the plaintiffs argue that the current year, within the terms of the contract, commenced on July 21, the date when the yearly premiums were to be paid under the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-4\">The mere fact that the policy bears date April 21, and was presumably issued on that date, is not conclusive that the current year, within the terms of the contract, commenced on that date. It certainly was within the power of the parties to the contract to fix a time of payment for the current year, which time might be or might not be the date of the contract. There is nothing ambiguous in the contract so far as the yearly payments are concerned.- The defendant fixed the time when this yearly premium was to be paid and for a period of fifteen years has received, on or before said date, said annual payment; that the defendant considered July 21 to be the date when a complete yearly premium was due is evidenced by its receipts, all of which recite that the payment received is \u201cfor the regular yearly advance payment.\u201d Could the language \u201cregular yearly advance payment\u201d apply to any year except the current year? We think not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-5\">The contract calls for the \u201cpayment of Three Hundred and Three Dollars and Fifty Cents to be made on or before the 21st of July in every year,\u201d and all payments were made in pursuance to said contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-6\">In order to sustain the contention of the defendant, the payments made by the plaintiffs and accepted by the defendant for fifteen years were really not an annual payment, although made at one time, but was, in fact, the sum of two installments, one for nine months and one for three months, that is, the payment made on July 21, 1910, paid up to April 21,1911, and an installment of three months on the year ending April 21,1912.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-7\">If this construction is to be placed upon this policy, then it certainly is ambiguous and admits of two interpretations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-8\">The language of the contract indicates, and the insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>was justified in believing that the payment for the current year commenced on July 21.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-3\">A contract of insurance must have a reasonable interpretation, such as was probably in the contemplation of the parties when it was made; and when the words of a policy are, without violence, susceptible of two interpretations, that which will sustain a claim to the indemnity it was the object of the insured to obtain should be preferred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-4\">It is true that when a contract of insurance fixes a yearly sum to be paid, but divides this sum into installments, the division is made for the accommodation of the insured, and upon the death of the insured the balance of installments unpaid, but which would fall due during the current year, could be deducted from the amount of the policy, but in this policy the yearly premium was not divided into installments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-5\">The cases relied upon by the defendant all relate to policies in which the yearly payment was divided into installments, and have no application to this policy. This policy was based upon an annual payment; the date of said payment was fixed by the defendant, and the yearly \"payment for the current year of the death of the insured,\u201d having been made by the insured, according to the terms of the contract, judgment should be entered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">The rule, therefore, for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense is made absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was order making absolute rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-8\"><em>Edgar Munson, </em>of <em>Candor &amp; Munson, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4c\">cited: Bracher v.
