Parga-Rosas, </em>238 F.3d 1209, 1214 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 942, 122 S.Ct. 319, 151 L.Ed.2d 238 (2001) (stating that while voluntary entry may be an important element of proof in some cases, the crime of being \u201cfound in\u201d the United States does not require that voluntary entry be pled in the indictment).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Cortez-Carrasco\u2019s argument that the trial jury should have been instructed that it must find voluntary entry in order to convict fails for similar reasons. A reasonable jury may infer that the defendant voluntarily intends to be in the United States when he is found anywhere within the country other than at the border and no evidence of involuntary entry is introduced. <em>See United States v. Quintana-Torres, </em>235 F.3d 1197, 1200 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 953, 121 S.Ct. 1427, 149 L.Ed.2d 366 (2001); <em>see also United States v. Castellanos-Garcia, </em>270 F.3d 773, 777 (9th Cir.2001). Cortez-Carrasco\u2019s conviction suffers from no infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Revocation of Cortez-Carrasco\u2019s supervised release was predicated upon the validity of his conviction for violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Thus, our conclusion that his \u201cfound in\u201d conviction stands defeats Cortez-Carrasco\u2019s challenge to the revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Finally, Cortez-Carrasco\u2019s challenge to the grand jury instructions is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Marcucci, </em>299 F.3d 1156, 1164 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b671-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
