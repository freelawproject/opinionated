The Adems challenge the IJ\u2019s ruling that they failed to demonstrate either of them suffered past persecution or possessed a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. The record supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2003) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum). We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u201c \u2018was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite\u2019 \u201d elements. <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). We have reviewed the record, the Board\u2019s decision, and the opinion of the IJ, and find that substantial evidence supports the ruling that the Adems failed to establish refugee status.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">We conclude as well that the Adems are not entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2000) or the U.N. Convention Against Torture. Based on our review of the record and of the IJ\u2019s decision denying relief, we hold that the IJ did not err in finding that they failed to show a \u201cclear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>See Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d) Nor did the Adems establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that they would face torture if they returned to Eritrea. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2003) (to qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, an alien must show \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-16\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-17\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
