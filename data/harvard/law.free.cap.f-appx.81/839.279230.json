Beaumont filed a complaint seeking review of a final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d) denying her application for Supplemental Security Income benefits. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). After the Commissioner answered Beaumont\u2019s complaint, the Commissioner moved the district court to reverse the agency\u2019s decision and to remand the matter for further administrative proceedings. The district court granted the motion and remanded the matter pursuant to the fourth sentence of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-24\">The fourth sentence of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) .provides that \u201c[t]he [district] court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Commissioner of Social Security, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Beaumont argues that there is no basis for a remand and that she is entitled to an award of benefits because she meets the requirements for listed impairments pursuant to 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 12.05(C) and (D). The Commissioner argues that the record contain inconsistencies and conflicts which require further administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-25\">After an examination of the record, we agree with the Commissioner that the record contains inconsistencies and unresolved issues that preclude an immediate award of benefits. \u201cConflicts in the evidence are for the [Commissioner] and not the courts to resolve.\u201d <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court reversing the Commissioner\u2019s decision and remanding the matter for further administrative proceedings is AFFIRMED. We deem it unnecessary to resolve the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>dispute over the applicable standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b871-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
