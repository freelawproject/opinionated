Petitioners alleged the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), an anti-government movement active in the southern Philippines, persecuted Petitioners based on Mr. Samin\u2019s assistance to the Philippine government. The IJ denied Petitioners\u2019 requests based on an adverse credibility determination against Samin and his failure to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. We review for substantial evidence and will reverse the BIA\u2019s determination only if the Petitioners show the evidence compels such a result. <em>Cruz-Navarro v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1024, 1028 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it except as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">We reject Petitioners\u2019 argument that the BIA erred in its adverse credibility determination against Samin. The BIA cited several discrepancies between Samin\u2019s asylum application and his testimony and concluded the testimony \u201clacked detail and was inconsistent.\u201d When \u201c[tjaken together,\u201d inconsistencies may be sufficiently material to permit an Immigration Judge (IJ) to question an applicant\u2019s credibility. <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1152 (9th Cir.1999). Two of the inconsistencies related to the basis for Samin\u2019s alleged fear of persecution. <em>See de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997). Such inconsistencies are permissible bases for the BIA to question Samin\u2019s credibility. <em>See, e.g., Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Singh-Kaur, </em>183 F.3d at 1152. Moreover, Samin had access to an interpreter and received multiple opportunities to clarify his testimony, but still failed to provide a coherent narrative. <em>See Singh-Kaur, </em>183 F.3d at 1152-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">After the BIA reversed his initial determination, the IJ provided several additional reasons for his finding, which the BIA subsequently affirmed. Based on Samin\u2019s testimony about his role as an informant and how he acquired his informant identity card, the IJ doubted Samin\u2019s testimony concerning the authenticity of the card and his claim that he would carry the potentially incriminating card on his person. The IJ also questioned Samin\u2019s assertion that he did not consider the safety of his family before volunteering as an informant in light of other facts about Samin in the record. In addition, the IJ found one of Samin\u2019s stated reasons for his 1993 return to the Philippines, \u201cto check the situation,\u201d was not plausible because Samin admitted he could have done so by telephone. Finally, the IJ concluded Samin\u2019s return to the Philippines to execute a lease was not an \u201caction of a person who has a well founded fear of persecution in his home country.\u201d Although Petitioners argue the IJ based his adverse credibility finding on impermissible conjecture, the record shows the IJ\u2019s conclusions were based on parts of Samin\u2019s testimony and other nonconjectural reasons which provide substantial evidence for the IJ\u2019s finding. <em>See Chebchoub, 257 </em>F.3d at 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Finally, Samin argues the BIA erred when it adopted the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination without providing specific, cogent reasons to support the BIA\u2019s determination. We reject this argument. The BIA\u2019s express incorporation of the IJ\u2019s decision permits the BIA to adopt the IJ\u2019s reasons for its decision as well. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number><em>Alaelua v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 1379, 1382 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">We also reject Petitioners\u2019 argument that the BIA erred when it determined Samin failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. A well-founded fear of persecution must be both \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960 (9th Cir.1996). \u201cIf the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality ... [and] it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so,\u201d the applicant lacks a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Because Samin was not credible, Petitioners cannot satisfy the subjective prong of the test. In addition, the possibility of relocation undercuts their attempts to satisfy the objective prong. The BIA incorporated the IJ\u2019s opinion and relied on reports from the State Department and Amnesty International that MNLF activity was localized to the Southern islands of the Philippines. The IJ noted Samin\u2019s shop in Luzon remained undisturbed despite Samin\u2019s misfortunes in Jolo. The conclusion that Samin could relocate vitiates his claim of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Samin lacked a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Berroteran-Melendez v. INS, </em>955 F.2d 1251, 1257 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Because the Petitioners have failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution, they cannot meet the more stringent standard required for withholding of deportation. <em>See Mejia-Paiz v. INS, </em>111 F.3d 720, 725 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"A1q\">Accordingly, the Petition for Review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b731-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>courts of this Circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
