We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law and due process claims, <em>Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, </em>282 F.3d 1218, 1222 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-18\">The BIA correctly determined that, because the Immigration and Naturalization Service objected to Erazo-Artica\u2019s motion for administrative closure of the removal proceedings, the IJ lacked discretion to grant the motion. <em>See Matter of Gutierrez-Lopez, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 479, 480, 1996 WL 413581 (BIA 1996) (\u201cA case may not be administratively closed if opposed by either of the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-19\">Erazo-Artica further contends that his pending application for TPS deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the IJ jurisdiction over the removal proceedings. We disagree. Nothing in the statute or regulations governing TPS precludes the initiation of a removal proceeding while an application is pending. <em>Cf. </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(f)(l) (an alien granted TPS \u201cshall not be considered to be permanently residing in the United States under color of law\u201d); <em>Yao v. INS, </em>2 F.3d 317, 319 (9th Cir.1993) (holding that alien\u2019s pending application for legalization of immigration status as a Special Agricultural Worker did not preclude initiation of deportation proceedings or entry of deportation order, but did prohibit execution of the deportation order until final determination on the application).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Moreover, the government concedes that Erazo-Artica has been granted \u201ctemporary treatment benefits\u201d that prohibit his removal from the United States and permit him to work until a final decision is made on his pending TPS application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254a(a)(l) &amp; 1254a(a)(4)(B) (the government shall not remove an alien who establishes prima facie eligibility for TPS pending final determination on TPS application); <em>accord </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 244.10(e)(l)(i) (recipient of temporary treatment benefits is entitled to temporary stay of deportation and employment authorization); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 244.10(e)(2) and 244.13(a) (temporary treatment benefits remain in effect until final decision on TPS application).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Finally, we reject Erazo-Artica\u2019s contentions that (1) the IJ improperly issued a summary decision, and (2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his removal hearings. Erazo-Artica has not demonstrated prejudice because he has not shown that these alleged due process violations affected the outcome of the proceedings or prevented him from reasonably presenting his case. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 899-900 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, 255 </em>F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b194-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
