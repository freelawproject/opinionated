Mbede asserts that she provided detailed, consistent and plausible testimony sufficient to support her claim that she was eligible for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158 (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2003); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). We have reviewed the record, the IJ\u2019s decision, and the Board\u2019s conclusion, and find that substantial evidence supports the IJ in her ruling that Mbede failed to establish refugee status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4) (2000); <em>see Matter of Y-B-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1136, 1139, 1998 WL 99554 (BIA 1998); <em>Matter of S-M-J-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722, 724-26, 1997 WL 80984 (BIA 1997).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Mbede challenges the adequacy of the Board\u2019s review of her appeal, arguing that the Board did not clearly state its reasoning. We reject her challenge, as the Board complied with the summary affirmance procedures set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2003). <em>See Khattak v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 250, 253 (4th Cir.) (\u201cKhattak already has received a full explanation of the immigration judge\u2019s decision, which is essentially the decision under review.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 833, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014, 72 U.S.L.W. 3282 (2003). We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b806-14\"> Mbede seeks to challenge the IJ's denial of her request for withholding of removal.
