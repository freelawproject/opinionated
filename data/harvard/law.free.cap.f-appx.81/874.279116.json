Scared, his girlfriend called the police in Herrin, Illinois. When police arrived they found the two pipe bombs laying in Harris\u2019 driveway \u2014 a friend of Harris\u2019 girlfriend had taken them there in order to keep them away from Harris. As a precaution, police officers evacuated a two-block area around Harris\u2019 home. They subsequently arrested him, and during questioning Harris admitted that the bombs were his. A grand jury indicted him for possessing an unregistered destructive device, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d). Harris pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 55 months\u2019 imprisonment. He appeals his sentence, but we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">Harris initially pleaded not guilty. While in jail awaiting trial, he wrote a letter to \u201cBill,\u201d in which he told Bill to deny knowing that Harris \u201chad made or had these things.\u201d He also directed Bill to advance to an unidentified woman \u201cthat stuff\u2019 that \u201cshe is always looking for,\u201d presumably in the hopes that the woman would not testify against Harris: \u201cIf she does not make it to court no case.\u201d In the letter Harris identified himself as \u201cCrazy Bob the mad bomber.\u201d Harris\u2019 cellmate found the letter and gave it to police. Harris later changed his plea to guilty. Harris did not enter into a written plea agreement with the government, but the government did orally promise not to appeal should it fail to convince the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>court to deny Harris a reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">The probation officer recommended in the presentence report that Harris\u2019 base offense level of 18 be increased two levels because his offense involved a destructive device, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(3), and another two levels for obstruction of justice for attempting to tamper with witnesses, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1. The probation officer also recommended that Harris\u2019 base offense level be decreased three levels for having timely accepted responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a), (b). No objections to the report were filed, but at sentencing the government argued that Harris was not entitled to a three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility for two reasons: 1) defendants who have obstructed justice are presumed not to have accepted responsibility, and 2) Harris pleaded guilty only after getting caught trying to tamper with witnesses. In response Harris insisted that the government had waived both contentions by failing to first make them as written objections to the presentence report as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(f)(1) and SDIL-LR Cr32.1(b). Alternatively, he argued that he was entitled to the decrease because his obstruction was \u201cbrief and minor.\u201d The court adjourned the sentencing hearing and directed the parties to brief whether Harris was entitled to an aceeptance-of-responsibility decrease. When the hearing reconvened two weeks later, the court sided against Harris and denied him the reduction and sentenced him to 55 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by three years\u2019 supervised release, and fined him $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Harris argues that the district court wrongly denied him the reduction for two reasons. First, he reasserts that the government\u2019s arguments opposing the decrease were untimely. But even if the government forfeited its chance to challenge the probation officer\u2019s recommendation, a sentencing court \u201cis not obliged to accept all unchallenged findings and recommendations made in the PSR.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>140 F.3d 453, 457 (2d Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Schuler, </em>34 F.3d 457, 461 (7th Cir.1994). At sentencing, the court in fact acknowledged that it was denying the decrease not because the government asked it to but because it believed that the probation officer\u2019s recommendation was not well-founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Furthermore, even though the government did not file an objection to the PSR, Harris suffered no prejudice. He had known since his change-of-plea hearing that the government would oppose any decrease for acceptance. And he had additional time to respond to the government\u2019s argument after the court requested briefing on the issue. Therefore, the court was free to reject the probation officer\u2019s recommendation even if the government violated the local rule requiring written objections to sentencing recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">Alternatively, Harris argues that the district court wrongly denied him the decrease even though he established extraordinary circumstances entitling him to it. This court reviews a district court\u2019s decision whether or not to grant an aeceptance-of-responsibility decrease for clear error, <em>see United States v. Fudge, </em>325 F.3d 910, 923 (7th Cir.2003), not under the less deferential <em>de novo </em>standard advocated by the defendant. A defendant who obstructs justice is presumed not to have accepted responsibility. <em>Id.; see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment (n.l). That presumption may be overcome but only if the defendant demonstrates that his case is \u201cextraordinary.\u201d <em>Fudge, </em>325 F.3d at 923; <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>319 F.3d 291, 300 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 123 S.Ct. 2289, 156 L.Ed.2d 141 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>Harris contends that he demonstrated to the court that his case is extraordinary for several reasons. First, he argues that his case is extraordinary because he did not resist arrest, confessed, and timely pleaded guilty. But this court has previously held that there is nothing extraordinary about confessing and pleading guilty. <em>See United States v. Partee, </em>301 F.3d 576, 581 (7th Cir.2002) (defendant who had obstructed justice was not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility merely for pleading guilty); <em>United States v. Yusuff, </em>96 F.3d 982, 989 (7th Cir.1996) (same). Harris cites several cases to support his argument that pleading guilty is an extraordinary circumstance, but his cases are inapposite. Two of the cases do not even address the issue of extraordinary circumstances. In the third, <em>United States v. Lallemand, </em>989 F.2d 936, 938 (7th Cir.1993), the defendant obstructed justice <em>before </em>he was arrested, while Harris obstructed justice afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">Next, Harris argues that his case is extraordinary because his attempt to tamper with witnesses was \u201cbrief and minor,\u201d rather than a \u201cfar flung effort to undermine the prosecution of the cause [sic].\u201d But the district court did not clearly err when it rejected Harris\u2019 characterization of his obstruction as \u201cminor.\u201d This court has held that attempts to obstruct justice by influencing witnesses and by concocting lies are inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility. <em>Fudge, </em>325 F.3d at 923; <em>Partee, </em>301 F.3d at 581. Harris relies upon <em>United States v. Bogas, </em>731 F.Supp. 242 (N.D.Ohio 1990), to advocate the opposite conclusion. But in <em>Bogas </em>the defendant cooperated with police both before and after his obstructive false statement to an investigator. <em>Id. </em>at 252. Harris, on the other hand, merely pleaded\" guilty, and only after police discovered his attempt to tamper with witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Finally, Harris contends that his case is extraordinary because, as a result of brain surgery in 1993, he suffers from seizures and depression, and is easily confused. He baldly asserted that these lingering symptoms constitute an extraordinary circumstance, but failed to explain how his seizures, depression, or confusion account for his obstructive conduct. He has therefore failed to meet his burden of showing that his medical condition was an extraordinary circumstance, or that the district court clearly erred in concluding that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
