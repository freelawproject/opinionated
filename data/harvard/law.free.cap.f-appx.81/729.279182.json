(\u201cBackyard\u201d), appeals the decision of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin granting Woodlink Ltd.\u2019s (\u2018Woodlink\u2019s\u201d) motions for summary judgment of non-infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,927,231 and 6,095,087 (\u201cthe \u2019231 patent\u201d and \u201cthe \u2019087 patent,\u201d respectively). Woodlink cross-appeals the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment as to the invalidity of the \u2019231 patent in light of U.S. Patent No. 5,269,255 issued to Finn. Because the district court properly construed the patent claims and correctly found no genuine issues of material fact on the question of infringement, and because the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Woodlink\u2019s invalidity arguments as moot, we <em>affirm,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">Backyard sued Woodlink for infringement of the \u2019231 and \u2019087 patents. As to each patent, Woodlink filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">In granting the motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the \u2019231 patent, the district court first construed the patent claims and then compared them to the accused devices. Asserted independent claim 1 reads, with the disputed claim term underlined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-15\">1. A bird feeder, comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-16\">a feed-containing body having at least a bottom and a side, and wherein at least a portion of the body comprises <em>mesh, </em>and wherein the body comprises a plurality of wood pieces, the wood pieces having grooves formed therein, and the mesh being inserted in the grooves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-17\">\u2019231 patent, col. 4, II. 2-8 (emphasis added). Woodlink argued \u201cmesh\u201d means \u201cexpanded mesh\u201d; Backyard argued \u201cmesh\u201d means \u201cnon-woven, non-welded sheet material with a pattern of holes.\u201d Based on the intrinsic evidence, the district court construed \u201cmesh\u201d to mean \u201cexpanded mesh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-18\">Applying the claims as construed, the district court found that Woodlink\u2019s bird-feeders could not literally infringe the asserted \u2019231 patent claims because Wood-link used perforated mesh, not expanded mesh. The court further found that Backyard was estopped from arguing that Woodlink\u2019s birdfeeders infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because it surrendered coverage to all non-expanded mesh in prosecuting the patent claims. Since Woodlink\u2019s birdfeeders could not infringe the claims as construed, no issue of material fact remained and the court granted Woodlink\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the \u2019231 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-19\">With respect to the \u2019087 patent, the district court granted Woodlink\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement, both literally and under the doctrine of equivalents. Again, in considering the motion, the district court first construed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>asserted claims of the \u2019087 patent. The representative independent claim 1 provides in relevant part, with the disputed claim terms underlined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">1. A bird feeder comprising: a first wall portion defining a first vertical surface;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">a second wall portion defining a second vertical surface;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">a third wall portion defining a third vertical surface;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">a fourth wall portion defining a fourth vertical surface;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">said first, second, third and fourth vertical surfaces of said first, second, third and fourth wall portions, respectively, being assembled together to define a bird feed retaining portion of said bird feeder, ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-10\">an apertured floor member, said <em>apertured floor member </em>extending to said first, second, th\u00fad, and fourth <em>vertical </em>surfaces ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">\u2019087 patent, col. 4, I. 60 \u2014 col. 5, I. 82 (emphasis added). The district court found that the claim language \u201capertured floor member\u201d requires at least one raised edge. Moreover, it construed \u201cvertical\u201d to require walls perpendicular to the bird-feeder\u2019s floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">Based on its construction of the claims, the district court found that Woodlink\u2019s birdfeeders do not infringe Backyard\u2019s asserted patent claims, either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents. First, it found no issue as to literal infringement because Woodlink\u2019s birdfeeders have neither a removable apertured floor member nor vertical walls. Second, because an apertured floor member is not equivalent to a sheet, the court found no possible infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">Backyard filed a timely appeal. Jurisdiction in this court is proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-14\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b763-15\">Determining patent infringement first requires claim construction followed by a comparison of the construed claims to the alleged infringing device. We review issues of claim construction <em>de novo. </em>In addition, summary judgment (as to infringement) is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We also review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-16\">A. The \u2019231 Patent</p>\n<p id=\"b763-17\">On appeal, Backyard challenges the district court\u2019s claim construction, arguing that \u201cmesh\u201d should be construed to mean \u201cnon-woven, non-welded sheet material with a pattern of holes.\u201d It argues that the intrinsic evidence supports its construction and that the doctrine of claim differentiation lends further support. Backyard also relies on the examiner\u2019s allowance of a non-statutory disclaimer. Finally, Woodlink cross appeals, arguing that the district court improperly denied its motion for summary judgment as to invalidity of the \u2019231 patent in light of the Finn patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-18\">Based on the intrinsic evidence, we hold that the district court properly found the claim term \u201cmesh\u201d means \u201cexpanded mesh.\u201d As the district court noted, the term \u201cmesh\u201d alone is ambiguous. Indeed neither party argues for a broad construction without limitation. Thus, because the meaning of \u201cmesh\u201d is ambiguous, we look to the specification and the prosecution history.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-19\">In light of the specification, the term \u201cmesh\u201d should be construed as \u201cex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>panded mesh.\u201d As Woodlink properly points out, \u201cexpanded\u201d modifies \u201cmesh\u201d eighteen times in the specification. Moreover, in a number of those instances that do not use \u201cexpanded\u201d as a modifier for \u201cmesh,\u201d the independent use of \u201cmesh\u201d simply refers back to the immediately pri- or reference, which <em>was </em>modified by \u201cexpanded.\u201d Beyond the sheer volume of references to \u201cexpanded mesh,\u201d the specification also suggests that the novelty of the invention resides in the use of expanded mesh. The specification particularly points out that expanded mesh does not require welding, weaving, or galvanizing. \u2019231 patent, col. 1, II. 37-38. It also notes that using expanded mesh allows one to regulate the size of the openings during manufacture, facilitating customization to attract particular bird species. \u2019231 patent, col. 1, II. 41-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">As with the specification, the prosecution history suggests limiting the construction of \u201cmesh\u201d to \u201cexpanded mesh.\u201d In particular, the prosecution history repeatedly distinguishes between expanded and non-expanded mesh. These distinctions, discussed below in the context of determining whether Backyard should be estopped from arguing infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, all suggest construing \u201cmesh\u201d as \u201cexpanded mesh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Further, we do not find support for Backyard\u2019s arguments regarding the doctrine of claim differentiation. Dependent claim 10 claims: \u201cA bird feeder according to claim 1, wherein the mesh is expanded.\u201d As such, Backyard argues, the court should not read the \u201cexpanded\u201d limitation into independent claim 1. As the district court correctly pointed out, however, the doctrine of claim differentiation only creates a <em>presumption </em>that claims cover different inventions. <em>Laitram Corp. v. Rexnord, Inc., </em>939 F.2d 1533, 1538 (Fed.Cir.1991) (citing <em>Autogiro Co. of Am. v. United States, </em>181 Ct.Cl. 55, 384 F.2d 391 (1967)). Here, the evidence favors limiting the construction of \u201cmesh\u201d to \u201cexpanded mesh,\u201d thereby overcoming the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Finally, based on the facts of this particular case, we do not rely on the patent examiner\u2019s allowance of a non-statutory, rather than a statutory, disclaimer to overcome a double-patenting rejection. We are not bound by what the examiner perceived to be the scope of the claim. Here, the parent application specifically claimed coverage of \u201cexpanded mesh\u201d in the sole independent claim. <em>See </em>U.S. Pat. No. 5,826,539, col. 4, II. 8-15. The only change between the parent and continuation application was the removal of the term \u201cexpanded\u201d modifying \u201cmesh\u201d in the independent claim. Otherwise, the Abstract, Specification, and Drawings are identical, focusing, as discussed above, on the use of \u201cexpanded mesh.\u201d Thus, based on the totality of the intrinsic evidence, we find that the term \u201cmesh\u201d must be construed as \u201cexpanded mesh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Reviewing the grant of summary judgment of non-infringement <em>de novo, </em>we find no remaining issues of material fact based on the claim construction. Specifically, Woodlink does not literally infringe because it uses perforated mesh, not expanded mesh, in manufacturing its birdfeeders. As to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, the district court properly applied the doctrine of prosecution history estoppel. The prosecution history contains a number of arguments that limit the range of equivalents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, in an affidavit submitted to the Patent and Trademark Office, the patentee favorably compared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>his own \u201cexpanded mesh\u201d feeders to those employing \u201cnon-expanded mesh.\u201d Second, the prosecuting attorney repeatedly distinguished the invention over prior-art, non-expanded-mesh feeders. Third, the patentee submitted tests illustrating the advantages of using expanded mesh over non-expanded mesh.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">We deny Woodlink\u2019s cross-appeal. \u201c[A] district court has discretion to dismiss a counterclaim alleging that a patent is invalid as moot where it finds no infringement.\u201d <em>Phonometrics, Inc. v. N. Telecom Inc., </em>133 F.3d 1459, 1468 (Fed.Cir.1998). Here, the district court dismissed Wood-link\u2019s counterclaim of invalidity as moot in its Order issued November 14, 2002. We find the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">B. The \u2019087 Patent</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">On appeal, Backyard argues that the term \u201capertured floor member\u201d does not require an upturned edge, but could cover a flat sheet. Backyard relies on both the intrinsic evidence and the doctrine of claim differentiation in making its argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">As with the \u2019231 patent, a <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s claim construction of \u201capertured floor member\u201d reveals that it correctly found the claim language to require at least one upturned edge. First, the specification states that \u201cthe term \u2018apertured floor member\u2019 means a tray-like member\u201d \u2019087 patent, col. 3. II. 35^41. Moreover, the dictionary definitions of \u201ctray\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> imply something more than a flat surface. Two of the four definitions used by the district court require a raised edge or rim, while the other two note the prevalence of this characteristic. Moreover, the specification states that a sheet \u201cmay be used for <em>forming </em>the apertured floor member.\u201d \u2019087 patent, col. 2, II. 43-45 (emphasis added). By disclosing some kind of forming process performed on a flat sheet, the specification suggests that a simple, unformed sheet does not amount to a tray-like member. Finally, the drawings also illustrate an upturned edge. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s claim construction requiring an upturned edge.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">Backyard further argues that the doctrine of claim differentiation precludes such a construction of \u201capertured floor member.\u201d Specifically, Backyard submits that we should not read in the limitation from dependent claim 3-\u201cThe bird feeder of claim 2, wherein the apertured floor member further comprises at least one upturned edge.\u201d \u2019087 patent, col. 6, II. 25-26. We conclude that the presumption of claim differentiation is overcome here by the intrinsic evidence, which favors construing the \u201capertured floor member\u201d as requiring at least one upturned edge.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-16\">Based on its claim construction with respect to the \u2019087 patent, the district court correctly found no infringement, literally or under the doctrine of equivalents. Because Woodlink uses a flat sheet in all of its accused birdfeeders, and not a \u201ctray\u201d with at least one upturned edge, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>no literal infringement. In addition, as applied to the facts of this case, there is no equivalence; trays are not equivalent to sheets because they have a lip (which helps contain the contents) and increased rigidity (as a consequence of the bend).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Lacking the \u201capertured floor member\u201d element, Woodlink\u2019s birdfeeders cannot infringe. Consequently, we need not address the \u201cvertical\u201d claim-construction issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to non-infringement of both the \u2019231 and \u2019087 patents. The district court properly construed the terms \u201cmesh\u201d and \u201capertured floor member\u201d in the \u2019231 and \u2019087 patents, respectively. Based on its claim construction, no issues of material fact remained as to infringement. We affirm as to Woodlink\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-6\">. Notably, the prosecution history referred to here (and used by the district court) relates to the parent application, App. No. 08/679,049, July 12, 1996, issued as U.S. Patent No. 5,826,539 on October 27, 1998.
