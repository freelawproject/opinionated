Marquez argues that his indictment was invalid because the underlying deportation order, which was based on his having been convicted of felony driving while intoxicated, is invalid under <em>United States v. Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d 921, 927 </em>(5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">To challenge the validity of an underlying deportation order, an alien must establish that: (1) the prior deportation hearing was fundamentally unfair; (2) the hearing effectively eliminated the alien\u2019s right to seek judicial review of the removal order; and (3) the procedural deficiencies caused actual prejudice. <em>United States v. Lopez-Vasquez, 227 </em>F.3d 476, 483 (5th Cir.2000); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">Marquez fails to show that his deportation hearing was fundamentally unfair inasmuch as the hearing did not violate his procedural due process rights. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 230 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1135, 123 S.Ct. 922, 154 L.Ed.2d 827 (2003). The court need not reach Marquez\u2019s remaining arguments. <em>See Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d at 231; <em>Lopez-Vasquez, </em>227 F.3d at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b549-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
