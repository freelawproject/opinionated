Knight petitions for a writ of mandamus to direct the judge presiding over his case in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico to recuse himself and, generally, to issue rulings in favor of Knight.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-20\">In <em>Regents of Univ. of New Mexico v. Knight, </em>321 F.3d 1111 (Fed.Cir.2003), we affirmed the district court's ruling (1) that Knight and Terence J. Seallen breached their contractual obligations to assign their patents and applications to the University of New Mexico and (2) declaring the University to be the owner of the disputed patents and applications. We reversed the dismissal of Knight\u2019s counterclaim for royalties and directed the district court on remand to determine whether any other counterclaims were compulsory and should be litigated. On remand, the district court dismissed the remaining counterclaims, refused to allow Knight to amend his counterclaim, and denied Knight\u2019s motion for recusal. Knight now petitions for a writ of mandamus seeking review of the recusal order and the other adverse rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-21\">The traditional use of the writ of mandamus in aid of appellate jurisdiction, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), \u201chas been to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>do so.\u201d <em>Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass\u2019n, </em>319 U.S. 21, 26, 63 S.Ct. 938, 87 L.Ed. 1185 (1943). A party who seeks a writ bears the burden of proving that it has no other means of attaining the relief desired, <em>Mallard v. U.S. Dist. Court for the Southern Dist. of Iowa, </em>490 U.S. 296, 309, 109 S.Ct. 1814, 104 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989), and that the right to issuance of the writ is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Allied Chemical Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980). \u201cWhere a matter is committed to discretion, it cannot be said that a litigant\u2019s right to a particular result is \u2018clear and indisputable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Knight has completely failed to show that a writ should issue. With respect to the district court\u2019s discretionary ruling denying Knight\u2019s motion to amend his counterclaim, such discretionary rulings are rarely appropriate for consideration in a mandamus petition. <em>Allied, </em>449 U.S. at 36 (allowing a litigant to seek immediate judicial review of a discretionary ruling encroaches on the policy against piecemeal review). As stated by the district court with respect to the recusal motion, \u201cKnight\u2019s deleterious obfuscation of the law and the facts solely indicates his unwillingness to accept the Court\u2019s rulings against him.\u201d Knight may, of course, seek review of these and other adverse rulings on appeal after final judgment. In sum, Knight has shown neither that he lacks other means of attaining the relief desired nor that his right to a writ is clear and indisputable. <em>Allied, </em>449 U.S. at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
