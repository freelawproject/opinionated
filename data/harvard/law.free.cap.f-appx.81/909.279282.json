We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-23\">If there had been a bona fide doubt as to Pierce\u2019s competency which arose during trial, the trial court was obligated, as a matter of procedural due process, to inquire into his competence to stand trial. <em>See United States v. Loyola-Dominguez, </em>125 F.3d 1315, 1318 (9th Cir.1997); <em>Amaya-Ruiz v. Stewart, </em>121 F.3d 486, 489 (9th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>991 F.2d 524, 527 (9th Cir.1993); <em>Hernandez v. Ylst, </em>930 F.2d 714, 716 (9th Cir.1991). However, as the state courts determined, on the facts of this case no bona fide doubt actually arose at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-24\">Nor can we say that the state courts erred when, following a post-trial proceeding, they determined that Pierce was not, in fact, incompetent and was able to participate as required by the United States Constitution, despite his various intention<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>al manipulations and acting out. <em>See Cooper v. Oklahoma, </em>517 U.S. 348, 354, 356, 116 S.Ct. 1373, 1376-77, 134 L.Ed.2d 498 (1996); <em>Drope v.
