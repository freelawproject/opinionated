The district court precluded the cross-examination because the questions proposed \u201cdidn\u2019t relate to the underlying fact\u201d of the alleged untruthfulness but instead pertained solely to a panel\u2019s credibility determination of the witness\u2019s testimony in an unrelated context. The district court also noted that its \u201cofficial inclination is there is insufficient probative value, outweighed by the prejudice.\u201d Because these determinations by the district court were harmless even if they were error, we affirm the appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-20\">The limitation on Villarreal\u2019s cross-examination was harmless because Villarreal\u2019s testimony relating to Williams\u2019 gun possession was fully corroborated by the testimony of a second officer. Accordingly, we affirm because even if the evidentiary ruling made by the district court was error, it was harmless. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-21\">We have carefully considered all of appellant\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-22\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
