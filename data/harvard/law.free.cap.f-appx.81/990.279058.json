Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">Peter John Cormier appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas petition based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Cormier also appeals the court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing. We have jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">The Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In order for Cormier to succeed on his petition, he must show that \u201cin light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were outside the <em>wide range of'professionally competent assistance.\u201d Id. </em>at 690 (emphasis added). \u201cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential,\u201d and there is a strong presumption that counsel \u201crendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-15\">Moreover, even if \u201cthe identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,\u201d the counsel\u2019s errors must also deprive the appellant of a fair trial. <em>Id. </em>at 690. The appellant must demonstrate that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-16\">Cormier essentially asserts that his trial counsel erred in failing to argue that Cormier\u2019s consent to search his motel room was not voluntary because he thought, as a probationer, he had to consent. Cormier cites this court\u2019s case of <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>323 F.3d 700 (9th Cir.2003), for support. However, since Cormier filed his brief, this court has taken that case en banc. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>343 F.3d 961 (9th Cir.2003)(en banc). Accordingly, <em>Crawford </em>has no precedential value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-17\">However, even if this court had not taken <em>Cranford </em>en banc, <em>Crawford </em>does not help Cormier. In <em>Crawford </em>this court held that the Fourth Amendment requires reasonable suspicion to search a parolee\u2019s residence even when state law permits a search without suspicion. <em>Crawford, </em>323 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>F.3d at 717-18. Where officers do not have reasonable suspicion, a compulsory parole condition may not serve as consent to engage in an otherwise unreasonable search. <em>Id. </em>Because the facts of <em>Crawford </em>are distinguishable from this case \u2014 where there was no mention of Cormier\u2019s being on parole or probation and Detective Peters did not rely on Cormier\u2019s status as a probationer to acquire consent \u2014 Cormier\u2019s argument fails. Because neither the facts of this case, nor case law advances Cormier\u2019s legal theory, we cannot find that his counsel acted \u201coutside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">An evidentiary hearing is required if the appellant can \u201callege specific facts which, if true, would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>United States v. McMullen, </em>98 F.3d 1155, 1158-59 (9th Cir.1996). As discussed above, even if the facts Cormier alleges are true, case law does not support habeas relief. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1023-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
