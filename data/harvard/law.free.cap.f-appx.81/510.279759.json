Lopez contends that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for using or possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense. He also asserts that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional because it does not require a substantial effect on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-21\">The district court determined that Lopez had raised his shirt to reveal a firearm during a confrontation in which Lopez had vandalized someone\u2019s car and the men with Lopez had assaulted someone. The court concluded that this display of the weapon was done in a threatening manner and constituted an aggravated assault under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.02. Considering the totality of the circumstances, we find that this determination is not clearly erroneous and that the district court did not err in applying the enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). <em>See United States v. Stevenson, </em>126 F.3d 662, 664 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Edwards v. State, </em>57 S.W.3d 677, 680 (Tex.App.-Beaumont 2001, pet refd); <em>Tanksley v. State, </em>656 S.W.2d 194, 195-96 (Tex.App.-Austin 1983, no pet.).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-22\">Lopez concedes that his argument that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause is foreclosed by circuit precedent. He raises the issue to preserve possible Supreme Court review. As we have repeatedly held, the \u201cconstitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) is not open to question.\u201d <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 517 (5th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1150, 122 S.Ct. 1113, 151 L.Ed.2d 1007 (2002); <em>see also United States v. Lee, </em>310 F.3d 787, 788-89 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b542-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
