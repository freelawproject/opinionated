We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">We review a dismissal on the pleadings <em>de novo. Dworkin v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 867 </em>F.2d 1188, 1192 (9th Cir.1989). We review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a motion for reconsideration of dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) for abuse of discretion. <em>Bellus v. United States, </em>125 F.3d 821, 822 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">The district court did not err in holding that it is lawful under Hawaii law to charge taxicab customers a flat rate rather than a metered rate. The plain language of Honolulu\u2019s Taxicab Ordinance, Revised Ordinance of Honolulu Chapter 12, Article I, expressly permits both drivers and taxi companies to offer fares to passengers at less than the metered rate. <em>See </em>ROH \u00a7 12 \u2014 1.10(c)(4). Furthermore, Taxi Ordinance \u00a7 12-1.4(e) expressly permits payments of \u201clegitimate commissions to tour and travel companies\u201d such as Defendant JTB Corporation, and it also permits payment of such commissions to taxi companies. R.O.H. \u00a7 12-1.4(e). Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that, under Hawaii law, Charley\u2019s Taxi Radio Dispatch Corp. (\u201cCharley\u2019s Taxi\u201d) had a legal basis both to provide discounted fares, and to charge the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b689-16\">The district court did not err in granting judgment against the Plaintiffs on their claims pursuant to the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(2). As an initial matter, we note that the Defendants have connections to interstate and international tourism that are sufficient to meet the <em>de .minimis </em>level of interstate commerce required for us to exercise jurisdiction over extortion claims under the Hobbs Act. <em>See U.S. v. Atcheson, </em>94 F.3d 1237, 1243 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-17\">The Hobbs Act makes it a crime to interfere with commerce by use of extortion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). \u201c \u2018[Ejxtortion\u2019 means the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(2). In this case, it is undisputed that the acts in question were the result of a contractual relationship between Charley\u2019s Taxi and the Plaintiffs. Given that the contractual terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>have been determined to be lawful under Hawaii law, and that the actions of Charley\u2019s Taxi were under a claim of right, not force or fear, the extortion claim is not legally viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Because Plaintiffs have made insufficient allegations of the predicate racketeering act of extortion, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, their claims brought pursuant to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968 are also legally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The Plaintiffs contend that the interest rates charged by Charley\u2019s Taxi were usurious, another alleged violation of RICO. The rate of interest one can lawfully charge under applicable federal and state law depends in part on whether any commissions or rates of interest were stipulated in written agreements between the parties. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(6) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(b); Hawaii Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 478-2, 478-4. Defendants claim that there were such written contracts; Plaintiffs claim that there were not. Unfortunately, the written agreements were not part of the district court record. Normally, this factual dispute would require a remand to determine the issue. However, to resolve the issue without the necessity of a remand to the district court, we ordered the parties to supplement the record pursuant to Fed. RApp. P. 10(e). Having now reviewed the supplemental material, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting judgment against the Plaintiffs on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b689-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
