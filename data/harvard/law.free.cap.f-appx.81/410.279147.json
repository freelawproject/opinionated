Before us, as before the District Court, Carmon alleges that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred in determining that Carmon\u2019s impairments do not entitle him to disability benefits and supplemental security income, and that the ALJ erred in determining that, despite his health problems, Carmon was capable of returning to work. The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g) and 1383(c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and entered a final order affirming the ALJ\u2019s opinion and dismissing Carmon\u2019s challenge on March 31, 2003. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and will vacate the order of the District Court, remanding with directions to remand the cause to the ALJ for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-17\">Because this opinion is not precedential, we will recite only those facts relevant to disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-18\">Antonio Carmon has HIV. On April 2, 1996, Carmon went to Rahway Hospital in Rahway, New Jersey, sick with what he thought was the flu. Carmon was admitted to the hospital and spent the better part of the following two months there. Carmon was treated by Dr. Kornicki, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>was referred to an HIV specialist, Dr. Ruggeri-Weigel. Each doctor noted a host of symptoms and possible causes, and ordered a battery of tests. Among the symptoms and possible causes were: pneumonitis, febrile illness, thrush, malnutrition, diarrhea, and history of HIV positive disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The results of the tests ordered by both doctors showed an absence of pneumocysistis earnii, or any other of a number of viral indicators. Indeed, by time of discharge, Dr. Ruggeri-Weigel noted that Carmon was \u201cfeeling fine\u201d and denied \u201cfever, night sweats, diarrhea, or fatigue.\u201d Although during his June 6,1996 visit with Carmon Dr. Kornicki noted weight gain of sixteen pounds, his outlook for Carmon was never as optimistic as that of Dr. Ruggeri-Weigel. On October 17, 1996, well after discharge, Dr. Kornicki wrote that Carmon\u2019s long-term prognosis was \u201cdifficult to state\u201d due to his multiple medications and viral load.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Kornicki also expressed that \u201cthe likelihood of [Carmon] doing any constrictive work [was] probably extremely poor.\u201d It is undisputed that Carmon has not worked since April 15, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">On August 27, 1996, Carmon applied for disability insurance benefits. On September 20, 1996, Carmon applied for supplemental security income for the period beginning April 15, 1996.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Carmon\u2019s applications were denied, both initially and on reconsideration, so Carmon exercised his right to <em>de novo </em>consideration by an ALJ. After a hearing on May 6, 1998, the ALJ issued an opinion. The ALJ first determined that Carmon had proven he was not gainfully employed, that he had an impairment, and that his impairment was severe.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the ALJ determined that Carmon\u2019s medical condition was not equivalent to anything on the Social Security Administration list of ailments that are sufficiently severe to justify a presumption in favor of benefit-entitling disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The ALJ farther determined that Carmon retained the capacity to perform \u201clight work\u201d pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567. Under this definition, the ALJ found that Carmon was capable of lifting 10 pounds frequently and up to 20 pounds occasionally. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ concluded that Carmon was therefore able to return to his past relevant work as a hospital food service employee, which Carmon\u2019s files characterized as requiring frequent lifting of items up to 20 pounds. Having determined that Carmon was not entitled to disability benefits, the ALJ did not proceed further.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Carmon sought review of the ALJ\u2019s decision by the Appeals Council, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Appeals Council determined that there were no grounds for such review. After exhausting these administrative remedies, Carmon filed the present action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on February 7, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Before the District Court, as before us, Carmon contended that the ALJ erred by: (1) failing to explain why Carmoris impairments, alone or in combination, did not meet the criteria of paragraphs 14.08(D)(2)(b), 14.08(M) or 14.08(N) of the list of presumptively disabling impairments contained in the Social Security regulations; (2) rejecting a treating physician\u2019s medical opinion in favor of that of a non-treating physician; (3) determining that Carmon had a residual functional capacity sufficient for him to perform his past relevant work; and (4) rejecting Carmoris subjective complaints without sufficient analysis. The District Court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision on all grounds. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Although we have plenary review of all legal issues, <em>see Krysztoforski v. Chater, </em>55 F.3d 857, 858 (3d Cir.1995), our factual review is limited to whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination. Substantial evidence is \u201cless than a preponderance of the evidence but more than a mere scintilla.\u201d <em>Jesurum v. Sec\u2019y of the United States Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>48 F.3d 114, 117 (3d Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). \u201c \u2018It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Ventura v. Shalala, </em>55 F.3d 900, 901 (3d Cir.1995)). Overall, the substantial evidence standard is a deferential standard of review. <em>See Schaudeck v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>181 F.3d 429, 431 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">A claimant is entitled to disability insurance benefits if he or she can prove an \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). A claimant is considered unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity \u201conly if his physical or mental impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A); <em>see also Fargnoli v. Massanari, </em>247 F.3d 34, 39 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">The Social Security Administration has promulgated a five-step evaluation process for use by the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration in determining whether an individual is disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520; <em>see also Plummer, </em>186 F.3d at 428. The process requires the Commissioner to sequentially determine the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">(1) Whether the claimant is currently engaging in substantial gainful activity. If so, the claimant is not eligible for disability benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">(2) Whether the claimant is suffering from a severe impairment. If not, the claimant is not eligible for disability benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">(3) Whether the evidence establishes that the claimant suffers from any ailment in a list of ailments presumed serious enough to preclude gainful work. If so, the claimant is automatically eligible for disability benefits. If not, the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>sioner proceeds to the next step. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">(4) Whether the claimant retains the \u201cresidual functional capacity\u201d to perform his past relevant work. If so, the claimant is not eligible for disability benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">(5) Whether-given the claimant\u2019s medical impairments, age, education, past work experience, and \u201cresidual functional capacity-jobs exist in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant can perform. If so, the claimant is not eligible for benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The claimant bears the burden of proof at the first four steps, and the Commissioner bears the burden at the fifth. <em>See Fargnoli, </em>247 F.3d at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The ALJ determined that Carmon had proven he was not gainfully employed and that his impairment was severe. Therefore, steps 1 and 2 are not at issue. At step 3, however, the ALJ determined that Carmon\u2019s medical condition was not equivalent to anything on the list of presumptively disabling ailments. The ALJ\u2019s analysis, in its entirety, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">[Carmon] has no impairment which [sic] meets the criteria of any of the listed impairments described in Appendix 1 of the Regulations (20 C.F.R., Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1). No treating or examining physician has mentioned findings equivalent in severity to the criteria of any listed impairment. Specifically, the undersigned evaluated the claimant\u2019s HIV infection under the requirements of listing 14.08(Id.). Although the claimant does have some symptoms of HIV, his condition fails to meet or medically equal the requirements of this listed impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Carmon challenges that determination, contending that his condition falls within (or is equivalent to) paragraphs 14.08(D)(2)(b), 14.08(M) or 14.08(N), and that the ALJ\u2019s determination is impermissibly conclusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">We are troubled by the ALJ\u2019s summary determination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have repeatedly stated that we are unable to conduct our substantial evidence review if the ALJ fails to identify the evidence he or she rejects and the reason for its rejection. <em>See Walton v. Halter, </em>243 F.3d 703, 710 (3d Cir.2001). Our precedent requires much more than a mere conclusory statement that the claimant\u2019s conditions are not found in the listings. <em>See Burnett v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>220 F.3d 112, 121 (3d Cir.2000); <em>Cotter v. Harris, </em>642 F.2d 700, 705 (3d Cir.1981). The reason is not merely a desire to make the ALJ jump through additional \u201choops.\u201d Substantial evidence review is all but impossible without an adequate indication of what the ALJ considered, what he or she rejected, and why. <em>Cotter, </em>642 F.2d at 705-06. But we need not determine whether a remand is necessary here to clarify the process by which the ALJ reached his step 3 determination, because remand is unquestionably necessary with respect to the ALJ\u2019s step 4 determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">The ALJ determined that Carmon was capable of \u201clight work,\u201d as that term is defined by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(b). The definition of \u201clight work\u201d provides that an employee be asked to lift up to 20 pounds, but <em>frequent </em>lifting is restricted to items <em>10 pounds </em>or less. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(b). The ALJ also explicitly looked to and credited Carmon\u2019s description of his duties at his past relevant work as a hospital food service worker. Carmon\u2019s filings make clear that as a hospital food service worker he was <em>frequently </em>expected to lift cartons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>of juice and milk weighing up to <em>20 pounds </em>.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The ALJ\u2019s residual capacity determination under step 4, therefore, is at odds with his determination that Carmon was capable of resuming his past relevant work: the ALJ would send Carmon back to do <em>frequently </em>that which the ALJ already determined Carmon could only do <em>occasionally </em>\u2014 lift 20 pounds. The definition of \u201cmedium work\u201d would seem more appropriate to fit Carmon\u2019s past relevant work as it provides that the employee be asked to lift up to <em>25 pounds frequently, </em>and more than that infrequently. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(c). We cannot square the responsibilities of Carmon\u2019s past relevant work with the ALJ\u2019s determination of his residual capacity, given the C.F.R.\u2019s definitions of light and medium work.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A remand is necessary to clarify how the ALJ determined that Carmon was able to return to his past relevant work, in light of his residual capacity. We also strongly advise the ALJ to take note of our holdings in <em>Cotter, Burnett </em>and their progeny, and to consider not restricting a revised opinion to clarification of step 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">For the reasons stated above, we vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand with instructions to remand to the Commissioner for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-12\">. \"The law and regulations governing the determination of disability are the same for both disability insurance benefits and [supplemental security income].\" <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 236 (5th Cir.1994). We provide citations only to the regulations respecting disability insurance benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\">. Carmon's T-helper lymphocyte (CD4) count was below 200, an indication that his \"susceptibility [to] opportunistic disease [wa]s considerably increased,\u201d 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, H 14.00(D)(3)(a)(iii), twice within one year: a count of 20 in October, 1996, and a count of 106 in July, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b444-7\">. In connection with his social security claims, Carmon met with a physician from the New Jersey Department of Labor, Dr. Arana S. Patel, on May 13, 1997. Although Dr. Patel never treated Carmon and met with him only once, Dr. Patel conducted a thorough physical examination. Of significance, Dr. Patel observed that Carmon \"looked very healthy\u201d and needed little or no assistance during the examination, for example, getting onto the examination table or dressing himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">The results of the tests run at Rahway Hospital and those conducted by Dr. Patel were also reviewed by state physicians, who drew conclusions with respect to Carmon\u2019s work capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b444-14\">. The Commissioner has promulgated a five-step process of evaluating disability benefit claims. <em>See </em>section II, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b446-9\">. We note that what the ALJ justified in one cursory paragraph required more than seven pages of dense briefing by the Government to buttress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b447-8\">. Cannon's filings actually state that the heaviest object he was expected to lift was 20 pounds, and that he was expected to lift up to 25 pounds frequently. This inconsistency is due to the choices with which Carmon was presented on the form he completed. The two responses can be harmonized by concluding that Carmon\u2019s prior relevant work required him to lift no more than 20 pounds, but required him to do so frequently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b447-20\">. Carmon also challenges the ALJ's step 4 determination as: (1) impermissibly conclusory; (2) impermissibly based on the findings of a non-examining physician despite contradictory findings of an examining physician; and (3) impermissibly dismissive of Carmon\u2019s subjective symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, etc.). We decline to reach the merits of these challenges in light of our determination that a remand is necessary, but reiterate our recommendation that the ALJ reconsider all bases for his prior opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
