In his complaint, he alleged that the appellees committed mail fraud and violated the RICO Act and Hobbs Act. He also alleged violations of the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-19\">First and contrary to Barker\u2019s arguments, the district court properly considered the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss as a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). <em>Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324 (5th Cir.1999). The district court\u2019s consideration of matters of public record did not convert the motion for judgment on the pleadings into a motion for summary judgment. <em>Davis v. Bayless, </em>70 F.3d 367, 372 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995). As for Barker\u2019s cause of action under the Voting Rights Act, Barker, in response to the appellees\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, did not contest the appellees\u2019 assertion that the Voting Rights Act did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-24\">With regard to the mail-fraud claim, Barker pleaded no facts showing that the appellees made any false representations. <em>In re Burzynski, </em>989 F.2d 733, 742 (5th Cir.1993). As for the Hobbs Act claim, Barker failed to allege that the appellees\u2019 supposed extortion affected commerce. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>119 F.3d 1205 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-25\">Because Barker failed to state claims of either mail fraud or extortion, the two alleged predicate acts, he failed to adequately plead a \u201cpattern of racketeering\u201d as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962. <em>Burzynski, </em>989 F.2d at 741. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. This court DENIES Barker\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This court also DENIES Barker\u2019s motion for costs and the appellees\u2019 request for sanctions under Fed. R.App. P. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-26\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND COSTS DENIED; MOTION FOR SANCTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b535-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
