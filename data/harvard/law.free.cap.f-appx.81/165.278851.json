Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review questions of law de novo, and factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1065 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-23\">Sandhu contends that he was denied due process during his immigration hearing due to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. Because Sandhu failed to comply with the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 1988 WL 235454 (BIA 1988), and the alleged ineffective assistance is not plain on the face of the administrative record, <em>see Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 525-26 (9th Cir.2000), we reject this contention, <em>see also Salaam v. INS, </em>229 F.3d 1234, 1239 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>(9th Cir.2000) (holding that credible applicant was not required to produce corroborative evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Because Sandhu does not challenge the merits of the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding, this issue is abandoned. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (stating that issues not discussed or supported by argument in an opening brief are deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AkQ\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
