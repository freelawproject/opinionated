We have reviewed the briefs, pertinent portions of the record, and the applicable authorities and have heard the arguments of counsel. In the prior proceeding, Urbina Nolasco knowingly and intelligently waived counsel, so there was no constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Urbina Nolasco challenges his conviction on the ground that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Urbina Nolasco acknowledges that this issue is foreclosed by binding precedent, and he is raising it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">The judgment of conviction and sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b539-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
