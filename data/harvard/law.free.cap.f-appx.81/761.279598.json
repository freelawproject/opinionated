This court may grant a certificate of appealability only if the appellant makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). Where, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2255 motion on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Willis has not made the requisite showing. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-21\">We construe Willis\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief on appeal as an application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 496, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014(2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a movant must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b) (2000). Willis\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these conditions. Therefore, we decline authorization for Willis to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"Abi\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
