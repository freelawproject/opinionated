We granted a certificate of appealability on the issue \u201cwhether the prosecutor failed to reasonably investigate, pursuant to <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>Upjohn Company for any exculpatory evidence it knew.\u201d We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Habeas relief is available to a state prisoner only when the state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to, or involve[s] an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or is \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented at the state Court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). We conclude that the state court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law in ruling that the prosecutor did not violate <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). It is undisputed that the prosecutor was not aware of the evidence that Izuel characterizes as exculpatory. In <em>Kyles, </em>the Court held that a prosecutor has \u201ca duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case, including the police.\u201d 514 U.S. at 437. Here, the state court found that Upjohn was not acting on the government\u2019s behalf, but instead provided background information. We cannot say that this was an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented to the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1004-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
