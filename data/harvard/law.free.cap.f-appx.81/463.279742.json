See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-25\">Vivian Grayden appeals from her conviction, pursuant to a guilty plea to wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (2000). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-26\">On appeal, Grayden contends her plea colloquy was inadequate and her plea therefore involuntary. Because Grayden did not timely move to withdraw her guilty plea in the district court, this court reviews the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 proceeding for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 527 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 899, 123 S.Ct. 200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002). We have reviewed the record, including the transcript of the hearing conducted before the district court, and are satisfied that Grayden entered her plea knowingly and voluntarily and that there was no error in the plea hearing that affected her substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Grayden\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
