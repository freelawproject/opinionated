(\u201cChapman\u201d) faded to pay to the IRS its employees\u2019 federal withholding taxes for the fourth quarter of 1994 and the first quarter of 1995. The Government brought this civil action against Richard Sibbrel (\u201cSibbrel\u201d). It asserted that he was a \u201cresponsible person\u201d at Chapman within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672 and sought to reduce to judgment its assessment of \u201ctrust fund\u201d recovery penalties against him. Following a two-day bench trial, the district court made oral findings of fact and conclusions of law, entered judgment for Sibbrel, and awarded him attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430. A panel of this Court reversed by memorandum disposition, <em>United States v. Chapman, </em>7 Fed.Appx. 804 (9th Cir.2001). The panel concluded \u201cthat the district court\u2019s finding that Sibbrel was not a \u2018responsible person\u2019 derives from the use of improper legal standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-17\">On remand, the parties stipulated to use the prior trial transcript and the documentary evidence admitted in that trial as if the case had been tried <em>de novo. </em>Thereafter, the district court issued lengthy and thorough written findings of fact and conclusions of law, again entered judgment for Sibbrel, and again awarded him attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The Government argues in this appeal that the district court erred in determining that Sibbrel was not a \u201cresponsible person\u201d of Chapman because the court again applied improper legal standards and ignored the prior panel\u2019s directives. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>\u201c[Responsibility is a matter of status, duty, and authority....\u201d <em>Davis v. United States, </em>961 F.2d 867, 873 (9th Cir.1992). \u201cAuthority turns on the scope and nature of an individual\u2019s power to determine how the corporation conducts its financial affairs; the duty to ensure that withheld employment taxes are paid ... flows from the authority that enables one to do so.\u201d <em>Purcell v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 932, 937 (9th Cir.1993). The district court thoroughly considered Chapman\u2019s by-laws and other documentary evidence, evaluated the testimony of various witnesses contained in the transcript, correctly applied the relevant case-law, and determined that Sibbrel did not have the authority to determine how Chapman conducted its financial affairs or the duty to ensure that withheld employment taxes were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Distilled to its essence, the district court\u2019s judgment for Sibbrel turned on the district court\u2019s finding that Sibbrel\u2019s testimony about his lack of authority over how Chapman conducted its financial affairs was more credible than the contrary testimony of David Chapman, Jr., Chapman\u2019s President and CEO. Because the district court\u2019s findings were predicated on a credibility determination, we give them great deference and decline the Government\u2019s invitation to overturn them. <em>See United States v. Kerr, </em>876 F.2d 1440, 1444 (9th Cir.1989).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">The district court awarded Sibbrel attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs under \u00a7 7430. The award was based on the court\u2019s finding that the Government\u2019s position throughout this litigation was not \u201csubstantially justified\u201d in law or in fact. This was a close case. Had the district court not discounted the credibility of Chapman, Jr.\u2019s testimony because it determined that he was biased, this case might have come out the other way. Thus, the Government\u2019s position was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7430. <em>See Norgaard v. Commissioner, </em>939 F.2d 874, 881 (9th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">Each side shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b947-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-6\">. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Sibbrel was not a responsible person, we need not address the second prong of \u00a7 6672 that asks whether Sibbrel \"willfully refused to pay the tax.\u201d <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>33 F.3d 1137, 1139 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
