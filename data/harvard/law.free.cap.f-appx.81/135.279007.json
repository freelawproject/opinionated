We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-26\">Camara argues that the district court erred in considering him a \u201ccareer offender\u201d for purposes of sentencing because one of his prior convictions resulted in a civil commitment to the California Rehabilitation Center (\u201cCRC\u201d) instead of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>criminal custody. A \u201ccareer offender\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) is someone who is at least eighteen years old, who has previously been convicted of two or more felonies that are crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses, and for whom the instant offense is a felony that is a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. A \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d is defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4BL2(b) as \u201can offense under federal or state law, punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year,\u201d that prohibits certain activities involving a controlled substance. There is no question that Camara\u2019s 1993 convictions were controlled substance offenses for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>See United States v. Sandoval-Venegas, </em>292 F.3d 1101, 1107 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Section 4B1.2 is predicated upon the offense\u2019s being punishable by a term of more than one year. Thus its application turns upon the potential sentence \u2014 not upon the actual sentence imposed. Application Note 1 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 indicates that this is \u00a7 4B1.2\u2019s meaning, for it provides that \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d means \u201ca prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed.\u201d Accordingly, the plain meaning of this guideline encompasses Camara\u2019s conviction because the maximum punishment was greater than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Camara also submits that the determination that he deserved civil commitment rather than criminal punishment shows that he should not be treated as a career criminal. We disagree. The court was not precluded from classifying him as a career offender just because his sentence of confinement was suspended and he was civilly committed to a narcotics treatment program. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>932 F.2d 752, 764 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that the district court was not precluded from classifying Davis as career offender just because state court imposed misdemeanor sentence for prior controlled substance offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Finally, Camara contends that the purposes of \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) are not served by classifying one who suffers from narcotics addiction as a career offender. However, Camara was not punished for his status as an addict, <em>Sanchez v. Nelson, </em>446 F.2d 849, 850 (9th Cir.1971) (per curiam), but for possession of controlled substances with the intent to sell them to others, Cal. Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 11351, 11359.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b167-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
