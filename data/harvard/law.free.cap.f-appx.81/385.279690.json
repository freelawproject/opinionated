PARKER, and RAGGI, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b418-12\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">In 1998, Plaintiff-Appellant Gladstone Ford brought a Title VII race discrimination and retaliation claim against his former employer, the New York City Transit Authority and the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Operating Authority. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants after concluding that Ford had demonstrated no issues of material fact supporting either claim. In August 2002, we affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment by summary order. <em>See Ford v. New York City Transit Author., </em>43 Fed.Appx. 445 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">In February 2003, Ford returned to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, seeking relief from the previous judgment by filing what he styled a \u201ccomplaint\u201d and an \u201cindependent action brought pursuant to [Fed. R.Civ.P.] 60(b)(3) &amp; (6).\u201d Ford alleged specifically that the defendants\u2019 attorney, Barbara Roth, committed a fraud upon the district court by (1) falsely informing the district court that Ford\u2019s EEOC charges had been dismissed, (2) soliciting an affidavit that Ford alleges included false statements, and (3) misrepresenting the adequacy of Ford\u2019s evidence and his efforts to comply with discovery. The district court characterized this \u201ccomplaint\u201d as a Rule 60(b) motion and denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-16\">On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party\u2019s legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: ... (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; ... or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken____ This rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, ... or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">If characterized as a 60(b)(3) motion, Ford\u2019s claim would be time-barred, because it was brought more than one year after the June 2001 summary judgment. An \u201cindependent action\u201d based upon \u201cfraud upon the court\u201d may, however, be brought at any time, <em>see Gleason v. Jandrucko, </em>860 F.2d 556, 558 (2d Cir.1988), so long as it is not barred by the doctrine of laches, <em>see Simons v. United States, </em>452 F.2d 1110, 1116 (2d Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">But Ford has alleged no facts that could support such an action. Appellees committed no wrong by informing the district court that the EEOC had \u201cdismissed\u201d Ford\u2019s charges. It is commonplace to refer to an EEOC right to sue letter as a dismissal. <em>See, e.g., Elmenayer v. ABF Freight System, Inc., </em>318 F.3d 130, 133 (2d Cir.2003). Even if the affidavit to which Ford objects included false statements\u2014 for which we see no evidence \u2014 that would not suffice to support a claim of fraud upon the court. <em>See Gleason, </em>860 F.2d at 559. And the appellees\u2019 argument below that \u201cthe record contains absolutely nothing other than Ford\u2019s self-serving speculation and surmise to support his claims\u201d does not misconstrue or \u201csuppress\u201d the evidence produced by Ford \u2014 it merely attests to the appellees\u2019 belief that such evidence was insufficient to support Ford\u2019s claim. Although Ford insists that the appellees lied by stating that he had failed to produce certain notes in response to discovery, he provides us with no evidence that he did in fact produce the documents in question. Finally, even had there been misrepresentations by the appellees regarding Ford\u2019s evidence or compliance with discovery at this stage, Ford could have raised this issue in his opposition to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Ford has thus not shown that he \u201chad no opportunity to litigate the allegations of fraud on the court\u201d in the previous proceeding. <em>Weldon v. United States, </em>70 F.3d 1, 5 (2d Cir.1995). He has also offered no evidence that the appellees committed any fraud or misrepresentation at all, much less the heightened form of \u201cfraud which seriously affects the integrity of the normal process of adjudication\u201d which is the predicate of an action under the savings clause of Rule 60(b). <em>Gleason, </em>860 F.2d at 559. We have considered all of the appellant\u2019s claims and find them meritless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-8\">. The appellees request that we enjoin the plaintiff from bringing any further similar actions against them. After considering the factors outlined in <em>Safir v. U.S. Lines, Inc., </em>792 F.2d 19, 24 (2d Cir.1986), we conclude that Ford's conduct does not rise to the level of \"vexatious\u201d or \"harassing,\u201d and therefore decline to impose sanctions upon him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
