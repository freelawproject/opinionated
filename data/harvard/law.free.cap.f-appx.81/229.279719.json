We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir.1998) (order), and we affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-24\">The district court properly dismissed Ward\u2019s access to courts claim challenging Arizona Department of Corrections Policy Number 902, because Ward has demonstrated his ability to present his claims to the court. <em>See Madrid v. Gomez, </em>190 F.3d 990, 995 (9th Cir.1999) (internal quotation omitted) (a prisoner\u2019s right of access to the courts \u201crequires prison authorities to provide prisoners with the capability of bringing contemplated challenges to sentences or conditions of confinement before the courts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-25\">The district court erred, however, in relying on <em>Zuther v. Arizona, </em>199 Ariz. 104, 14 P.3d 295 (2000), to dismiss Ward\u2019s due process claim challenging the withholding of a $50 release fee in a dedicated discharge account. <em>Zuther </em>is inapposite because in that case, the prisoner was ultimately released and granted access to the $50 fee; here, Ward is serving a 197-year sentence and will never gain access to the release fee. Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of Ward\u2019s due process claim, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>remand for further proceedings as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b261-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
