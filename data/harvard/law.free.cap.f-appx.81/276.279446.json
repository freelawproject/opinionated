R.Civ.P. 12(b)(5). The district court granted Defendant\u2019s motion and dismissed Plaintiffs claim with prejudice because Plaintiff failed to properly serve Defendant within the applicable statute of limitations. Thereafter, Plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider the judgment, which the district court properly construed as a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). The district court denied Plaintiffs motion. On appeal, Plaintiff argues: (1) Defendant is equitably es-topped from raising insufficient service of process as an affirmative defense; or alternatively (2) Plaintiff should be allowed to re-serve Defendant. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-16\">We review a district court\u2019s order denying a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Matosantos Commercial Corp. v. Applebee\u2019s Intern., Inc., </em>245 F.3d 1203, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>1218 (10th Cir.2001). Under an abuse of discretion standard, \u201ca trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed unless the appellate court has a definite and firm conviction that the lower court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Phelps v. Hamilton, </em>122 F.3d 1309, 1324 (10th Cir.1997). As noted by both parties, we generally review the district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to dismiss on matters of personal jurisdiction and proper service of process <em>de novo. See Jenkins v. City of Topeka, </em>136 F.3d 1274, 1275 (10th Cir.1998). The <em>de novo </em>standard of review does not apply here, however, because Plaintiff has not appealed the district court\u2019s order granting Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Instead, Plaintiff only appeals the denial of his motion to reconsider, which the district court properly construed as a Rule 59(e) motion. Therefore, applying the Rule 59(e) abuse of discretion standard, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Plaintiff filed a medical malpractice claim against Defendant in Kansas state court alleging Defendant failed to diagnose a brain tumor. Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed that suit. On June 21, 2001, Plaintiff re-filed his medical malpractice claim against Defendant in the District of Kansas. Plaintiff served a petition and summons on Defendant at his business address in Portland, Oregon by certified mail, return receipt requested. The signature on the certified mail receipt was illegible and Defendant denies signing the receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Defendant filed an answer to Plaintiffs complaint on August 1, 2001. In the answer, Defendant raised affirmative defenses of improper service of process and lack of personal jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2) and (b)(5). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff\u2019s claim for insufficient service of process on November 15, 2001. The district court granted Defendant\u2019s motion and dismissed Plaintiff\u2019s claim with prejudice because the applicable statute of limitations had expired. Plaintiff then filed a motion to reconsider, properly renamed by the district court as a motion to alter or amend the judgment, which the district court denied. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e), service upon an individual may be effected in one of two ways: (1) Pursuant to the law of the state in which the district court is located; or, (2) By delivering a copy of the summons and the complaint to the individual personally. Plaintiff in this case attempted service under Kansas law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e)(1) and both parties agree that Kansas law applies. Under Kansas law, a plaintiff must first attempt to serve a defendant at his home. Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 60-304(a). If service cannot be effectuated at defendant\u2019s home, only then may a plaintiff attempt to serve a defendant at his place of business by restricted delivery. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">Here, Plaintiff failed to initially serve Defendant at his home as required by \u00a7 60-304(a). Instead, Plaintiff delivered the complaint to Defendant\u2019s business. Further, Plaintiff failed to request restricted delivery as required by \u00a7 60-304(a). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found Plaintiff failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>properly serve Defendant under Kansas law. <em>See supra </em>text 278 and note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Plaintiff argues that despite his failure to properly effectuate service, Defendant is equitably estopped from raising a deficient service of process defense. Plaintiff claims that Defendant\u2019s answer was misleading and that Defendant failed to inform him of his deficient service in a timely manner. In Kansas, equitable estoppel \u201cexists when [a] party by [its] acts, representations, admissions, or silence induced another party to believe certain facts existed upon which [it] detrimentally relied and acted.\u201d <em>Turon State Bank v. Bozarth, </em>235 Kan. 786, 684 P.2d 419, 422 (Kan.1984). Estoppel by silence requires an intent to mislead \u201cor at least a willingness that others should be deceived.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Plaintiff mistakenly relies on <em>Yoh v. Hoffman </em>for his estoppel argument. 29 Kan.App.2d 312, 27 P.3d 927 (Kan.Ct.App. 2001). In <em>Yoh, </em>defendant\u2019s counsel failed to inform plaintiff of defendant\u2019s death and continued to act as if the defendant was still alive. <em>Id. </em>at 929. The court noted that these acts constituted \u201ca long-term, deliberate deception of their opponent and the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 931. Unlike the situation in <em>Yoh, </em>the record here is devoid of any evidence Defendant engaged in deliberate fraud. We are not persuaded by Plaintiffs argument that Defendant misled him when Defendant \u201cadmitted\u201d in his answer he could be served at work rather then at home. Defendant only admitted in his answer he <em>could </em>be served at work, not that he was <em>properly </em>served at work. Perhaps Defendant was comfortable with being served at work, but that fact alone does not prove Plaintiff provided Defendant with actual notice of his suit. To argue that Defendant\u2019s \u201cadmission\u201d in his answer rises to the level of fraud or deceit is unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Plaintiff also argues Defendant deliberately misled him by waiting until the statute of limitations on his medical malpractice claim expired before filing his motion to dismiss for insufficient process and by failing to notify Plaintiff of any service problems during their scheduling conferences. Defendant, however, had until November 15, 2001 to file any motions based on personal jurisdiction as mandated by court order. Defendant filed his motion to dismiss on or before that day. The fact that Plaintiffs statute of limitations ran in the interim is not Defendant\u2019s fault. Further, Defendant indicated that he was disputing service when he raised insufficient service of process as an affirmative defense in his August 1, 2001 answer. Therefore, we reject Plaintiffs equitable estoppel argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Second, Plaintiff argues that even assuming his service of process was defective, he can re-serve Defendant under Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 60-203(b). Section 60 \u2014 203(b) is a \u201csavings\u201d statute that permits a plaintiff to re-serve a defendant within ninety days if service was \u201cpurported to have been made,\u201d but was later adjudicated invalid. In relevant part, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-11\">If service of process ... <em>purports to have been made </em>but is later adjudicated to have been invalid due to any irregularity in form or procedure or <em>any </em>defect in making service, the action shall nevertheless be deemed to have been commenced at the applicable time under subsection (a) if valid service is obtained ... within 90 days after that adjudication, except that the court may extend that time an additional 30 days upon a showing of good cause by the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVK\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">The Kansas legislature enacted \u00a7 60-203(b) to \u201creduce the instances in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>defective service of process ... resulted] in actions being barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Grimmett v. Burke, </em>21 Kan.App.2d 638, 906 P.2d 156, 162 (Kan.Ct. App.1995). According to the Kansas Supreme Court, the purpose of \u00a7 60-203(b) was to prevent the statute of limitations from running in situations where service was held to be defective, and the claim time-barred, even though the defendant \u201chad actual knowledge of the pendency of the action through the faulty process.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Martin, </em>240 Kan. 370, 729 P.2d 1200, 1204 (Kan.1986) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The Kansas Supreme Court noted that the inquiry under \u00a7 60-203(b) was factual in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 1204-05. The court also explained that \u00a7 60-203(b) should be liberally construed and applied if a plaintiff purportedly makes valid service, which in turn gives a defendant actual notice of suit. <em>Id. </em>at 1204 (noting that \u201c[t]he use of the word <em>any </em>makes crystal clear the legislative intent that the statute is to be liberally applied in cases involving <em>any irregularity </em>or <em>any defect </em>in the service of process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In <em>Grimmett v. Burke, </em>21 Kan.App.2d 638, 906 P.2d 156, 163 (1995), the Kansas Court of Appeals recognized that the Kansas Supreme Court construed \u00a7 60-203(b) liberally; nevertheless, it stated the statute could be construed in one of two ways: \u201cone is extremely liberal and the other appears to be a commonsense approach.\u201d The court explained that an excessively liberal application of \u00a7 60-203(b) would \u201cestablish that a plaintiff <em>always </em>gets a second chance under section 60-203(b) when his or her original service has been determined invalid. This would be true no matter how inept or how lacking in good faith the original service may have been.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163-64. The court noted that \u201csuch a liberal construction is ludicrous; [and] we do not believe it was intended and will not adopt that approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court in <em>Grimmett, </em>building upon the principles set forth in <em>Hughes, </em>prescribed more judicially manageable standards to \u00a7 60-203(b). The court indicated that Kansas\u2019 service of process rules would be rendered meaningless if there were no limits to the statute. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the court recognized that \u00a7 60-203(b) first requires a plaintiff to show he \u201cpurportedly made valid service\u201d upon defendant before permitting re-service. <em>Id. </em>at 164. The court set forth the following factors interpreting the phrase \u201cpurports to have made valid service\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">Before it can be said that service has \u201cpurported to have been made,\u201d it must be shown that a defendant was given actual notice of having been sued. We also conclude that the following factors should exist: (1) The original service must have \u201cappeared\u201d to be valid and the returns by the sheriffs office or other process servers must indicate that the service was valid. (2) The record should show that the plaintiff believed in good faith that his or her service was valid and relied on that validity to his or her detriment. (3) The plaintiff had no reason to believe the defendant was contesting service until after the statute of limitations had run, but had no opportunity to take steps to correct the defective service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">In this case, Plaintiff argues the district court erred when it applied the <em>Grimmett </em>factors, rather than the liberal approach utilized in <em>Hughes. </em>Plaintiffs argument is based on the flawed premise that a difference exists between the interpretation of \u00a7 60-203(b) in <em>Hughes </em>and <em>Grimmett. Grimmett </em>does not conflict with the liberal approach found in <em>Hughes. </em>Both eases conform with the plain language of the statute. The district court correctly noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>that \u201c[w]hat [PJlaintiff fails to recognize is that <em>Grimmett </em>set the standard. Prior to <em>Grimmett, </em>no court ... had been called upon to explicitly determine when service is \u2018purported to have been made.\u2019 \u201d Thus, <em>Grimmett </em>simply expanded upon <em>Hughes </em>\u2019 analysis by explaining, in greater detail, the initial requirements of \u00a7 60 \u2014 203(b). Further, the Kansas Supreme Court in <em>Hughes </em>clearly limited its liberal application of \u00a7 60 \u2014 203(b) to the facts of that case. <em>Hughes, </em>729 P.2d at 1204-05. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it applied the <em>Grimmett </em>factors to Plaintiffs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it held Plaintiff failed to show he purportedly made valid service of process under \u00a7 60 \u2014 203(b). According to <em>Grimmett, </em>the notion that Plaintiff purportedly made valid service under \u00a7 60-203(b) is premised on Plaintiff demonstrating Defendant received actual notice of suit. 906 P.2d at 164. In Kansas, Plaintiff bears the burden of making a prima facie showing he complied with the service statutes. <em>Taylor v. Phelan, </em>912 F.2d 429, 431 (10th Cir.1990). Further, if the jurisdictional allegations in a complaint are challenged, the plaintiff must support them with competent proof. <em>Pytlik v. Professional Resources, Ltd., </em>887 F.2d 1371, 1376 (10th Cir.1989). Plaintiff fails to satisfy his burden. Plaintiff admits he did not properly serve Defendant under Kansas law. Instead of serving Defendant at his home, Plaintiff attempted to serve him at work. Someone at Defendant\u2019s office received the summons because someone signed the receipt; however, Plaintiff cannot prove Defendant signed the receipt. Further, Defendant denies signing the receipt. The district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">If Plaintiff felt that the signature on the return was actually Defendant\u2019s, or that it would satisfy legal requirements, then Plaintiff should have supported his position with competent proof.... His failure to do so resulted not only in a deficient prima facie showing, but also resulted in a complete absence of evidence from which the court could conclude that Defendant had the \u2018actual notice\u2019 required for a finding that service is \u2018purported to have been made\u2019 pursuant to K.S.A. 60-203(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Plaintiff argues Defendant had actual notice because he filed an answer. Defendant\u2019s counsel stated at oral argument, however, that they only filed an answer because Plaintiffs counsel sent them an affidavit of service. This affidavit of service may have placed Defendant\u2019s counsel on notice, but it did not necessarily place Defendant on notice. <em>See Grimmett, </em>906 P.2d at 161 (explaining that knowledge of attempted invalid service by defendant\u2019s attorney does not constitute substantial compliance or indicate defendant knew of service); <em>see also id. </em>at 163-64 (some limits to the application of \u00a7 60-203(b) must exist or the Kansas service rules will be rendered completely meaningless). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found Plaintiff was unable to prove Defendant received actual notice of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">The remaining <em>Grimmett </em>factors are extraneous because Plaintiff fails to show Defendant received actual notice of suit. Nevertheless, we shall briefly discuss why Plaintiff fails to satisfy those factors as well. Following actual notice, <em>Grimmett </em>requires a plaintiff to show that his attempted service had the appearance of being valid. 906 P.2d at 164. The court in <em>Grimmett </em>explained that \u201cthe only method we know to give service an appearance of being valid is to examine the return and, if it appears from the return that defendant was personally served, then the service has the \u2018appearance\u2019 of having been valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Again, Plaintiff has not provided any evidence demonstrating why his reliance on the return receipt was justified. Plaintiff failed to follow Kansas law by requesting restricted delivery, the signature on the receipt was illegible, and Defendant denies signing the receipt. As such, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the return did not appear valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><em>Grimmett </em>also requires a plaintiff to show he had a good faith belief his service was valid, and that he relied on its validity to his detriment. <em>Id. </em>As the district court reasoned, Plaintiff did not have a good faith belief his service was valid because Defendant raised insufficient service of process as an affirmative defense in his answer. If Plaintiff read the answer, he would have immediately noticed his service was being contested.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Finally, <em>Grimmett </em>requires a plaintiff to demonstrate he \u201chad no reason to believe [defendant] was contesting service until after the statute of limitations had run, [and] had no opportunity to take steps to correct the defective service.\u201d 906 P.2d at 164. As mentioned, Defendant notified Plaintiff in his answer he was disputing service. We also note that Plaintiff had ample opportunity to correct his defective service. Defendant filed his answer on August 1, 2001, and Plaintiff had seven weeks, or until September 19, 2001, to properly serve Defendant. Plaintiff argues he met with defense counsel on several occasions and they never informed him they were disputing service. Defendant\u2019s counsel, however, had no obligation to inform Plaintiff that he failed to comply with Kansas law. Defendant complied with all rules of procedure and deadlines set by the court in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Plaintiff\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), its judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\">. <em>But see Walker v. United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>240 F.3d 1268, 1272 (10th Cir.2001) (some courts have shifted to a <em>de novo </em>standard of review when the underlying substance of the Rule 59(e) motion requires such a standard). In any event, if we reviewed this case under a <em>de novo </em>standard, the result would be the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\">. Plaintiff argues that some Kansas courts have applied \u00a7 60-203(b) even though insufficiency of process was raised as an affirmative defense in the answer. <em>See Vogeler v. Owen, </em>243 Kan. 682, 763 P.2d 600, 602-03 (Kan. 1998) and <em>Yoh, </em>27 P.3d at 929-30. These cases are unavailing to Plaintiff because neither the Kansas Supreme Court in <em>Vogeler, </em>nor the Kansas Court of Appeals in <em>Yoh, </em>addressed the actual substance of \u00a7 60-203(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
