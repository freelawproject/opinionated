Frega, </em>179 F.3d 793, 811 n. 22 (9th Cir.1999). The pivotal question is whether the court properly treated Baker\u2019s state conviction as a prior conviction or whether it should have been considered a \u201crelated sentence\u201d since it was committed at the same time and place as the felon-in-possession count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-17\">Baker\u2019s argument is based on an incorrect guideline section. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) was not intended to define \u201cprior sentences\u201d for criminal history purposes. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>909 F.2d 389, 392 (9th Cir.1990). Rather, the \u201crelated cases\u201d provision of \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) deals with the relationship between multiple prior sentences, not the relationship between prior sentences and a current offense. <em>Id.; United States v. Ticchiarelli, </em>171 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-21\">The government addressed the same incorrect guideline section instead of referring to the appropriate one. The relationship between a prior sentence and a current offense is governed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1). <em>United States v. Ladum, </em>141 F.3d 1328, 1347 (9th Cir.1998). That section defines a \u201cprior sentence\u201d as \u201cany sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt ... for conduct <em>not part of the instant offense.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l) (emphasis added). Application Note 1 to this section states, \u201cconduct that is part of the instant offense means conduct that is relevant conduct to the instant offense under the provisions of \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).\u201d \u201cRelevant Conduct\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-22\">All acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-23\">that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-24\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-25\">A state conviction resulting \u201cfrom a discrete, identifiable illegal act that is not an integral part of the federal offense con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>duct\u201d is not \u201crelevant conduct\u201d for criminal history purposes. <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>59 F.3d 914, 918 (9th Cir.1995); <em>Ladum, </em>141 F.3d at 1347. In determining whether there is a sufficient degree of similarity between a prior conviction and a current offense, a court compares the elements of the prior offense with those of the current offense, and examines the actual conduct underlying the two crimes. <em>Ladum, </em>141 F.3d at 1348-49. A court also considers whether there was a temporal and geographical proximity between the crimes, a common scheme or plan, or common victims. <em>See United States v. Weiland, </em>284 F.3d 878, 882 (8th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">The court in <em>Ladum </em>used this approach to determine whether the defendant\u2019s pri- or city ordinance violations should count toward his federal sentence for conspiracy to defraud the United States and for filing false income tax returns. 141 F.3d at 1346-48. The defendant operated a second-hand store as a \u201cfront-man\u201d for the store\u2019s actual owner. He hid the owner\u2019s interest in the property and helped him skim profits by falsifying property and sales records, leading to his convictions for violating two city record-keeping ordinances. <em>Id. </em>The court held that the ordinance violations were \u201cprior sentences\u201d because there was an insufficient degree of similarity and connection between the pri- or and current crimes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-6\">The object of the tax conspiracy was impeding the IRS\u2019s determination of Ladum\u2019s taxes. The ordinance violations involved [the defendant\u2019s] failure to fill in certain information on police property forms and his sale of regulated secondhand property prior to the expiration of a waiting period. These violations were not pled in the indictment, nor were they used to prove the instant offense. Finally, although the ordinance violations took place during the course of the conspiracy and the offenses are somewhat similar in character because they involve record keeping, the offenses involve different victims-local authorities instead of the IRS-and different societal interests-the regulation of stolen property instead of tax collection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1348 (citing <em>Buchanan, </em>59 F.3d at 918).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">We have also has demonstrated that if sufficiently distinct, a state crime can count as criminal history even if committed at the same time and the same place as the federal offense. <em>Garcia, </em>909 F.2d at 392. In <em>Garcia, </em>the defendant was found in possession of both counterfeit currency and methamphetamine following a traffic stop. He was first prosecuted in state court for possession of methamphetamine, and then prosecuted for the counterfeit currency in federal court. Applying \u00a7 4A.1.2(a)(l), the court affirmed the district court\u2019s decision to include the state conviction in his criminal history score despite the fact that the crimes occurred simultaneously. <em>Id.; see also, e.g., United States v. Torres-Diaz, </em>60 F.3d 445, 448 (8th Cir.) (state drug convictions counted in criminal history despite their temporal and geographical proximity to federal drug \u201cstash house\u201d conviction), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 971, 116 S.Ct. 432, 133 L.Ed.2d 347 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">Our review of the record leaves no doubt that, although Baker possessed the gun and the drugs at the same time and place, there was an \u201cinsufficient degree of similarity and connection\u201d with the federal offense to make the state conviction \u201crelevant conduct.\u201d <em>Buchanan, </em>59 F.3d at 918. The two crimes share no common elements, and the conduct underlying them was distinct in nature. <em>Compare, </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), <em>with </em>Nev.Rev.Stat. 453.336 (possession of a controlled substance). Knowing possession of contraband establishes possession of a controlled substance under Nevada law. Nev.Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>Stat. 458.336. In contrast, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) makes gun possession (otherwise lawful conduct) a crime based on the person\u2019s status as a convicted felon. Moreover, viewed objectively, the two offenses did not share a common purpose, nor did one crime facilitate the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Baker\u2019s marijuana possession was a \u201cdiscrete, identifiable illegal act\u201d that was not an integral part of having a felon in possession of a firearm, despite the temporal and geographical overlap. <em>Buchanan, </em>59 F.3d at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1000-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
