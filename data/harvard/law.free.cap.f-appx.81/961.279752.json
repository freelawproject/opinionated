We conclude that the district court did not err, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-21\">A dismissal without leave to amend is proper if \u201cit is clear, upon de novo review, that the complaint could not be saved by any amendment.\u201d <em>McKesson HBOC, Inc. v. New York State Common Ret. Fund, Inc., </em>339 F.3d 1087, 1090 (9th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Lee v. City of Los Angeles, </em>250 F.3d 668, 692 (9th Cir.2001)). However, \u201c[a] district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Broudo v. Dura Pharm., Inc., </em>339 F.3d 933, 937 (9th Cir.2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-22\">Where a district court does not offer reasons for a dismissal without leave to amend, we consider five factors to address the propriety of that decision: \u201c(1) bad faith; (2) undue delay; (3) prejudice to the opposing party; (4) futility of amendment; and (5) whether plaintiff has previously amended his complaint.\u201d <em>Schmier v. United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, </em>279 F.3d 817, 824 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>In re Consol. Pioneer Mortgage Entities, </em>205 B.R. 422, 426 (B.A.P. 9th Cir.1997)). \u201c[A] proposed amendment is futile only if no set of facts can be proved under the amendment to the pleadings that would constitute a valid and sufficient claim or defense.\u201d <em>Sweaney v. Ada County, Idaho, </em>119 F.3d 1385, 1393 (9th Cir.1997) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Miller v. Rykoff-Sexton, Inc., </em>845 F.2d 209, 214 (9th Cir.1988)). Futility of amendment, standing alone, can justify the denial of a motion for leave to amend. <em>United States ex rel. Lee v. SmithKline Beecham, Inc., </em>245 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-23\">The district corut correctly concluded that Hanlon\u2019s proposed amendment would be futile because his state law claims would continue to be preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). <em>See Peterson v. Am. Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., </em>48 F.3d 404, 407-08 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>Cir.1995); <em>see also McKesson HBOC, Inc., </em>339 F.3d at 1096 (\u201cLike the district court, we conclude that the deficiencies in McKesson\u2019s claims cannot be cured by amendment.\u201d). The district court was not required to grant <em>sua sponte </em>leave to amend the complaint to allege an ERISAbased claim. <em>See Geweke Ford v. St. Joseph\u2019s Omni Preferred Care Inc., </em>130 F.3d 1355, 1361 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201c[Plaintiff] waived its right to make these ERISA claims because [plaintiff] neither raised this issue to the district court nor requested leave to amend to attempt to assert a claim under ERISA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b993-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
