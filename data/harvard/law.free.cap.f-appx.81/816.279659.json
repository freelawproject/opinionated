Heimlich appeals the denial of his Fed. R. Crv. P. 15 motion to amend his pleadings to reflect that the state appellate court had reversed his criminal conviction. Heimlich argues that the district court did not have the discretion to deny his motion to amend because the district court did not give a \u201csubstantial reason\u201d for the denial. He also contends that the denial of the motion places \u201c[p]rocedure ... over substance to conceal evidence and obstruct justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">\u201cPost-judgment amendment to a complaint can only occur once the judgment itself is vacated under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 or 60.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judgment against Heimlich was not vacated under either of these rules. In cases where a party seeks to amend a complaint after entry of judgment, \u201cwe have consistently upheld the denial of leave to amend where the party seeking to amend has not clearly established that he could not reasonably have raised the new matter prior to the trial court\u2019s merits ruling.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Heimlich has made no such showing. Consequently, Heimlich\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s refusal to allow him to amend his pleadings five years after the judgment is without arguable merit and is frivolous. The appeal is therefore DISMISSED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Heimlich\u2019s outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b849-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
