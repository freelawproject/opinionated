See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b486-19\">Grant Lee appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. Lee claims to possess newly discovered evidence that proves his innocence and entitles him to another trial. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-21\">In 1999, Lee was convicted of sexually assaulting Jane Doe, a mentally disabled woman with cerebral palsy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the trial, Lee \u201cadmitted that he tried to grope [Doe] and that he touched her breasts, \u2018butt,\u2019 and vaginal area,\u201d but denied that he had intercourse with Doe. (Dist. Ct. Op. at 3.) Doe testified that Lee had forcibly raped her, and that Lee hurt her \u201ca whole lot.\u201d (J.A. at 63.) An emergency room physician who had examined Doe after the incident testified that Doe had vaginal injuries that resulted from \u201ca rapid, violent stretching\u201d and that the vaginal mucosa had \u201cbeen torn or stretched to the point where the ... surface tissue started to separate.\u201d (J.A. at 52, 64-65). Lee\u2019s attorney never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>asked the physician the condition of Doe\u2019s hymen. Two years after the sexual assault, Doe sought medical attention for a heavy menstrual flow. The doctor who examined Doe noted in his medical report that her hymen was intact. Lee became aware of the report and filed a motion for a new trial, which the district court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">We review the denial of a Rule 33 motion for new tidal for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Adam, </em>70 F.3d 776, 779 (4th Cir.1995). In order for a district court to grant a convicted criminal defendant a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence, it must determine whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">(1) the evidence relied on is, \u201cin fact, newly discovered\u201d; (2) there are facts \u201calleged from which the court may infer due diligence on the part of the movant\u201d; (3) \u201cthe evidence relied upon [is] not merely cumulative or impeaching\u201d; (4) \u201cthe evidence [is] material to the issues involved\u201d; and (5) the evidence is of such a nature that it would \u201cprobably result in [an] acquittal at a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AID\"><em>United States v. Lofton, </em>233 F.3d 313, 318 (4th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Chavis, </em>880 F.2d 788, 793 (4th Cir.1989)). \u201cUnless the answer to each of these inquiries is affirmative, a new trial is not appropriate.\u201d <em>Chavis, </em>880 F.2d at 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">In this case, the district court concluded that Lee did not exercise due diligence and thus did not satisfy the <em>Chavis </em>require-merits. We agree. Lee never inquired into the condition of Doe\u2019s hymen during the long course of the criminal proceedings against him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To counter his neglect, Lee points out that he had reason to believe that Doe\u2019s hymen was not intact in 1998, as he was prepared to produce a witness who claimed to have had sex with Doe on multiple occasions. Due diligence required more than mere speculation on Lee\u2019s part, however - it required investigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because, at the very least, Lee could have inquired as to the condition of Doe\u2019s hymen by the time of his second trial, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Lee had not been duly diligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-12\">. Lee was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241(a) (West 2000), which prohibits using force to cause another to engage in a \"sexual act\u201d within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. According to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2246(2)(A) (West 2000), \"the term 'sexual act\u2019 means ... contact between the penis and the vulva, ... [which] occurs upon penetration, however, slight.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-9\">. Lee was tried twice, the first trial ending in a mistrial. Lee did not inquire into the condition of Doe\u2019s hymen during either proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b487-10\">. The government avers that it is probable that Doe\u2019s hymen healed after the attack and was \"intact\u201d in 2000, but not in 1998. The prosecution\u2019s expert, Dr. Berryman, stated that, \"an \u2018intact hymen\u2019 in November 2000 says nothing about the condition of [Doe\u2019s] hymen in 1998,\u201d and that he \u201cwould expect that, without further sexual intercourse, the hymen would have healed.\u201d (J.A. at 104). Dr. Berryman also concluded that in order for Dr. Halliday, the emergency room physician, to make the observances that he did, Doe\u2019s hymen must <em>not </em>have been intact at the time of his examination in 1998. (J.A. at 105).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
