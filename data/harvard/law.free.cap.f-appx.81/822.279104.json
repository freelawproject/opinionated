Hawkins, Texas prisoner number 669983, appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment for the defendants in this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit. Hawkins also moves this court for the appointment of counsel and a trial transcript at Government expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-24\">Hawkins argues that the trial court erred in denying his postjudgment motion for a return of property. Hawkins has not shown that the trial court so erred. Hawkins cited no jurisdictional basis for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>motion, and research reveals none. The motion was unauthorized, and Hawkins has not shown that he is entitled to relief in connection with the claim raised therein. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Hawkins\u2019s argument that the trial court acted unfairly by rescheduling his trial fails because Hawkins identifies no prejudice that he suffered in connection with this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Hawkins\u2019s arguments that the trial court erred in denying his motions to amend his complaint and compel discovery and in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment are likewise unavailing. The record reflects that Hawkins\u2019s motion to amend his complaint was granted. He filed no motion to compel discovery and there was no motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Hawkins\u2019s claim that he was denied a trial before a federal judge lacks merit. The record shows that he consented to trial before a magistrate judge, who is a federal judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 631 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Finally, Hawkins argues that he was denied due process in connection with the trial judge\u2019s denial of his request to see certain tapes, when the defendants testified falsely, and when the trial judge took certain actions in relation to certain witnesses. Hawkins fails to explain how these actions harmed him, and his conelusional assertions in relation to these claims are insufficient to show that he is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Hawkins has failed to show that the trial court committed reversible error in connection with the disposition of his claims. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED, and Hawkins\u2019s motions for the appointment of counsel and a transcript at Government expense are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b854-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
