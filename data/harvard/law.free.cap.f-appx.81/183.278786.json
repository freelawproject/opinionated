We review the district court\u2019s sentence de novo, <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>States v. Reyes-Pacheco, </em>248 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The district court imposed a victim-related adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2, which permits increased penalties when the victim of an assault is a law enforcement officer. When recommending this enhancement, the Presentence Investigation Report cited \u00a7 3A1.2\u2019s Advisory Comment 4(A), which did not take effect until after Mendoza-Maldonado\u2019s arrest. Mendoza-Maldonado argues that retroactive application of this Advisory Comment runs afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The Presentence Investigation Report did erroneously cite the 2002 Sentencing Guidelines instead of the 2001 edition. However, this particular comment was already written into the 2001 Guidelines as Comment 5, and was simply renumbered as 4(A) when the 2002 edition took effect. The language of the two comments is nearly identical. Applying \u00a7 3A1.2 to Mendoza-Maldonado pursuant to Comment 4(A) does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause just because the Comment has been renumbered since his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">We reject Mendoza-Maldonado\u2019s contention that the proper guideline to calculate his sentence for assaulting a federal officer is \u00a7 2A2.4, which sets the base offense level for crimes of \u201cobstructing or impeding officers.\u201d If a defendant\u2019s conduct rises to the level of aggravated assault, the district court must use \u00a7 2A2.2 instead of \u00a7 2A2.4. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.4(c)(l). When \u00a7 2A2.4 is used, as it was in Mendoza-Maldonado\u2019s case, Advisory Comment 1 to \u00a7 2A2.4 requires the addition of the \u00a7 3A1.2 official victim enhancement so the defendant\u2019s sentence reflects the fact that the assault victim was a law enforcement officer. We therefore hold that the district court did not err by imposing the enhancement under \u00a7 3A1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Moreover, the district court did not err by increasing Mendoza-Maldonado\u2019s sentence by two levels for reckless endangerment during flight under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2. Mendoza-Maldonado claims that his act of reckless endangerment is already accounted for by the assault charge, so that adding this enhancement would \u201cdouble-count\u201d the same behavior. His argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Hernandez-Sandoval, </em>211 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir.2000), in which we held that imposing these same two enhancements is not impermissible double-counting when the act giving rise to the \u00a7 3C1.2 enhancement (driving recklessly) is separate and distinct from the act that justifies the \u00a7 3A1.2(b) enhancement (assaulting officers). <em>Id. </em>at 1117. The district court did not err by imposing the enhancement for reckless endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b216-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
