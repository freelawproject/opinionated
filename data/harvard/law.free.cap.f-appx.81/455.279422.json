See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-16\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b488-17\">Ricardo Gunn appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion as successive, noting that Gunn had not sought the requisite authorization from this Court to file such a motion. We construe Gunn\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief on appeal as an application to file a second or successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a movant must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 118. Gunn\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these conditions. Therefore, we decline to authorize Gunn to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-19\">Gunn has also requested a certificate of appealability. Because the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Gunn\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, however, the issue of entitlement to a certificate of appealability is not properly before this court. Accordingly, we deny Gunn\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-20\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
