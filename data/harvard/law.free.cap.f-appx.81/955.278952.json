Bonuchi appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment affirming the decision of the administrative law judge (the Appeals Council having denied review) in Bonuchi\u2019s application for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-33 (the \u201cAct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-18\">Bonuchi suffers from a combination of depression and musculoskeletal disease. Both parties agree that Bonuchi is disabled under the Act because her condition meets or exceeds the severity of an affective mental disorder in listing 12.04, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (\u201cListing 12.04\u201d). The parties differ only over the onset date of Bonuchi\u2019s disability. The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) determined that Bonuchi was disabled as of March 1, 1995, while Bonuchi contends that she became disabled on November 12, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-19\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s summary judgment upholding a denial of benefits. <em>Rollins v. Massanari, </em>261 F.3d 853, 855 (9th Cir.2001). We will uphold the ALJ\u2019s decision \u201cif it was supported by substantial evidence in the record and applied the correct legal standards.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-20\">The ultimate cause of Bonuchi\u2019s disability was her mental impairment. The ALJ reasonably concluded that the suicide of Bonuchi\u2019s husband most likely exacerbated her depression to the required level of disability. He therefore determined that March 1, 1995 was the onset date. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>determination is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Although supported by substantial evidence, the ALJ\u2019s decision must also be free from legal error. Bonuchi argues that the ALJ erred by failing to give adequate reasons for rejecting the testimony of Dr. Stephen Nathan, the Commissioner\u2019s medical expert, and by failing to follow the guidelines. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">The ALJ did not reject Dr. Nathan\u2019s testimony. Dr. Nathan testified that Bonuchi suffered from severe fibromyalgia and depression, that these impairments met the requirements of Listing 12.04, but that an exact onset date was not discernible from the record. Dr. Nathan did not, as Bonuchi claims, \u201ccorroborate\u201d the opinion of Dr. Narvaiz. He simply replied in the negative when asked if he had any reason to disagree with Dr. Narvaiz\u2019s estimate of the onset date. In determining from all the available evidence that March 1 was the disability onset date, the ALJ properly followed the applicable guidelines. <em>See DeLorme v. Sullivan, </em>924 F.2d 841, 848 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">Bonuchi also contends that the ALJ improperly rejected Dr. Morse\u2019s subjective medical opinion as to Bonuchi\u2019s exertional capabilities because the ALJ mischaracterized Dr. Morse\u2019s opinion as vocational evidence. \u201cThe Commissioner is required to give weight not only to the treating physician\u2019s clinical findings and interpretation of test results, but also to his subjective judgments.\u201d <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 832-33 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">At issue is an October 1994 letter to the state agency, in which Dr. Morse wrote that a job within Bonuchi\u2019s exertional capability would be \u201cvery hard to find and sustaining such a schdule [sic] could ber [sic] very difficult for her.\u201d In reviewing this evidence, the ALJ stated that Dr. Morse \u201cis not a vocational expert and is not qualified to provide an opinion as to the claimant\u2019s employability, given her ex-ertional capacity.\u201d While Dr. Morse\u2019s subjective medical judgment (i.e., that it would be difficult for Bonuchi to sustain a schedule) was within his sphere of expertise, his opinion on the prevalence of jobs in the national economy (i.e., that it would be difficult for her to find a job) was not. The ALJ properly rejected Dr. Morse\u2019s <em>vocational </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">The ALJ also gave adequate reasons for rejecting Dr. Morse\u2019s medical opinions; they lacked explanation and were inconsistent with Dr. Morse\u2019s prior statements. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(3)-(4). In assessing Bonuchi\u2019s residual functional capacity, the ALJ evaluated the medical evidence to determine exertional capacity, and obtained the necessary vocational evidence by calling upon a vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">As a separate issue, Bonuchi argued in her briefs that the ALJ erred by failing to recuse himself despite an \u201cappearance of impropriety.\u201d At oral argument, however, counsel for Bonuchi conceded that this issue has been decided in the Commissioner\u2019s favor by <em>Bunnell v. Barnhart, </em>336 F.3d 1112 (9th Cir.2003), which held that the \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d standard for federal judges does not apply to ALJs.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">The district court\u2019s summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b988-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
