Failing Company\u2019s (\u201cGEFCO\u201d) motion for new trial or, in the alternative, motion for remittitur. Both sides presented credible evidence on the mitigation issue. The jury weighed the evidence and rendered a verdict in favor of the Wallaces. Under these circumstances, the district court\u2019s denial of a new trial is virtually unassailable. <em>See George v. City of Long Beach, </em>973 F.2d 706, 709 (9th Cir.1992). The jury carefully considered the evidence offered by both sides as reflected by the size of the award, which was considerably less than the highest amount endorsed by the Wallaces\u2019 experts. The fact that the jury gave less credence to the testimony offered by GEF-CO\u2019s expert did not render the damages award \u201cgrossly excessive or monstrous.\u201d <em>See Hemmings v. Tidyman\u2019s Inc., </em>285 F.3d 1174, 1192 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-20\">The district court similarly acted within its discretion when it admitted into evidence the damage estimates calculated by the Wallaces\u2019 experts. <em>See id. </em>at 1183. An expert\u2019s alleged failure to consider all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>possible variables goes to the weight of the expert evidence and not its admissibility. <em>See id. </em>at 1188-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b954-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
