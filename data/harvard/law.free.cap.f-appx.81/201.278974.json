Hogan (\u201cHogan\u201d), an inmate at the U.S. Penitentiary-Atlanta, died from injuries that he sustained when he was kicked in the head by a fellow-inmate wearing steel-toed boots. Hogan\u2019s wife (\u201cMrs. Hogan\u201d) sued the Government under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 et seq., claiming that the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) was negligent in supplying steel-toed boots to Hogan\u2019s assailant. The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that the FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exemption precluded government liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-26\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and application of the discretionary function exemption <em>de novo, see United States v. City of Tacoma, </em>332 F.3d 574, 578 (9th Cir.2003), we find that the discretionary function exemption bars Mrs. Hogan\u2019s claim. Steel-toed boots were not \u201ccontraband\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(d)(1)(F). Moreover, by Executive Order, OSHA regulations require the BOP to provide protective footwear to inmates who work in particular areas of the prison to protect their feet from work-related injuries. Executive Or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>der No. 12196 \u00a7 1-101 et seq., 45 Fed. Reg. 12,769 (Feb. 26, 1980), <em>reprinted in </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902 note; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.136(a) &amp; (b). The BOP\u2019s decision to issue steel-toed boots to inmates and to allow the inmates to wear the boots during non-working hours was a discretionary act not precluded by any statute, regulation, or policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">We also find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s refusal to strike any portions of the declarations of the Government\u2019s previously withdrawn expert witness, John L. Lee (\u201cLee\u201d). <em>Maffei v. Northern Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>12 F.3d 892, 897 (9th Cir.1993). Under Federal Rules of Evidence 601 and 701, Lee\u2019s declarations contain his competent percipient witness testimony and lay opinion testimony as National Safety Administrator of the BOP. Moreover, the district court\u2019s refusal to strike the portions of the declarations to which Mrs. Hogan objects did not prejudice her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b233-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
