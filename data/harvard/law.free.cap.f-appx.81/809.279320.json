The record supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2003) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum). We will reverse only if the evidence \u201c \u2018was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite\u2019 \u201d elements. <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). We have reviewed the administrative record, the IJ\u2019s decision, and the decision of the Board, and find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>ing that Laksono failed to establish her refugee status.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">We conclude as well that Laksono is not entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2000) or the U.N. Convention Against Torture. Based on our review of the record and of the IJ\u2019s decision denying relief, we hold that the IJ did not err in finding that Laksono failed to show a \u201cclear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>See Rusu, </em>296 F.3d at 324 n. 13 (\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d). Nor did Laksono establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that she would face torture if she returned to Indonesia. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2003) (to qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, an alien must show \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We deny Laksono\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
