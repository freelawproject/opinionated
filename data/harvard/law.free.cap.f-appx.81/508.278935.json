Appellants argue that the district court erred in refusing to apply equitable tolling to their claim. They argue that the court\u2019s reliance on <em>Houston v. United States Postal Service, </em>823 F.2d 896 (5th Cir.1987) and <em>United States v. Kubrick, </em>444 U.S. 111, 100 S.Ct. 352, 62 L.Ed.2d 259 (1979), for the conclusion that the statute of limitations in the FTCA is jurisdictional in nature was erroneous. They argue that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to their case because they were prevented by affirmative and fraudulent action on the part of the defendant from making the connection between their injury and the defendant\u2019s actions. They argue that the district court erred in relying on the decision in <em>Hohri v. United States, </em>586 F.Supp. 769 (D.D.C. 1984), <em>affirmed, </em>847 F.2d 779 (Fed.Cir.1988), in which the plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising out of their internment during WWII were held to be time-barred, because that case concerned Japanese-American internees. They argue that unlike the Japanese, they were never made aware, either through published opinions or congressional reports, that the Government had concealed its role in their ordeal, and had misrepresented the military necessity for the treatment they received. They contend that the report \u201cCommission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, Personal Justice Denied\u201d (1982) did not report on the treatment of Latin Americans of German descent. They argue that the statute of limitations was tolled until 1994, when they finally discovered that the United States caused them injury, and that their action was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Although the district court, in its order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, noted <em>Houston </em>and <em>Kubrick </em>for the proposition that the statute of limitations in the FTCA is jurisdictional, the magistrate judge\u2019s report specifically acknowledged that equitable tolling could apply to FTCA cases, but concluded that the circumstances in this case did not justify its application. The district court found that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims accrued in 1982 when the Commission\u2019s report was published, but certainly no later than the publication of the <em>Hohri </em>decision in 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The 1982 report, \u201cCommission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, Personal Justice Denied,\u201d in an Appendix, provides information concerning the detention and deportation of Japanese, German, and Italian internees from Latin America, including Costa Rica. The report notes that some of these internees were held at Crystal City, Texas. The plaintiffs were interned during the same period as the plaintiffs in <em>Hohri, </em>pursuant to similar policies, and were held in some of the same camps. The district court correctly ruled that a \u201creasonable person would have been on notice long before 1994 that the United States Government was involved in [their] detention and subsequent transfer to Germany \u2014 or would have inquired further.\u201d The district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that equitable tolling did not apply. <em>Teemac v. Henderson, </em>298 F.3d 452, 457 (5th Cir.2002). As a result, this Court AFFIRMS the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b541-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
