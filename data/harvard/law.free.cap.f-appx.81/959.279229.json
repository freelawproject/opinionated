Her 1999 and 2000 evaluations were unsatisfactory, except for a barely satisfactory evaluation later in 1999, and she was formally advised of unsatisfactory performance a few months after the barely satisfactory rating. Yanz submitted no cognizable evidence that would establish a genuine issue of material fact as to the satisfactory performance element of her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-18\">Even if she had made out a prima facie case, Yanz failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to pretext. She was fired for discouraging a complaining subordinate from going over her head, in plain violation of her employer\u2019s \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy. The isolated remark she quoted in her complaint, that she \u201ccould be replaced by two younger, less experienced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>employees\u201d is insufficient, in light of the record, to show discriminatory intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b992-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b992-19\">. <em>Coleman v.
