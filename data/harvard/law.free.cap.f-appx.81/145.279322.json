Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review for substantial evidence the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, <em>Mejia-Paiz v. INS, </em>111 F.3d 720, 722-23 (9th Cir.1997), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The IJ identified material inconsistencies between Tun\u2019s testimony, his asylum application, and his written declaration regarding his purported membership in the National League for Democracy and his participation in student protests. Because these inconsistencies go to the heart of his asylum claim, substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, Tun failed to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of deportation. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816-17 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">We reject Tun\u2019s contention that the IJ did not adequately review his request for relief under the CAT. Because the record contains no evidence that Tun was ever persecuted or harmed while he resided in Burma, the IJ reasonably concluded that Tun failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if he is deported to Burma. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1282-83 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b177-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
