R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Kenneth Mattix appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his application for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Mr. Mattix argues that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel at his criminal trial in Oregon state court because his trial counsel failed to conduct an adequate investigation regarding whether he was competent to stand trial and to waive his right to trial by jury. We affirm the district court\u2019s order. The parties are familiar with the facts. We repeat them here only as is necessary to our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Following his conviction on rape and sexual molestation charges in Oregon state court on July 28, 1992, Mr. Mattix was transferred to Nevada to face other charges. Based on conflicting psychological reports concerning Mr. Mattix\u2019s competency to stand trial, the prosecution and defense stipulated to a finding that Mr. Mattix was incompetent to stand trial. The Nevada state court then dismissed the charges against Mr. Mattix.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">Upon his return to Oregon, Mr. Mattix filed a petition for post-conviction relief in state court. The state court denied the petition. It ruled that Mr. Mattix had failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that his trial counsel had provided him with ineffective assistance by not properly investigating his mental competency to stand trial. Mr. Mattix filed a \u00a7 2254 petition with the federal district court. It determined that the state court did not unreasonably apply federal law to Mr. Mattix\u2019s case and denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b207-15\">Mr. Mattix argues on appeal that the district court should have granted his petition under \u00a7 2254(d)(2) because the state court\u2019s decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented. In doing so, Mr. Mattix relies primarily on the Nevada psychiatric evaluations finding him incompetent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-16\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas corpus petition de novo. <em>Ho v. Carey, </em>332 F.3d 587, 591 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Karis v. Calderon, </em>283 F.3d 1117, 1126 (9th Cir.2002). We review findings of fact for clear error. <em>McNeely v. Blanas, </em>336 F.3d 822, 826 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-17\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) applies to this petition, since it was filed after April 24, 1996. AEDPA requires us to deny a petition for writ of habeas corpus unless the state court\u2019s adjudication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-18\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-19\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-20\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Furthermore, under AEDPA, \u201ca determination of a factual is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>sue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct,\u201d and the petitioner has the burden of rebutting this presumption by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">When analyzing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Supreme Court has stated that the petitioner must first demonstrate that \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The petitioner must also demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s deficient performance. The petitioner must show \u201cthat counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In reviewing habeas petitions under \u00a7 2254(d)(2), the Supreme Court has granted substantial deference to state court decisions. The Court has explained that \u201ca [state court] decision adjudicated on the merits in a state court and based on a factual determination will not be overturned on factual grounds unless objectively unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the state-court proceeding.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1041, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (citations omitted); <em>see also Davis v. Woodford, </em>333 F.3d 982, 990-91 (9th Cir.2003) (applying the objectively unreasonable standard to a claim under \u00a7 2254(d)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Mr. Mattix was represented by Mr. Frank DeSimone at his trial. The State presented Mr. DeSimone\u2019s affidavit in opposition to the collateral attack on the judgment of conviction in the state post-conviction proceedings. Mr. DeSimone alleged that the state trial court granted his motion for extraordinary funds to retain a psychiatrist to examine his client\u2019s competency to stand trial. Dr. Hugh Gardner examined Mr. Mattix. He concluded that Mr. Mattix was competent to stand trial. Mr. DeSimone also alleged that, based on his own observations of Mr. Mattix, he concluded that his client was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Mr. Mattix submitted evaluations by Nevada psychiatrists conducted after his conviction in Oregon. Their evaluations are in conflict. Three psychiatrists concluded that he was not competent to stand trial. At least four concluded that Mr. Mattix is a skillful malingerer who feigned mental disability. The Nevada court dismissed the criminal charges against Mr. Mattix based on the stipulation of the prosecutor and defense counsel that Mr. Mattix was \u201ccurrently incompetent to stand trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The state post-conviction court also reviewed the transcript of Mr. Mattix\u2019s coherent and responsive testimony at his trial. It noted that Mr. Mattix\u2019s \u201ctestimony at trial was logical, internally consistent and he did not display any inability to understand the proceedings or to participate in them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Given the conflicting evidence before the state court, we are persuaded that it reasonably determined that Mr. DeSimone adequately investigated Mr. Mattix\u2019s competency before his trial, and did not violate Mr. Mattix\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel under the 6th and 14th Amendments. The State presented evidence credited by the court in the post-conviction proceeding that Mr. Mattix was competent to stand trial. Mr. Mattix has failed to rebut the presumption that the state court\u2019s findings were correct by clear and convincing evidence. Accordingly, the state court\u2019s decision that Mr. Mattix was not ineffectively represented at his trial was not objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b207-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
