The United States cross-appeals the district court\u2019s order that the imposed fine be distributed to two private shelters in Montana rather than the Crime Victims Fund. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm Gazda\u2019s conviction and reverse and remand the fine distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">There was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. \u201cSufficient evidence supports a conviction if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would allow any rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>239 F.3d 1086, 1092 (9th Cir.2001). The United States introduced substantial circumstantial evidence tending to prove that Gazda continuously possessed the firearm on or about August 9-10, 2001. The United States also introduced evidence tending to disprove Gazda\u2019s justification story. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">The district court did not err in denying Gazda\u2019s written request for disclosure of the grand jury transcripts. A trial judge may order disclosure of grand jury transcripts \u201cwhen the party seeking them has demonstrated that a \u2018particularized need exists which outweighs the policy of secrecy.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Walczak, </em>783 F.2d 852, 857 (9th Cir.1986) (quoting <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 395, 400, 79 S.Ct. 1237, 3 L.Ed.2d 1323 (1959)). Gazda claims there was a particularized need because a comparison of the grand jury papers to the case submitted to the petit jury during trial would confirm whether the government charged one case at grand jury but proved a different one at trial. Gazda\u2019s claim fails because the United States charged the same case to the grand jury that it proved at trial, namely, being a felon-in-possession of a firearm and a felon-in-possession of ammunition on or about August 9-10, 2001. Any evidence offered by the United States concerning Gazda\u2019s possession of the firearm before August 9-10, 2001 was introduced solely as circumstantial evidence to establish that Gazda possessed the gun on the dates charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">The Indictment is not duplicitous, and therefore, there is no prejudicial misjoinder. The Indictment can only be read to charge one offense per count. Because only one offense is charged per count, there can be no prejudicial misjoinder of multiple offenses within each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">The district court committed plain error by ordering that the fine imposed on Gazda be distributed to two private shelters in Montana rather than the Crime Victims Fund. The Victims of Crime Act of 1984 established the Crime Victims Fund, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10601(a), which requires that \u201cthere shall be deposited in the Fund ... all fines that are collected from persons convicted of offenses against the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>States.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10601(b)(1). Although the government failed to object at the time, we agree with its assertion on appeal that the erroneous order affects substantial rights of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The Crime Victims Fund was enacted as a source of funds in the United States Treasury for programs that compensate and assist crime victims. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10601(d) (allocating funds among programs); \u00a7 10602 (delineating eligible compensation programs); \u00a7 10603 (delineating eligible assistance programs). The Crime Victims Fund also serves to prevent courts from selecting their personal charities as the recipients of large sums of money that would otherwise be paid to the treasury. Not only are the courts ill-equipped to determine which charitable organizations most deserve these sums of money, but any involvement in the selection process raises the prospect of conflicts of interest and unnecessary criticism of the courts. Thus, the district court\u2019s erroneous order not only prevented $45,000 from properly being used to finance payments to state and federal victim compensation and assistance programs, but also potentially subjected the court to unnecessary criticism. Because this fine has not yet been paid to the Clerk of the Court, we reverse and remand the fine distribution with instructions that the district court order the imposed f\u00edne to be distributed to the Crime Victims Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">AFFIRMED in part/REVERSED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b687-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
