Lynch, Judge) denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the denial by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) of his request for habeas relief from removal proceedings pursuant to former \u00a7 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) (formerly 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 212(h)).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-17\">Padmore is a citizen of Barbados who entered the United States in 1975 as a lawful permanent resident. In January 1993, Padmore pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter and was sentenced to a term of 9 to 18 years of imprisonment. At the time of his guilty plea, \u00a7 212(h) allowed all aliens who had not been convicted of crimes involving murder or torture to apply for discretionary relief from removal based on \u201cextreme hardship\u201d to the alien or to a lawful permanent resident\u2019s spouse, parent, or child. <em>Jankowski-Burczyk v. INS, </em>291 F.3d 172, 175 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-18\">In February 1998, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) initiated removal proceedings based on Padmore\u2019s conviction of an aggravated felony. Based on the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), which in 1996 had amended the INA to make aliens who had been convicted of aggravated felonies ineligible for \u00a7 212(h) relief, <em>Jankowski-Burczyk, </em>291 F.3d at 175; IIRIRA \u00a7 348(a), the BIA denied Padmore\u2019s request for a \u00a7 212(h) hearing and ordered Padmore removed to Barbados.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-19\">The District Court denied Padmore\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, finding that Padmore was not entitled to \u00a7 212(h) relief because Congress had clearly communicated its intent that the IIRIRA\u2019s 1996 amendment to \u00a7 212(h) be applied retroactively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Our review of \u00a7 2241 petitions in immigration cases is limited to statutory and constitutional claims. <em>Sol v. INS, </em>274 F.3d 648, 651 (2d Cir.2001). We review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Kuhali v. Reno, </em>266 F.3d 93, 99 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The determination of whether a statute applies retroactively is governed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Landgraf v. USI Film Products, </em>511 U.S. 244, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Landgraf </em>instructs that, \u201c[w]hen a ease implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court\u2019s first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute\u2019s proper reach.\u201d 511 U.S. at 280. The language indicating Congress\u2019s intent to apply a statute retroactively must be clear and unambiguous. <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 317, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (citing <em>Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 328 n. 4, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997)). Absent a clear indication of Congress\u2019s intent, the court must determine whether the statute has a retroactive effect, taking into account considerations of fair notice, reliance, and settled expectations. <em>Id. </em>at 321. If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, however, the inquiry ends, and \u201cthere is no need to resort to judicial default rules.\u201d <em>Landgraf, </em>511 U.S. at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Congress explicitly expressed its intent to apply the IIRIRA\u2019s amendment to \u00a7 212(h) retroactively. The IIRIRA states that its amendment to \u00a7 212(h) \u201cshall be effective on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall apply in the case of any alien who is in exclusion or deportation proceedings as of such date unless a final administrative order in such proceedings has been entered as of such date.\u201d IIRIRA \u00a7 348(b). This language unambiguously indicates Congress\u2019s intent to apply \u00a7 212(h) to all removal cases not made final by the effective date of the amendment. <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 319 <em>&amp; </em>n. 43 (citing \u00a7 348(b), in <em>dicta, </em>as an example of \u201cCongress\u2019s willingness, in [some] sections of IIRIRA, to indicate unambiguously its intention to apply specific provisions retroactively\u201d). Indeed, the language of \u00a7 348(b) is similar to the language cited in <em>Landgraf </em>as an example of a clear statement of retroactivity. <em>Landgraf, </em>511 U.S. at 257 n. 10 (statement that amendments \u201cshall be applicable with respect to charges pending ... on the date of enactment of this Act and all charges filed thereafter\u201d indicates retroactive intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">Since the language of \u00a7 348(b) clearly expresses Congress\u2019s intent to apply the amendments to \u00a7 212(h) retroactively, this Court need not address Padmore\u2019s argument that retroactive application upsets his settled expectations because he would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(h) relief at the time of his guilty plea in 1993. <em>Kuhali, </em>266 F.3d at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-15\">. The District Court also held that (1) Pad-more was not entitled to \u00a7 212(c) relief because he had been incarcerated for more than five years and thus was statutorily ineligible for such relief, and (2) \u00a7 212(h) did not vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>late the Equal Protection Clause. We need not review these conclusions, because Pad-more has not raised them on appeal. <em>LoSacco v. Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\">. Padmore raised before the BIA only an equal protection challenge to the application of the post-IIRIRA \u00a7 212(h) to his case. We need not address whether this was sufficient to exhaust his current retroactivity challenge, because his argument fails on the merits. <em>Drax v. Reno, </em>338 F.3d 98, 110 n. 17 (2d Cir.2003) (\"We have previously considered the merits of unexhausted immigration claims where we believed it important to do so.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
