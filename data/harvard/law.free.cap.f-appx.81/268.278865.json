We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-21\">Although Lang argues that June 22, 1992 was the relevant date of admission rather than June 17, 1994, we need not resolve this issue because Lang committed the crime of criminal copyright infringement in violation of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2319(b)(1) within five years of either date. The IJ\u2019s determination that Lang\u2019s criminal conduct began in December 1995 is well supported by evidence that weekly shipments of 700-800 units were made between December 1995 and August 1997, that Lang received $5,000 to $14,000 per delivery, and that he sold $1,460,137 worth of counterfeit software between December 31, 1996 and August 8, 1997 \u2014 -which necessarily includes the period to which Lang pled guilty. Thus, the crime was committed within five years of the date most favorable to Lang.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-22\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
