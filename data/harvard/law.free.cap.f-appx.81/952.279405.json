We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Gonzalez v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 903, 907-08 (9th Cir.1996), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Ouroukov failed to establish that he was persecuted, or has a well-founded fear of future persecution, on account of an enumerated ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Ouroukov testified that his father was forced to change his middle name to a Bulgarian-sounding name and had trouble finding employment as a doctor. Ouroukov also testified that he had experienced difficulties in school on account of his ethnicity. This evidence does not compel a finding that Ouroukov experienced past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Ouroukov\u2019s fear of future persecution is based on his desire to avoid military service. Military conscription, however, does no amount to persecution. <em>Gonzalez v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir.1996). Finally, the IJ\u2019s finding that Ouroukov failed to support his fear of future religious persecution is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Accordingly, Ouroukov has failed to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b984-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
