We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>novo a dismissal based on immunity, <em>Mabe v. San Bernardino County Dep\u2019t of Pub. Soc. Servs., </em>237 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir.2001), or res judicata, <em>Stewart v. U.S. Bancorp, </em>297 F.3d 953, 956 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The district court properly concluded that United States Attorney McKay was entitled to absolute immunity, because his role in the sentencing recommendation was \u201cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.\u201d <em>See Broam v. Bogan, </em>320 F.3d 1023, 1028 (9th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976)). The probation officer defendants were also entitled to absolute immunity for the actions they took preparing reports for Donaghe\u2019s sentencing judge. <em>See Demoran v. Witt, </em>781 F.2d 155, 157 (9th Cir.1986) (\u201cProbation officers preparing presentencing reports serve a function integral to the independent judicial process.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">The district court properly found that Donaghe\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim against probation officer Thornton was barred by res judicata, because his claim was adjudicated in a prior lawsuit. <em>See Stratosphere Litig. L.L.C. v. Grand Casinos, Inc., </em>298 F.3d 1137, 1143 n. 3 (9th Cir.2002). Donaghe\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment due process claim against Thornton is also barred by res judicata. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Donaghe\u2019s remaining contentions also lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b957-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
