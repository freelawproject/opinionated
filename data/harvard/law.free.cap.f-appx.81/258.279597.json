We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b291-18\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Zambada possessed a firearm <em>for </em>purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). His wife said that the weapon in the closet in Zambada\u2019s room was his gun, it was the type of firearm that has no benign use, and it was loaded. Thus, Zambada\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Kelso, </em>942 F.2d 680, 682 (9th Cir.1991), and <em>United States v. Highsmith, </em>268 F.3d 1141, 1142 (9th Cir.2001), is misplaced. Although a weapon does not have to be present when overt acts are committed, <em>see United States v. Stewart, </em>926 F.2d 899, 902 (9th Cir.1991), some acts in furtherance of the conspiracy took place at Zambada\u2019s house, and 193.6 grams of cocaine as well as a scale and substantial cash were found in the same search of Zambada\u2019s residence. This was relevant conduct suggesting that Zambada possessed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>gun in connection with drug trafficking. <em>See United States v. Willard, </em>919 F.2d 606, 609-10 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">For the same reasons, the district court\u2019s finding that Zambada was ineligible for the safety valve, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(2), is well supported. While the burden and quantum of proof are different from \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>222 F.3d 545, 551 (9th Cir.2000), the conduct that makes the safety valve unavailable is the same, <em>United States v. Smith, </em>175 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.1999). Even if the district court\u2019s formulation were not perfectly clear, its finding that Zambada was not eligible for relief is not clearly erroneous as he could not possibly show on this record that he did <em>not </em>possess the gun while involved in drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
