Section 242(a)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(C), deprives this court of jurisdiction because, as Yos concedes, he is an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony under Section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Yos\u2019s contention that Section 242(a)(2)(C) may not apply to bar judicial review of an order denying a request for relief under the Convention Against Torture is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute which precludes judicial review of \u201cany final order of removal\u201d against a covered alien. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-23\">The petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AMT\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
