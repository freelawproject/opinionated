Because the board\u2019s decision affirming OPM\u2019s action is both supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with the applicable law, we <em>affirm. </em>The board\u2019s decision is reviewed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). <em>See Jones v. Dept. of Transp., </em>295 F.3d 1298, 1304 (Fed.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-23\">Moss was deemed unsuitable for federal employment based on 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 731.202(b)(l)-(3). Three instances of misconduct support this determination. First, OPM, and later the board, found that Moss misrepresented his employment history by inaccurately stating that he had never been fired. Second, Moss was arrested for and pled guilty to charges of spousal abuse. Third, Moss failed to disclose that his criminal case was ongoing at the time of his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-24\">The board, which is in a superior position to make credibility determinations, found that Moss was not trustworthy. <em>See Griessenauer v. Dept. of Energy, </em>754 F.2d 361, 364 (Fed.Cir.1985). The board also found that Moss\u2019 previous employers, who testified that Moss had been fired for cause, were credible, and that the weight of the remaining evidence, which included police reports and Moss\u2019 numerous false employment applications, supported OPM\u2019s determination.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
