He was sentenced to five years of probation and was ordered to pay restitution. Norman failed to abide by the terms of his probation, and it was revoked. He was sentenced to six months in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and three years of supervised release. His supervised release was subsequently revoked for violations, and he was ordered to serve 120 days in community confinement. Another petition for violation of supervised release was filed, and Norman pleaded true to four violations of the conditions of his supervised release. The district court sentenced him to two years of imprisonment. Norman appeals from this sentence, arguing that it is plainly unreasonable, and that the district court erred by failing to articulate its reasons for imposition of the sentence or its consideration of the applicable statutory factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the policy statements in Chapter 7 of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The district court was fully familiar with Norman\u2019s background and conduct, and it specifically rejected the suggested guidelines range in Chapter 7. Norman\u2019s sentence was within the statutory maximum and was not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Mathena, </em>23 F.3d 87, 93-94 (5th Cir.1994). Under the applicable standard of review (plain error) and the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the district court\u2019s alleged failure to state the reasons for imposition of sentence or to articulate its consideration of the relevant factors under \u00a7 3553 (including the policy statements) was not plain error. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930-31 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d 437, 441-42 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
