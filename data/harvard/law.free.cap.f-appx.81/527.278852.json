Keller, of one count of kidnaping and one count of gross sexual imposition. In a separate proceeding, the trial judge convicted Keller of the sexually violent predator specification contained in each count. Keller was then sentenced to a total of fifteen years to life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>in prison. In his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, Keller alleged prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of counsel, and denial of due process based on the admission of certain police testimony. The district court dismissed the petition. Only the ineffective assistance claim is before us on appeal. The sole issue is whether Keller was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s failure to object to certain remarks made by the prosecutor during closing argument. We conclude that the state court judgment should not be set aside on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Keller\u2019s arrest and conviction stem from an assault against a twelve-year-old girl as she walked home from a neighbor\u2019s house on the night of January 22, 1999, in Tiffin, Ohio. The young girl\u2019s attacker forcibly grabbed her from behind, lifted her off the ground, and dragged her several feet through her backyard, causing severe bruising about her head and face. The attacker repeatedly told the girl to be quiet. Once the two were behind the girl\u2019s house, the attacker managed to rub the girl\u2019s genitals through her clothes before she struggled free. The girl ran to her house, screaming and crying. The police were immediately summoned. The victim described her assailant as a short, stocky white male wearing a long dark coat and what looked like a hood. She also indicated that the attacker told her, \u201cI want to touch your pussy,\u201d as well something about \u201cgoing home.\u201d Officer Fabian of the Tiffin Police Department responded to the scene, and immediately discovered two fresh footprints in the mud, both of which appeared to be boot prints.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Approximately eighteen minutes after the police were dispatched, Officer McClure encountered Keller walking along the street approximately six blocks from the girl\u2019s residence. Keller was wearing a long dark coat, a baseball cap, and rubber boots. His jeans and coat were splattered with mud. Officer McClure recognized Keller and asked him what he was doing there. Officer McClure testified that it was unusual to see Keller \u201cin that part of town.\u201d Keller responded vaguely, saying he was coming from \u201csomeplace\u201d and going \u201csomewhere.\u201d Upon further questioning, Keller said that he had been chased by three men, and that he \u201cmight have been hit in the cheek or face\u201d in a fight. Keller could offer no details regarding the alleged fight, and when Officer McClure suggested that Keller was not in fact involved in a fight, Keller replied, \u201c[I]f that\u2019s what you think, then that\u2019s fine with me.\u201d The officer also noticed that Keller was sweating profusely and smelled strongly of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Shortly thereafter, the victim was brought by police car to Keller\u2019s location, whereupon officers asked Keller to say the words \u201cI want to go home\u201d while the victim listened. When asked if she recognized Keller\u2019s voice, she responded, \u201cIt sounds like him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">A police tracking dog led police through alleyways and down streets to a point only a few hundred feet from where officers were questioning Keller, but it dropped the trail upon being distracted by another dog\u2019s feces. On the way, the dog passed near a black knit cap on the ground. The cap was collected as possible evidence, but hairs found on it did not match Keller\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">A police detective made a plaster cast of two apparently fresh footprints found in the victim\u2019s yard. Because the prints were made in muddy ground and a light rain had been falling since the time of the attack, only one of the attempted casts yielded a usable specimen for comparison. A forensic expert testified that although comparison at the detail level was not possible due to the quality of the cast, the cast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>matched the boot that Keller was wearing both in terms of tread design and size of the heel portion. Although the expert could not say that Keller\u2019s boot was the only boot that could have made the print \u201cto the exclusion of all other boots,\u201d he reported that the boot could have made the print.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">During the rebuttal phase of closing argument, the prosecuting attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACg\">I wanna suggest you do this. Imagine if you have a child[,] a 12 year old daughter. And a person has been accused, as Mr. Keller has been. And this person that has been accused is your Mend. Somebody you like. You care about. Because if it\u2019s somebody you don\u2019t care about it\u2019s easy to say, don\u2019t want him around my kids. Imagine it\u2019s somebody you care about, a Mend of yours. And you, and you have the evidence that we have presented to you today and yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">We have proven to you each and every one of these things. We have presented to you the testimony of the girl. All these police officers. Proven to you the boot is very similar, same tread, same size tread. Would you let that person near your 12 year old girl? If you can say, yes, then you vote not guilty. If you say, no, vote guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">(J.A. at 216-17.) Keller\u2019s attorney did not object to these remarks. The judge then instructed the jury on all relevant points, including the burden of proof and reasonable doubt. During deliberation, the jury twice indicated to the trial judge that it was having difficulty reaching a unanimous decision. Ultimately, after sixteen hours of deliberation, the jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts. On direct appeal to the Ohio Court of Appeals, Keller asserted claims of both prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel predicated on the above-quoted remarks. He argued that the prosecutors remarks were so inflammatory and prejudicial that they infected the entire trial, rendering the resulting conviction a denial of due process, and further that his attorney\u2019s failure to object to the remarks constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Because trial counsel did not object to the statements, the state appellate court reviewed Keller\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim for plain error only, concluding without discussion that no such error occurred. (J.A. at 137.) Turning to Keller\u2019s related claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the state appellate court cited <em>Strickland </em>and stated, \u201c[I]n order to demonstrate prejudice, an appellant must show that a reasonable probability exists that the result of the trial would have been different had it not been for counsel\u2019s mistakes.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 138.) Without deciding whether counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument constituted deficient performance, the court summarily concluded that Keller could not satisfy the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland. See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697 (\u201cIf it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, ... that course should be followed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Keller again asserted the interrelated claims of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. In analyzing Keller\u2019s procedurally defaulted claim of prosecutorial misconduct, the district court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper, but that the remarks were not so egregious that they infected the entire trial to the level of a due process violation. <em>See Simpson v. Jones, </em>238 F.3d 399, 409 (6th Cir.2000); <em>Pritchett v. Pitcher, </em>117 F.3d 959, 964 (6th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Carroll, </em>26 F.3d 1380, 1385 (6th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>1994). Regarding Keller\u2019s separate claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the district court concluded that counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument constituted deficient performance, but agreed with the Ohio Court of Appeals that Keller had failed to demonstrate prejudice under <em>Strickland </em>for the same reasons that it would deny Keller\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Keller must show that: (1) his trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687; <em>Kinnard v. United States, </em>313 F.3d 933, 935 (6th Cir.2002). The only issue before us for review is the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that Keller failed to show that he was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s deficient performance. The district court made no credibility determination or other apparent finding of fact; its decision was based upon the transcript of Keller\u2019s trial. As such, it is reviewed <em>de novo. See Perkins v. LeCureux, </em>58 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">To establish prejudice under <em>Strickland, </em>Keller must show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694. \u201cIt is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding____ [A]nd not every error that conceivably could have influenced the outcome undermines the reliability of the result of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693. In a case such as this, \u201cthe question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695. We are concerned with whether the result of Keller\u2019s trial is fundamentally \u201cunreliable because of a breakdown in the adversarial process that our system counts on to produce just results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Finally, because the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 applies to Keller\u2019s petition, we must consider Keller\u2019s challenge within the more limited assessment of whether the state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>to the facts of this case resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an objectively unreasonable application of, relevant Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405, 410-11, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">We find that the Ohio Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that Keller was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to object was an objectively reasonable application of <em>Strickland. </em>While we might agree that the evidence of Keller\u2019s guilt is not \u201coverwhelming,\u201d the jury\u2019s verdict is amply supported by the totality of the evidence before it. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695 (instructing that the court \u201cmust consider the totality of the evidence\u201d before the jury). Within minutes of the attack, Keller was found walking the nearby streets, wearing wet and muddy clothes matching the victim\u2019s description in many material respects, wearing muddy boots with the same heel size and tread style as the boot of the attacker, and unable to give a coherent account for his presence in that area. Also within minutes of the attack, the victim was able to identify Keller\u2019s voice as sounding like the man who attacked her. A police tracking dog followed the attacker\u2019s trail to a place within sight of Keller, where the dog became distracted and dropped the trail. The boot print evidence is particularly persuasive. It seems highly unlikely that someone other than Keller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>would have left, in the vicinity of the attack, a fresh, muddy boot print of the same heel size and tread design as the boots Keller was wearing that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">A thorough review of the trial record further reveals that trial counsel performed ably throughout the proceeding, including successfully arguing against the introduction at trial of evidence of Keller\u2019s prior sexual assaults for the purported purpose of proving identity. The admission of this \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence probably would have been devastating for his defense of mistaken identity. At closing argument, Keller\u2019s attorney repeatedly invoked the state\u2019s burden of proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt, mentioning the standard no fewer than twenty times in seventeen pages of argument in which he carefully tested each piece of evidence against that standard and systematically reminded jurors of weaknesses brought out by defense counsel in cross-examination. Although the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument took place in rebuttal, leaving defense counsel no opportunity to respond, the trial court instructed the jury on reasonable doubt and the state\u2019s burden in both the preliminary instructions and the final instructions. On both occasions, the court emphasized that statements by counsel are not evidence. In the final charge to the jury, the court further instructed, \u201cYou decide the disputed facts and the Court provides the instructions of law. It is your sworn duty to accept these instructions and to apply the law as it is given to you.\u201d (Trial Tr., Yol. Ill, at 497.)</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In determining whether attorney error resulted in prejudice, we presume that the jury acted according to law. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694; <em>id. </em>at 695 (\u201cThe assessment of prejudice should proceed on the assumption that the decision maker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision.\u201d). Given the evidence presented, our judgment that counsel\u2019s performance was otherwise professional and capable throughout the proceedings, and the court\u2019s proper instructions regarding the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof and the jury\u2019s duty to accept the court\u2019s instruction, we are confident that Keller\u2019s trial as a whole was a fundamentally fair and reliable adversarial process. As a result, we cannot say that counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument has undermined our confidence in the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">In sum, the state court\u2019s conclusion that Keller was not deprived of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel was objectively reasonable. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b563-9\">MOORE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AmS\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">I believe that a conditional writ of habeas corpus should be granted on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel and respectfully dissent. The prosecutor blatantly misstated the law when he said in rebuttal, \u201cWould you let that person near your 12 year old girl? If you can say, yes, then you vote not guilty. If you say, no, vote guilty.\u201d This is a far easier standard than the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard required by law. Any reasonable juror would not want a person suspected of and arrested for kidnapping and gross sexual imposition of a twelve-year-old girl to be near the juror\u2019s young daughter and would convict under the prosecutor\u2019s standard. The trial counsel failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s fundamentally incorrect statement, and the trial judge did not instruct the jury to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">The jury deliberated for sixteen horn\u2019s and twice reported itself deadlocked. Under these circumstances it is unreasonable to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s blatant misrepresentation of the standard of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>required to convict did not demonstrate the prejudice required for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">I further note that the state court of appeals misstated the standard for prejudice under <em>Strickland. </em>The state court of appeals ruled that \u201cAppellant cannot demonstrate that the jury would have rendered an acquittal had defense counsel objected\u201d to the prosecutor\u2019s statement in closing argument. This ruling is contrary to clearly established federal law in <em>Strickland, </em>which requires only a showing of \u201c[a] <em>reasonable probability </em>that the result would have been different.\u201d 466 U.S. at 694 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Under these circumstances, a conditional writ of habeas corpus should issue. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
