See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Justin L. Chambers pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (2000). Chambers was sentenced to three years probation. Chambers violated the terms of his probation and was sentenced to twelve months incarceration and twelve months on supervised release. After serving twelve months in incarceration, Chambers began serving his supervised release. Chambers violated the terms of his supervised release. The district court revoked Chambers\u2019 supervised release and sentenced him to twelve months incarceration. Chambers appeals, asserting his sentence is excessive. We review this claim de novo. <em>United States v. Fareed, </em>296 F.3d 243, 245 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">Chambers\u2019 claim is meritless. The district court had statutory authorization to sentence Chambers to an initial term of twelve month incarceration, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (2000), and twelve months of supervised release, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(3) (2000), to revoke Chambers\u2019 supervised release based on his violation of its terms, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g) (2000), and to sentence him to a subsequent term of twelve months incarceration upon revocation of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s revocation of Chambers\u2019 supervised release and its resulting order for Chambers to serve twelve months in incarceration. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
