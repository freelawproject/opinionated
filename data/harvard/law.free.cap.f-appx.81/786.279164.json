We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-18\">Morgan contends on appeal that the district court gave jury instructions that constructively amended the indictment. Morgan points to the fact that the indictment charged a conspiracy involving cocaine and methamphetamine, while the court instructed the jury that it could convict based upon participation in a conspiracy involving cocaine and/or methamphetamine. Rogers\u2019 claim is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Montgomery, </em>262 F.3d 233, 242 (4th Cir.2001) (stating that \u201c[wjhere a statute is worded in the disjunctive, federal pleading requires the Government to charge in the conjunctive!;] [t]he district court, however, can instruct the jury in the disjunctive\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>United States v. Champion, </em>387 F.2d 561, 563 (4th Cir.1967) (approving disjunctive jury instructions when statute disjunctively worded and indictment conjunctively worded). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Morgan does not dispute that the Government proved he was involved in a conspiracy to distribute at least fifty grams of methamphetamine. We therefore find that Morgan is not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Morgan further asserts there was not sufficient evidence to convict him of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. \u201cProof of any one of the violations charged conjunctively in the indictment will sustain a conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. McGinnis, </em>783 F.2d <em>755, </em>757 (8th Cir.1986); <em>see Turner v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 398, 420, 90 S.Ct. 642, 24 L.Ed.2d 610 (1970) (stating general rule that when jury returns guilty verdict on indictment charging several acts in conjunctive, verdict stands if evidence is sufficient with respect to any one act charged). Morgan\u2019s conspiracy conviction is supportable on proof of his involvement with methamphetamine. Moreover, although the jury\u2019s verdict reflects it rejected the Government\u2019s assertion that Morgan\u2019s conduct involved at least five kilograms of cocaine, the special verdict form does state that the jury found Morgan guilty of conspiracy to distribute both methamphetamine and cocaine. Thus, this claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b819-13\"> The jury\u2019s special verdict form indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-14\">As to the charge of conspiracy to possess, with intent to distribute, cocaine and methamphetamine contained in the Bill of indictment, do you find the Defendant, Doyle Ray Morgan\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-15\">GUILTY: <em>X </em>NOT GUILTY: _</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-16\">1.
