Because Sarah\u2019s paralysis occurred more than 30 days after the date on which she was vaccinated, Sarah\u2019s doctors determined that the vaccine she received did not induce the paralysis. The Heberns contend that Sarah\u2019s doctors now agree that Sarah\u2019s paralysis was caused by polio that she contracted through contact with another child following the other child\u2019s vaccination. Proceeding on that theory, the Heberns filed a petition for relief under the Vaccine Act in June 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The Vaccine Act provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cno petition may be filed for compensation under the Program for [a vaccine-related] injury after the expiration of 36 months after the date of the occurrence of the first symptom or manifestation of onset of the significant aggravation of such injury....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-16(a)(2). Pursuant to that provision, the Heberns were required to file their petition in 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">In the proceeding following the filing of their' petition, the Heberns contended that, through no fault of their own, they did not determine the cause of Sarah\u2019s injuries before June 2000, and that the 36-month limitations period for filing a petition under the Vaccine Act should have been equitably tolled. A special master of the Court of Federal Claims, however, dismissed the petition as untimely, holding that equitable tolling does not apply to petitions for compensation under the Vaccine Act. The He-berns did not appeal that decision, and a final judgment was issued on the petition in October 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">In April 2002, the Heberns filed an application for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(e), which authorizes the special master or court to award compensation to cover the petitioner\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, even if the petition was unsuccessful, if the special master or court determines that the petition was brought in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for the claim for which the petition was brought. The special master denied the application on the ground that, because the court did not have jurisdiction over the Heberns\u2019 petition for compensation, it did not have jurisdiction to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On review of the special master\u2019s decision, the Court of Federal Claims affirmed and dismissed the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">It is undisputed that the Heberns\u2019 petition for compensation was not filed within the 36-month period provided in the Vaccine Act and thus would be timely only if the limitations period was equitably tolled. This court, however, has held that equitable tolling is not permitted under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-16(a)(2). <em>See Brice v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>240 F.3d 1367, 1372-74 (Fed.Cir.2001). Therefore, the special master in the compensation proceeding properly held that the He-berns\u2019 compensation petition was time-barred and that the court did not have jurisdiction to hear the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Because the Court of Federal Claims lacked jurisdiction over the compensation petition, it also lacked jurisdiction over the application for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The attorney fee provision of the Vaccine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 800aa-15(e), is not an independent grant of jurisdiction for the Court of Federal Claims to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in Vaccine Act cases. <em>See Martin v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>62 F.3d 1403 (Fed.Cir.1995). Rather, \u201cSection 300aa-15(e)(l) simply authorizes fee awards in cases already within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1406. Inasmuch as the Court of Federal Claims did not have jurisdiction to hear the underlying petition, it did not have jurisdiction to hear the request for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Accordingly, the court was correct in denying the Heberns\u2019 application for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
