R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b956-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">Rafael Gonzalez appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition challenging his 1995 California state conviction for murder and related offenses. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. Reviewing de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition, <em>Mendez v. Small, </em>298 F.3d 1154, 1157-58 (9th Cir.2002), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Gonzalez contends that his due process rights were violated when the trial court denied a motion to recuse the entire district attorney\u2019s office after voir dire, when it discovered that District Attorney Otero had represented him in two prior cases as a juvenile. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">Gonzalez has made no attempt to rebut the state court\u2019s factual findings that Otero had only assisted \u201cmarginally\u201d in voir dire and that his prior representation of Gonzalez was brief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Moreover, Gonzalez has failed to show how he was prejudiced in any way by being prosecuted by someone else in Otero\u2019s office. <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (reviewing trial error for \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d on the jury\u2019s verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-14\">Finally, Gonzalez has not identified any Supreme Court authority requiring recusal of an entire district attorney\u2019s office on these facts. Accordingly, the district court properly denied Gonzalez\u2019s petition. <em>See Garvin v. Farmon, </em>258 F.3d 951, 954 (9th Cir.2001) <em>cert. denied </em>535 U.S. 990, 122 S.Ct. 1546, 152 L.Ed.2d 471 (2002); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b956-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
