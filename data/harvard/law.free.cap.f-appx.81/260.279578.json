Many details of the ensuing encounter between Hamre and White are disputed, but it is undisputed that Hamre used foul language and rudely told White to get off his property after learning that White did not have a warrant. It is also undisputed that more than five weeks later, White filed citations charging Hamre with (1) reckless endangerment; (2) disorderly conduct; and (3) fourth degree assault. The judge dismissed the first two charges and acquitted Hamre of the third because of insufficient evidence that Hamre intended to create fear in the mind of Officer White, a required element of fourth degree assault in Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Hamre subsequently filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington against White, the City of Bothell, Bothell Police Chief Mark Ericks, and three other Bothell police officers identified as John Does I through III, claiming that his arrest and prosecution based on Officer White\u2019s fabricated version of their encounter violated his First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. He also filed state tort claims for false arrest and imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss all of Hamre\u2019s claims against all parties. The district court also rejected Hamre\u2019s request for a Rule 56(f) continuance to find evidence of the City\u2019s liability for a section 1983 violation. Hamre appeals the district court\u2019s judgment except for the dismissal of the claims against Police Chief Ericks and the John Doe defendants. As the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite them only as necessary. We reverse in part and affirm in part and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Hamre presented sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on his First Amendment and Fourth Amendment claims. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Hamre, Officer White told Hamre he would \u201cdeal with [him] later\u201d after Hamre used insulting language during their encounter. White allegedly then followed through on the threat by fabricating his police report and filing false charges against Hamre in retaliation for Hamre\u2019s rude behavior. White\u2019s alleged retaliation for the insult he received from Hamre would constitute a clear First Amendment violation. <em>See City of Houston v. Hill, </em>482 U.S. 451, 461, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987); <em>Duran v. City of Douglas, </em>904 F.2d 1372, 1378 (9th Cir.1990). Hamre also presented sufficient evidence that White\u2019s alleged deliberate false statements about his encounter with Hamre led to Hamre\u2019s wrongful arrest and prosecution in violation of his clearly established Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See Hervey v. Estes, </em>65 F.3d 784, 790 (9th Cir.1995). Because Hamre\u2019s claims are governed more closely by Fourth Amendment principles than by due process, we affirm the dismissal of Ham-re\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment claim. <em>See Galbraith v. County of Santa Clara, </em>307 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The district court also erred by dismissing Hamre\u2019s state tort claims. With respect to Hamre\u2019s claims for false arrest and imprisonment and malicious prosecution, the district court failed to credit the evidence presented by Hamre that Officer White falsified his police report to \u201cdeal with [Hamre] later\u201d as he had threatened to do. Under Washington law, \u201c[I]f a factual issue as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>probable cause or malice exists, the question must be submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Bender v. City of Seattle, 99 </em>Wash.2d 582, 664 P.2d 492, 501 (Wash.1983). Similarly, the district court erred in dismissing Ham-re\u2019s intentional infliction of emotional distress claim by faffing to recognize that being prosecuted on trumped up charges amounts to more than \u201cmere annoyance, inconvenience, or normal embarrassment.\u201d <em>Brower v. Ackerley, </em>88 Wash.App. 87, 943 P.2d 1141, 1149 (Wash.Ct.App.1997) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The district court also erred by dismissing Hamre\u2019s state law claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress on the grounds that Hamre did not present evidence of \u201cobjective symptomatology.\u201d \u201cThe party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of showing the absence of an issue of material fact,\u201d <em>Seaman v. Karr, 114 </em>Wash.App. 665, 59 P.3d 701, 707 (Wash.Ct.App.2002) (internal quotation omitted), but the district court failed to recognize that the defendants never raised the issue of the lack of evidence of \u201cobjective symptomatology\u201d to support Hamre\u2019s claim. Hamre should be given the chance to present evidence to the district court before having his claim dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Because we are reversing the dismissal of Hamre\u2019s state law tort claims against White, we also reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hamre\u2019s state law claims against the City of Bothell. Similarly, Hamre\u2019s section 1983 claims against the City should be reinstated to the same extent as his section 1983 claims against White. To the extent that the district court denied Hamre\u2019s Rule <em>56(f) </em>motion to continue discovery against the City based solely on its erroneous dismissal of Ham-re\u2019s constitutional claims against White, the court should allow Hamre to continue discovery to uncover potential evidence of the City\u2019s customs, practices, or policies that might trigger section 1983 liability. However, to the extent that the district court\u2019s decision to deny Hamre\u2019s request for a Rule 56(f) continuance depended on its conclusion that Hamre already had ample time to uncover evidence suggesting municipal liability if any existed, we permit the district court to reaffirm its denial of Hamre\u2019s Rule 56(f) request on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">We REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hamre\u2019s First and Fourth Amendment and state law tort claims, AFFIRM the dismissal of Hamre\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment claim, and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
