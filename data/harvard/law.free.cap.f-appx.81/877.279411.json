Flowers was convicted in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois of one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Flowers argues for reversal of his conviction, alleging that: (1) the prosecutor improperly referenced his alleged post-arrest \u201csilence\u201d at trial, in violation of his Fifth Amendment self-incrimination and due process rights, and (2) there was insufficient evidence to prove he was in possession of the drugs (cocaine and cocaine base) at the time of his arrest. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">On May 4, 2001, agents from the Quad Cities Metropolitan Enforcement Group (\u201cQCMEG\u201d) arrested one Michael Bennett on charges of possession of cocaine, methamphetamine, and marijuana. Bennett agreed to cooperate and thereafter participated in a \u201ccontrolled\u201d purchase of drugs from his supplier, Emil Dahmers. That same day, before proceeding with the controlled buy, the agents searched Bennett for possession of any other moneys, and thereafter provided him with $300 in prerecorded money, and placed him under surveillance and observed him as he drove to Dahmers\u2019s house to purchase cocaine. Approximately five minutes after Bennett arrived at Dahmers\u2019s residence, agents observed Dahmers exit the house and drive to an apartment building later determined to be Flowers\u2019s residence (827 18th Street). Several minutes after entering the Defendant\u2019s apartment, Dahmers returned and entered his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">As Dahmers was driving to his residence (where Bennett was waiting for the delivery of the cocaine), the QCMEG agents attempted to pull Dahmers over for a traffic stop, as they suspected he realized he was being followed by the police. Dahmers refused to comply and stop his vehicle; instead, he jumped a curb and drove over a sidewalk onto a service road in an attempt to flee. As Dahmers proceeded to drive down the service road with the police in hot pursuit, he was observed dumping white powder (which the agents suspected to be cocaine) out of his car window. Eventually, the QCMEG agents succeeded in forcing him to stop his vehicle in a church parking lot, took him into custody and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Shortly thereafter, Dahmers agreed to cooperate, and, during an interview, admitted that in the past he had frequently purchased crack and powder cocaine from Flowers at his residence (827 18th Street, Apartment 12). Dahmers went on to inform the agents that Flowers stored his drugs in an upstairs apartment (Apartment 22) owned by the Defendant\u2019s cousin, Paul Cummings. Based upon their investigation, including Dahmers\u2019s statements, the agents obtained warrants to search Apartments 12 and 22, located at 827 18th Street, Moline, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">When the agents entered Apartment 12, Flowers, his live-in girlfriend, Anita Ramirez, and his friend, Kelvin Bell, were all inside the apartment. Agents proceeded to search the apartment and, inside the bedroom, recovered $8,010 in cash from a travel bag (underneath the bed), and $1,609 in cash-including the $300 in marked bills used in the Bennett-Dahmers transaction-from a bedside table. Also inside Apartment 12, agents found a set of keys to Apartments 12 and 22, letters which listed the Defendant\u2019s address as \u201c827 18th Street, Apartment 12,\u201d as well as two cell phones, and a pager.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">A number of other agents proceeded upstairs to search Apartment 22 and, after gaining entry, recovered various items of drug paraphernalia, including a digital scale, a plastic bowl containing 194.2 grams of cocaine, and a plastic bag holding 13.4 grams of cocaine from a kitchen cabinet in the apartment. Also in the cupboard, resting on a plastic plate, was Flowers\u2019s gym membership card, as well as an additional 80.6 grams of crack-cocaine. Forensic fingerprint tests revealed the Defendant\u2019s prints on a paper plate located <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>under the plastic plate containing crack-cocaine. On the other side of the kitchen, agents located a drawer full of \u201ccorner-cut\u201d plastic baggies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">After Flowers\u2019s arrest he was given his <em>Miranda </em>warning, and waiving his rights proceeded to answer the questions of QCMEG agent Jeffrey Hayes. Agent Hayes testified at trial that, during this interview, Flowers admitted that the keys and cash found in Apartment 12 during the search belonged to him, but went on to claim that part of the cash found in his bedroom ($2,000) came from his mother, and that he had earned the rest of the money through part-time employment in the roofing and contracting business. During direct questioning at trial, the prosecutor asked Agent Hayes: \u201cDid you ask the Defendant [Flowers] if he knew who owned the narcotics, the cocaine and crack cocaine ... found in Apartment No. 22?\u201d (Tr. at 138.) Over defense counsel\u2019s objection,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hayes answered: \u2018Tes. I asked Mr. Flowers who the narcotics belonged to, and he stated that he did know; however, he would not inform me of that person\u2019s name.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Ramirez, also took the stand, and while testifying stated that, during the year pri- or to his arrest, Flowers had been staying with her in Apartment 12 four to five nights a week. Contrary to the Defendant\u2019s assertion that he had earned part of the $9,919 doing roofing and contracting work, Ramirez testified that to the best of her knowledge Flowers had never held a job that year, and that he \u201cstay[ed] at home at [her] apartment\u201d during the day while she went to work. <em>(Id. </em>at 115)</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Dahmers also testified and recounted that he often purchased powder cocaine and crack-cocaine from Flowers, <em>(id. </em>at 148) (testifying that, each day, he would buy drugs \u201c[a]s many times [as] [he] could get a hold of [the Defendant] and ... had money\u201d), and that Flowers kept his drugs \u201cupstairs\u201d in Paul Cummings\u2019s apartment (Apartment 22). <em>(Id. </em>at 151.) Consistent with the physical evidence recovered at the scene, Dahmers stated that, on the day of his arrest (May 4, 2001), the Defendant was keeping his drugs in the kitchen of Apartment 22, \u201cin a bowl\u201d and \u201con a plate\u201d on the kitchen counter, and that, incident to their drug transaction, he (Dahmers) had observed that the Defendant used his gym membership card to scoop \u201cup [the drugs] and put [them] on the scale.\u201d (Tr. at 154-55.) Phone records subpoenaed established that, between January and May of 2001, Dahmers had called the Defendant\u2019s phone number at least 210 times, and that Flowers had called Dahmers\u2019s phone number approximately 118 times during the same time frame, thus supporting Dahmers\u2019s testimony that he had frequently purchased drugs from Flowers and arranged the drug purchases by phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">The prosecution also presented the testimony of Flowers\u2019s cousin, Paul Cummings, who likewise provided corroborating evidence of Flowers\u2019s drug-trafficking activities. Cummings, who owned Apartment 22, testified that approximately one month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>before Flowers\u2019s arrest on one occasion in particular, he observed Flowers sitting at the kitchen counter of his apartment, handling a \u201clittle small bag\u201d of white powdery substance which he suspected was an illegal drug. Cummings went on to deny that he personally ever had any involvement in Flowers\u2019s drug-related activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The jury convicted Flowers of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine and at least 50 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and (b). On September 11, 2002, the district court sentenced Flowers to 240 months in prison, to be followed by ten years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay a $1,500 fine and $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Flowers raises two issues on appeal. First, he claims that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of Agent Hayes regarding his (Flowers\u2019s) <em>post-Miranda </em>statement, and the prosecutor\u2019s subsequent reference to such statement during closing argument, infringed his Fifth Amendment due process rights under <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). Flowers also argues that the evidence the Government presented was insufficient to establish that he had possession of the cocaine and cocaine-base found in Apartment 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">\n<em>A. Fifth Amendment Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">This court generally reviews a claim of constitutional error <em>de novo. See United States v. Kirschenbaum, </em>156 F.3d 784, 792 (7th Cir.1998) (citing <em>United States v. Wicks, </em>132 F.3d 383, 386) (7th Cir.1997). In this case, the Government claims that we should review the Defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim for plain error, because the Defendant failed to expressly object to the prosecution\u2019s reference to Flowers\u2019s post-arrest statement during the closing argument. <em>See Lieberman v. Washington, </em>128 F.3d 1085, 1095 (7th Cir.1997) (\u201c[b]e-cause the trial judge was never called upon to rule whether the State\u2019s cross-examination and/or closing statements were violative of <em>Doyle, </em>Lieberman waived this argument on appeal unless \u2018plain error\u2019 is manifest\u201d). We disagree with the Government\u2019s contention, for a reading of the transcript reveals that defense counsel <em>did </em>make a Fifth Amendment objection to the prosecutor\u2019s line of questioning during the direct examination of Agent Hayes, and thus hold that counsel did preserve his objection for the remainder of the trial (including closing arguments). <em>{See </em>Tr. at 137) (\u201cSo may the record then reflect our <em>Doyle v. Ohio </em>objection, and we will just proceed without our having to object further?\u201d). Accordingly, we review the Defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim <em>de novo. United States v. DeGeratto, </em>876 F.2d 576, 585 (7th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">In <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617-618, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 2244-2245, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), the Supreme Court held that the use of a defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence for impeachment purposes is unconstitutional, as it violates a defendant\u2019s right to due process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court opined that, because the <em>Miranda </em>warning contains an \u201cimplicit\u201d assurance that \u201csilence will carry no penalty\u201d at trial, it would be \u201cfundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s [post-Miranda] silence to be used to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>peach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The Defendant in his appeal claims that under <em>Doyle, </em>it was unconstitutional for the prosecutor to solicit trial testimony from Agent Hayes regarding the Defendant\u2019s post-Miranda, statements (post-arrest interview). In particular, the Defendant contends that his response to Hayes\u2019s inquiry as to who owned the drugs in Apartment 22 <em>(ie., </em>that \u201che did know [who owned the drugs in Apartment 22]; however, he would not inform [Agent Hayes] of that person\u2019s name\u201d (Tr. at 133)) constituted <em>\u201csilence\u201d </em>under <em>Doyle, </em>and thus should not have been introduced to the jury at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">We do not agree, for Flowers\u2019s case is distinguishable from <em>Doyle. </em>Unlike the defendants in <em>Doyle, </em>Flowers did not remain <em>silent </em>when questioned by the agents. Instead, after receiving his <em>Miranda </em>warning, Flowers voluntarily opted to pick and choose the responses he gave to the agents\u2019 queries. Thus, the statement in <em>question </em>\u2014 that <em>he (Defendant) did know who owned the drugs, but would not say who it was </em>\u2014 was <em>clearly an affirmative answer, rather than silence. </em>Nothing in <em>Doyle </em>precludes the prosecution from presenting at trial a defendant\u2019s prior affirmative statement (answer).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Considering the facts in this case, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Anderson v. Charles, </em>447 U.S. 404, 100 S.Ct. 2180, 65 L.Ed.2d 222 (1980) is most instructive. In <em>Anderson, </em>the Supreme Court expressly held that <em>Doyle </em>does not apply in situations where \u201ca defendant ... voluntarily speaks after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings [because he] has not been induced to remain silent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408. Here, as in <em>Anderson, </em>before the Defendant made his statement regarding who owned the drugs in Apartment 22, the Defendant had already answered a number of <em>prior questions;</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>thus, his affirmative statement (that \u201che did know [who the owner of the drugs was]; however, he would not inform [Agent Hayes] of that person\u2019s name\u201d) was not silence, but rather an admission that he knew the identity of the drug owner but refused to reveal the party\u2019s name to Agent Hayes. <em>See also Lindgren v. Lane, </em>925 F.2d 198, 201 (7th Cir.1991) (holding that an agent\u2019s testimony regarding defendant\u2019s compound statement that he had been out fishing all night, but \u201che didn\u2019t wish to say any more\u201d was not a <em>Doyle </em>violation); <em>United States v. Crowder, </em>719 F.2d 166, 168, 172 (6th Cir.1983) (concluding that a defendant\u2019s post-MiramZa statement about his connection with stolen goods, followed by a refusal to later re-tell his story to FBI agents did not fall within the parameters of \u201csilence\u201d under <em>Doyle). </em>Accordingly, when a defendant gives limited, self-serving statement, he gives a statement; thus, Agent Hayes\u2019s testimony regarding Flowers\u2019s affirmative statement was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Furthermore, even if Hayes\u2019s testimony stating that Flowers refused to inform the officer of the name of the owner of the drugs could be construed as \u201csilence,\u201d this would not rise to the level of a constitutional violation, as Flowers was neither prejudiced by the admission of the Defendant\u2019s statement (Hayes\u2019s testimony), nor by the prosecutor\u2019s reference to such statement during closing argument. During closing, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aya\">\u201c[Flowers] also said he knew who owned the drugs, but he wouldn\u2019t say who that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>person was. Now, I would suggest to you that is a false statement by Defendant. He knew whose the drugs were all right, but the second half [of that statement] was not true because he owned the drugs. He owned the drugs and he wasn\u2019t going to say. He was just trying to think fast when being questioned by the police, d[id]n\u2019t want to look guilty, and [was] trying to come up with something.\u201d (Tr. at 275.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Considering the wealth of evidence of Defendant\u2019s guilt, any error caused by this statement of the prosecutor in his closing argument was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Constitutional error is harmless if it had no \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Aleman v. Sternes, </em>320 F.3d 687, 689-690 (7th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993)). As we have stated previously, \u201c[a]n error is harmless if the other untainted incriminating evidence is overwhelming.\u201d <em>United States v. Manganellis, </em>864 F.2d 528, 539 (7th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">In this case, an abundance of incriminating evidence, direct and circumstantial both pointed to the Defendant\u2019s ownership and control of the cocaine found in Apartment 22. Not only did Flowers admit that he owned the set of keys identified as being keyed to Apartment 22, agents who searched the apartment found his gym membership card lying on top of a plate of cocaine in the kitchen, as well as various drug paraphernalia (a digital scale, a plastic bowl containing 194.2 grams of cocaine, and a plastic bag holding 13.4 grams of cocaine). Additionally, Flowers\u2019s fingerprint was found on a plate beneath the cocaine, and the marked $300 in cash (used earlier that day in a drug transaction) was discovered in Flowers\u2019s bedroom at the time of his arrest. Witnesses Dahmers and Cummings sealed the case against Flowers, testifying that they had seen Flowers in possession of cocaine (and, according to Dahmers, actually dealing cocaine) in Apartment 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Considering the plethora of evidence of Flowers\u2019s guilt, we are convinced that the prosecutor\u2019s brief mention of Defendant\u2019s post-arrest statements during closing argument had little, if any, impact at all on the jury\u2019s decision, much less a \u201csubstantial effect.\u201d Thus, even were we to determine that the court had committed any error in dealing with the admission of the Defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>statement about ownership of the drugs, we would deem it to be harmless error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>\n<em>B. Insufficient Evidence Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Flowers next claims that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base. \u201cA party challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a jury conviction faces a steep uphill battle.\u201d <em>United States v. Graham, </em>315 F.3d 777, 781 (2003). We have stated on prior occasion that a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence poses a \u201cnearly insurmountable burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>213 F.3d 409, 416 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">In evaluating a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we must determine whether, \u201c \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>796 F.2d 212, 214 (7th Cir.1986) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original)). \u201cAn appellate court will not weigh the evidence or assess the credibility of the witnesses. Only when the record contains no evidence, regardless of how it is weighed, from which the jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, may an appellate court overturn the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>796 F.2d 212, 214-15 (7th Cir.1986) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">The burden on Flowers to establish that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction is <em>particularly </em>great, given that Flowers failed to make a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal on the possession of cocaine and cocaine base with intent to distribute charge in a timely manner (ie., at the close of the Government\u2019s evidence or within the seven-day period following entry of the jury\u2019s verdict), and thus waived an appellate challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>United States v. Archambault, </em>62 F.3d 995, 998 (7th Cir.1995). Flowers may obtain reversal only if he demonstrates a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. quoting United States v. Baker, </em>40 F.3d 154, 160 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">To be convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), the Government must prove: (1) knowing or intentional possession of the drug (in this case, cocaine and cocaine base); (2) with intent to distribute; and (3) with the knowledge that the drug was a controlled substance. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>325 F.3d 865, 868 (7th Cir.2003). Flowers contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that he was in \u201cpossession\u201d of and thus responsible for the drugs found in Apartment 22 on May 4, 2001. Specifically, Flowers argues that the Government\u2019s evidence failed to establish a \u201cnexus\u201d between himself and the cocaine and cocaine base, and furthermore was insufficient to support that he was exercising \u201cdominion and control\u201d over the contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Possession of a controlled substance may be actual or constructive. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>328 F.3d 352, 355 (7th Cir.2003). Thus, \u201c[a] defendant need not be caught red-handed in order to satisfy the possession element\u201d of \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>United States v. Starks, </em>309 F.3d 1017, 1022 (7th Cir.2002). The Government \u201cmay prove constructive possession if it can demonstrate that the defendant exercised ownership, dominion, authority or control over the illicit material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">Despite Flowers\u2019s protestations to the contrary, the trial record holds ample evidence to establish that Flowers was in possession of the drugs recovered from Apartment 22. Again, we recall Flowers\u2019s admission that he had his own key to the apartment where the drugs were found, as well as the agents\u2019 discovery of his finger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>print on the plate beneath the crack cocaine (kitchen cupboard). Also supporting the Government\u2019s case, Emil Dahmers testified at trial that Defendant \u201ckept [his drugs] upstairs [in Paul Cummings\u2019s apartment \u2014 Apartment 22]\u201d (Tr. at 151) and that on the date of the drug bust (May 4, 2001), the Defendant had taken him (Dahmers) to that apartment, and, while he was seated at the kitchen counter, he (Defendant) had used his gym membership card to scoop the cocaine from a bowl (or a \u201cplate\u201d) to a digital scale, prior to the sale. (Tr. at 155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Physical evidence recovered from the kitchen cabinet in Apartment 22 \u2014 a plastic plate holding crack cocaine, Flowers\u2019s gym card, a digital scale \u2014 certainly seemed to corroborate Dahmers\u2019s testimony that when he and Flowers were inside the kitchen in Apartment 22, he had observed Flowers use his gym membership card to scoop \u201cup [the drugs] and put [them] on the scale.\u201d (Tr. at 154-55.) The Government at trial presented the following confiscated items: Defendant\u2019s gym membership card, a digital scale, a bowl containing powder cocaine, and a plate holding around 80 grams of crack cocaine. Finally, considering also the fact that Flowers was found in possession of the <em>$300 in recorded buy money </em>(used in the Bennett-Dahmers transaction earlier that day), and that his cellular phone records documented that he had called Dahmers\u2019s phone number approximately 118 times over a five-month period (January through May, 2001), Dahmers\u2019s claim that he purchased cocaine from Defendant on a frequent basis, and that, on the date of the arrest, Defendant had sold him (Dahmers) drugs out of the stash found in Apartment 22 was even more credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">The Government\u2019s evidence establishes a most clear nexus between the Defendant Flowers and the cocaine and cocaine base found in Apartment 22, and furthermore the plethora of direct and physical evidence (scale, corner-cut baggies) supported that Flowers was involved in the distribution and sale of illegal drugs. We are convinced that the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt was clearly supported by the evidence. Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-9\">. In addition to the possession with intent to distribute charge, Flowers was originally charged with three other crimes: (1) conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, (2) using and carrying a firearm during a drug-trafficking crime, and (3) being a felon in possession of a firearm. Prior to the end of trial (on May 14, 2002), the court dismissed the two firearms charges on the Government\u2019s motion and, at the close of the Government\u2019s case (on May 16, 2002), the court granted the Defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge. The remaining charge went to the jury, and, after hearing the evidence and applying the relevant law, the jury found the Defendant guilty of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b912-5\">. An agent testified that \"corner-cut\u201d plastic bags are often used to store drugs in distributable amounts. (Tr. at 84-85.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b912-6\">. When the prosecutor asked Hayes this question during direct examination, Defense counsel objected, arguing that Flowers had been merely asserting his right to remain silent, and that the statement thus could not be used against him under <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). After a sidebar discussion of the issue, counsel\u2019s objection on the record was overruled in the absence of the jury. Defense counsel then asked that \"the record ... reflect our <em>Doyle v. Ohio </em>objection\u201d and requested permission to \"proceed without having to object further.\u201d (Tr. at 137.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b913-10\">. Although <em>\"Doyle </em>involved a state prosecution [and due process guarantees under the Fourteenth Amendment], it applies identically to federal prosecutions under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Balter, </em>91 F.3d 427, 439 n. 9 (3d Cir.1996) (citation omitted). <em>See also United States v. Gant, </em>17 F.3d 935 (7th Cir.1994) (addressing an alleged <em>Doyle </em>violation in the context of a federal prosecution); <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>929 F.2d 1169, 1174 (7th Cir.1991) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b914-7\">. After reading Flowers his <em>Miranda </em>warnings (and before he asked Flowers about the ownership of the drugs), Agent Hayes asked the Defendant a number of questions and he freely answered. Specifically, Hayes asked Flowers where the money found in Apartment 12 had originated, whether the key ring belonged to him, and who resided in Apartment 22\u2014 and Flowers voluntarily answered each of these questions. (Tr. at 130-33.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b915-8\">. Although Flowers bases his argument for reversal of his conviction primarily on <em>Doyle, </em>which addresses a defendant\u2019s <em>due process </em>rights, Defendant also refers to his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination to support his argument for reversal. Flowers's Br. at 20-21. \"The right against self-incrimination is violated only when: (1) it was the prosecutor\u2019s manifest intention to refer to the defendant\u2019s silence; or (2) the remark was of such a character that the jury would 'naturally and necessarily\u2019 take it to be a comment on the defendant\u2019s silence.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. Peters, </em>63 F.3d 546, 561 (7th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Donovan, </em>24 F.3d 908, 916 (7th Cir.1994)). Again, we note that, during his arrest, Flowers was informed of his right to remain silent, but instead of remaining silent, chose to answer Agent Hayes\u2019s interrogatories. Thus, in recounting on the stand the nature of his post-arrest interview with Flowers, Agent Hayes did not reference Defendant\u2019s <em>silence, </em>but rather Flowers's affirmative statement that he knew who owned the drugs but would not identify that person. Moreover, to the extent that the district court might have committed <em>any </em>Fifth Amendment error in admitting Hayes\u2019s testimony (or allowing the prosecutor to refer to such testimony in his closing statement), such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the conclusiveness of the wealth of evidence received in evidence against Flowers at trial (eyewitness testimony, physical evidence of drug paraphernalia, keys to Apartment 22, etc.). <em>See supra </em>at 10-11.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
