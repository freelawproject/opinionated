Because we find Campbell\u2019s arguments unavailing, we AFFIRM his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Acting on a tip, police seized two three-ring binders containing 112 images of nude or partially nude children from Campbell\u2019s place of employment in May of 2001. Campbell told police that he downloaded them from various websites. The police arrested Campbell and a grand jury indicted him for one count each of receiving and possessing child pornography shipped and transported in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">At trial, Campbell moved for judgment of acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s case-in-chief, arguing that the government presented no evidence showing he intended to possess any illegal images. The district court granted the motion with respect to sixty-six of the images, concluding that as a matter of law, those images were not \u201clascivious\u201d and could not support a conviction under \u00a7 2252. But the court ruled that the government presented sufficient evidence to allow the jury to consider the remaining images.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Campbell\u2019s principal defense then, was that while those images contained nude or partially nude minors, he did not know they were engaged in sexually explicit conduct and therefore he did not violate \u00a7 2252. Essentially, Campbell wanted to show that he thought the pictures were artistic-the district court described it as a \u201ckind of Michelangelo defense.\u201d To support this defense, Campbell sought to present testimony from Lendon Noe, an art professor who would have testified about well-regarded artists who use nude or partially nude children as subjects in their work. The district court disallowed Noe\u2019s testimony because Campbell failed to disclose her as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Later, Campbell sought to use in his closing argument those sixty-six images that the district court concluded were not lascivious as a matter of law. But the court refused his request, finding that the images would prejudice Campbell himself. The court also overruled Campbell\u2019s objection to the jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">The jury found Campbell guilty of both receiving and possessing the sexually explicit images in violation of \u00a7 2252. At his sentencing, Campbell requested a three-point reduction in offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility. The court denied that request and sentenced Campbell to forty months for each offense, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">A. Campbell\u2019s Right to Present a Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">Campbell argues that by excluding Professor Noe\u2019s testimony and disallowing defense counsel\u2019s use of the sixty-six nonlaseivious images for his closing argument, the district court denied him his right to present a defense. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 141, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">The right of the accused to present a defense inheres in the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process and the Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Amendment\u2019s Compulsory Process Clause. <em>Taylor v. Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 410, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988); <em>Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967). Presenting relevant evidence is part of that right. <em>United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998). But the right to present relevant evidence is not boundless. <em>Id. </em>It \u201cmay, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.\u201d <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 55, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987) (quoting <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 295, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973)). A defendant\u2019s noncompliance with \u201cestablished rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt or innocence\u201d may prompt a court to curtail the right to present relevant evidence. <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 302. Excluding relevant evidence for failure to comply with such rules does not violate an accused\u2019s right to present a defense so long as those rules are not \u201c \u2018arbitrary\u2019 or \u2018disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. at 308 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Here, in excluding Noe\u2019s testimony, the district court applied one of those rules: Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(b)(1)(C), concerning reciprocal discovery of expert witnesses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Campbell\u2019s request for discovery from the government, and the government\u2019s compliance, obligated him to disclose any expert witnesses he intended to present.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Campbell does not claim that he properly disclosed this witness. Nor does he claim that enforcing Rule 16 here is \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201cdisproportionate\u201d to its intended purpose. Instead, he argues that Professor Noe was a lay witness, not an expert and therefore not subject to the dictates of Rule 16(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">The Federal Rules of Evidence allow a witness to be \u201cqualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 702. As an art professor asked to testify about child nudity as art, Noe fit the bill. The defense sought to offer her insight about the professional art world, not her knowledge regarding Campbell\u2019s case. Thus the district court acted within its discretion to remedy Campbell\u2019s Rule 16(b)(1)(C) failure-to-diselose violation by excluding Noe\u2019s testimony under Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(d)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">Second, the district court acted within its discretion in denying Campbell\u2019s request to use in his closing argument those images excluded by the court as nonlascivious. A court may limit a defendant\u2019s right to present relevant evidence when necessary to further \u201cother legitimate interests of the criminal trial process.\u201d <em>Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. at 308. One such interest is the court\u2019s duty to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the jury from \u201cthe influence of passion and prejudice, and to assure to the litigants a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>Hockaday v. Red Line, </em>174 F.2d 154, 156 (D.C.Cir.1949) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In its sound discretion, the district court could have determined that protection of Campbell\u2019s trial rights necessitated this evidentiary ruling. Danger of prejudice to Campbell inhered in what the jury might have surmised upon learning that the judge had excluded some images but not others. Reasoning by implication, the jury might well have concluded that since the court eliminated certain images from jury consideration as nonlascivious, those that remained <em>were </em>lascivious.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">B. Campbell\u2019s Motion for Acquittal</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Next, Campbell argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 29 motion for acquittal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Ceim. P. 29. When we review the denial of a motion for acquittal, \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Campbell claims that the government presented insufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to find that the images contained sexually explicit conduct, an essential element of an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">For purposes of \u00a7 2252, \u201csexually explicit conduct\u201d means \u201clascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(2)(A)(v). In determining whether a particular exhibition of the genitals or pubic area was \u201clascivious,\u201d several of our sister circuits have used the six factors outlined in <em>United States v. Dost, </em>636 F.Supp. 828, 832 (S.D.Cal.1986). <em>See, e.g., Doe v. Chamberlin, </em>299 F.3d 192, 196 (3d Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Amirault, </em>173 F.3d 28, 32-35 (1st Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Wolf, </em>890 F.2d 241, 244-46 (10th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Rubio, </em>834 F.2d 442, 448 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Those factors are: (1) whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child\u2019s genitalia or pubic area; (2) whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity; (3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child; (4) whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude; (5) whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity; and (6) whether the depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer. <em>Dost, </em>636 F.Supp. at 832. We note that this list is not exhaustive, and an image need not satisfy every factor to be deemed lascivious. <em>Id. </em>Rather, along with any other relevant criteria, including the age of the child, these factors provide a framework for analyzing the image in its entirety. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Using this framework then, we conclude that a rational juror could have found that Campbell\u2019s images depicted \u201csexually explicit conduct\u201d-that is, a \u201clascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(2)(A)(v). Campbell\u2019s pictures contained images of preadolescent to teenage girls, most of whom are completely nude. Those not completely nude are found wearing lingerie or stockings and garters-inappropriate attire for girls of their age. Many of the depictions are sexually suggestive, with girls posing unnaturally, prompting focus on the genital area. Moreover, most of the images seem intended to elicit a sexual response in the viewer. That intent is evidenced by how the child poses (on her back with legs slightly spread), the angle of the shot (taken from near the child\u2019s feet, while she is lying on her back), and the child\u2019s facial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>expression (smiling while looking into the camera). These same characteristics support a finding that the images suggest a sexual coyness or willingness to engage in sexual activity. In short, Campbell\u2019s images involved all of the <em>Dost </em>factors to some extent, and a rational juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that they depicted sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">C. The Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Third, Campbell argues that the district court erred in refusing to deliver his proposed jury instruction. He claims that the court\u2019s instruction was constitutionally infirm because it failed to require a finding that the defendant <em>knew </em>the images contained a \u201clascivious exhibition of the genital or pubic area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">\u201cWe review jury instructions as a whole to determine whether they fairly and adequately submitted the issues and applicable law to the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>952 F.2d 1504, 1512 (6th Cir.1991). We will reverse a district court\u2019s refusal to deliver a requested instruction \u201conly if that instruction is (1) a correct statement of the law, (2) not substantially covered by the charge actually delivered to the jury, and (3) concerns a point so important in the trial that the failure to give it substantially impairs the defendant\u2019s defense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Campbell asked the court to instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">In order for you to find the defendant guilty of either count, the government must have proved to you beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Campbell knew the photographs were of minors -i.e., under the age of 18- and that he knew beyond a reasonable doubt that the photographs were of sexually explicit conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">J.A. at 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">Because Campbell\u2019s requested instruction incorrectly stated the law, the district court properly rejected it. Campbell\u2019s version would have required the jury to find that <em>Campbell </em>knew beyond a reasonable doubt that the photographs were of sexually explicit conduct. The correct charge-which the district recited-instructed that the <em>jury </em>must find beyond a reasonable doubt that Campbell knew that the depiction was a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">D. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">Finally, Campbell argues that the district court erred in denying his request for a three-point reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility. A district court\u2019s determination of acceptance of responsibility is a factual finding, and when considering a defendant\u2019s sentence under the guidelines, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Lutz, </em>154 F.3d 581, 589 (6th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Clements, </em>144 F.3d 981, 982 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-16\">Section 3E1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines awards a reduction of two points \u201c[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). An additional point may be deducted if the defendant pleads guilty. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). Because Campbell did not plead guilty, we need only consider whether the district court clearly erred by denying him the \u00a7 3El.l(a) two-point reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-17\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err. Campbell argues that his offense level should have been reduced because he never denied that he possessed or received the images of girls in various states of undress. But he did argue his innocence, claiming that he did not know the images contained sexually explicit conduct. Thus he put the government to its burden of proving all of the essential elements of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>We have held that the \u00a7 3El.l(a) reduction is \u201c \u2018not intended for a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hill, </em>167 F.3d 1055, 1071 (6th Cir.1999) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 2). The district court determined that Campbell did not merit this reduction because he denied his guilt and forced the government to obtain a jury verdict on the elements of the crime. We find no clear error by the district court in denying Campbell this two-point reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">For the all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm Campbell\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-10\">. The statute criminalizes the receipt of child pornography by \u201c[a]ny person\u201d who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">(2) knowingly receives, or distributes any visual depiction that has been mailed, or has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or which contains materials which have been mailed or so shipped or transported, by any means including by computer ... if\u2014 (A) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and (B) such visual depiction is of such conduct;</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b565-22\">.
