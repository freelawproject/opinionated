Morales contends 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), claiming a majority of the Supreme Court feels <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), was incorrectly decided. Morales acknowledges that this contention is foreclosed by circuit precedent, but raises it to preserve it for possible review by the Supreme Court. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>see also United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Morales seeks remand pursuant to Fed. R.Crim. P. 36 for correction of a clerical error in the judgment. The Government concedes that remand is appropriate because the written judgment does not reflect that, at sentencing, the district court orally granted its motion to remit the $100 special assessment. Accordingly, this action is REMANDED for the sole purpose of allowing the district court to correct the judgment to reflect that the $100 special assessment is abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED, REMANDED FOR CORRECTION OF CLERICAL ERROR IN JUDGMENT</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
