Hurley, <em>District </em>Judge) denying the County\u2019s Rule 50 motion to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of plaintiff Regina Canino on her retaliation claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq., </em>and under New York State Human Rights Law, Executive Law \u00a7 290 <em>et seq. </em>The jury rejected Canino\u2019s sexual harassment claim as well as her constructive discharge cause of action under the same statutes; but it awarded her $75,000 on her retaliation claim. The district court found that the evidence was sufficient to support Canino\u2019s retaliation claim. Construing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff as is appropriate in reviewing a Rule 50 motion, <em>Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Ass\u2019n of the City of New York v. City of New York, </em>310 F.3d 43, 50-51 (2d Cir.2002), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-21\">In order for Canino to sustain her retaliation claim after a jury verdict in her favor, she must show (1) that she engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) that the County was aware of her participation in that activity; (3) an adverse employment action; and (4) a causal connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>Gordon v. New York City Bd. of Educ., </em>232 F.3d 111, 116 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Canino and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor, we believe that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the denial to Canino of the right not to work on Sundays one week following her filing of a sexual harassment complaint was both an adverse employment action and was retaliatory. <em>See Wanamaker v. Columbian Rope Co., </em>108 F.3d 462, 466 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201cBecause there are no bright-line rules, courts must pour over each case to determine whether the challenged employment action reaches the level of \u2018adverse.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Richardson v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Corr. Serv., </em>180 F.3d 426, 444 (2d Cir.1999) (allowing proximity of filing of complaint to adverse action to suffice for a showing of a causal connection); <em>Quinn v. Green Tree Credit Corp., </em>159 F.3d 759, 769 (2d Cir.1998) (same); <em>see also Raniola v. Bratton, </em>243 F.3d 610, 625 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201cA plaintiff may establish a Title VII violation even when a retaliatory motive is not the sole cause of the adverse employment action or when there were other objectively valid grounds for [it].\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We have carefully considered all of appellants\u2019 arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
