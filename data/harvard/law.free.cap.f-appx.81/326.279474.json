Paje filed an appeal with the Board claiming that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) violated the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) by retaliating against him for making protected disclosures concerning Paje\u2019s claim to a retirement annuity. The Administrative Judge (AJ) determined that under <em>Francisco v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>295 F.3d 1310 (Fed.Cir.2002), Paje had not demonstrated that he had made a protected disclosure and dismissed Paje\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The AJ noted that in earlier litigation related to benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System, the Board and this court affirmed OPM\u2019s denial of Paje\u2019s application for annuity benefits. The AJ further noted that Paje had been a \u201cparty to three regulation review proceedings all of which ended with the case either being denied or dismissed, and a prior appeal under the Whistleblower Protection Act which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d Finally, the AJ determined that the doctrine of res judicata bars relitigation of issues decided in earlier cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Summary disposition \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir.1994). The Board correctly concluded that Paje did not make a protected disclosure. <em>See Francisco, </em>295 F.3d at 1314. Because we agree with the Board that Paje did not make a disclosure of the type protected by the WPA and that res judicata is applicable, summary disposition is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The Board\u2019s decision is summarily affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-9\"> The AJ noted that Paje\u2019s case was \u201cremarkably similar\u201d to <em>Francisco. </em>We note that Paje was represented before the Board by the same representative, Rizalino S. Cayle, who represented the petitioner in <em>Francisco.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
