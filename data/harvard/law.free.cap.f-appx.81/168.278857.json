We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">The Government contends we lack jurisdiction because Bartlow faded to file a timely notice of appeal. We disagree. <em>Andrade v. Attorney General of California, </em>270 F.3d 743, 752 (9th Cir.2001), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003), permits us to treat a pro se prisoner\u2019s timely motion for an extension of time as \u201cthe functional equivalent of a notice of appeal.\u201d The Government also submits that Bartlow is improperly seeking review of issues barred by the plea agreement and beyond the scope of the certificate of appealability. We conclude, however, that we may review issues that are within the context of Bart-low\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-17\">To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Bartlow must show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>See United States v. Fry, </em>322 F.3d 1198, 1200 (9th Cir.2003). His claim fails on both grounds. The record indicates that Bartlow\u2019s attorney negotiated a plea agreement that substantially reduced Bartlow\u2019s potential term of imprisonment. Moreover, the issues that Bartlow now raises were either argued by counsel or are meritless. In sum, the record indicates that Bartlow\u2019s attorney was competent and that Bartlow benefitted from the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b201-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
