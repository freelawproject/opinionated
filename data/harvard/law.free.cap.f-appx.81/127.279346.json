We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s judgment pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae since the judgment resulted from a discretionary determination. Accordingly, we may not disturb the BIA\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-26\">Because the facts are known to the parties we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-27\">Garcia argues that the IJ erroneously found that her removal would not cause \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to her sons, a finding which resulted in the denial of her application under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). We may not review such a finding. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>of 1996 eliminated judicial review of the BIA\u2019s discretionary decisions regarding cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir.2002) . In <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>the court held that the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d determination is a \u201csubjective, discretionary judgment that has been carved out of our appellate jurisdiction.\u201d 327 F.3d 887, 888 (9th Cir.2003) . Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Garcia failed to prove \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Because meeting the heightened hardship requirement is a necessary element in establishing eligibility for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l), the court cannot disturb the BIA\u2019s judgment absent other serious error, in which case the court exercises jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Garcia has not shown such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">We are not persuaded by Garcia\u2019s argument that the IJ abused her discretion in denying Garcia\u2019s motion for a continuance. The decision whether to grant a continuance at a removal hearing \u201cis in the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned except on a showing of clear abuse.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir.1996). Garcia was afforded ample time-about eight months-to gather evidence to support her application. Instead, she waited to move for a continuance until she appeared in person and did not indicate how long it would take to obtain medical and psychological evaluations of her sons. Moreover, the IJ accepted Garcia\u2019s testimony about her sons\u2019 conditions even without any medical reports. <em>See Administrative Record, </em>at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Nor is the court persuaded that the IJ violated Garcia\u2019s due process right to \u201ca full and fair hearing.\u201d <em>Getachew v. INS, </em>25 F.3d 841, 845 (9th Cir.1994). The court reviews this claim <em>de novo, </em>and will reverse the BIA on due process grounds only if the proceedings were \u201cso fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). In addition, the alien must show prejudice. <em>See Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 965 (9th Cir.2002). The record does not establish that the IJ was biased or prevented Garcia from presenting her case. Rather, Garcia received a full and fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b159-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
