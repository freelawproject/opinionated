See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-24\">Viren Mundra, a native of India, pled guilty by way of a written plea agreement before a magistrate judge to one count of criminal copyright infringement in violation of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a)(1) (2000), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2319(b)(1) (2000). The district court sentenced him to an eighteen-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-25\">On appeal, Mundra\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious issues presented but raising questions as to whether the magistrate judge fully complied with Fed. R. Crim P. 11 and whether the district court correctly sentenced Mundra in accordance with the sentencing guidelines. Mundra was notified by counsel of his right to file a supplemental brief and has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-26\">We find the magistrate judge fully complied with the requirements of Rule 11. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>We further find that the district court correctly adopted the unopposed presentence report and correctly sentenced Mundra within the proper guidelines range. We reject the claims raised in Mundra\u2019s informal brief as unsupported and merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Mundra\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
