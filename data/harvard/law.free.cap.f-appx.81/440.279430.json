The district court departed below the guideline range on the government\u2019s motion based on King\u2019s substantial assistance and imposed a sentence of one month imprisonment for Count Five, a consecutive seven-year sentence for Count Six, and a consecutive twenty-five-year sentence for Count Twenty-one, plus a five-year term of supervised release. The court also ordered restitution of $18,644, to be paid in installments of $100 per month during King\u2019s term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">King\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising as potentially meritorious issues the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines and its imposition of consecutive sentences for the two \u00a7 924(c) convictions, but asserting that in his view there are no meritorious issues for appeal. King has filed a pro se supplemental brief asking that the <em>Anders </em>brief be dismissed, requesting new counsel, and contesting his sentence and the amount of restitution. Finding these claims meritless, we affirm the conviction and sentence. We deny King\u2019s motions to dismiss the <em>Anders </em>brief and for appointment of new counsel. We deny his motion for a <em>Faretta</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-16\">When he entered his guilty plea, King acknowledged that he participated in armed bank robberies on October 15, 2001, and December 28, 2001. We find no error in the calculation of the guideline range for Count Five or the consecutive sentences imposed for the two \u00a7 924(c) convictions. <em>See Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 130, 133 n. 1, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993) (holding that the enhanced sentence for a second or subsequent conviction may be imposed in the same judgment as the sentence for the initial \u00a7 924(c) conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-17\">In his pro se supplemental brief, King argues that the twenty-five-year consecutive sentence for Count Twenty-one is illegal, and thus is plain error, because it is not supported by a second bank robbery conviction. He is mistaken. The current penalty for a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) is a sentence of at least twenty-five years. A conviction under \u00a7 924(c) does not require a conviction for the underlying offense \u201cas long as all the elements of that offense are proved and found beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Crump, </em>120 F.3d 462, 466 (4th Cir.1997). King\u2019s admission satisfied this requirement. King also disputes the amount of restitution imposed by the district court, but did not object to the amount stated in the presentence report. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>We find that the district court did not plainly err in ordering King to make restitution of $18,644.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court has reviewed the record for reversible error and found none. We therefore affirm the conviction and sentence. As previously noted, we deny King\u2019s motions to dismiss the <em>Anders </em>brief, for a <em>Faretta </em>hearing, and for appointment of new counsel. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-12\"><em> Faretta v.
