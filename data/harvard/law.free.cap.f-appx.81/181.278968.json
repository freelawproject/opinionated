Ashcroft, </em>315 F.3d 1201 (9th Cir.2003) (per curiam), <em>as amended by </em>343 F.3d 961, has dealt Robledo-Dominguez\u2019s petition for review a \u201cfatal\u201d blow. <em>See </em>Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 8. In <em>Vasquez-Lopez, </em>we held that \u201can alien who commits to departure in order to avoid [removal] proceedings is [not] entitled to continue accruing \u2018presence\u2019 so as to become eligible for other discretionary relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1205. Because RobledoDominguez\u2019s voluntary departure to Mexico in 1995 therefore cut off his accrual of continuous physical presence in the United States for purposes of cancellation of removal, and because only five years passed between his 1995 return to the United States and the INS\u2019s service of a notice to appear in 2000, Robledo-Dominguez lacks the ten years of continuous physical presence necessary to secure his eligibility for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). Accordingly, his petition must be</p>\n<p id=\"b213-23\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b213-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
