The order is appealable only if a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appeal-ability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Rathburn has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
