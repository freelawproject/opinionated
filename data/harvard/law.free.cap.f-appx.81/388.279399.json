The essence of Johnson\u2019s action is that IRS officials maliciously denied him two promotions that he believes to be mandatory. With respect to his statutory and common law claims, we affirm substantially for the reasons given by the district court. And to the extent that there are claims of a constitutional nature embedded in his complaint, Johnson has failed, even under the liberal pleading standards set forth in <em>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002), to state a valid constitutional claim. <em>See Tiltti v. Weise, </em>155 F.3d 596, 602 (2d Cir.1998). Finally, the district court properly denied Johnson\u2019s motion for a default judgment. We have considered all of appellant\u2019s claims and find them to be meritless. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
