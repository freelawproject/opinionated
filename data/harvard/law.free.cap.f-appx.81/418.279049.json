We review the decision of the IJ when the BIA does not render its own opinion. <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir.2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">Chen, a native and citizen of China, was married in 1985. After the birth of his daughter in 1986, his spouse was fitted with a mandatory IUD and subjected to periodic examinations. He claims that his wife, who became pregnant in early 1988, had a mandatory abortion on March 28, 1988 and was re-fitted with an IUD. When Chen and his wife learned she was pregnant again in November 1988, they left their village to stay with Chen\u2019s mother-in-law until their son was born in August 1989. The children and Chen\u2019s wife remained with her mother until they were discovered in a routine household registration check, whereupon they were brought back to Chen\u2019s village and, according to Chen, his wife was forced to undergo an involuntary tubal ligation. Chen was fined 5,000 RMB <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for failing to observe a five-year spacing requirement in between children.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-17\">When Chen arrived in the United States, he was not admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged him as removable; Chen conceded removability and sought asylum, withholding of removal and voluntary departure. The IJ denied relief, the BIA dismissed the appeal, and Chen filed the Petition for Review before us now. We have jurisdiction pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 242, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-18\">We will uphold the agency\u2019s findings of fact so long as they are supported by substantial evidence on the record. <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272. Under this standard, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination must be upheld unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-20\">Chen contends that he is entitled to asylum as a refugee because he suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>past persecution and because he has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his opposition to the coercive population control program in China. The INA statute was amended to provide that \u201ca person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be ... subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">In denying Chen the relief he sought, the IJ stated that some of the facts set forth above were not supported by corroborating evidence. Chen contends that the decision of the IJ is not supported by substantial evidence, and he attacks in particular what he claims was the IJ\u2019s unreasonable requirement that he provide corroborating evidence of certain facts. He argues that although the IJ found him credible, the IJ denied him asylum because he failed to provide corroborating evidence. Chen also contends that the BIA erred by adopting the IJ\u2019s decision without determining whether it was reasonable for the IJ to require corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Chen\u2019s argument is premised in large part on his belief that the IJ found him to be credible. The IJ did not make an explicit finding as to Chen\u2019s credibility. Chen relies on the IJ\u2019s statement that \u201cI am not saying that the respondent does not have a wife, I am not saying that the respondent does not have two children ...\u201d The above statements by the IJ accepting the irrefutable facts that Chen has a wife and two children do not signify that the IJ found him to be credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">It appears that the IJ, without explicitly questioning the dates of the \u201cforced\u201d abortion, may have considered the timing of the abortion to be improbable. On March 28, 1988 Chen\u2019s wife discovered she was pregnant with her second child at her check-up and was allegedly forced to undergo an abortion. Sometime between this date and November 1988 (when she discovered she was pregnant for an alleged third time), she had a second IUD inserted. But by November 1988 she had become pregnant again, despite the recent abortion and IUD insertion. A.R. at 30-31. The IJ\u2019s recitation of the precise dates suggests his incredulity, since within a six-month period, Chen\u2019s wife underwent a forced abortion and the insertion of an IUD, but nonetheless became pregnant. As the IJ stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">Now, this issue about when did the wife find out that she was pregnant was an area that was subject to some inquiry by the Court and also by the Trial Attorney. For instance it was not to [sic] clear whether the respondent\u2019s wife discovered that she was pregnant on the 28th, which is the date that the allege [sic] abortion was done, or that if she knew, in fact, that she was already pregnant on the 19th and yet, she went to the check up on the 28th, knowing that she was already pregnant. Since we do not have a certificate of the act, well, a medical procedure on that day. It appears that the only thing that the Court has is the testimony of the respondent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alj\">A.R. at 30. (IJ at 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Chen argues that it was unreasonable of the IJ to require corroborating evidence. We have stated that in deciding whether corroborating evidence is necessary, the IJ or the BIA should: (1) identify the facts for which \u201cit is reasonable to expect cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>roboration;\u201d (2) inquire as to whether the applicant has provided information corroborating the relevant facts; and, if s/he has not, (3) analyze whether the applicant adequately explained the failure to do so. <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 554 (3d Cir.2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In two recent opinions, both of which were decided by this court after Chen\u2019s brief was filed, we considered the connection between findings of credibility and the need for corroboration. In <em>Kayembe v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 231 (3d Cir.2003), where we assumed that Kayembe\u2019s testimony was credible (although the IJ had found he was not credible), we remanded to the BIA because its opinion (unlike that of the IJ) said nothing about corroboration, and therefore we were unwilling to read a requirement of corroboration into its opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 238. We further stated that \u201c[t]he BIA in this case has failed even to provide us with clues that would indicate why or how Kayembe failed to meet his burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238. As a result of the BIA\u2019s failure to provide us with those clues, we found it impossible to meaningfully review its decision. This is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Similarly in our later decision in <em>Miah v. Ashcroft, </em>346 F.3d 434 (3d Cir.2003), we held that the BIA failed to properly analyze the issue of corroboration when it neglected to explain the particular aspects of the petitioner\u2019s testimony for which it would have been reasonable to expect corroboration. <em>See id. </em>at 439. That is not the situation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The IJ did not question Chen\u2019s assertion that his wife had an abortion, but noted the failure of Chen to provide an abortion certificate because, as the IJ stated, the certificate was needed to ascertain whether the abortion \u201chappened <em>when </em>[Chen] indicated it happened, between the birth of the first and the second child.\u201d App. at 35 (emphasis added). Chen\u2019s testimony regarding the availability of an abortion certificate was ambiguous. He states that the officials did not issue an abortion certificate at the time of the abortion, that his wife went back to get one some time after the procedure, but did not answer whether or not she ever acquired the certificate because it involved a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue,\u201d which he did not ask about. App. at 135. There may be some merit to Chen\u2019s argument that it was unreasonable of the IJ to require him to produce corroborating evidence of a certificate of abortion when such evidence was not available, but there are other items that were not introduced that support the IJ\u2019s reluctance to accept Chen\u2019s story.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">For example, the IJ pointed to the tubal ligation. The statute identifies \u201cinvoluntary sterilization\u201d as one of the bases for asylum based on a well-founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion. The IJ said the evidence satisfactorily demonstrated that Chen\u2019s wife underwent the tubal ligation, but that it was not clear whether it was involuntary or \u201cbecause the[ ] couple had decided that they ... did not want any[ ]more children.\u201d App. at 35. The IJ also stated that the documents missing from the case were extremely important for his final analysis. The IJ explained that \u201cthat creates a major doubt in [his] mind ... as to the actual reasons why the tubal ligation did happen when it happened. Especially, since we are dealing with children that were born in 1989 and 1986.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is clear that the IJ believed that Chen had not satisfactorily shown that the tubal ligation was involuntary. The IJ examined the certificate of tubal ligation that Chen produced, and he accepted the fact that the certificate verifies that Chen\u2019s wife has undergone a tubal ligation. However, the IJ noted that the certificate referred to Fuzhou No. 1 Hospi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>tal but pointed out that Chen \u201cadmitted clearly that this was not the hospital where his wife underwent the operation.\u201d The IJ stated, \u201cI am just saying that on the facts that I have before me, there is no connection between the actions taken by the government, if any, to force her to undergo the tubal ligation. There is a theory here that could be interpreted as one that shows that that operation was done voluntarily and since, that has not been established to the satisfaction of the Court, what I mean by that, is that he has not been disapproved to the satisfaction of the Court, I find that the respondent has not met his burden of establishing the necessary elements of his claim.\u201d App. at 36-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The IJ also noted that corroborating evidence was missing of \u201c[t]he fine or the alleged fine that the family unit received for 5,000 RMB.\u201d App. at 35. Thus, notwithstanding Chen\u2019s assumption that the IJ found him credible, the IJ\u2019s references to his \u201cdoubt\u201d as to the reasons for Chen\u2019s wife\u2019s tubal ligation and the IJ\u2019s comments with regard to the fine suggest that the IJ had reservations about Chen\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The IJ was also skeptical of Chen\u2019s contention that he was persecuted in the past and had a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his opposition to China\u2019s population control measures. Chen contends that he articulated his resentment towards the family planning policies to fellow villagers at various times and states that he presented his views in 1997 to a journalist who was doing a story on Chen\u2019s village as the model village for local family planning policy. He states that as a result of this incident, he was called into the family planning office and warned to keep his feelings quiet. A heated argument between Chen and the officials erupted, and Chen alleges he was hit on the head with a chair by an official because he would not leave when directed to do so. The IJ concluded that because there is no record or report of the interview given by Chen to the local reporter, \u201cthe interview either never happened or ... the importance that the authorities gave to that interview did not amount to to [sic] much.\u201d App. at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The IJ accepted that Chen expressed \u201csome ideas of opposition to the ... birth control policy of his country,\u201d but the IJ did not find \u201cthat the necessary link in terms of any actions or official actions taken against him were based on those alleged opinions or expressions of his opinion about this particular issue.\u201d App. at 35-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">We do not read the IJ\u2019s decision to hold that Chen\u2019s failure to provide corroborating evidence <em>per se </em>was the basis for the denial of asylum. Instead, the failure to provide factual support for his position provided the basis for the IJ\u2019s implicit finding that Chen lacked credibility. We cannot fault the IJ for requiring Chen to produce evidence to support his claim that he is a refugee. The statute that gives the Attorney General the authority to grant an asylum petition clearly provides that the persecution must be \u201con account of\u2019 a specific ground provided in the statute. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Chen has not shown that he was persecuted on account of his resistance to a coercive population control. Although we may assume that he was called to the family planning clinic, the IJ noted \u201cthe action taken against him ... which would have been so probative of his opinion, did not appear to the Court to be serious enough.\u201d App. at 36. While there was a physical confrontation at the end of that interview, there is no evidence that Chen was assaulted because of his opinion. Instead, it appears that the physical contact resulted from Chen\u2019s failure to leave the office when directed. Similarly, Chen has not produced evidence that his inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>view with the reporter was known to the relevant Chinese authorities who could have taken repressive action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">It is true that in <em>Abdulai, Kayembe </em>and <em>Miah </em>we remanded because we were unconvinced by the IJ or BIA\u2019s expressed need for corroboration. Unlike those cases, here, the IJ albeit somewhat less specific than desirable, identified the items that required corroboration. All three of our prior cases recognized that the BIA [or the IJ] may require applicants \u201cto supply corroborating evidence in order to meet their burden of proof.\u201d <em>Abdulai, </em>239 F.3d at 554; <em>Kayembe, </em>334 F.3d at 238, and <em>Miah, </em>346 F.3d at 439. It was not unreasonable in this case for the IJ to require some corroboration of at least some of Chen\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">It is not insignificant to the issue whether Chen has a well-founded fear of future persecution that his wife and children are still in China, he sends money for their support, and the children \u201cwho are 10 and almost 14 years of age are attending school.\u201d App. at 33. Admittedly, the IJ\u2019s opinion is somewhat difficult to follow, probably in part because it was delivered orally. We cannot, and should not, remand merely because he failed to make explicit his lack of credibility finding. In short, we find no basis to disagree with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Chen \u201chas not met his burden of establishing the necessary elements of his claim.\u201d App. at 37. Thus, there is a basis in the record to support the IJ\u2019s decision. There is enough in the record from which we can decide this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">For the reasons set forth above, we will deny Chen\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">CHERTOFF, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<author id=\"b455-10\">CHERTOFF, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">This Court has emphatically reiterated that although we review a decision of the Immigration Judge (IJ) or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) under a deferential standard, there must be some explanation for us to review. <em>See Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 555 (3d Cir.2001). In particular, we have held that the IJ or BIA \u201cshould give specific reasons for [the] determination that a witness is not credible.\u201d <em>Balasubramanrim v. INS, </em>143 F.3d 157, 162 (3d Cir.1998). In the absence of a credibility finding, we assume credibility, and decide whether the IJ or BIA decision is supported by substantial evidence in light of that assumption. <em>Kayembe v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 231, 235 (3d Cir.2003). Also, while the IJ or BIA may require corroboration of the applicant\u2019s account, the decisionmaker must (1) identify the facts for which corroboration reasonably may be expected; (2) explain whether the applicant has furnished corroboration for those facts, and (3) address whether \u201c \u2018the applicant has adequately explained his or her failure to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miah v. Ashcroft, </em>346 F.3d 434, 439 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting Abdulai). In essence, then, we interpret the law to require identification of the essential facts of the claim, analysis of the evidence presented, assessment of the credibility of the applicant, and consideration of the need for specific corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">Here, despite heroic efforts by the majority to discern a coherent analysis in the oral opinion of the IJ, that oral opinion does not come close to meeting these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">At the outset, the IJ\u2019s view of the credibility of applicant Chen is a mystery. The majority reads the IJ\u2019s decision as an \u201cimplicit finding\u201d that Chen lacked credibility based on a \u201cfailure to provide factual support.\u201d Majority Op. at 9. But the Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>ment itself-defending the decision in this Court-proceeds on the opposite assumption that the IJ found Chen to be credible. Appellee Br. at 18. This matters, of course, because the determination of credibility affects the corroboration analysis. <em>Miah, </em>346 F.3d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Worse yet, if the IJ did find a lack of credibility based on a \u201cfailure to provide factual support,\u201d that itself is an error. As we observed in <em>Abdulai </em>the BIA has ruled that an adverse credibility determination cannot be based on a \u201cfailure of proof,\u201d but \u201cis more appropriately based on inconsistent statements, contradictory evidence, and inherently improbable testimony.\u201d 239 F.3d at 551 n. 6 (quoting <em>In re S-M-J-, </em>Interim Decision 3303 (BIA 1997), <em>available at </em>1997 WL 80984). Nothing in the IJ\u2019s opinion ties any of these characteristics to a finding on credibility. Without articulated reasons, this Court cannot determine whether the \u201creasons ... bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.\u201d <em>Balasubramanrim, </em>143 F.3d at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Turning to corroboration, the IJ found flaws in each of the three grounds invoked by Chen\u2019s application. Chen claimed refugee status because (1) his wife was allegedly forced to abort a pregnancy; (2) she was later involuntarily sterilized; and (3) he purportedly expressed opposition to China\u2019s forcible population control measures. Under the statute, any of these claims, if true, would establish refugee status that would entitle the applicant to be considered for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">I agree with the majority that the IJ adequately explained his rejection of the third claim. Not so as to the first and second claims, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Regarding the allegedly forced abortion, the IJ questioned the lack of documentary support for the timing of the abortion. As the majority reads the IJ\u2019s opinion, \u201c[i]t <em>appears </em>that the IJ, without explicitly questioning the dates of the \u2018forced\u2019 abortion, <em>may have considered </em>the timing of the abortion to be improbable.... The IJ\u2019s recitation of the precise dates <em>suggests </em>his incredulity....\u201d Majority op. at 5 (emphasis added). I note in passing that the use of words like \u201cit appears,\u201d \u201cmay have considered\u201d and \u201csuggests his incredulity\u201d demonstrates that the majority was obliged to divine the IJ\u2019s findings because they were never made explicit. At any rate, what is totally absent from the IJ\u2019s opinion is any explanation of why the timing of the abortion is improbable, what difference the timing makes, and how documentation of the date of the abortion would shed light on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">The IJ suggests that the timing question is whether Chen\u2019s wife only discovered that she was pregnant on the date the abortion was done, or whether she thought she was pregnant before she went to the hospital for a check up on that day. After posing that conundrum, the IJ concludes: \u201cSince we do not have a certificate of the act, well, a medical procedure on that day ... [i]t appears that the only thing that the Court has is the testimony of the respondent.\u201d A.R. at 30. Why is the date when Chen\u2019s wife first suspected she was pregnant probative of the mandatory or voluntary nature of the abortion? I can guess-but the IJ never says. More important, the IJ does not explain why a certificate showing the date of the abortion would shed any light on when Chen\u2019s wife first thought she might be pregnant. Put in the language of <em>Abdulai </em>why would it be \u201creasonable to expect [Chen] to corroborate\u201d his wife\u2019s subjective awareness of her pregnancy with a certificate memorializing the date of the abortion? 239 F.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">That is not the end of the immigration authorities\u2019 analytical failures on this point. As explained in <em>Abdulai </em>the U or BIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>were also supposed to address whether Chen adequately explained his failure to furnish this supposedly corroborative abortion certificate. Before the BIA, Chen submitted a State Department report stating that Chinese authorities do not issue abortion certificates for involuntary abortions. A.R. at <em>7.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If so, that would seem a pretty persuasive reason why no such certificate could be provided to corroborate an involuntary abortion. Since this State Department report was not presented until the appeal to the BIA, the IJ can be excused for not addressing this. But the BIA-which affirmed without opinion-cannot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The IJ\u2019s discussion of the forced tubal hgation-sterilization-is even more opaque. As the majority notes, the IJ found documentary corroboration that Chen\u2019s wife underwent the sterilization, but said he could not determine whether it was involuntary or not. Of course, Chen testified that it was forced. And, significantly, the IJ acknowledged that the tubal ligation procedure was corroborated with documents. A.R. at 32, 35. But the IJ continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">[T]hat is when the other documents that are missing ... from this case become extremely important for my final analysis. The fine or the alleged fine that the family unit received for 5,000 RMB and the certificate of abortion or the statement indicating that the abortion had, in fact, happened when the respondent indicated it happened, between the birth of the first and the second child, [sic] For some reason are not here. And, that creates a major doubt in the mind of the Court as to the actual reasons why the tubal ligation did happen when it happened. Especially, since we are dealing with children that were born in 1989 and 1986.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">A.R. at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">Why does the absence of these documents about the abortion or the fine create a doubt about the involuntariness of the tubal ligation? If the (nonexistent) abortion certificate evidenced that the forced abortion occurred in 1988, how would that be probative of the voluntariness of the 1989 sterilization? What is the significance of the fine for all this? Does the payment of a fine make it more or less likely that the sterilization was compelled? Again, I could speculate about these matters, but that is precisely what our cases teach that a reviewing court should not do. The IJ has the obligation to explain why facts-such as the date of the abortion-are significant, and what corroboration can reasonably be expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">Perhaps the applicant in this case cannot meet his burden of proof and the IJ could explain why. But the IJ has not. I appreciate the workload carried by the Immigration Judges, and recognize that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>unreasonable to insist upon polished or even written opinions. But the deference which we owe to the administrative judges requires that they express findings and judgments to which we can defer. If we are obliged to reconstruct their decisions in order to affirm them, the result is not deference to those decisions, but a transfer of decisional authority to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">I would remand this case to the BIA for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-15\">. Neither party has provided any information on the comparable United States currency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\">. Chen referred the BIA to page 24 of the 1998 State Department Report \"China: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions,\u201d which provides: \"The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General are unaware of any so-called 'abortion certificates,\u2019 which often are presented as part of asylum applications as evidence of a forced abortion.
