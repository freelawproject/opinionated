A review of the district court\u2019s docket sheet entries does not reflect that a final judgment has been entered. Therefore, we conclude that the appeal is premature and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-24\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b357-25\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">(1) SeaChange\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"ACD\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
