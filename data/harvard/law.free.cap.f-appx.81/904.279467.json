The district court rejected Stewart\u2019s argument that the Federal Arbitration Act was \u201creverse preempted\u201d by the MeCarran-Ferguson Act and held that Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 695B.181 could not be applied to invalidate the arbitration agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">As the party who initially requested arbitration, Stewart has waived the right to challenge the enforceability of the arbitration provision pursuant to \u00a7 695B.181.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Nghiem v. NEC Elec., Inc., </em>25 F.3d 1437, 1440 (9th Cir.1994) (reasoning that the party\u2019s \u201cvoluntary initiation of arbitration can be interpreted as waiver of any objection he may have had over the authority of the arbitrator\u201d). Moreover, even if Stewart is not deemed to be the party who initiated arbitration, it is undisputed that, in 1999, she filed what she herself characterizes as a \u201cstrenuous opposition\u201d to appellees\u2019 motion to have her case referred to arbitration. It is also undisputed that, in opposing arbitration, Stewart did not assert that \u00a7 695B.181 permitted or required her complaint to be adjudicated in district court, notwithstanding the policy\u2019s arbitration provision. Lastly, it is not disputed that Stewart first invoked \u00a7 695B.181 <em>after </em>participating fully in the arbitration and losing. She first made the argument in opposition to appellees\u2019 motion to confirm the arbitration award. These circumstances further support our conclusion that Stewart waived her right to invoke \u00a7 695B.181.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">We therefore do not reach the McCarran-Ferguson Act preemption issue. We decline to address Stewart\u2019s equitable estoppel argument because she did not raise it below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Steam Press Holdings, Inc. v. Haw. Teamsters &amp; Allied Workers Union, Local 996, </em>302 F.3d 998, 1005 (9th Cir.2002) (stating the general rule that this court \u201cwill not consider arguments on appeal that were not properly raised at the lower court level\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1232, 123 S.Ct. 1354, 155 L.Ed.2d 196 (2003); <em>A-1 Ambulance Serv., Inc. v. County of Monterey, </em>90 F.3d 333, 338 (9th Cir.1996) (stating that an argument \u201cmust have been raised sufficiently for the trial court to rule on it\u201d in order to be considered on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">The order of the district court confirming the arbitration award is</p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b937-6\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-7\">. Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 695B.181 permits health care contracts to provide for binding arbitration, but requires that such arbitration provisions meet certain conditions specified in the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b937-8\">. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recite them here except as necessary to aid in understanding this disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b937-16\">. After examining the record, we reject Stewart\u2019s contention that she raised the issue below. Moreover, her equitable estoppel claim would fail because she was not ignorant of the binding arbitration provision, and there is no evidence that she relied to her detriment on conduct by Rocky Mountain. <em>See NGA </em># 2 <em>Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Rains, </em>113 Nev. 1151, 946 P.2d 163, 169 (1997) (stating the elements of equitable estoppel).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
