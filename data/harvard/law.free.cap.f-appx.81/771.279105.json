Layton cannot appeal these orders unless a circuit judge or justice issues a certificate of appealability, and a certificate of appealability will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>issue absent a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A habeas petitioner meets this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 534 U.S. 941 (2001). As to two of the issues Layton presents - whether the trial court adequately advised Layton regarding the dangers of self-representation, and whether the trial court erred in accepting Layton\u2019s attorney\u2019s request that he be allowed not to directly examine Layton, because of his belief that Layton planned to perjure himself on the stand - Judge Williams and Judge Traxler conclude that Layton has made the required showing. Accordingly, we grant a certificate of appealability as to these issues. Having independently reviewed the record, however, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying habeas relief as to these issues, and accordingly affirm its judgment. As to the remaining issues, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
