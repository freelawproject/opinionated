The district court sentenced Chavez-Guerrero to eighteen months of im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>prisonment and three years of supervised release. No conditions of supervised release were mentioned during the oral pronouncement of sentence. The court\u2019s judgment, however, included the following condition for Chavez-Guerrero\u2019s supervised release: \u201cThe defendant shall not possess a firearm, destructive device, or any other dangerous weapon during the supervised release.\u201d On appeal, Chavez-Guerrero argues that the condition that he not possess \u201cany dangerous weapon\u201d during his supervised release must be stricken from the judgment because it conflicts with the absence of conditions during the oral pronouncement of sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">For the reasons outlined in <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, 352 </em>F.3d. 934, No. 03-40055, 2003 WL 22853762 (5th Cir. filed Dec. 3, 2003), we find that the district court\u2019s omission of the dangerous weapon prohibition during the oral pronouncement of sentence did not create a conflict with the sentence set forth in the judgment. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b857-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-6\">. Chavez-Guerrero concedes that the judgment's prohibition on his possession of a firearm or destructive device did not conflict with the oral sentence because, under federal law, it is a crime for a convicted felon to possess either type of device. <em>See United States v. Asuncion-Pimental, </em>290 F.3d 91, 94-95 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
