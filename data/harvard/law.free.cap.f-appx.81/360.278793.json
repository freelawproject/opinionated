Tortora, </em>922 F.2d 880 (1st Cir.1990). The appellants essentially argue that since the government\u2019s case rested upon hearsay, it failed to prove the need for detention by a preponderance of the evidence. However, the rules of admissibility for criminal trials do not apply to detention hearings. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f); <em>United States v. Acevedo-Ramos, 755 </em>F.2d 203 (1st Cir.1985). More importantly, the appellants\u2019 indictments sufficed to trigger a rebuttable presumption in favor of detention. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e); <em>United States v. Vargas, </em>804 F.2d 157 (1st Cir.1986). As the district court ruled, the appellants failed to satisfy their burden of production by presenting some evidence that they do not endanger the community. Finally, even if they had discharged their burden, the weight of the incriminating evidence is just one factor in the analysis. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g); <em>United States v. Palmer-Contreras, 835 </em>F.2d 15 (1st Cir.1987). The appellants are charged with serious crimes involving large amounts of drugs, and the record shows that they have the contacts and resources to flee.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-23\"><em>Affirmed. </em>Loe.
