Ca\u00f1izares\u2019 complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Ca\u00f1izares opposes, moves for sanctions, and submits a \u201csupplemental brief.\u201d The United States opposes the motion for sanctions. Ca\u00f1izares replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-20\">Ca\u00f1izares filed a complaint with the Court of Federal Claims seeking review of a Social Security Administration (SSA) decision, dismissal of certain SSA employees for negligence, and damages. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed Ca\u00f1izares\u2019 complaint for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that it does not have jurisdiction over tort claims or SSA decisions. Ca\u00f1izares appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-22\">The United States argues that the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 judgment should be summarily affirmed. We agree. Summary disposition of a ease \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir.1994). In the present case, it is clear that summary disposition is warranted. Ca\u00f1izares\u2019 complaint, grounded in tort law and Social Security law, clearly is not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1) (Court of Federal Claims has \u201cjurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages not sounding in tort\u201d); <em>Marcus v. United States, </em>909 F.2d 1470, 1471 (Fed.Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-23\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b345-24\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b345-25\">(1) The United States\u2019 motion for summary affirmance is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-26\">(2) Ca\u00f1izares\u2019 motion for sanctions is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-27\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
