(\u201cCostco\u201d) appeals a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff Bradley Cohn, as well as two post-trial awards of attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-17\">A. <em>The Jury Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-18\">The jury\u2019s award was not excessive as a matter of law. California Civil Code section 3333 permits compensation for \u201call the detriment proximately caused\u201d by employment discrimination (among other things), and under this provision \u201cCalifornia courts are authorized to award to a victim of employment discrimination all damages necessary to make the victim whole.\u201d <em>Cloud v. Casey, </em>76 Cal.App.4th 895, 909, 90 Cal.Rptr.2d 757 (1999). California does not adhere to the so-called \u201cpost-resignation rule,\u201d which might otherwise cut off Cohn\u2019s damages after a voluntary resignation. <em>See id. </em>The jury could have concluded that Costco\u2019s failure to engage in the interactive process directly caused damages to Cohn that extended beyond the date of any offer of reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>accommodation as well as beyond the date of Cohn\u2019s voluntary resignation. Under California law, a full award of damages for such injury is not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">The fact that Costco may have provided a temporary \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d does not alter this conclusion. Counsel represented at oral argument that the jury was never instructed that a temporary offer of accommodation does not meet the obligation of providing a reasonable accommodation. <em>Cf. Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, </em>85 Cal.App.4th 245, 264, 102 Cal. Rptr.2d 55 (2000) (\u201cA temporary position is not ... a reasonable accommodation.\u201d); <em>Criado v. IBM Corp., </em>145 F.3d 437, 444-45 (1st Cir.1998) (allowing a disabled employee a one-month leave of absence when the employee requested a longer leave period did not absolve the employer of its duty to accommodate); <em>see also McAlindin v. County of San Diego, </em>192 F.3d 1226, 1237 (9th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Criado </em>for proposition that the duty to reasonably accommodate is a \u201c \u2018continuing\u2019 duty that is \u2018not exhausted by one effort\u2019 \u201d). The jury could reasonably have thought that Costco\u2019s offer of a temporary accommodation did not terminate its obligation to participate in the interactive process precisely because it was <em>temporary </em>-the offer itself, in explicitly providing for reassessment after eight weeks, contemplated that the interactive process would continue. The jury thus could have awarded damages for Cohn\u2019s resultant loss, subtracting some amount to represent the wages he could have earned through mitigation-i.e. through acceptance of Costco\u2019s offer of temporary accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Under the deferential standards of review we employ under these circumstances, <em>see Freund v. Nycomed Amersham, </em>347 F.3d 752, 771 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Pavao v. Pagay, </em>307 F.3d 915, 918 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Los Angeles Police Protective League v. Gates, </em>995 F.2d 1469, 1477 (9th Cir.1993), we cannot conclude that the jury\u2019s award was excessive or otherwise improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">B. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">We also uphold the awards of attorney\u2019s fees. An award of attorney\u2019s fees made pursuant to state law is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., </em>317 F.3d 1097, 1102 (9th Cir.2003). We do not find that the district court abused its discretion in finding that all of Cohn\u2019s claims were related and that his attorneys\u2019 hours were reasonably expended. All of Cohn\u2019s claims arose from the series of events that took place when he tried to return to work and obtain an accommodation for his disability. Cohn\u2019s attorneys pursued all reasonable claims that arose from this series of events, and all of the claims were strongly interrelated. <em>Cf. Entm\u2019t Research Group v. Genesis Creative Group, Inc., </em>122 F.3d 1211, 1230 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201cIt is well-established law that a party entitled to attorney\u2019s fees as a prevailing party on a particular claim, but not on other claims in the same lawsuit, can only recover attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending against that one claim or any \u2018related claims.\u2019 \u201d). Cohn\u2019s various claims were not \u201cdistinctly different claims for relief that are based on different facts and legal theories.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983); <em>see also Greene v. Dillingham Constr. N.A., Inc., </em>101 Cal.App.4th 418, 424, 124 Cal.Rptr.2d 250 (2002). Therefore, we affirm the awards of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1019-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
