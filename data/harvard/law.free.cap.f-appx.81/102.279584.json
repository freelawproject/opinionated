The SSA signed by the Gannons explicitly incorporates the 2/90 Report. The district court correctly determined that, because the Gannons entered into a superseding agreement incorporating the 2/90 Report, they may nob-ten years later-challenge the FSA\u2019s failure to use an earlier report.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-20\">The FSA did not abuse its discretion by correcting the SAA\u2019s expiration date and the stated market value of the secured property pursuant to 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 780.11, which explicitly authorizes the agency to \u201ccorrect all errors in entering data on program contracts, loan agreements, and other program documents and the results of the computations or calculations made pursuant to the contract or agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-21\">Following the Seventh and Eighth Circuits, we have held that recapture is due upon expiration of the SAA. <em>Pauly v. USDA, </em>348 F.3d 1143 (9th Cir.2003). The FSA correctly determined that the Gannons owed recapture when their SAA expired. The FSA also correctly calculated that, pursuant to the formula stated in the SAA, the Gannons owe recapture equal to 50% of the appreciation of the secured property.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-22\">In light of our decision, we need not address the Gannons\u2019s recoupment argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b134-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
