Even though Local 4 was not among the movants, the rationale for dismissal as to the International and the District Council applied in the same way to the Local, so there was no error in granting judgment in favor of the Local as well. As for the defamation complaint, regardless of whether it was correctly deemed to have been preempted, appellant did not submit cognizable evidence demonstrating the existence of a genuine issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-18\">Judge Canby concurs in the judgment for the reasons stated by the magistrate judge in his order granting summary judgment. Because these reasons apply equally to the claims against Local 4, there was no error in entering judgment in favor of Local 4 as well as the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-21\">. <em>Cf.
