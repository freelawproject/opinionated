We dismiss in part, and deny in part, the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Bustos-Hernandez failed to establish extreme hardship. <em>See Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1270 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">We retain jurisdiction to consider Bustos-Hernandez\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with the denial of his application for suspension of deportation, and review de novo, <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-19\">Bustos-Hernandez contends that his counsel failed to raise certain issues concerning extreme hardship before the IJ. Contrary to Bustos-Hernandez\u2019s contention, his counsel did raise these issues and his counsel\u2019s performance was not so inadequate as to affect the outcome of the proceeding. <em>See Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.1999). Accordingly, Bustos-Hernandez failed to show that he was prejudiced, and his ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b251-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
