Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 888, 891-92 (9th Cir.2002). The BIA correctly ruled that Kumar received proper notice of his removal hearing through his counsel, <em>see Garcia v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir.2000), and that he was not in custody at the time of the hearing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). Nothing in the record before us compels a contrary result. <em>See Celis-Castellano, </em>298 F.3d at 891-92; <em>Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052-53 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The BIA also denied Kumar\u2019s motion to reopen on the following grounds: (1) Kumar failed to establish that he received ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to his removal hearing; and (2) Kumar failed to demonstrate that his asylum application was based on newly discovered evidence of changed country conditions that could not have been presented at the hearing. Although the BIA asserted that Kumar \u201craise[d] no arguments on appeal which were not addressed by the Immigration Judge,\u201d the IJ in fact never heard nor ruled on these two grounds for reopening Kumar\u2019s removal proceedings and thus did not develop any record on these issues. Indeed, the IJ\u2019s decision is silent as to these additional potential grounds for relief. Nor did the INS address them in its briefs to the BIA and to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">Accordingly, the BIA lacked jurisdiction to deny Kumar\u2019s motion on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel and changed country circumstances, as those issues were not properly before it. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.1(b)(3), 1003.1(d)(1), 1003.3(a)(1), 1003.3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">The petition therefore is DENIED in part, GRANTED in part, <em>see Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964-66 (9th Cir.2002), and REMANDED to the BIA with instructions to remand to the Immigration Court in Los Angeles for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
