Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b205-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-16\">Anthony Sims entered a conditional guilty plea to charges of possession with the intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained through a search warrant. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-17\">The district court correctly found probable cause for the search based on Agent Hart\u2019s affidavit. The affidavit supported the court\u2019s ruling as it contained information that: (1) Dusek sold cocaine to the confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) on three separate \u201ccontrolled\u201d occasions; (2) Dusek made plans with the Cl to rob his \u201csupplier\u201d in conversations monitored by the SPD; (3) the Cl pointed out the apartment in question while under surveillance; (4) Dusek was reliable because he made statements against his penal interest; and (5) the information gleaned through the stop of Sheena Best corroborated Dusek\u2019s statement that his supplier \u201cSims\u201d resided in the apartment they searched. This information was more than sufficient to support the district court\u2019s determination that probable cause to search the apartment existed under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983); <em>United States v. Angulo-Lopez, </em>791 F.2d 1394, 1396 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-18\">Although the government acknowledged that paragraphs 5 and 6 of Agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Hart\u2019s affidavit contained some misinformation, the district court disregarded paragraph 5 in determining probable cause and held that paragraph 6 was not an important aspect of its determination. Because none of the misinformation was necessary to the district court\u2019s finding probable cause, Sims was not entitled to a <em>Franks </em>hearing. <em>See Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667, (1978); <em>United States v. Lefkowitz, </em>618 F.2d 1313, 1317 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b205-13\"> This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
