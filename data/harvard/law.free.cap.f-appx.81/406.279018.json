Eyler appeals from an order entered in the District Court affirming the decision of the Commissioner of Social Security denying Eyler\u2019s application for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-433. The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and we have jurisdiction on appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Because we write solely for the benefit of the parties, we recount the facts and the procedural background of this case only as they are relevant to the following discussion. In 1997, Eyler applied for disability insurance benefits on the basis that he had been unable to work since November 15, 1996 due to physical problems involving his back, high blood pressure, diabetes, pancreatitis, a seizure disorder and deafness in his right ear. After reviewing the medical evidence, physicians acting on behalf of the Commissioner concluded that Eyler had the capacity to work. Eyler\u2019s application for benefits was initially denied and was again denied on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">An Administrative Law Judge thereafter conducted a hearing on Eyler\u2019s application at which she heard testimony from Eyler, his wife, a medical expert and a vocational expert. The ALJ subsequently concluded that Eyler\u2019s condition did not meet the standard for disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">After exhausting his administrative remedies, Eyler filed an action against the Commissioner in the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The case was referred to an United States Magistrate Judge who recommended that the Commissioner\u2019s decision be affirmed. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, overruling Eyler\u2019s objections. Eyler timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">We have previously set forth our standard of review in cases involving an appeal from the denial of disability benefits. We have instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-13\">The role of this Court is identical to that of the District Court, namely to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The Court is bound by the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Substantial evidence has been defined as \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-14\"><em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Ventura v. Shalala, </em>55 F.3d 900, 901 (3d Cir.1995)) (certain citations omitted). In making this determination, \u201cwe are not permitted to weigh the evidence or substitute our own conclusions for that of the fact-finder.\u201d <em>Burns v. Barnhart, </em>312 F.3d 113, 118 (3d Cir.2002) (citing <em>Williams v. Sullivan, </em>970 F.2d 1178, 1182 (3d Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">In order to qualify for disability benefits, a person must be disabled as that term is defined by the Social Security Act and accompanying regulations. <em>Burns, </em>312 F.3d at 118. Disability is defined under the Act as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The ALJ, in evaluating Eyler\u2019s application for benefits, applied the familiar five-step analysis, determining that, at steps one through three, Eyler was not currently employed, and that his back disorder, hypertension, diabetes, and pancreatitis were severe impairments, but that they did not meet or equal any of the impairments listed in Appendix 1, Subpart P of Part 404 (\u201cListing of Impairments\u201d). 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 416.920(d), 404.1520(d). The ALJ moved on to step four and determined that, while Eyler did not retain the residual functional capacity to perform his past work, Eyler did retain the residual functional capacity to perform the requirements of sedentary work. Finally, at step five, the ALJ consulted a vocational expert. The ALJ asked the vocational expert a hypothetical question which took into account all of Eyler\u2019s impairments that were supported by objective medical evidence. The vocational expert testified that a person with impairments such as Eyler\u2019s retained the ability to engage in a significant number of simple sedentary and light jobs on a nationwide level. The ALJ concluded that Eyler was not disabled and denied benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Eyler\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that the ALJ erred in not giving controlling evidentiary weight to the testimony and opinion of her treating physician. Eyler argues that the ALJ\u2019s decision not to credit his treating physician\u2019s opinions was not based on objective, competent medical evidence. A treating physician\u2019s findings and opinions are, generally, given great weight. <em>Frankenfield v. Bowen, </em>861 F.2d 405, 408 (3d Cir.1988) (citing <em>Rossi v. Califano, </em>602 F.2d 55, 57 (3d Cir.1979)). However, \u201cthe medical judgment of the treating physician can be rejected on the basis of contradictory evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If substantial evidence in the record supports a conclusion that is contrary to that expressed by the treating physician, the ALJ may reject the treating physician\u2019s findings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Here, the ALJ properly evaluated the medical opinions in the record. In fact, the opinions Eyler relies on, as has been argued by the Commissioner, are opinions that are not germane to the nature and/or severity of his impairments. Instead, he calls our attention to the report and opinion of Dr. Sicilia and Dr. Eder. Dr. Sicilia\u2019s opinion was that Eyler was \u201cdisabled\u201d and Dr. Eder noted his belief that Eyler was unable to work in a \u201cmeaningful way.\u201d (App. 444 and 454)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court noted, \u201ca treating physician\u2019s opinion with respect to whether or not a plaintiff is disabled from employment is not entitled to any special deference. The responsibility of determining whether the plaintiff is disabled for purposes of receiving DIB lies with the ALJ.\u201d (App.4). We agree. Neither Dr. Sicilia\u2019s nor Dr. Eder\u2019s opinions concern any medical diagnosis. Instead, these opinions, in reality, reflect a legal conclusion neither physician was competent to make. We agree with the District Court that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Eyler\u2019s second argument on appeal is that the District Court improperly relied on the opinion of the vocational expert because that opinion did not take into consideration the effects Eyler\u2019s medication would have on his ability to work. This argument is without merit. As the District Court found, the hypothetical that the ALJ presented to the vocational expert required that the vocational expert assume a hypothetical individual who is \u201c[a]f-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>feet[ed] by ... medication.\u201d (App.5). Further, that hypothetical individual was affected by limitations that included the effects of Eyler\u2019s medication, <em>e.g. </em>fatigue, an inability to stand for long periods of time, occasional concentration problems. We agree with the District Court that this hypothetical \u201c \u2018fairly set[s] forth every credible limitation established by the physical evidence.\u2019 \u201d (App.4) (quoting <em>Plummer, </em>186 F.3d at 431).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Finally, Eyler argues that the ALJ failed to take account of his subjective symptoms, including pain, in determining that he could still perform the full range of light work. The ALJ determined that Eyler had a discernible medical condition that could cause his pain, but that his statements concerning his pain and its impact on his ability to work were not entirely credible in light of the entire record.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Allegations of pain and other subjective symptoms must be supported by objective medical evidence. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529. Once an ALJ concludes that a medical impairment that could reasonably cause the alleged symptoms exists, he or she must evaluate the intensity and persistence of the pain or symptom, and the extent to which it affects the individual\u2019s ability to work. This obviously requires the ALJ to determine the extent to which a claimant is accurately stating the degree of pain or the extent to which he or she is disabled by it. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Here, the ALJ concluded that Eyler had a discernible medical condition that could reasonably cause the pain of which he complained. However, although the ALJ determined that his testimony was \u201cgenerally credible,\u201d the ALJ thought that Eyler\u2019s testimony about the extent of his pain was exaggerated. (App.26) The ALJ noted that the record also contained testimony of one physician\u2019s concern that Eyler was engaging in \u201cdrug seeking behavior.\u201d (App.18) The ALJ determined that Eyler could perform light duty work despite his complaints of incapacitating pain. That ruling is clearly supported by substantial evidence in this record. The ALJ cited specific instances where Eyler\u2019s complaints about pain and other subjective symptoms were inconsistent with: 1) the objective medical evidence of record; 2) Eyler\u2019s testimony as to his rehabilitation and medication regimen; and 3) Eyler\u2019s own description of his daily activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">In conclusion, we are satisfied that the ALJ undertook a comprehensive examination of the evidentiary record and that substantial evidence in the record supports both her and the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\">.
