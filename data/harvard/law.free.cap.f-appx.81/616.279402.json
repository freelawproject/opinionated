The district court sentenced Wallette to \u201ca total of 480 months\" imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing for reversal that the district court erred in denying a motion to suppress, and that Wallette received ineffective assistance of counsel. In his pro se supplemental brief, Wallette argues additionally that his sentence violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction under sections 922(g)(1) and 924(e), and that he was misled by the court\u2019s statement that he could receive a 50% credit for good behavior. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">We conclude the arguments concerning the motion to suppress are unavailing because Wallette did not move to suppress until after the deadline for doing so had passed, and he did not establish good cause for his untimely motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3), (e); <em>United States v. Blue, </em>255 F.3d 609, 612 (8th Cir.2001) (per curiam). We further conclude that Wallette\u2019s ineffective assistance claim should be brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Soriano-Hernandez, </em>310 F.3d 1099, 1105 (8th Cir.2002.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">We reject Wallette\u2019s pro se arguments. The jury was not required to find that he was manufacturing injectable methamphetamine for him to be sentenced to more than 5 years imprisonment, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C); the evidence at trial \u2014 that Wallette had 3 prior felony convictions, he had purchased a shotgun from a witness, and the shotgun had been manufactured in Brazil and imported at Miami \u2014 supported his conviction under section 922(g), <em>see United States v. Boyd, </em>180 F.3d 967, 978 (8th Cir.1999); section 924(e) is a sentencing enhancement, which did not require findings by the jury, <em>see United States v. Campbell, </em>270 F.3d 702, 707-08 (8th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 946, 122 S.Ct. 1339, 152 L.Ed.2d 243 (2002); and the district court\u2019s misstatement as to the amount of possible good-time credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>did not affect Wallette\u2019s substantial rights, <em>see United States v. Kempis-Bonola, </em>287 F.3d 699, 702 (8th Cir.) (standard of review), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>537 U.S. 914, 123 S.Ct. 295, 154 L.Ed.2d 196 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Having reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find that the district court erred in sentencing Wallette to a total of 480 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release, instead of pronouncing separate sentences for each count. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2, comment. (n.l). Because the sentence imposed exceeded the statutory m\u00e1ximums for Counts 1-3 and 6, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), 844; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5871, and exceeded the supervised release maximum for Count 3, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b), we find that this was plain error. <em>See United States v. Maynie, </em>257 F.3d 908, 918-19 (8th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1151, 122 S.Ct. 1117, 151 L.Ed.2d 1010, 535 U.S. 944, 122 S.Ct. 1333, 152 L.Ed.2d 238 (2002). Thus, we modify the judgment to impose concurrent sentences of 240 months on Counts 1 and 2, 12 months on Count 3, 360 months on Count 4, and 120 months on Count 6, and a consecutive sentence of 120 months on Count 5. We further modify the judgment to impose concurrent supervised release terms of 1 year on Count 3 and 3 years on the remaining counts. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5G1.1(a); 5G1.2, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">We find no other nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
