The respondent did not file an answer to the charges. On March 14, 2003, the National Labor Relations Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) entered a decision and order in Case No. 7-CA-44786 granting the General Counsel\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Board ordered the respondent to bargain with the union and to provide the requested documents. It also ordered limited backpay for affected employees. The Board now applies to this court for summary enforcement of its decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">In response to the Board\u2019s application, this court received a letter from Mary L. Lewis, who identifies herself as the sole shareholder of the above corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She states that the respondent ceased business operations for financial reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>and that all wages due at the time of closing were paid. She also states that she cannot produce the documents sought by the union, including some documents apparently lost during a theft from her office.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The fact that a respondent may have ceased business operations and may no longer be able to comply with the Board\u2019s decision and order is not a bar to enforcement of that decision and order by this court. <em>NLRB v. Electric Steam Radiator Corp., </em>321 F.2d 733, 738 (6th Cir.1963). Likewise, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) prohibits this court from considering objections not made before the Board unless such failure \u201cshall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\u201d This requirement is waived \u201conly in cases of extenuating circumstances,\u201d <em>NLRB v. Ferraro\u2019s Bakery, Inc., </em>353 F.2d 366, 368 (6th Cir.1965), and then \u201conly if there has been some occurrence or decision that prevented a matter which should have been presented to the Board from having been presented at the proper time.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Allied Products Corp., </em>548 F.2d 644, 654 (6th Cir.1977). We conclude that no reasons have been advanced which would explain the respondent\u2019s failure to file an answer to the charges against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">It therefore is ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the Board\u2019s decision and order in Case No. 7-CA-44786 be and hereby is enforced. The respondent, Consolidated Foods Services, Inc., d/b/a Express Gourmet, its officers, agents, successors, and assigns, shall abide by the directives contained therein.

provided, however, that in no event shall this sum be less than these employees would have earned for a 2-week period at the rate of them normal wages when last in the Respondent\u2019s employ, with interest, as set forth in the remedy section of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">(c) Furnish the Union with the following information requested in its letter of November 28, 2001: an accounting of all unpaid contractual obligations, including wages, fringe benefits, and accrued vacation pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">(d) Preserve and, within 14 days of a request, or such additional time as the Regional Director may allow for good cause shown, provide at a reasonable place designated by the Board or its agents, all payroll records, social security payment records, timecards, personnel records and reports, and all other records including an electronic copy of such records if stored in electronic form, necessary to analyze the amount of backpay due under the terms of this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">(e) Within 14 days after service by the Region, duplicate and mail, at its own expense and after being signed by the Respondent\u2019s authorized representative, copies of the attached notice marked \u201cAppendix\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to all former employees who were employed by the Respondent when it ceased operations at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport on about October 15, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">(f) Within 21 days after service by the Region, file with the Regional Director for Region 7 a sworn certification of a responsible official on a form provided by the Region attesting to the steps that the Respondent has taken to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-14\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b48-15\">NOTICE TO EMPLOYEES</p>\n<p id=\"b48-16\">MAILED PURSUANT TO A JUDGMENT OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS ENFORCING AN ORDER OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD</p>\n<p id=\"b48-17\">The National Labor Relations Board has found that we violated Federal labor law and has ordered us to post and obey this notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>FEDERAL LAW GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">Form, join, or assist a union</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">Choose representatives to bargain with us on your behalf</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">Act together with other employees for your benefit and protection</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax\">Choose not to engage in any of these protected activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">WE WILL NOT fail and refuse to bargain in good faith with Local 24, Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, as the exclusive representative of the employees in the bargaining unit set forth below, by refusing to bargain with the Union concerning the effects on the unit employees of our decision to close our Detroit Metropolitan Airport facility, and the resulting termination of the unit employees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-11\">All cooks, bakers, storeroom employees, utility employees, hosts/hostesses, cashiers, deli/grill attendants, bartenders, pie bakers/baker helpers, pantry employees, snack bar employees, fast food attendants and servers employed by us at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, but excluding confidential employees, watchmen, and guards and supervisors as defined in the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">WE WILL NOT fail and refuse to furnish the Union with information that is necessary for, and relevant to, the Union\u2019s performance of its function as the exclusive representative of the employees in the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">WE WILL NOT in any like or related manner interfere with, restrain, or coerce you in the exercise of the rights guaranteed you by Section 7 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-14\">WE WILL, on request, bargain with the Union concerning the effects on unit employees of the closing of our facility at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, and the resulting termination of the unit employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-17\">WE WILL pay limited backpay to the unit employees in connection with our failure to bargain with the Union concerning the effects of our closing of the Detroit Metropolitan Airport facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-18\">WE WILL furnish the Union with the following information requested in its letter of November 28, 2001: an accounting of all unpaid contractual obligations, including wages, fringe benefits, and accrued vacation pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-19\">CONSOLIDATED FOOD SERVICES, INC.
