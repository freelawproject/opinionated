Although Coleman concedes that he is a convicted felon and that the firearms were in or affecting interstate commerce, he argues that no rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly possessed the firearms in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-23\">One may be in constructive possession by exercising dominion or control over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>area in which the contraband is found.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Joint-occupancy cases, like this one, require some evidence \u201c \u2018supporting at least a plausible inference that the defendant had knowledge of and access to the weapon.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict and accepting its credibility determinations, the evidence is sufficient to support Coleman\u2019s conviction. The Government presented evidence, including Coleman\u2019s admission that weapons were inside the car, supporting at least a plausible inference that Coleman had knowledge of and access to the firearms in question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
