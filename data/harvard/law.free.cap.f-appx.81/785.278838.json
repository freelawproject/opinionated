The order denied her motion to reopen and reconsider the Board\u2019s dismissal of her appeal from the Immigration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Judge\u2019s (IJ) order denying her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and for relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Tshibonge first raises several challenges to the summary affirmance procedure employed by the Board in its initial decision, dated November 18, 2002, affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge without opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003). As Tshibonge did not file a timely petition for review of that decision, we are without jurisdiction to consider her claims. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Tshibonge next disputes the Board\u2019s decision denying relief on her motion to reconsider. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order of February 11, 2003, and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2003). To the extent that Tshibonge seeks to challenge the IJ\u2019s determination that her asylum application is untimely and she failed to establish extraordinary circumstances excusing the late filing, we find we are without jurisdiction to consider such a claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Accordingly, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
