At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure based upon Washington\u2019s substantial assistance, and imposed concurrent sentences of 168 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release on the conspiracy count, and 80 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release on the firearm count. On appeal, Washington\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the court should have granted a greater downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-20\">In the plea agreement, Washington waived his right to appeal his sentence, with exceptions not applicable here. After carefully reviewing the record, we conclude Washington\u2019s challenge to the extent of the departure is within the scope of the waiver, he entered into the plea agreement knowingly and voluntarily, and no miscarriage of justice would result from enforcing the waiver. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-91 (8th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>No. 03-6608, 2003 WL 22258164 (Nov. 3, 2003). We have reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and have found no nonfrivolous issue not waived by the plea agreement. Accordingly, we enforce Washington\u2019s appeal waiver, dismiss this appeal, and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-17\">. The Honorable Fernando J.
