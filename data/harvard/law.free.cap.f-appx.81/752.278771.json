Wood, <em>Judge) </em>of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>cocaine and heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. On appeal, Louis argues that: (1) his trial counsel labored under a conflict of interest and otherwise failed to provide effective assistance; and (2) the district court erred in allowing a co-defendant to testify about his understanding of certain conversations between himself and Louis. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">With respect to Louis\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, this court has expressed a \u201cbaseline aversion to resolving ineffectiveness claims on direct review.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>205 F.3d 23, 35 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 885, 121 S.Ct. 203, 148 L.Ed.2d 142 (2000). As the Supreme Court recently explained, \u201cin most eases a motion brought under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective-assistance,\u201d because the district court is the forum best suited to develop the facts necessary to evaluate such claims. <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). Following <em>Massaro, </em>we recently observed that ineffectiveness claims should only be resolved on direct appeal \u201cwhen their resolution is beyond any doubt or to do so would be in the interest of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Khedr, </em>343 F.3d 96, 100 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because we believe that Louis\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance would benefit from further development of the record, we decline to review them on direct appeal and dismiss them without prejudice to Louis\u2019s right to pursue them in a collateral proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Turning to Louis\u2019s second ground for appeal, we find that he has not met the heavy burden of showing that admission of the impugned testimony constituted plain error \u2014 a showing that must be made where, as here, the appellant failed to object to admission of the evidence at trial. <em>See United States v. Dukagjini, </em>326 F.3d 45, 61 (2d Cir.2003). At the very least, the testimony of Louis\u2019s co-defendant concerning certain taped conversations was not plainly inadmissible. <em>See United States v. Urlacher, </em>979 F.2d 935, 939 (2d Cir.1992) (holding that witness\u2019s interpretation of comments made by defendant during taped conversations was admissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
