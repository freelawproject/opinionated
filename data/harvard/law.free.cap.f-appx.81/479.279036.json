On April 30, 2003, this court directed the clerk of this court to refuse to file any <em>pro se </em>appeal concerning \u201cany order or judgment entered in Judd\u2019s criminal proceeding, United States District Court Cause Nos. MO-98-CR-93 or MO-98-059M,\u201d unless he submitted proof of the satisfaction of prior sanctions. <em>United States v. Judd, </em>67 Fed.Appx. 248 (5th Cir.2003). Judd\u2019s current action is just the latest of scores of frivolous attempts to challenge rulings in that same criminal proceeding. This frivolous appeal is in violation of the April 30, 2003, sanction order, and it is DISMISSED accordingly. Judd is ORDERED to pay another sanction in the amount of $105, payable to the clerk of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The court hereby updates and consolidates its previous sanction orders. The clerk of this court and the clerks of all the district courts within this Circuit are hereby DIRECTED to refuse to file any action, appeal, motion, or pleading by Judd unless Judd submits proof of the satisfaction of his monetary sanctions. Only one exception applies to this general sanction: In accordance with this court\u2019s order in <em>In re Judd, </em>No. 03-50562 (5th Cir. June 30, 2003), Judd is authorized to submit in this court a nonfrivolous application for authorization to file a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. As this court has warned Judd before, attempts to file frivolous pleadings including a frivolous motion for authorization \u2014 will invite the imposition of further sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED PURSUANT TO PRIOR SANCTION ORDER; MONETARY SANCTION IMPOSED; NEW SANCTIONS ON FILING IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A-Z\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
