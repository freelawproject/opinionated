R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b675-12\"> The Honorable Anna J. Brown, United States District Judge for the District of Oregon, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b675-18\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-19\">Carmen Roxas, a native and citizen of the Philippines, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) upholding an Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) denial of her request for asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will reverse the BIA\u2019s determination only if the Petitioner shows the evidence compels such a result. <em>See Cruz-Navarro v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1024, 1028 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-20\">Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it except as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-21\">We assume Roxas\u2019s testimony was credible because neither the BIA nor the IJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>made an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Katana v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1113-14 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Roxas first argues the BIA erred when it determined Roxas did not establish that she had suffered past persecution. Roxas points out \u201ctwo attempts on her life were made,\u201d and she \u201ccontinues to receive death threats\u201d from the New People\u2019s Army (NPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">This Court has defined persecution as an \u201cextreme concept\u201d that includes the \u201cinfliction of suffering or harm.\u201d <em>Korablina v. INS, </em>158 F.3d 1038, 1044 (9th Cir.1998). <em>See also Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1997). \u201cOur court generally treats unfulfilled threats, without more, as within that category of conduct indicative of a danger of future persecution, rather than as past persecution itself.\u201d Li<em>m v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000) (citations omitted). \u201cIn certain extreme cases, we have held that repeated and especially menacing death threats can constitute a primary part of a past persecution claim, particularly where those threats are combined with confrontation or other mistreatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cThreats standing alone, however, constitute past persecution in only a small category of cases, and only when the threats are so menacing as to cause significant actual \u2018suffering or harm,\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Roxas did not offer any evidence of actual suffering or harm caused by the threats. <em>Compare Borja v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 732, 736 (9th Cir.1999) (NPA threatened petitioner with a gun and then cut her shoulder with a knife). The gunshots fired at Roxas\u2019s student group and the knife-wielding man attacking the group were undoubtedly frightening. The attacks, however, were on the group rather than on Roxas singularly, and no one was physically harmed. The attackers were not apprehended, and it is unknown whether the attackers were part of the NPA. According to Roxas, the written death threats continued on a regular basis for over ten years, but no harm resulted from these repeated threats. Roxas did not present any evidence that the threats escalated or were disruptive to Roxas\u2019s family members, who have continued to reside in their home. Without more, therefore, these threats do not constitute past persecution. <em>Compare Lim, </em>224 F.3d at 936 <em>with, Ruano v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1155, 1162 (9th Cir.2002) (court found past persecution when petitioner was \u201cclosely confronted\u201d and put in harm\u2019s way on numerous occasions by men drawing weapons in petitioner\u2019s presence).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Roxas next argues the BIA erred when it determined Roxas did not establish an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution. A well-founded fear of persecution must be both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Roxas satisfied the subjective prong because she testified credibly. Substantial evidence, however, supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Roxas\u2019s fear of persecution was not objectively reasonable. Roxas testified the death threats continue to this day, but she did not offer any evidence that the threats specifically targeted her for her political opinions or that the threats were likely to be carried out. Roxas testified she believed the activities of the NPA were on the rise, but the BIA noted the Amnesty International report submitted by Roxas indicates the NPA and the Philippine government are participating in negotiations for a peace agreement and most of the current abuses are committed by the government\u2019s security forces and Muslim armed groups. Roxas was a student member of the Civilian Home Defense Force for a year and a half. She left the country over 13 years ago. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>no evidence that Roxas is a person of particular interest to the NPA or that she would be singled out for her political opinions. <em>See Cruz-Navarro, </em>232 F.3d at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Finally, Roxas argues that she was penalized for her failure to provide corroborating evidence. She was not. The Board merely upheld the IJ\u2019s determination that Roxas\u2019s credible testimony standing alone did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Roxas necessarily failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal because she failed to meet the standard for asylum. <em>Rivera-Moreno v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 481, 487 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The Petition for Review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b675-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this Circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
