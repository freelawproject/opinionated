Rangel argues that the identification of him from a single photograph display violated his due process rights. This argument is without merit. Although the single photograph display was impermissibly suggestive, <em>see Hudson v. Blackburn, </em>601 F.2d 785, 788 (5th Cir.1979), an examination of the totality of the circumstances reveals that the suggestiveness did not lead to \u201ca substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>United States v. Burbridge, </em>252 F.3d 775, 780 (5th Cir.2001) (citations omitted); <em>see also Allen v. Estelle, </em>568 F.2d 1108, 1113-14 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Rangel also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. However, the evidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, sufficiently established Ran-gel\u2019s knowledgeable participation in a cocaine conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Villarreal, </em>324 F.3d 319, 324 (5th Cir.2003) (knowledge of drug conspiracy may be inferred from large amount and value of cocaine in vehicle); <em>United States v. Diaz-Carreon, </em>915 F.2d 951, 954-55 (5th Cir.1990) (guilty knowledge may be inferred from inconsistent statements and implausible explanations of defendant); <em>United States v. Booker, </em>334 F.3d 406, 410 (5th Cir.2003) (uncorroborated co-conspirator testimony is sufficient to support a conviction unless legally incredible). The evidence was also sufficient to support Ran-gel\u2019s aiding and abetting conviction. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>121 F.3d 928, 936 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b851-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
