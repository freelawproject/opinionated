The district court rejected O\u2019Connell\u2019s claims that he was denied a fair trial and effective assistance of counsel. We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">O\u2019Connell was charged in Michigan state court with raping his five-year old stepdaughter. Prior to trial, defense counsel requested copies of any medical reports. The prosecutor provided the names of anticipated witnesses, including Linda Hibst, a medical expert who examined the child, but was unaware any reports existed. Defense counsel then sent a letter to Hibst asking her to send any reports she prepared to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">On the morning of trial, the judge found a copy of Hibst\u2019s examination report in the court file attached to defense counsel\u2019s letter. Because defense counsel had not seen the report in advance, the court allowed him to interview Hibst before she testified. Though Hibst testified to finding an adhesion during her examination of the child, she could not say with certainty that it resulted from sexual abuse. Defense counsel effectively cross-examined Hibst, highlighting the weaknesses in the bases of her conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-15\">The jury returned a guilty verdict. O\u2019Connell appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which affirmed. The Michigan Supreme Court declined to review his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-16\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Ah_\">A. Standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b604-17\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to deny habeas corpus relief de novo and the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>Palazzolo v. Gorcyca, </em>244 F.3d 512, 515 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-18\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), federal courts may not grant habeas relief for claims adjudicated on their merits in a state court proceeding, unless that state court proceeding resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-19\">B. <em>Brady </em>claim</p>\n<p id=\"b604-20\">O\u2019Connell argues that he was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial because the trial court allowed Hibst to testify even though defense counsel did not obtain her report until the morning of trial. Having examined the record, we agree with the district court that O\u2019Connell\u2019s fair-trial claim implicated no <em>constitutional </em>right because he failed to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-21\">A defendant establishes a <em>Brady </em>violation by showing that: (1) the prosecutor suppressed material evidence, (2) the evidence was favorable to the accused be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>cause it was either exculpatory or impeaching, and (3) prejudice resulted. <em>See Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). Evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 280 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The district court correctly concluded that O\u2019Connell failed to establish any of the elements of a <em>Brady </em>violation. First, there are no facts to support O\u2019Connell\u2019s contention that prosecutors suppressed Hibst\u2019s report. In fact, paragraphs 13 and 15 of trial counsel\u2019s affidavit in support of O\u2019Connell\u2019s Motion to Remand, filed in state court, demonstrate that the prosecutor assigned to the case was unaware that Hibst had prepared a report. It was the trial judge who found the report in the court\u2019s file, attached to defense counsel\u2019s letter to Hibst requesting a copy of her report be sent to the trial court. Second, Hibst\u2019s report was neither exculpatory nor impeaching. Last, defense counsel\u2019s interview with Hibst before she testified eliminated any potential for prejudice due to his not having received her report earlier. With the preparation time the court allowed, counsel effectively cross-examined Hibst. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that O\u2019Connell failed to demonstrate a <em>Brady </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">C. Ineffective assistance claim</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Having found no <em>Brady </em>violation, we consider O\u2019Connell\u2019s alternative argument that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. O\u2019Connell contends counsel\u2019s failure to timely obtain Hibst\u2019s report amounted to deficient performance. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel presents a mixed question of law and fact. Therefore, we apply the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d prong of \u00a7 2254(d)(1). <em>Hunt v. Mitchell, </em>261 F.3d 575, 580 (6th Cir.2001). A state court unreasonably applies Supreme Court precedent if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case. <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 407, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">The Supreme Court established a two prong test to evaluate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Both prongs of the test must be satisfied in order to grant relief. After reviewing the facts of this case, we agree with the district court and the Michigan Court of Appeals that O\u2019Connell cannot establish that he was prejudiced by any conduct of his defense counsel. Absent prejudice, his claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
