Young is serving a 100-month sentence imposed following a guilty-plea conviction for bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-19\">Young was convicted in federal court while out on bond pending appeal of a state court conviction and 48-month sentence for forgery. While in federal custody, Young filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition challenging his state court conviction. This court granted a certificate of appealability on whether Young could properly challenge his state court conviction while in federal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-20\">We conclude that the district court had jurisdiction over Young\u2019s section 2254 petition while he was in federal custody. Young was permitted to apply for habeas relief from a state restraint which will go into effect in the future, as the State of Washington filed a detainer against petitioner. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. foil. \u00a7 2254, Rule 2(b), n. 5 (courts have jurisdiction over habeas applications where petitioner currently in federal custody applies for habeas relief from a state restraint which is to go into effect in the future); <em>Rose v. Morris, </em>619 F.2d 42, 43 (9th Cir.1980) (\u201c[a] state detainer warrant against a federal prisoner is sufficient \u2018custody\u2019 to confer habeas jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-21\">No certificate of appealability was issued on the merits of Young\u2019s appeal, we deny Young\u2019s request to broaden the COA, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b704-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
