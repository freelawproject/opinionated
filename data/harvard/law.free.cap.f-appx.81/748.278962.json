Chu\u2019s allegations stem from child support proceedings and a resulting levy placed on his bank account for failure to make child support payments. The district court granted the City\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding that under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, because Chu\u2019s claims generally arose from state court proceedings, it did not have jurisdiction to consider Chu\u2019s claims. Moreover, the district court held that Chu\u2019s claims, based almost exclusively on conclusory allegations, were without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-17\">We agree with the district court that Chu\u2019s claims are barred from review under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. It is well settled that inferior federal courts lack jurisdiction to review state court decisions, whether final or interlocutory. <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 416, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>Doctor\u2019s </em>Assoc., <em>Inc. v. Distajo, </em>107 F.3d 126, 138 (2d Cir.1997); <em>Gentner v. Shulman, </em>55 F.3d 87, 89 (2d Cir.1995). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars not only claims which would involve direct review of a state court decision, but also claims which are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a state court decision. <em>Moccio v. New York State Office of Court Admin., </em>95 F.3d 195, 198 (2d Cir.1996). Finally, it bars claims which could have been raised in the state court. As Chu\u2019s claims are plainly covered by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, the district court was correct in finding that it could not entertain Chu\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-18\">We have carefully considered all of appellant\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-19\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
