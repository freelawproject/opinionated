Peralta \u2014 a packager in a heroin mill from 1999 until his arrest in 2001 \u2014 was convicted of one count of participating in a conspiracy to distribute, and possess with intent to distribute, heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and sentenced principally to a term of 108 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was the lower limit of the applicable and stipulated Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">On appeal, Peralta argues that it was error to refuse to grant him a minor role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). There is some question, on the facts of this case, as to the proper standard of review of the district court\u2019s denial of a minor role adjustment. Regardless of which standard we apply, however, the defendant\u2019s claim fails. Whether or not the role of a packager is akin to the role of one who transports or stores drugs, as defendant asserts, we have made it plain that even a courier is not automatically entitled to a minor role adjustment. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>920 F.2d 153, 155 (2d Cir.1990). Factors such as \u201cthe nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to other participants, the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture, and the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise\u201d may be considered. <em>Id. </em>Here, evidence was presented that suggests that Peralta had packaged heroin for street sale for many years, and that he had occupied this role for much longer than several other members of the conspiracy. The district court was thus within its discretion to deny the minor role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Because the merits are so easily dealt with, we need not concern ourselves with the applicability of the waiver provisions of Peralta\u2019s plea agreement, or with whether Peralta can argue on appeal for a role adjustment he agreed not to request at the sentencing stage. We have considered all of appellant\u2019s claims and find them merit-less. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
