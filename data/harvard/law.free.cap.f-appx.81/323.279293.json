Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Arnold D. Green\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Green has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-21\">Green appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims from an April 27, 2000 decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals wherein the Board determined there was no clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in a July 1983 Board decision denying his claim for a rating of total disability based on individual unemployability. Green argued that the Board committed CUE by failing to consider a 1981 Social Security Administration (SSA) decision. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims concluded that the record on appeal yielded \u201cno evidence that the August 1981 SSA decision was of record at the time of the July 1983 [Board] decision.\u201d The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that the Board\u2019s CUE decision was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d and was supported by an adequate statement of reasons or bases. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7261(a)(30)(A), 7104(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-23\">Additionally, for the first time on appeal, Green argued before the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims that the Board committed CUE in failing to apply certain regulations correctly in adjudicating his claim. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held, \u201c[b]ecause there is no Board decision on this allegation of CUE, it is not properly before the Court,\u201d citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7252(a) and <em>Andre v. Principi, </em>301 F.3d 1354, 1361 (Fed.Cir.2002) (\u201c[E]aeh \u2018specific\u2019 assertion of CUE constitutes a claim that must be the subject of a decision by the [Board] before the Veterans Court can exercise jurisdiction over it.\u201d). The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed the Board\u2019s decision and Green appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-25\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>See Forshey v. Principi </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). Green\u2019s appeal does not satisfy any of the grounds for invoking this court\u2019s jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 decision did not address or otherwise depend on any issue of validity or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>interpretation of any statute or regulation, nor did Green properly raise any argument concerning the validity or interpretation of any such provision. Further, Green fails to raise any clear or genuine constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In his brief, Green states that he has been denied due process because the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \u201cchose to rely\u201d on the Board\u2019s decision that the 1981 SSA decision \u201cwas not received by VA until July 23, 1984,\u201d instead of finding that the SSA decision had been received on an earlier date. In essence, Green only challenges the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims factual determinations and application of the law to the facts. Such matters are clearly outside our jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). As we explained in <em>Helfer v. West, </em>174 F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed.Cir.1999), to the extent appellants simply put a \u201cdue process\u201d label on contentions that they should have prevailed on their claims, the claim is \u201cconstitutional in name only.\u201d \u201cThe characterization of [a] question as constitutional in nature does not confer upon us jurisdiction that we otherwise lack.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The only genuine issues on appeal pertain to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claim\u2019s factual determinations and applications of the law to the facts. Thus, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2), Green\u2019s appeal is not within this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
