The district court sentenced him to 180 months in prison. Baylor\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. However, he raises the issues of whether the magistrate judge complied with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in accepting Baylor\u2019s guilty plea, and whether the district court erred in sentencing Baylor as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Although notified of his right to do so, Baylor has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-22\">After reviewing the transcript of the plea proceeding, we conclude that the magistrate judge fully complied with the requirements of Rule 11 in accepting Baylor\u2019s guilty plea. Turning to the sentencing issue, we find that the district court\u2019s determination that the challenged prior conviction resulted from a counseled plea was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989) (standard of review for factual determinations under the Sentencing Guidelines is clearly erroneous). Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>ingly, the district court properly sentenced Baylor as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Baylor\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
