Mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>See Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). Rollins\u2019 petition does not set forth exceptional circumstances as would warrant the issuance of a writ of mandamus at this time. Accordingly, although we grant Rollins\u2019 motion to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny his petition for a writ of mandamus without prejudice to his ability to refile for mandamus relief if the district court does not act expeditiously. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented before the district court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-18\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
