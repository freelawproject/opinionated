The district court sentenced her to twenty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Austin\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Austin has filed a pro se supplemental brief, also contending that there was insufficient evidence to support her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the evidence was sufficient. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942) (standard of review). To the extent Austin challenges the credibility of the Government\u2019s witnesses, \u201cwe do not review the credibility of the witnesses and assume that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Sun, </em>278 F.3d 302, 313 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Austin\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
