Powell\u2019s motion to amend his brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-20\">Powell alleged that prison officials used excessive force on him in an altercation that resulted in his loss of good time credits, among other things. A prisoner attacking a disciplinary proceeding that resulted in the loss of good-time credits cannot bring a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action seeking damages until his \u201cconviction\u201d in that proceeding has been expunged, reversed, or otherwise set aside. <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); <em>Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc). Powell is unable to show that his disciplinary conviction has been set aside. <em>See Randell v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 300, 301 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-21\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Powell\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
