While Schwyhart was serving his supervised release, the district com\u00ed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found that he had violated his release conditions and thus revoked supervised release and imposed a 36-month prison term. Schwyhart appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Schwyhart was scheduled to commence the 5-year supervised release term in October 1997. Prior to his release, however, a detainer was filed against him in another district court for charges of assaulting an inmate. Schwyhart was convicted and served a 60-month prison sentence on the assault charge and thus was not released from prison until March 2002. Beginning in September 2002, the probation office filed three violation reports. Until the sentencing portion of those revocation proceedings, Schwyhart proceeded pro se \u2014 at his choice, against the court\u2019s strong advice \u2014 with the assistance of standby counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Schwyhart\u2019s counsel argues on appeal that Schwyhart\u2019s supervised release had expired prior to some or all of the violations and that he was not given adequate notice of his release conditions or of the violations relied upon by the com\u00ed. In a pro se supplemental brief, Schwyhart argues additionally that none of the violations justified the 36-month sentence; there was insufficient evidence of some of the violations; the district court\u2019s refusal to allow him to cross-examine a witness at the revocation hearing violated his right to confront witnesses; his decision to represent himself was an invalid waiver of counsel; the district court\u2019s refusal to appoint new counsel and an investigator, and to ensure his access to a law library, violated due process; and counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">All of the foregoing arguments fail, and we reject them with little discussion: (1) given the time that Schwyhart served on his subsequent assault conviction, he was still on supervised release for his bank-robbery conviction on January 7, 2003, when he committed the last violations relied upon by the district court, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(e) (term of supervised release does not run while person is imprisoned for at least 30 days); (2) he received written notice of his release conditions when he was sentenced on the bank robbery, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(f); (3) he received adequate notice of the violations at issue before the preliminary hearing and the revocation hearing, and any irregularity in the notice process was harmless, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(b)(1)(A), (b)(2), 52(a); (4) the district court had ample evidence to find Schwyhart violated his release conditions, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (court must find violation by preponderance of evidence); (5) the sentence was within the limits of section 3583(e)(3), and was not an abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Ghimes, </em>54 F.3d 489, 492 (8th Cir.1995); (6) the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting cross-examination of a witness at the revocation hearing, see <em>United States v. Love, </em>329 F.3d 981, 984 (8th Cir.2003) (standard of review); (7) the court discussed with Schwyhart his decision to represent himself, setting out the problems involved, <em>see United States v. Stewart, </em>20 F.3d 911, 917 (8th Cir.1994); (8) he was not denied due process by the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>court\u2019s refusal to appoint new counsel or an investigator, or to address his concerns about a law library, because the court appointed the federal public defender to represent him, first as standby counsel then as primary counsel upon Schwyhart\u2019s request; and (9) his ineffective-assistance claim is not properly before us, <em>see United States v. Cain, </em>134 F.3d 1345, 1352 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Accordingly, we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we deny Schwyhart\u2019s motion for new counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-9\">. The Honorable Richard E.
