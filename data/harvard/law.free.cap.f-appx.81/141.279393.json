Cudahy, Senior United States Court of Appeals Judge for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">We find that all of Carrillo\u2019s challenges to his conviction lack merit. We thus affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">There was no violation under <em>Brady v. Maryland.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Carrillo has not identified any exculpatory evidence that the government has failed to produce or that it produced too late to be useful to Carrillo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if he had, he has also failed to articulate a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the outcome of his case would have been different had certain information been provided or provided in a more timely manner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court conducted an in camera review of the informant\u2019s file and determined that there was no undisclosed material that would support Carrillo\u2019s entrapment defense. We have examined the file ourselves and agree with this conclusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Carrillo was able to secure the informant\u2019s presence at trial and had the opportunity to examine her using the government evidence that tended to undermine her credibility. The outcome of the case, we are confident, would not have changed had discovery proceeded as appellant argues it should have.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The district court\u2019s refusal to allow Carrillo to treat the informant as a hostile witness on direct examination did not violate Carrillo\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights and, assuming without deciding that it was an abuse of discretion, it was harmless.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court merely noted that at the time the point was raised, it was premature, because Carrillo had not yet established that the witness was hostile. Carrillo never renewed his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the government\u2019s objections during Carrillo\u2019s examination of the informant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-17\">We also reject Carrillo\u2019s challenge to the admission of the tapes. Carrillo never points to any factual assertions that could make the recorded statements hearsay in the first place.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The recorded statements of Carrillo himself were admissible as admissions because they were offered against him and he is a party.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The statements of those with whom Carrillo was speaking were not admitted for the truth of any factual assertions they made.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the hearsay objection.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-18\">The district court did not err in denying Carrillo\u2019s motion for a new trial and did not abuse its discretion in denying a post-trial evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Most of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>arguments in support of his motion for a new trial were the same ones we deal with above. Those that were different are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Finally, the district court did not commit clear error in refusing to depart downward for acceptance of responsibility in sentencing Carrillo.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Carrillo denied responsibility and went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\">. <em>Brady v.
