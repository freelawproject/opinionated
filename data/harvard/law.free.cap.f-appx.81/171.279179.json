Rodriguez, </em>the \u201cmarijuana conspiracy case,\u201d and <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>the \u201cmoney laundering case.\u201d We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">We reject Hernandez\u2019s assertion of <em>Apprendi </em>error in his marijuana conspiracy case. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Drug identity was an element of the offense charged in the marijuana conspiracy case, which had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Jury Instruction 34, for example, required the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe defendant intentionally delivered marijuana.\u201d While drug quantity was not submitted to the jury, the district court correctly calculated Hernandez\u2019s sentence because \u201cthe \u2018prescribed statutory maximum\u2019 for a single conviction under [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) ] for an undetermined amount of marijuana is five years.\u201d <em>United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053, 1059 (9th Cir.2000), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir.2002) <em>(en banc). </em>This five year sentence dictated by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) was then properly doubled pursuant to a notice filed under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, which increases punishment due to prior felony drug convictions. Therefore, Hernandez\u2019s sentence in the marijuana conspiracy case does not violate <em>Apprendi. </em>We have previously ruled that it is proper to stack the statutory maximum terms and thus the district court did not err in doing so here. <em>Buckland, </em>289 F.3d at 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Because the district court did not err in calculating Hernandez\u2019s sentence in the marijuana conspiracy case, it follows that the sentence in the money laundering case was also properly calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
