The IJ cited, as the sole basis for her determination, a perceived variance between Chen\u2019s first interview with immigration officials, pursuant to INA \u00a7 235(b)(1), and his subsequent testimony at a merits hearing, at which he claimed that he fled China to escape persecution he suffered on account of his homosexuality. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision in a one-line opinion from which Chen now appeals. We GRANT Chen\u2019s petition for review, and REMAND for proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b284-16\">Chen argues that substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. We agree. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>292 F.3d 1017 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-17\">First, we find no discrepancy between the interview and the testimony. At Chen\u2019s first interview,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Chen was advised that if he had any fear of persecution, he would have the opportunity to speak \u201cprivately and confidentially to another officer.\u201d Chen was then asked a series of eight perfunctory questions pursuant to a printed form. The immigration official asked why Chen left China, and Chen responded, \u201cMy family raise pigs and do not make much money.\u201d The official next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>asked Chen whether he had any fear or concern about being returned to his home country, and whether he feared that he would be harmed if he were returned. Chen responded in the affirmative to both these questions. The officer asked no follow-up questions. Nor does anything appear in the record to indicate whether Chen was afforded the opportunity to speak \u201cprivately and confidentially\u201d with another officer after disclosing his fear to the first officer, and if so, what occurred during the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Months later, in his written application for asylum and his testimony at a merits hearing in conformity therewith, Chen claimed to have left China to escape persecution he suffered on account of his homosexuality. We conclude that nothing in Chen\u2019s initial interview is inconsistent with this claim. Chen <em>did </em>state that he was afraid to return to China because he thought he would be harmed, and although he did not elect to disclose the basis for that fear, he was never asked about his reason, and, moreover, he might well have been awaiting the chance to speak \u201cprivately and confidentially\u201d with another officer about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Further, even if we agreed with the IJ that there was a variance between Chen\u2019s initial interview and his subsequent testimony, answers given at an initial, perfunctory interview with immigration officials shortly after arrival are not sufficiently rehable to constitute substantial evidence supporting an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Singh, </em>292 F.3d at 1024. Here, numerous factors call into question the reliability of Chen\u2019s initial interview: linguistic difficulties with the Mandarin translation; the fact that the statement itself provided no information as to how the interview was prepared, and the absence of a recorded opportunity for an explanation as to the basis for one\u2019s fears; the stressful circumstance of entry into a new country; and the recognition that \u201can arriving alien who has suffered abuse during interrogation sessions by government officials in his home country may be reluctant to reveal such information during the first meeting with government officials in this country.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1022-23 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Accordingly, we hold that substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Having determined that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal on the basis of adverse credibility, we remand so that the BIA may determine Chen\u2019s eligibility for relief. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">PETITION GRANTED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-12\">. There is some discrepancy in the record as to whether this interview occurred the first day Chen arrived in Guam with a boatload of other Chinese nationals, or four days after his arrival. For purposes of this appeal, the difference is irrelevant; what matters is that the interview was Chen's <em>first </em>interview with immigration officials upon or shortly after his arrival in Guam.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
