On appeal, Settle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>also asks this court to take notice of Amendment 599. Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude the district court did not commit error. A court may not grant a section 3582(c)(2) motion unless a reduction would be consistent with the applicable policy statements found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, and section 1B1.10 does not permit retroactive application of Amendments 624 and 640 in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>Cf. United States v. Dowty, </em>996 F.2d 937, 938-39 (8th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) could not be applied retroactively in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding when amendment was not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c)). Amendment 599 does not help Settle because it deals with relevant conduct in cases where the defendant is charged with a separate weapon offense, which did not occur in Settle\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">We affirm the district court and deny Settle\u2019s pending motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b931-40\"> The Honorable Catherine D.
