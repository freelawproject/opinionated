We review an adverse credibility determination under a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.1999). We must affirm the IJ\u2019s determination \u201cunless the evidence presented would compel a reasonable fact finder to reach a contrary result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1149-50; <em>see also INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">In this case, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by inconsistencies in the petitioner\u2019s testimony, including his lack of awareness of crucial events that characterized the movement for Khalistani independence (including the 1992 election boycott), his observance of Sikh customs, his level of activity in the Akali Dal Mann party, and the nature of the 1995 Golden Temple commemorative event. His testimony related to his alleged political activity and arrests was often vague and nonspecific. Finally, Rihal\u2019s testimony conflicts with State Department reports indicating that Sikhs living outside the Punjab tend to encounter harassment infrequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">Because Rihal did not present to the BIA his due process claims that the translation was inadequate and that the IJ badgered him at the hearing, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider them on appeal. <em>Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 867 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">The IJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW IS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b939-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
