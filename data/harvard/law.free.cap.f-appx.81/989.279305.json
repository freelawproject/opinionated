We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-26\">The California Court of Appeal decision affirming Steadham\u2019s conviction for the Hayashi robbery was not contrary to, or an objectively unreasonable application of, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>clearly established federal law. <em>See Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1172, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (emphasizing standard under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)). That court\u2019s conclusion was consistent -with <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), and <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 324, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). It was not unreasonable given Hayashi\u2019s testimony that Stead-ham resembled the attacker but looked more grown up and heavier \u2014 a view of Steadham expressed by witnesses to other robberies as well \u2014 and evidence that the Hayashi robbery occurred in the same time frame and geographic area as other taxi robberies with which Steadham was connected, that Hayashi picked up his fare right by Steadham\u2019s house, that Hayashi\u2019s cab was recovered very close to where Steadham lived, and that the fare used the name \u201cAnthony\u201d \u2014 Steadham\u2019s first name. Even though Hayashi\u2019s identification may have been weak, a rational trier of fact could have found that Steadham was the robber beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1021-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">.
