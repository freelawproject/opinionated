Whiteley (appellants) infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,040,143. The trial court then issued a permanent injunction on any further infringing actions. Appellants initially appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which properly transferred the case to this court. <em>See Regents of the Univ. of Mich. v. Genesearch, LLC, </em>No. 02-2421 (6th Cir. May 19, 2003). Having reviewed the evidence of record and the parties\u2019 arguments, this court <em>affirms </em>the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b368-16\">Scientists from Vetgen, in collaboration with the University of Michigan and Michigan State University, developed and patented testing procedures that indicate whether a dog or horse is a carrier of or infected with Type I Willebrand\u2019s Disease. The patents covering the procedures are U.S. Patent Nos. 6,040,143 and 6,074,832. On May 10, 2000, appellees filed suit against appellants alleging that their canine testing for Type I Willebrand\u2019s Disease infringes the patents. The district court held a <em>Markman </em>hearing on April 15, 2002 and issued an order construing the claims three days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-17\">Thereafter, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment that appellants infringe claims 15, 16, 17, and 26 of the \u2019143 patent. On July 10, 2002, the district court granted appellees\u2019 motion and issued an order permanently enjoining appellants from practicing the accused testing procedures. The judgment of the district court was entered on July 12, 2002. Appellants timely filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s judgment. In addition, appellants filed a notice of appeal with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>district court on November 15, 2002. On January 13, 2003, the district court denied appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration. In this appeal, appellants primarily challenge the district court\u2019s discovery rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Appellees contend that this court lacks jurisdiction over this appeal because it was untimely filed. In their brief, appellees misrepresented to this court that the Sixth Circuit did not address the issue of whether appellants\u2019 notice of appeal was timely filed. To the contrary, the Sixth Circuit discussed the issue at length and advised this court that, under Sixth Circuit law, the notice of appeal in this case was timely filed. <em>See Regents, </em>No. 02-2421, slip op. at 3. Because this issue is one of procedure, not unique to patent law, the law of the Sixth Circuit applies. <em>See Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Delta Oil Prod. Corp., </em>806 F.2d 1031, 1033 (Fed.Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), a notice of appeal must be filed \u201cwithin 30 days after the date of entry of the judgment or order appealed from.\u201d Appellants\u2019 notice of appeal was filed about four months after the order appealed from was entered by the district court. This thirty-day deadline is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Ill. Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); <em>Tylo Sauna, S.A. v. Amerec Corp., </em>826 F.2d 7, 9 (Fed.Cir.1987). Appellants, however, filed a timely motion for reconsideration. A motion to reconsider, when timely filed, qualifies as a motion to alter or amend the judgment filed pursuant to Rule 59, Fed.R.Civ.P., for purposes of tolling the time period for filing a notice of appeal. <em>See Moody v. Pepsi-Cola Met. Bottling Co., </em>915 F.2d 201, 206 (6th Cir.1990). The Sixth Circuit correctly stated that, \u201c[ujnder Rule 4(a)(4)(B)(i), Fed. R.App. P., the notice of appeal filed by defendant Whiteley would have become effective at the time the motion for reconsideration was denied, <em>i.e., </em>on January 13, 2003.\u201d <em>Regents, </em>No. 02-2421, slip op. at 3. Accordingly, appellants notice of appeal was timely, and this court has jurisdiction to consider the merits of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Appellants make two arguments regarding the district court\u2019s evidentiary and discovery rulings. First, appellants assert that they were prejudiced by appellees\u2019 failure to re-depose Ms. Whiteley in violation of the district court\u2019s order. This argument is misplaced. On December 3, 2001, the district court granted appellees\u2019 motion to compel Ms. Whiteley to submit for re-deposition. That order did not require appellees to re-depose her. It merely allowed the re-deposition, which appellees ultimately decided not to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Second, appellants argue that the district court wrongfully excluded Ms. Whiteley\u2019s proffered expert report as evidence. The district court excluded the evidence because appellants failed to timely notify appellees and the court of appellants\u2019 intention to designate Ms. Whiteley as an expert witness in violation of Fed. R.C\u00cdV.P. 26(a)(2) and the district court\u2019s scheduling order. Rule 37(c), Fed. R. Civ. P, gives the district court discretion to exclude evidence that is not submitted in accordance with Rule 26(a). A district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Combs v. Wilkinson, </em>315 F.3d 548, 554 (6th Cir.2002). Here, it is clear that appellants\u2019 proffered expert report did not comply with Rule 26(a), among other deficiencies. Accordingly, the district court acted within its discretion by excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Finally, appellants argue that the 143 patent fails to satisfy the require-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>merits of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. In support of this argument, appellants present evidence that was not presented to the trial court, and is apparently the result of post-judgment investigation by appellants. This court does not review evidence or arguments that were not presented to the trial court in the first instance. The scope of appellate review in this court is limited to the record established in the proceedings before the trial court. <em>Sage Prod., Inc. v. Devon Indus. Inc., </em>126 F.3d 1420, 1426 (Fed.Cir.1997) (\u201cIn short, this court does not \u2018review\u2019 that which was not presented to the district court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Based on the forgoing analysis, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
