Schwartz, <em>District </em>Judge) granting Plaintiffs-Appellees\u2019 Scholastic Inc., J.K. Rowling and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. (collectively \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) motion for summary judgment, dismissing the counterclaims brought against Plaintiffs by Stouffer, awarding Plaintiffs\u2019 certain attorneys fees, and imposing $50,000 in sanctions upon finding that Stouffer committed a fraud on the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Familiarity is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues. The District Court properly dismissed Stouffer\u2019s trademark and copyright counterclaims, imposed $50,000 sanctions, and awarded Plaintiffs certain attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">The District Court\u2019s dismissal of Stouffer\u2019s trademark claims was proper because no reasonable juror could find a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the two parties\u2019 works. \u201cThe district court\u2019s ultimate balancing of the <em>Polaroid </em>factors is always subject to <em>de novo </em>review, and such review is <em>a fortiori </em>applicable on review of a grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Patsy\u2019s Brand. Inc. v. I.O.B. Realty. Inc., </em>317 F.3d 209, 215 (2d Cir.2003) (internal citations and quotations omitted). To prevail on summary judgment in a trademark infringement action, the owner of the trademark must establish that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact regarding whether \u201cnumerous ordinary prudent purchasers are likely to be misled or confused as to the source of the product in question because of the entrance in the marketplace of defendant\u2019s mark.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217. In assessing the likelihood of confusion, eight factors set forth by Judge Friendly in <em>Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., </em>287 F.2d 492, 495 (2d Cir.1961) should be considered. <em>See Nabisco, Inc. v. Warner-Lambert Co., </em>220 F.3d 43, 46 (2d Cir.2000). Here, although the District Court did not individually assess each <em>Polaroid </em>factor, it acknowledged the governing law and thoroughly compared the <em>Harry Potter </em>books with Stouffer\u2019s works. In so doing, it correctly found that there was little similarity between the two works at issue. Stouffer\u2019s two publishing businesses were not successful, notwithstanding the questionable evidence submitted by Stouffer to the contrary. Further, Stouffer\u2019s and Plaintiffs\u2019 marks are used in two very different ways. Rowling\u2019s use of the term \u201cMuggles\u201d describes ordinary humans with no magical powers while Stouffer\u2019s \u201cMuggles\u201d are tiny, hairless creatures with elongated heads. Further, the <em>Harry Potter </em>books are novel-length works and whose primary customers are older children and adults whereas Stouffer\u2019s booklets appeal to young children. Accordingly, the District Court correctly dismissed Stouffer\u2019s trademark claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">The District Court\u2019s dismissal of Stouffer\u2019s copyright claims was proper because no reasonable juror could find a substantial similarity between Stouffer\u2019s illustration of Larry Potter and Plaintiffs\u2019 illustration of Harry Potter. The District Court\u2019s conclusion that there is no substantial similarity between the copyright <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>protected elements of the parties\u2019 works is reviewed <em>de novo. Boisson v. Banian, Ltd., </em>273 F.3d 262, 272 (2d Cir.2001). Here, aside from the fact that both illustrations depict a boy wearing glasses, there is no similarity between the two works. Accordingly, the District Court correctly dismissed Stouffer\u2019s copyright claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The District Court\u2019s sanctions and award of attorneys\u2019 fees was warranted. Such an award is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Schlaifer Nance &amp; Co., Inc. v. Estate of Warhol, </em>194 F.3d 323, 333 (2d Cir.1999). Beyond the powers expressly conferred by statute, federal courts have the inherent power to sanction a party for conduct which abuses the judicial process. <em>See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 46, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991). Here, the District Court found clear and convincing evidence that Stouffer had submitted falsified evidence in this litigation, and we adopt its findings and affirm its sanction against Stouffer in the amount of $50,000. We likewise affirm the statutory award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to Plaintiffs with respect to their defense of Stouffer\u2019s trademark claims. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a). Further, we find it is appropriate in this case to award Plaintiffs all attorneys fees and costs that they incurred on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">For these reasons, the Court hereby AFFIRMS the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Stouffer\u2019s counterclaims, sanctioning Stouffer $50,000 and awarding Plaintiffs certain attorneys fees, and ORDERS Stouffer to pay all Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys fees and costs incurred on appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
