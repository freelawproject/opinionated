The district court dismissed the indictment without prejudice under the anti-shuttling provisions of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (\u201cLADA\u201d), 18 U.S.CApp. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 2, art. LV(e) &amp; 9(1). Following re-indictment, a jury convicted Smith on all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Smith appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to dismiss his first indictment with prejudice, claiming that the district court failed to consider the effect that one of section 9(l)\u2019s three factors \u2014 the \u201cseriousness of the [defendant\u2019s] offense\u201d \u2014 had on its decision to dismiss without, as opposed to with, prejudice. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9(1). We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s dismissal of the indictment without prejudice. <em>United States v. Kurt, </em>945 F.2d 248, 252 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The district court discussed section 9(l)\u2019s three-factor standard in its June 7, 2002 Order setting Smith\u2019s motion for hearing, and the Government argued the seriousness of Smith\u2019s offense at the hearing. Though the district court did not make an express finding to the effect, Smith\u2019s offense was, in fact, quite serious. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Tummolo, </em>822 F.Supp. 1561, 1565 (S.D.Fla.1993) (holding that armed robbery and being a felon in possession are \u201cserious offenses\u201d for section 9(1) purposes). Coupled with the district court\u2019s findings on the other two section 9(1) factors, dismissal without prejudice was appropriate. <em>See Harman v. Apfel, </em>211 F.3d 1172, 1174 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]he decision of a trial court is reversed under the abuse of discretion standard only when the appellate court is convinced firmly that the reviewed decision lies beyond the pale of reasonable justification under the circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Smith also appeals the district court\u2019s jury instruction on the interstate commerce element of his Hobbs Act violation. Smith contends that Jury Instruction No. 19 impermissibly eviscerated the requirement that, to establish a Hobbs Act violation, the Government must establish that the robbery had some actual \u2014 not merely probable or potential \u2014 adverse effect on interstate commerce. This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Atcheson, </em>94 F.3d 1237, 1243 (9th Cir.1996), where we held that \u201cthe jurisdictional requirement is satisfied \u2018by proof of a probable or potential impact.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b214-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
