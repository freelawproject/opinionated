Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201cIt can be reversed only if the evidence presented ... was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When an alien seeks to overturn the BIA\u2019s adverse determination \u201che must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. at 817; <em>see also Ghaly v. INS, 58 </em>F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995). Credibility determinations are judged by the same basic standard. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002); Cor<em>don-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000); <em>de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997). In that area, however, we have added that the determination \u201c \u2018must be supported by a specific, cogent reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>de Leon-Barrios, </em>116 F.3d at 393 (citation omitted); <em>see also Gui, </em>280 F.3d at 1225; <em>Akinmade v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 951, 954 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">Here Selvaratnam\u2019s claim failed because the BIA, in reliance on the IJ\u2019s decision, determined that Selvaratnam was not credible. We are unable to say that the determination was not supported by substantial evidence in the record. His inconsistencies went to the very heart of his asylum claim. <em>See de Leon-Barrios, </em>116 F.3d at 394. For example, when he arrived at the airport in Honolulu, he said that he had not been arrested or confined in a jail or prison, but suggested that persecution might occur in the future. That alone is not dispositive. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>292 F.3d 1017, 1021-24 (9th Cir.2002). But he attempted to explain that omission with contradictory statements, <em>viz., </em>(1) he did so state, but it was not taken down; (2) he did not so state because he was afraid that he might be sent back to Sri Lanka, and he did not want to insult his government; (3) he feared that the INS would beat him. Moreover, his story about the severity of the torture to which he was subjected seemed to grow over time. The grossest part was not contained in earlier statements, or in his asylum application, or even, apparently, initially recounted to his attorney. It did not come out until the hearing itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>On this record, we cannot say that \u201cno reasonable factfinder could fail to find\u201d him credible. <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 484, 112 S.Ct. at 817. Thus, the BIA could properly determine that he was not eligible for asylum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Nor did the BIA err when it determined that Selvaratnam was not entitled to relief under the Torture Convention. It is true that the standard under that Convention is not identical with the standard for asylum, and a person\u2019s lack of credibility might result in denial of relief under the latter without absolutely foreclosing relief under the former. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1282-84 (9th Cir.2001). However, on the information in this record, we cannot say that Selvaratnam has demonstrated that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to Sri Lanka. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b940-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-11\">.
