We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We vacate and remand the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-18\">The district court erred as a matter of law by failing to make the appropriate factual findings to support a downward departure for aberrant behavior under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.20. We recently have held that prior to departing downward, a sentencing court must make separate determinations that the case is extraordinary and that the behavior was aberrant. <em>United States v. Guerrero, </em>333 F.3d 1078, 1082 (9th Cir.2003). Although it appears that the factual circumstances of this case warrant a downward departure for aberrant behavior, the district court\u2019s failure to separately determine both that the case is extraordinary and the behavior aberrant requires us to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-19\">The district court also erred in ordering that the fine imposed on Carey be distributed to the Missoula County School District rather than the Crime Victims Fund. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10601(b)(1) (\u201cthere shall be deposited in the Fund ... all fines that are collected from persons convicted of offenses against the United States.\u201d). Carey, however, has already paid the fine to the Clerk of the Court. The monies may very well have been delivered to the school district, rendering any redistrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>ution order moot. We therefore remand the question whether the fine is technically distributable to the proper entity, the Crime Victims Fund, to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b685-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
