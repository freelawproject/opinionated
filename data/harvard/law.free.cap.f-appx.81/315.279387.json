Ground Heaters, Inc. and T.H.E. Machine Company have not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-25\">The district court certified that portion of its order holding that \u201cthe file wrapper contents of Canadian Patent No. 1,158,119 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>constitute a printed publication for purposes of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b).\u201d Bruckelmyer asserts that the broader controlling question of law is whether \u201cthe contents of a foreign country\u2019s patent file wrapper, available only in one foreign patent office, constitute a printed publication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">This court determines for itself whether it will grant permission to appeal an interlocutory order certified by a trial court. <em>See In re Convertible Rowing Exerciser Patent Litigation, </em>903 F.2d 822 (Fed.Cir.1990). Such a ruling is within this court\u2019s complete discretion. <em>Id. </em>In this case, we are not convinced that immediate interlocutory review of the issues raised is warranted. Any review of the issues may await an appeal after final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Bruckelmyer\u2019s petition for permission to appeal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
