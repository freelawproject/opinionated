We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review credibility findings for substantial evidence. <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149-50 (9th Cir.1999). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-24\">The IJ noted many inconsistent or confusing aspects of Kaur\u2019s testimony. For example, in her asylum application, Kaur stated that her father had been arrested three times, but she testified during her hearing that he had only been arrested twice. Kaur testified that her brother had disappeared on March 11, 1992, but she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>could not explain how she knew the date of his disappearance and was unclear on how she came to learn that he had disappeared. Nor could Kaur name the faction her brother belonged to. Taken together, the inconsistencies are sufficiently material to permit an adverse credibility finding. <em>See id. </em>at 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b692-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
