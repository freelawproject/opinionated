R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of his action under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) against the United States and the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d), alleging that prison guards wrongfully confiscated and lost or destroyed Corbeil\u2019s postage stamps after searching his cell. The district court dismissed Corbeil\u2019s FTCA claim based on its conclusion that his case fell within an exception to the FTCA\u2019s waiver of immunity, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c), and therefore the United States retained its sovereign immunity in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-21\">Corbeil contends that the district court erred in applying the FTCA\u2019s \u201cdetention of goods\u201d exception to his case, because the BOP officials were not \u201claw enforcement officials,\u201d and his property was not \u201cdetained\u201d but instead \u201cseized.\u201d Corbeil\u2019s contention is foreclosed by this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Bramwell v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, </em>348 F.3d 804 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing his FTCA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b694-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
