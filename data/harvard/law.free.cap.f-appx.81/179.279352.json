The district court agreed. Maglieri appeals on two grounds: (1) whether the ALJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence; and (2) whether the ALJ made adequate credibility findings regarding Maglieri\u2019s testimony and evidence offered by Maglieri\u2019s father. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">A district court\u2019s affirmance of an ALJ\u2019s decision is reviewed de novo. <em>Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1097 (9th Cir.1999). A reviewing court must affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision unless the ALJ\u2019s findings are unsupported by substantial evidence or based on legal error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">ALJ Franks\u2019 decision stated that Maglieri\u2019s explanation for his earned income \u2014 that he did not work and was only paid to maintain coverage under the group insurance carried by his father\u2019s businesses \u2014 amounted to an admission of fraud against an insurance provider. Maglieri\u2019s duplicitous role in the admitted insurance fraud led ALJ Franks to conclude that Maglieri was not generally credible. Further, ALJ Franks found that Maglieri\u2019s allegations and testimony were inconsistent and contradictory. For example, the argument that Maglieri was only maintained as an employee to retain health benefits would be more plausible if he received only a token amount of income, instead of receiving substantial, differing, and often increasing amounts. ALJ Franks\u2019 decision is also supported by the fact that Maglieri earned $22,792 in self-employment income after his alleged disability on-set date, by his orthopedic surgeon\u2019s statement in a progress report that Maglieri was \u201cback working full time,\u201d and by Maglieri\u2019s past experience as a business advisor \u2014 the same position for which he was being paid as an employee. In sum, ALJ Franks\u2019 decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">ALJ Franks\u2019 credibility findings were also sufficient. He specifically made detailed, well reasoned findings, clearly stating why he believed Maglieri\u2019s testimony was not credible. Although ALJ Franks did not make explicit findings regarding the unverified letter offered by Maglieri\u2019s father, that failure was not erroneous, as ALJ Franks was not required to evaluate evidence of insurance fraud calculated to provide disability benefits for Maglieri. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(u)(l)(B) (\u201cWhen redetermining the entitlement ... under this subchapter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall disregard any evidence if there is reason to believe that fraud or similar fault was involved in the providing of such evidence.\u201d). Finally, we decline to consider Maglieri\u2019s argument that ALJ Franks also erred by failing to consider evidence offered by Kathy Owen, controller of his father\u2019s businesses. An issue not preserved before the district court will not be considered on appeal. <em>Echazabal v. Chevron USA, Inc., </em>336 F.3d 1023, 1035 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b211-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
