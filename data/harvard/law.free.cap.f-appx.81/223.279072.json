The district court\u2019s statement \u2014 that the argument for a cultural assimilation departure \u201ccertainly ... is not persuasive to the Court in this case\u201d given Campos-Lara\u2019s criminal history \u2014 indicates, rather, that the district court believed that a cultural-assimilation departure was unwarranted in light of the facts of Campos-Lara\u2019s particular case. Because the district court concluded as a factual matter that the evidence of Campos-Lara\u2019s cultural assimilation was insufficient to justify a downward departure, we lack jurisdiction to review its decision. <em>United States v. Lipman, </em>133 F.3d 726, 732 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">The record does not support Campos-Lara\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s statements implied a bias that deprived him of an objective, impartial, and fair consideration of the merits of his request for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">This appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b256-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
