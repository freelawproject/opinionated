Johnson contends that he is a layman of law and that the ends of justice require counsel be appointed to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">This is a relatively straight-forward, fact-intensive case that does not require Johnson to demonstrate legal skills or training to inform the court adequately of his allegations. Johnson\u2019s claims are based on his own direct experiences and are not likely to require extensive investigation. Johnson has not shown exceptional circumstances warranting the appointment of counsel. <em>See Feist v. Jefferson County Comm\u2019rs Court, </em>778 F.2d 250, 253 (5th Cir.1985). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b874-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
