She appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Kelly seeks resentencing, arguing that the District Court erred in not granting her relief from the mandatory statutory minimum, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6) and 5C1.2 (2002). Kelly points to the plea agreement, in which the parties stated that they believed Kelly had a Category I criminal history, and in which they agreed that she would receive an additional two-level reduction in her offense level if she was entitled to safety-valve relief. At sentencing, however, Kelly did not dispute the fact that she had two criminal history points, which precluded safety-valve relief. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l). The mistaken assumption that Kelly had about her own criminal history and resulting sentence was not a basis for the court to grant safety-valve relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-15\">.
