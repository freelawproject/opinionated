We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We affirm the BIA\u2019s order of removal, but remand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with <em>Ali v. Ashcroft, </em>346 F.3d 873 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">Because the facts are known to the parties we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">We review the BIA\u2019s findings for substantial evidence. <em>See Andriasian v. INS, </em>180 F.3d 1033, 1040 (9th Cir.1999). The BIA\u2019s decision must be upheld unless the evidence would compel a reasonable adjudicator to reach a contrary result. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Where, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without issuing an opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s ruling. <em>See He v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 593, 595-96 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-14\">The IJ denied Ibrahim\u2019s application solely on the basis of an adverse credibility finding. Under the substantial evidence standard, the IJ \u201cmust have a legitimate articulable basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility, and must offer a specific, cogent reason for any stated disbelief.\u201d <em>Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 342 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-15\">Two of the IJ\u2019s reasons for questioning Ibrahim\u2019s credibility were cogent, and these reasons suffice to uphold the IJ\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-16\">First, Ibrahim did not provide verification for the critical parts of his story concerning his time in the Kenyan refugee camps and his journey to America. We have held that \u201cwhere the IJ has reason to question the applicant\u2019s credibility, and the applicant fails to produce non-duplicative, material, easily available corroborating evidence and provides no credible explanation for such failure, an adverse credibility finding will withstand appellate review.\u201d <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-17\">In this case the IJ had reason to question Ibrahim\u2019s credibility. The IJ gave Ibrahim multiple opportunities to explain his failure to obtain confirmation of his presence in Kenya and his travels. Ibrahim, however, did not identify any specific circumstances that impeded his gathering of evidence. His explanations for why he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>did not contact the airplane or bus companies, or make a greater effort to contact his family and friends in Kenya, were not credible or sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Second, Ibrahim\u2019s vague, contradictory testimony about his sister provided a sound basis for the IJ legitimately to disbelieve him. Inconsistencies in testimony in an asylum application may provide a cogent reason for an adverse credibility finding if the inconsistencies are \u201csubstantial.\u201d <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, 257 </em>F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). On the other hand, \u201c[m]inor inconsistencies ... that do not relate to the basis of an applicant\u2019s alleged fear of persecution, go to the heart of the asylum claim, or reveal anything about an asylum applicant\u2019s fear for his safety are insufficient to support an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, 660 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Ibrahim\u2019s testimony about the abduction of his sister contained substantial inconsistencies. The abduction was closely connected in time and place to the heart of Ibrahim\u2019s asylum claim \u2014 his fear of persecution arising from the events of January 24, 1991. Nevertheless, Ibrahim could not account for the significant discrepancy in dates or for how his sister found the family-</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Accordingly, the record does not compel a contrary result as to the IJ\u2019s negative credibility finding, and we must affirm the BIA\u2019s judgment upholding the IJ\u2019s order of removal. However, we remand to the BIA for a reconsideration of Ibrahim\u2019s case in connection with one of our recent decisions. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">In the recent decision, <em>Ali, </em>346 F.3d at 886, we held that Somali detainees may not be removed to Somalia because it lacks a functioning government to accept them. We interpreted 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(2) to authorize the Attorney General to remove an alien only to a country whose government is willing to accept the alien. <em>See id. </em>at 881-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">In addition, we upheld the district court\u2019s certification of a nationwide habeas and declaratory class composed of all persons in the United States who are subject to orders of removal to Somalia, and the district court\u2019s accompanying order to the INS not to remove any person in this nationwide class to Somalia. <em>See id. </em>at 876, 888-89. The <em>Ali </em>injunction, so long as it remains in force, appears to bar Ibrahim\u2019s deportation to Somalia, where civil war continues and no functioning government exists to accept him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">We remand for further proceedings in light of <em>Ali.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1012-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
