He argues that the district court erred by (1) denying his proposed good faith jury instruction, and (2) excluding his expert witness testimony. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">The standard of review of the district court\u2019s denial of a proposed jury instruction turns on the nature of the error alleged. <em>See United States v. Dixon, </em>201 F.3d 1223, 1230 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Knapp, </em>120 F.3d 928, 930 (9th Cir.1997). We review de novo whether the district court\u2019s instructions adequately presented the defendant\u2019s theory of the case. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>217 F.3d 746, 750 (9th Cir.2000); however, its \u201cprecise formulation\u201d of the instructions is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Dixon, </em>201 F.3d at 1230; <em>Knapp, </em>120 F.3d at 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">A mail fraud defendant has no right to a \u201cgood faith\u201d instruction when the jury has been adequately instructed with regard to the intent required to be found guilty of the crime charged. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Frega, </em>179 F.3d 793, 804 (9th Cir.1999) (where district court provided adequate instruction on specific intent element of mail fraud, no good faith defense instruction was required); <em>United States v. Dees, </em>34 F.3d 838, 842 (9th Cir.1994) (specific good faith instruction is unnecessary where the court has already adequately instructed the jury as to specific intent); <em>United States v. Sarno, </em>73 F.3d 1470, 1487 (9th Cir.1995) (notwithstanding normal rules governing theory of defense requests, the failure to give instruction on good faith defense is not fatal so long as the jury is clearly instructed as to the necessity of specific intent as an element of crime). As the district court defined intent to defraud, no good faith instruction was necessary at all, and certainly not the defendant\u2019s specific instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-16\">Sproul\u2019s proposed instruction asked that the district court charge that good faith is \u201ca complete defense.\u201d While accurate, it expressed no concept not included in the district court\u2019s instruction that if the jury believed Sproul\u2019s representations were made in good faith it \u201cshould acquit.\u201d His instruction also went further to include his version of the facts, i.e., his alleged reliance upon his customer Buonocore\u2019s approval of the invoices. \u201cAs a general matter, a district court may refuse to give a jury instruction \u2018if its language gives undue emphasis to defendant\u2019s version of the facts rather than being a statement of appropriate principles of [the] law for the jury to apply to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Velarde-Gomez, </em>224 F.3d 1062, 1075 (9th Cir.2000) (decision vacated on other grounds) (quoting <em>United States v. Goland, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>959 F.2d 1449, 1453 (9th Cir.1992)). The failure to specifically reference the source of Sproul\u2019s good faith belief was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The exclusion of Sproul\u2019s expert witness is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Benavidez-Benavidez, 217 </em>F.3d 720, 723 (9th Cir.2000). We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s exclusion of the defense expert\u2019s testimony regarding the content of the ATF regulations regarding the small winery tax credit. Sproul was charged with defrauding the receiver by misrepresenting the tax rate he billed in the invoices. Nothing the expert proffered was relevant to the propriety of failing to disclose the credit to the receiver. He offered no opinion regarding the information a receiver would need to administer a winery. To the extent the expert was called to testify about the advice he would give to a winery client in its business dealing with other wineries, that evidence was not germane to the information Sproul fraudulently withheld from the receiver, his duty to divulge it, or his good faith belief that he had no duty to truthfully disclose that he claimed the credit while invoicing for the full amount of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b721-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
