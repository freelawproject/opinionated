In June 1999, Duzant was transferred to a new department supervised by Janis Moore (\u201cMoore\u201d), who shortly thereafter began closely tracking his work and giving him deadlines he found unreasonable. Moore is Caucasian, and Duzant was the only African-American under her supervision. Duzant claims Moore monitored his work more closely than that of other employees because he is African-American. Additionally, Duzant claims Moore discriminated against him on account of his race by giving him an unsatisfactory performance review, chastising him for speaking with another African-American employee, and not offering him overtime work when all other employees in his department clocked an average of over 240 overtime hours.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The district court found that only Moore\u2019s failure to offer Duzant overtime could constitute an adverse employment action under Title VII, but thereafter found that Duzant had failed to proffer sufficient evidence of Moore\u2019s discriminatory intent to survive summary judgment. Duzant\u2019s appeal is limited to challenging the district court\u2019s conclusion that a reasonable jury could not, on the basis of the proffered evidence, infer that race motivated the denial of overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Duzant premises his prima facie case of discrimination on the claim that all other employees in his department received overtime hours while he, the only African-American, did not. EBC explains that Duzant was given no overtime because all of the overtime work that was \u201ccritical\u201d during the period of time Duzant worked in Moore\u2019s department was two-dimensional (\u201c2-D\u201d) design, and Duzant was the only exclusively 3-D designer in the department. Because EBC has put forward \u201ca legitimate non-discriminatory reason\u201d for the disparity, <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 142, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (quoting <em>Texas Dep\u2019t. of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 254, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)), \u201cthe burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the real reason for the adverse employment decision was discrimination.\u201d <em>Mandell v. County of Suffolk, </em>316 F.3d 368, 381 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Duzant submits evidence that EBC\u2019s justification is pretextual and more evidence of his acrimonious relationship with Moore. Duzant argues that, taken together, this evidence provides a sufficient basis for a jury to conclude that EBC\u2019s justification is pretext for discrimination. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">Duzant averred that there were other designers is his department \u2014 designers whom defendant concedes received over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>time \u2014 -who were doing 8-D work. Duzant further testified in his deposition that he was capable of doing the work for which other designers were being paid overtime, and that Moore knew he was capable of doing such work. Taking these facts as true and viewing all others in a light most favorable to Duzant, <em>see, e.g., Terry v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir.2003), we cannot agree that EBC either \u201c \u2018conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason\u2019 \u201d for denying Duzant overtime, or that \u201c \u2018there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zimmermann v. Assocs. First Capital Corp., </em>251 F.3d 376, 381 (2d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 148).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">As evidence of racial discrimination, Duzant points to his proof of pretext, Moore\u2019s close tracking of him, Moore\u2019s completion of a performance review of him when his contract did not permit such evaluations, and Moore\u2019s scolding of him for speaking with another African-American employee on one occasion. Moore testified in her deposition that Duzant was only one of a handful of her employees whose work she tracked, and she pointed to one other Caucasian employee whose work she had found unsatisfactory. Moore further provides non-diseriminatory reasons for each of the incidents of which Duzant complains, but it is not our role on a motion for summary judgment to decide whose version of events is the more credible. Moreover, even the Caucasian employee whom Moore stated she monitored in a manner similar to Duzant received overtime while Duzant did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In Title VII cases, we have made clear that summary judgment usually \u201cmay be defeated where \u2018a plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer\u2019s asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Byrnie v. Town of Cromwell, </em>243 F.3d 93, 102 (2d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at <em>148); see also Zimmermann, </em>251 F.3d at 381 (\u201c \u2018[C]ircumstances in which plaintiffs will be required to submit evidence beyond\u2019 evidence establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case and evidence permitting a finding that a proffered explanation was false \u2018in order to survive a motion for judgment as a matter of law ... will be uncommon.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 154 (Ginsburg, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">In the case at bar, the district court concluded that \u201ca reasonable juror would be bound to find that it is at least as likely that Moore failed to give [Duzant] overtime because of [personal] animosity between the two\u201d than it is that she failed to give him overtime because of racial animus. While there was undisputed evidence that Moore and Duzant did not get along, it is nonetheless for a jury to weigh this evidence against the circumstantial evidence of racial animus and to make a finding as to Moore\u2019s actual motivation. Although racial animus may well have played no part in Moore\u2019s failure to grant Duzant overtime, we cannot say that no reasonable juror could conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The judgment, therefore, is VACATED and the case REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\">. Prior to filing the instant action, Duzant filed a grievance through his union complaining that his unsatisfactory performance review and the failure to give him overtime ran afoul of his employment contract. As a re-suit, the performance review was ultimately stricken from Duzant\u2019s personnel record, and he was paid a sum equivalent to 80 hours of overtime.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
