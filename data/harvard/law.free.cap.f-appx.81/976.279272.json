Hassan (\u201cHassan\u201d) appeals the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u2019s\u201d) denial of her application for asylum. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We reverse the BIA\u2019s final order of removal and grant Hassan\u2019s petition for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-17\">Because the facts are known to the parties we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-18\">We review the BIA\u2019s findings for substantial evidence. <em>See Andriasian v. INS, </em>180 F.3d 1033, 1040 (9th Cir.1999). The BIA\u2019s decision must be upheld unless the evidence would compel a reasonable adjudicator to reach a contrary result. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). \u201cWhere, as here, the BIA reviews the IJ\u2019s decision de novo, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s opinion is expressly adopted.\u201d <em>Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-19\">The BIA upheld the order of removal in part because it found that the IJ\u2019s negative credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. We disagree. Under the substantial evidence standard, the IJ \u201cmust have a legitimate articulable basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility, and must offer a specific, cogent reason for any stated disbelief.\u201d <em>Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 342 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-20\">The fact that Hassan\u2019s rape was not mentioned in her asylum application form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>does not amount to a cogent reason supporting the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. The asylum officer\u2019s notes from the initial interview mentioned the rapes of Hassan\u2019s sisters and the fact that United Somali Congress soldiers touched Hassan \u201call over her body.\u201d Moreover, we have held that an applicant\u2019s failure to relate details about sexual assault or abuse at the first opportunity \u201ccannot reasonably be characterized as an inconsistency.\u201d <em>Paramasamy v. Ashcroft, </em>295 F.3d 1047, 1053 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cThat a woman who has suffered sexual abuse at the hands of male officials does not spontaneously reveal the details of that abuse to a male interviewer does not constitute an inconsistency from which it could reasonably be inferred that she is lying.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">The apparent inconsistency between Hassan\u2019s asylum form and her testimony as to the precise number of her attackers was not significant. \u201cMinor\u201d errors or inconsistencies \u201cthat do not relate to the basis of an applicant\u2019s alleged fear of persecution, go to the heart of the asylum claim, or reveal anything about an asylum applicant\u2019s fear for his safety are insufficient to support an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, 660 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">The record suggests that the confusion regarding Hassan\u2019s brother\u2019s escape to Kenya resulted from a translation problem. However, discrepancies that are \u201cpossibly the result of mistranslation or communication\u201d are not a legitimate basis for an adverse credibility finding. <em>Akinmade v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 951, 956 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">The IJ\u2019s last reason for doubting Hassan\u2019s credibility \u2014 that she was lying about her father\u2019s job and the family\u2019s subjection to burglaries \u2014 had no basis and was not supported by substantial evidence. \u201cSpeculation and conjecture cannot form the basis of an adverse credibility finding----\u201d <em>Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1071 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">In addition, the BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s finding that Hassan had been firmly resettled in Tanzania. We reverse since the record compels a contrary finding. An applicant is not eligible for asylum in the United States if she has been firmly resettled in another country. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi). \u201cAn alien is considered to be firmly resettled if, prior to arrival in the United States, he or she entered into another country with, or while in that country received, an offer of permanent resident status, citizenship, or some other type of permanent resettlement. ...\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.15. We have held that a \u201cduration of residence in a third country sufficient to support an inference of permanent resettlement in the absence of evidence to the contrary shifts the burden of proving absence of firm resettlement to the applicant.\u201d <em>Cheo v. INS, </em>162 F.3d 1227, 1229-30 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">In this case, the burden of proof shifted to Hassan because she lived in Tanzania for more than three years. Nevertheless, Hassan proved absence of firm resettlement. As the IJ acknowledged, the Tanzanian authorities did not extend an offer of permanent resettlement to Hassan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">The record also compels a contrary conclusion on Hassan\u2019s asylum claim. In order to be eligible for asylum, an applicant must show that she is unable or unwilling to return to her country of origin \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). We have defined a \u201cparticular social group\u201d as \u201cone united by voluntary association ... or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>an innate characteristic that is so fundamental to the identities or consciences of its members that members either cannot or should not be required to change it.\u201d <em>Hernandez-Montiel v. INS, </em>225 F.3d 1084, 1093 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">To qualify for asylum, an applicant must show that her fear of persecution is well-founded by showing that such fear is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>See Montecino v. INS, </em>915 F.2d 518, 521 (9th Cir.1990). Once an applicant establishes past persecution, a presumption arises that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Popova v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 1251, 1259 (9th Cir.2001). Under the current version of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A), in order to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear, the government must show by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a \u201cfundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear....\u201d <em>Baballah v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 981, 992 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Hassan established past persecution based upon a particular social group \u2014 her clan. Her credible testimony about being raped and separated from her family reflected a subjectively genuine fear of persecution. Numerous documents in the record provide objective evidence in support of Hassan\u2019s account of what happened to her in Mogadishu in January 1991. The government did not rebut the presumption that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">Finally, we note that in <em>Ali v. Ashcroft, </em>346 F.3d 873, 886 (9th Cir.2003), we held that Somali detainees may not be removed to Somalia because it lacks a functioning government to accept them. Hassan is a member of <em>All\u2019s </em>nationwide class of persons who are subject to orders of removal to Somalia, and accordingly she may not be removed to Somalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">We grant Hassan\u2019s petition for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"A3P\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1009-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
