The plaintiff, Jaime L. Robinson, brought this action against the defendant, Ronald R. Gamo, Jr.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking damages for personal injuries sustained as a result of an automobile accident that was caused by the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence and recklessness. The plaintiff appeals<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>rendered after the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, and subsequently denied the plaintiffs motions to set aside the verdict and for a new trial. We conclude that a claimant who has unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the full coverage limits of her own uninsured motorist policy has satisfied \u00a7 38a-845 (1) and, therefore, may bring an action to collect from the tortfeasor, either personally or through the association, with any recovery from either of those sources reduced by the full amount of those policy limits. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. In March, 2001, the plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident with the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, the plaintiff brought this action to recover both economic and noneconomic damages, claiming that she was entitled, inter alia, to compensatory and double and treble damages pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-295,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for injuries caused by the defendant\u2019s allegedly negligent and reckless conduct. At the time of the accident, the defendant had an automobile liability insurance policy from Reliance Insurance Company of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Permsylvania (Reliance), with bodily injury coverage in the amount of $20,000. Reliance, however, became insolvent prior to the commencement of this action, and the association assumed the defense pursuant to the Connecticut Insurance Guaranty Association Act (guaranty act), General Statutes \u00a7 38a-836 et seq. The plaintiff then filed a claim with her automobile insurer, the United States Automobile Association (USAA), because she had uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage with policy limits of $100,000 per person. The plaintiff then filed a civil action against USAA to recover that sum, which she subsequently withdrew after settling her coverage claim against USAA for $80,000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">In his answer, the defendant raised multiple special defenses, including that: (1) he is entitled to an automatic reduction of any adverse judgment by the amount paid to the plaintiff by any solvent insurer, the association, or other source relating to the plaintiffs claim; and (2) pursuant to \u00a7 38a-845 (1), the defendant is not liable to pay an adverse judgment because the plaintiff failed to exhaust all solvent insurance, governmental insurance or guaranty programs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At trial, after the plaintiff presented her case-in-chief, the defendant moved for a directed verdict. The trial court granted that motion, concluding orally that, although directed verdicts are \u201cdisfavored,\u201d the plaintiff had failed to exhaust her rights under her uninsured motorist insurance policy with USAA because she had settled for $80,000, when the policy limit was $100,000. The trial court relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>an affidavit from Lawrence Connelli, an attorney for USAA, stating that the settlement was based on that company\u2019s valuation of the case, with no consideration given to any potential offsetting sums from the association or other sources. The trial court also cited the exhaustion language from the statute, as well as <em>Doucette </em>v. <em>Pomes, </em>247 Conn. 442, 724 A.2d 481 (1991), and <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn., </em>711 F. Sup. 70 (D. Conn. 1989), to support its conclusion. The trial court further concluded that, although the association \u201cis not an actual party in this case . . . [t]he court finds also that if there was a judgment against the . . . defendant, [the association] would have to pay that amount just as any insurance company who is not a party and in a regular lawsuit, driver versus driver, the insurance company would have to pay. [The association] in this case bears the financial responsibility they have, the financial interest in this case and that they would be required to pay. And any judgment against the . . . defendant, they are standing in the shoes of his company Reliance which is insolvent and doesn\u2019t exist any more.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, the trial court rendered judgment for the defendant in accordance with the directed verdict,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff raises a litany of claims that boil down to a single dispositive issue, namely, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the plaintiffs settlement of her uninsured motorist claim for less than her policy limits, constitutes the required exhaustion of that insurance policy under \u00a7 38a-845 (l).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that the plain language of the statute does not require that she exhaust the policy limits in their entirety, but rather only her \u201crights\u201d under the policy. The plaintiff further contends that her rights under that policy are defined by the uninsured and underinsured motorist statute, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (b),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that she, therefore, potentially may recover an additional $20,000 from the association because that statute permits her to recover the limit of her uninsured motorist policy, which is $100,000. The defendant, citing <em>Carrier </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>316 Or. 341, 851 P.2d 851 (1993), argues in response that the word \u201cexhaust\u201d requires the plaintiff to recover the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>entire $100,000 policy limit before she may recover any moneys either from the association or a person insured by the association pursuant to the guaranty act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant also contends that his construction of \u00a7 38a-845 (1) is consistent both with the common usage of the word \u201cexhaust,\u201d and the purpose of the guaranty act as a source of last resort for the payment of tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u201cThe standards for appellate review of a directed verdict are well settled. Directed verdicts are not favored. ... A trial court should direct a verdict only when a jury could not reasonably and legally have reached any other conclusion. ... In reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision to direct a verdict in favor of a defendant we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. . . . Although it is the jury\u2019s right to draw logical deductions and make reasonable inferences from the facts proven ... it may not resort to mere conjecture and speculation. ... A directed verdict is justified if . . . the evidence is so weak that it would be proper for the court to set aside a verdict rendered for the other party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coughlin </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>270 Conn. 487, 497-98, 853 A.2d 460 (2004). In the present case, the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was based on its interpretation of \u00a7 38a-845 (1). Accordingly, this presents an issue of statutory construction over which our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">We begin with the text of \u00a7 38a-845 (1), which provides: \u201cAny person having a claim against an insurer under any provision in an insurance policy, other than a policy of an insolvent insurer, which is also a covered claim under sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive, <em>shall exhaust first his rights under such policy. </em>Any amount payable on a covered claim under said sections shall be reduced by the amount <em>recoverable </em>under the claimant\u2019s insurance policy or chapter 568.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">We begin with the common usage and ordinary meaning of the words of the statute that are at issue, namely, \u201cexhaust\u201d and \u201crights,\u201d which are \u201cdetermined appropriately by review of [their] dictionary definition[s] . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>272 Conn. 410, 421 n.12, 862 A.2d 292 (2004). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201cexhaust,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cto use up the whole supply or store of: expend or consume entirely . . . .\u201d The otherwise plain meaning of the word \u201cexhaust\u201d is, however, rendered ambiguous by the use of the word \u201crights\u201d with respect to the relevant insurance policy. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines the word \u201cright\u201d in relevant part as \u201csomething to which one has a just claim: as ... a power or privilege vested in a person by the law to demand action or forbearance at the hands of another ... a claim recognized and delimited by law for the purpose of securing it . . . .\u201d Although the plaintiffs uninsured motorist policy has a coverage limit of $100,000, she may not necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>have, in all cases, a just claim to that full amount. Moreover, the statute is silent as to whether \u201cexhaustion\u201d constitutes a proper attempt, regardless of success, at obtaining those policy limits. The statute is, therefore, ambiguous, and we may look to extratextual evidence to determine its meaning. See General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The legislative history of the guaranty act sheds no light on the extent of the plaintiffs obligation to \u201cexhaust\u201d her rights under the uninsured motorist policy. The legislative history does, however, explain the purpose of the association, which \u201cwas established for the purpose of providing a limited form of protection for policyholders and claimants in the event of insurer insolvency. The protection it provides is limited based upon its status as a nonprofit entity and the method by which it is funded. Specifically, the association is a nonprofit legal entity created by statute to which all persons licensed to transact insurance in the state must belong. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38a-838 (8) and 38a-839. When an insurer is determined to be insolvent under \u00a7 38a-838 (7), the association becomes obligated pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 38a-841, to the extent of covered claims within certain limits. The rates and premiums charged by member insurers are authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 38a-849 to include amounts sufficient to recoup the assessments levied upon insurers by the association. Because \u00a7 38a-849 provides that insurers may pass on the costs of the assessments made against them by the association, it is in reality policyholders who pay for the protections afforded by the association. Limitations on the association\u2019s obligations, therefore, provide another form of protection against increased premiums for policyholders in addition to the primary protection afforded all claimants against losses resulting from insurer insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u201cThe legislative history confirms that the association was established for the benefit of consumers. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>public hearing held prior to passage of the bill proposing the creation of the association, Peter Kelly, a member of the state insurance department stated: \u2018[T]his bill provides the means to avoid financial loss to Connecticut residents because of the insolvency of [insurance companies]. ... In the late 1960s . . . [consumers were being hurt and on a personal scale, an insolvency can be ruinous. . . . [The bill] provides the means for all insurance companies assessed to recover from the entire insured residents of this state the cost of such assessments so that it is really not an assessment on a company but an assessment on the entire residents of the state who are insured after the fact. This is spreading the risk amongst all Connecticut residents. ... I think you must remember that industry is not paying the cost. This bill provides that Connecticut residents will pay the cost. . . . This bill provides for protections of residents of this state and the residents if any assessments are ever made will pay for the cost of such assessments in their future insurance premiums.\u2019 Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Insurance and Real Estate, 1971 Sess., pp. 55-59.\u201d <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>243 Conn. 438, 451-52, 705 A.2d 1012 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Inasmuch as the guaranty act is based on a model statute drafted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that has been adopted in substantial part by the legislatures of many of our sister states; see 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1971 Sess., p. 3624, remarks of Representative Michael Colucci; we find guidance in on point court decisions from those states with respect to this issue of first impression in our state.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>Doucette </em>v. <em>Pomes, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 464 (relying on model regulations and report to conclude that self-insurer is not \u201cinsurer\u201d under guaranty act). These decisions demonstrate that our sister states have taken divergent views toward the competing policy considerations created by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">We begin with the distinct minority position, seemingly endorsed by the plaintiff in her brief, which is that a policyholder satisfies applicable exhaustion requirements by entering into a good faith settlement with the uninsured motorist insurer, even if that settlement is for less than the policy limits. See <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Dept. of State, </em>394 Mich. 350, 357, 231 N.W.2d 43 (1975); <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>234 N.W.2d 22, 24-25 (N.D. 1975); see also <em>Alabama Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Colonial Freight Systems, Inc., 537 </em>So. 2d 475, 476 (Ala. 1988) (relying on second sentence of exhaustion statute, which provided for reduction by \u201c \u2018amount of any recovery,\u2019 \u201d and concluding that plaintiffs recovery from fund should be reduced by $25,000 settlement rather than $50,000 policy limit); <em>Patel </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>138 N.C. App. 693, 695-96, 531 S.E.2d 879 (2000) (relying on second sentence of exhaustion statute, which provided for reduction by \u201c \u2018amount of any recovery\u2019 \u201d and concluding that plaintiff satisfied exhaustion requirement by obtaining arbitration award for claim against uninsured motorist carrier, even when award was less than policy limits). These courts conclude that there is no absolute \u201cright\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>to the full value of the policy, and that the insured\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to a given sum in a particular case is determined on a case-by-case basis. See <em>Patel </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>supra, 696 (\u201c[p]laintiff pursued her claim in a legally sanctioned manner, and thus, exhausted her \u2018right\u2019 under the [insurance] policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Other states require the complete recovery of the limits of the uninsured motorist policy before the plaintiff may recover from the uninsured tortfeasor through the state guaranty fund or personally, if the damages exceed the available uninsured motorist coverage. These states emphasize the meaning of the word \u201cexhaust\u201d as \u201cto use up entirely,\u201d as well as the guaranty act\u2019s purpose of serving as a \u201clast resort\u201d protection for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. They also note the possibility of collusive settlements between plaintiffs and their still solvent uninsured motorist insurers. See <em>Witkowski </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>576 A.2d 669, 671-72 (Del. Super. 1989); <em>Carrier </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>supra, 316 Or. 348-49; <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Valley Lines, Inc., </em>421 Pa. Super. 362, 369-70, 617 A.2d 1335 <em>(1992);</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em>Prutzman v. Armstrong, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>90 Wash. 2d 118, 121-22, 579 P.2d 359 (1978); see also <em>Jackson Brook Institute, Inc. </em>v. <em>Maine Ins. Guaranty Assn., </em>861 A.2d 652, 657 (Me. 2004) (relying on plain meaning of word \u201c \u2018exhaust\u2019 \u201d in concluding that settlement of directors and officers insurance claim for less than policy limits did not satisfy statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The majority of the states considering this issue have staked out a middle ground between these two poles. We find particularly persuasive the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hasemann </em>v. <em>White, </em>177 Ill. 2d 414, 416, 686 N.E.2d 571 (1997), wherein the plaintiffs brought a personal injury action against the defendants to recover damages for injuries arising from an automobile accident. The defendants\u2019 insurer became insolvent and the state guaranty fund took over the defense. Id. The two plaintiffs made a claim against their uninsured motorist carrier and settled for $7500 and $3000 under a policy with a $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident limit. Id. Thereafter, the plaintiffs obtained arbitration awards of $9000 and $4000 against the defendants, and those awards were set off by the amount actually received by the plaintiffs under their uninsured motorist coverage. Id., 416-17. The defendants appealed, claiming that the awards should have been set off by the full policy limits, rather than the actual amounts received, because the plaintiffs had failed to \u201cexhaust\u201d their rights under their uninsured motorist policy, as was required by the applicable statute.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id., 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>After reviewing the various states\u2019 different approaches to determining a plaintiffs obligation with respect to the exhaustion of his or her rights under uninsured motorist coverage, the Illinois court adopted the majority position, which it described as \u201ca middle course\u201d holding that \u201ca settlement does constitute an exhaustion of rights, but that the guaranty fund\u2019s liability is reduced by the full amount of the uninsured-motorist policy limits, regardless of the amount that the claimant actually received under the settlement.\u201d Id., 419. The court noted \u201can obvious tension between the other possible constructions of the nonduplication provision and the language and purpose of the [guaranty act]. On the one hand, limiting the [Illinois Insurance Guaranty Fund\u2019s] setoff to the amount actually received by the claimant under the settlement would invite collusion and provide little incentive for a claimant to pursue a full and fair settlement with his own carrier. On the other hand, requiring a claimant to fully litigate his uninsured-motorist claim in order to satisfy the exhaustion requirement would be contrary to our public policy which encourages the settlement of claims.\u201d Id., 420. The court also stated that the majority rule is consistent with the \u201c[t]he rationale behind the nonduplication provision [which] is to insure that the Fund is a recovery of last resort by requiring that the claimant first seek to cover his loss with funds available from other insurers. Consistent with this rationale, a claimant who settles with his uninsured-motorist carrier for less than the policy limit should be assumed to have received the policy limit for purposes of assessing Fund liability. When a claimant settles with his own carrier for less than the policy limits, the claimant must bear the risk of settling too cheaply.\u201d Id., 420-21. The Illinois court then concluded that the state guaranty fund was not liable in <em>Hasemann </em>\u201c[b]ecause the Fund is entitled to a setoff in the amount of the policy limits of the claimants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>uninsured-motorist policy and the claimants\u2019 loss does not exceed their uninsured-policy limits . . . .\u201d Id., 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The majority of the other states considering this issue have concluded consistently with the Illinois decision in <em>Hasemann. </em>See <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>v. <em>Liemsakul, </em>193 Cal. App. 3d 433, 440-41, 238 Cal. Rptr. 346 (1987) (stating that reduction must be by policy limit rather than amount recovered from uninsured motorist coverage because different result would be \u201cantithetic to the [insurance guaranty] scheme\u201d); <em>Colorado Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. Harris, 827 P.2d 1139, 1142 (Colo. 1992) (Discussing the public policy favoring settlement of disputes and stating that \u201c[allowing [the plaintiff] to recover from the [guaranty fund], subject to a reduction by the policy limit of her uninsured motorist coverage, avoids windfall recoveries and duplicate recoveries .... This approach also places on the claimant the burden of maximizing his or her uninsured motorist recovery.\u201d); <em>Hetzel </em>v. <em>Clarkin, </em>244 Kan. 698, 706, 772 P.2d 800 (1989) (concluding in case wherein defendant\u2019s coverage with insolvent insurer was greater than plaintiffs uninsured motorist coverage, \u201c[e]ven if [the plaintiffs] settlement with her insurance company was $5,000 short of the policy limit, she should still be able to collect the excess coverage that the [gjuaranty [association had a duty to provide [$50,000 less the maximum she could have recovered from her uninsured coverage]\u201d); <em>Kenny </em>v. <em>Hoschar, </em>675 So. 2d 807, 810 (La. App. 1996) (\u201cWhere the insured settles with the other insurer for an amount under policy limits but damages exceed the policy limits, [state guaranty association] is entitled to a credit against the insured\u2019s damages for the full amount of the other insurer\u2019s policy limits. Thus, the insured may recover . . . only to the extent that the insured\u2019s damages exceed the policy limits of the other insurance.\u201d); <em>Belongia </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Ins. Security Fund, </em>195 Wis. 2d 835, 847-48, 537 N.W.2d 51 (App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>1995) (rejecting good faith settlement approach and concluding that plaintiff was not entitled to collect from guaranty fund when his total damages exceeded his uninsured motorist settlement, but were less than his policy limits).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">We, therefore, conclude that a claimant satisfies the exhaustion requirement of \u00a7 38a-845 (1) by pursuing coverage under her own uninsured motorist policy prior to attempting to collect either from the guaranty fund or the tortfeasor personally. The claimant\u2019s failure to obtain the full policy limits from her own coverage does not preclude her from collecting either from the guaranty fund or the tortfeasor personally, but her recovery from either of those sources is reduced by the full amount of those policy limits. Indeed, this conclusion is consistent with the language of the second sentence of \u00a7 38a-845 (1), which provides that \u201c[a]ny amount payable on a covered claim under said sections shall be reduced by the <em>amount recoverable </em>under the claimant\u2019s insurance policy or chapter 568.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>v. <em>Liemsakul, </em>supra, 193 Cal. App. 3d 439-40 (stating that plain meaning of \u201crecoverable\u201d means \u201c[c]apable of being recovered\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is noteworthy that the statute uses the term recoverable, implying any recovery that might have been possible, not just recovery that was actually made\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Moreover, this middle ground also is the best effectuation of the various relevant public policies. It is consistent with our \u201c[p]ublic policy [that] favors and encourages the voluntary settlement of civil suits.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins.

See <em>Dubay </em>v. <em>Irish, </em>207 Conn. 518, 524, 542 A.2d 711 (1988) (\u201c[W]e [have] rejected the claim that the outcome of a case should depend upon whether the defendant has insurance.

The fact is irrelevant to the question of liability.\u201d); see also <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Fulton Concrete </em>Co., 195 Ga. App. 348, 349, 393 S.E.2d 449 (1990) (declining to reach exhaustion issue under insurance guaranty act because it \u201cwill only become a relevant inquiry if and when [the plaintiff] obtains a judgment\u201d); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Braddy, </em>376 N.J.

We, however, conclude that the plaintiffs failure to obtain the remaining $20,000 under her policy does not by itself preclude her from pursuing additional recovery from the defendant so long as she can prove that she has suffered damages in excess of her policy limit of $100,000.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The trial court directed a defendant\u2019s verdict before the jury had an opportunity to make a determination of the plaintiffs damages, and also did not rule as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>a matter of law that the plaintiff had not suffered at least $100,000 in damages. Our review of the evidence of economic and noneconomic damages submitted during the plaintiffs case-in-chief, including the plaintiffs medical bills, lost wages and testimony about her pain and suffering, indicates that, as the plaintiff properly argued to the trial court, a jury reasonably could have found that she had incurred more than $100,000 in damages. Accordingly, the trial court improperly directed a verdict for the defendant, and a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-845 (1) provides: \u201cAny person having a claim against an insurer under any provision in an insurance policy, other than a policy of an insolvent insurer, which is also a covered claim under sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive, shall exhaust first his rights under such policy.

In <em>Bethea, </em>the majority did not reach the exhaustion issue, but concluded that the plaintiff properly could bring an action against an uninsured defendant covered by the state\u2019s guaranty fund, without first having obtained the limits of his uninsured motorist policy. Id., 426-27. The majority concluded that there were no guaranty act issues presented before a judgment entered against the defendant, and that \u201c[t]he [association's role in the case was strictly in terms of defending the alleged tortfeasor with respect to the claims against him; it was not defending against a claim under the Insurance Guaranty Act.\u201d Id., 427. In a concurrence, Justice Zappala stated that he would have reached the exhaustion issue, and concluded that \u201csettlement of the uninsured motorist claims for less than the limits of coverage is a failure to exhaust the claimants\u2019 rights under the policy which precludes recovery under the Act.\u201d Id., 428. Justice Zappala emphasized the guaranty association\u2019s role as the \u201clast resort for payment of a claim\u201d and the possibility of collusive low settlements between plaintiffs and their insurers.

We note that this is an incorrect statement of the law because this statutory limit applies only to the amount recoverable under her uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. Damages in excess of that amount may be collected from the defendant personally, should he have sufficient assets. In this respect, the defendant is no different than any other tortfeasor against whom a judgment in excess of his insurance policy limits has been rendered.
