Michael R. Kerin, the temporary administrator of the estate of the plaintiff, Zbigniew Szewczyk,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appeals, following our grant of certification,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from the judgment of the Appellate Court concluding that the plaintiff did not suffer from an emergency medical condition, and affirming the judgment of the trial court dismissing his administrative appeal from the decision of the defendant, the department of social services (department), denying medicaid benefits to the plaintiff. <em>Szewczyk </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>77 Conn. App. 38, 52, 822 A.2d 957 (2003). We conclude that the plaintiff suffered from an emergency medical condition. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Chief Judge Lavery aptly set forth the facts and procedural history in his dissent from the Appellate Court opinion in this case. \u201cThe plaintiff, a native of Poland, illegally remained in this country after his visa expired. On November 24, 1998, the plaintiff sought treatment from his family physician. At that time, he suffered from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>intense pain, nausea and overall weakness so severe that he could take only one to two steps before collapsing. After reviewing the results of tests performed on the plaintiffs blood samples, the plaintiffs physician immediately referred the plaintiff to Robert B. Erichson, an oncologist at Stamford Hospital (hospital).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u201cOn that same day, Erichson diagnosed the plaintiff with acute myelogenous leukemia and admitted him to the hospital. The plaintiff received treatment consisting of chemotherapy, surgery and biopsies at the hospital until his discharge on December 26, 1998. The hospital charges from November 24 through December 26,1998, totaled $82,046.85.* **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u201cAn application for benefits from November through December, 1998, was filed with the [department], an agency of the state. Erichson wrote a letter, which was admitted into evidence by the department\u2019s hearing officer, that stated that \u2018acute myelogenous leukemia . . . <em>is a rapidly fatal disease unless treated aggressively with chemotherapy.\u2019\u2019 . . . </em>Erichson also opined that such chemotherapy is always administered in a hospital, associated with severe infections requiring aggressive antibiotic and transfusion treatment, and that <em>\u2018in the absence of such therapy, [the plaintiff] would probably not be alive today.\u2019</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> . . . </em>Despite the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>any medical evidence to the contrary, the hearing officer determined that the plaintiff did not suffer from an emergency medical condition and therefore was not eligible for benefits. Specifically, the hearing officer found that the plaintiff did not suffer from an emergency medical condition because the plaintiff would not have immediately died on November 24, 1998, if he had not received treatment.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 53-54 <em>(Lavery, C. J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the denial of benefits to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-183 and 17b-61. The trial court applied the explanation of \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d from the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>150 F.3d 226, 232-33 (2d Cir. 1998), and cited another trial court case for the proposition that \u201can emergency is any condition that is of such severity that in the absence of immediate medical attention, the patient\u2019s health would be placed in serious jeopardy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The trial court credited the hearing officer\u2019s conclusions that the biopsy and catheterization were not \u201c \u2018emergency events,\u2019 \u201d and that the plaintiff \u201c \u2018would not have immediately died\u2019 on the date of admission.\u201d The trial court concluded that these findings were supported by substantial evidence, and, therefore, dismissed the plaintiffs administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The plaintiff thereafter appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court. <em>Szewczyk </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 38. The Appellate Court relied on the standards articulated in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 232, and concluded that the hearing officer did not use an inappropriately \u201cnarrow\u201d legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>standard. <em>Szewczyk </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 48. The Appellate Court also concluded that the hearing officer\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, similarly crediting his determination that the biopsy and catheterization were not emergency procedures, and that the hearing officer\u2019s decision not to adopt Erichson\u2019s determination was a question of credibility that it would not disturb.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 52. Accordingly, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, and this certified appeal followed. See footnote 4 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the Appellate Court correctly relied upon, but misapplied, the Second Circuit\u2019s explanation of the term \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d from <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 233. The plaintiff also contends that the Appellate Court\u2019s improperly restrictive application of the term \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d will have dire consequences for patient care, and will interfere with hospitals\u2019 discharge of their patient care responsibilities under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, the plaintiff claims that the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>officer\u2019s determination that he did not suffer from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u201cemergency medical condition\u201d was not supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>substantial evidence.* *******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiffs contention that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the judgment of the trial court because the hearing officer correctly relied upon, but misapplied, the standard set forth in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In the present case, the plaintiff concedes that there is no Connecticut law that provides broader health coverage to illegal aliens than that provided under federal law, and acknowledges that the definition of \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d in \u00a7 3000.01 of the Uniform Policy Manual is controlled by the coordinate federal statute. See, e.g., <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>252 F.3d 567, 570 (2d Cir. 2001). Thus, in order to establish his eligibility for payments under \u00a7 3005.05 (C) of the Uniform Policy Manual, the plaintiff must establish that he suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>from an emergency medical condition as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), and also that he received treatment for the emergency medical condition within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (2) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">We begin with the applicable standard of review. \u201cIn <em>Cadlerock Properties Joint Venture, L.P. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>253 Conn. 661, 669, 757 A.2d 1 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1148, 121 S. Ct. 1089,148 L. Ed. 2d 963 (2001), we stated: Although the interpretation of statutes is ultimately a question of law ... it is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts. . . . We also have held that an exception is made when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny . . . the agency is not entitled to special deference. . . . Accord <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>[232 Conn. 91, 109, 653 A.2d 782 (1995)] ([a]s we have stated many times, the factual and discretionary determinations of administrative agencies are to be given considerable weight by the courts . . . [however] it is for the courts, and not for administrative agencies, to expound and apply governing principles of law . . .).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wallingford </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health, </em>262 Conn. 758, 771-72, 817 A.2d 644 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The construction and application of \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) presents an issue of law not heretofore considered by this court. Accordingly, our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>272 Conn. 410, 419, 862 A.2d 292 (2004). With respect to the construction and application of federal statutes, \u201cprinciples of comity and consis-</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>tency\u201d require us to follow the plain meaning rule for the inteipretation of federal statutes \u201cbecause that is the rule of construction utilized by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Webster Bank </em>v. <em>Oakley, </em>265 Conn. 539, 554-55, 830 A.2d 139 (2003) (construing federal Americans with Disabilities Act and Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 903, 124 S. Ct. 1603, 158 L. Ed. 2d 244 (2004) . Moreover, it is well settled that \u201c[t]he decisions of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals carry particularly persuasive weight in the interpretation of federal statutes by Connecticut state courts.\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id., 555 n.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>\u201cAccordingly, our analysis of the federal statutes in the present case begins with the plain meaning of the statute. ... If the text of a statute is ambiguous, then we must construct an interpretation consistent with the primary purpose of the statute as a whole. . . . <em>[United States </em>v. <em>Ripa, </em>323 F.3d 73, 81 (2d Cir. 2003)]; see also <em>In re Caldor Corp., </em>303 F.3d 161, 167-68 (2d Cir. 2002) Qa]s long as the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent, there generally is no need for a court to inquire beyond the plain language of the statute . . .). Under the plain meaning rule, [legislative history and other tools of interpretation may be relied upon only if the terms of the statute are ambiguous. <em>... In re Venture Mortgage Fund, L.P., </em>282 F.3d 185, 188 (2d Cir. 2002). Thus, our interpretive process will begin by inquiring whether the plain language of [each] statute, when given its ordinary, common meaning ... is ambiguous. . . . <em>In re Caldor Corp., </em>supra, 168.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Webster Bank </em>v. <em>Oakley, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 555-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">We note at the outset that the Second Circuit is the sole federal Court of Appeals to have considered \u00a7 1396b (v) (3). That court authoritatively construed \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 233, and declared the statutory term \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d to be clear and unambiguous. We, therefore, need not reinvent the federal wheel, and turn to <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>for highly persuasive guidance respecting this issue from the federal Court of Appeals whose jurisdiction encompasses our state.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See footnote 11 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>this opinion. In that case, the Second Circuit concluded that, \u201c[t]he statutory language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) is plain in its meaning. An \u2018emergency medical condition\u2019 must be manifested by acute, rather than chronic symptoms. It must necessitate immediate medical treatment, without which the patient\u2019s physical well-being would likely be put in jeopardy or serious physical impairment or dysfunction would result.\u201d <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>the Second Circuit adopted the definition of \u201c \u2018emergency\u2019 \u201d from Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary and stated that \u201c[i]n the medical context, an \u2018emergency\u2019 is generally defined as \u2018a sudden bodily alteration such as is likely to require immediate medical attention.\u2019 . . . The emphasis is on severity, temporality and urgency. We believe that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) clearly conveys this commonly understood definition.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 232. The court further stated that \u201c[a]n \u2018acute\u2019 symptom is a symptom \u2018characterized by sharpness or severity . . . having a sudden onset, sharp rise, and short course . . . [as] opposed to chronic.\u2019 . . . Moreover, as a verb, \u2018manifest\u2019 means \u2018to show plainly.\u2019 . . . In \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) this verb is used in the present progressive tense to explain that the \u2018emergency medical condition\u2019 must be revealing itself through acute symptoms. Thus ... the statute plainly requires that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>acute indications of injury or illness must coincide in time with the emergency medical condition. Finally, \u2018immediate\u2019 medical care means medical care \u2018occurring . . . without loss of time\u2019 or that is \u2018not secondary or remote.\u2019 . . . In sum, the statutory language unambiguously conveys the meaning that emergency medical conditions are sudden, severe and short-lived physical injuries or illnesses that require immediate treatment to prevent further harm.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.) Id. Indeed, in determining that the federal regulation, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.255,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or the legislative history do not require a different definition of the term \u201cemergency medical condition,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cour review of the plain meaning of \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) ends our inquiry.\u201d Id., 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>the court applied this standard and concluded that three undocumented aliens who were residents of long-term nursing and rehabilitation centers did not suffer from \u201cemer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>gency medical conditions\u201d under \u00a7 1396b (v). Id., 228-29, 233. The patients required rehabilitative care for severe head injuries that they had sustained as a result of trauma from an automobile accident and assaults. Id., 228-29. The court stated that treatment for the \u201cpatients\u2019 sudden and severe head injuries undoubtedly satisfied the plain meaning of \u00a7 1396b (v) (3). However, after the patients were stabilized and the risk of further direct harm from their injuries was essentially eliminated, the medical emergencies ended. This is not to say that the patients could not suffer from a true emergency medical condition while being cared for by [the rehabilitation centers]. For example, it seems clear that if one of these patients suffered a sudden heart attack, treatment to stabilize the patient would be covered by [m]edicaid pursuant to \u00a7 1396b (v) (3). However . . . such an occurrence would constitute an independent emergency and would not be considered a continuation of the emergency situation brought about by the initial head injury.\u201d Id., 232-33. The court further stated that, although two of the patients \u201cundoubtedly require <em>ongoing maintenance care, </em>we have some doubt as to whether their health would be jeopardized by the absence of immediate medical attention .... In any event, however, it is clear that the <em>stable, long-term problems </em>suffered by [two of the immigrants] do not meet the additional, independent requirement that the medical condition be manifested by acute symptoms.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Several of our sister state courts have considered <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>as persuasive authority in determining the meaning of \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d under the plain language of \u00a7 1396b (v) (3). See, e.g., <em>Scottsdale Healthcare, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Administra</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>tion, </em>206 Ariz. 1, 6-7, 75 P.3d 91 (2003);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Luna </em>v. <em>Division of Social Services, </em>162 N.C. App. 1, 11-13, 589 S.E.2d 917 (2004). We find especially persuasive a North Carolina appellate decision that is directly on point, namely, <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Division of Social Services, </em>166 N.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>App. 209, 600 S.E.2d 877 (2004), review granted, 359 N.C. 320, 611 S.E.2d 409 (2005).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Diaz, </em>a biopsy performed on an undocumented alien suffering from sore throat, nausea, vomiting, bleeding gums and lethargy revealed that he had acute lymphocytic leukemia. Id., 210. He immediately received chemotherapy, sustained an infection requiring transfer to the intensive care unit, and subsequently was discharged from the hospital approximately one month after chemotherapy started. Id. He received subsequent \u201cmodules\u201d of chemotherapy on a monthly basis for the next several months. Id. The division of social services approved medicaid coverage for the first several modules, but denied it with respect to the rest. Id., 211. The trial court concluded that the alien was entitled to \u201ctreatment for [his] emergency medical condition\u201d with respect to <em>all </em>of the modules of chemotherapy. Id. The division of social services thereafter appealed, claiming that the \u201ctrial court erred by extending [m]edicaid benefits to [the] petitioner for the treatment of an emergency medical condition.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, relying solely on the federal medicaid requirements and concluding that \u201cmedical care is necessary for the treatment of an emergency condition if the alien requires the care and services after the sudden onset of a medical condition (including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>labor and delivery) that manifests itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) .... These symptoms must be so severe that the absence of immediate medical attention could result in: (1) placing the patient\u2019s health in serious jeopardy, (2) serious impairment to bodily functions, or (3) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 213, citing <em>Medina </em>v. <em>Division of Social Services, </em>165 N.C. App. 502, 508, 598 S.E.2d 707 (2004).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The North Carolina court applied this standard and concluded that the petitioner was entitled to medicaid coverage for an \u201cemergency medical condition.\u201d <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Division of Social Services, </em>supra, 166 N.C. App. 216. It determined that, unlike in prior cancer cases, the trial court had made the requisite findings of fact to support its determination that the patient initially had arrived at the hospital with \u201cacute symptoms\u201d such as vomiting and lethargy, and that \u201cabsent medical treatment in the form of chemotherapy, [his] health would have been placed in serious jeopardy and he would have died.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 215-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Beyond the analysis of <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>we also note that the plain language of \u00a7 1396b (v) indicates that the statute encompasses pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>ment for care beyond that which is immediately necessary to stabilize a patient. The statute permits payment for \u201ccare and services . . . necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical condition of the alien\u201d; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (2) (A); so long as the alien is otherwise eligible and \u201csuch care and services are not related to an organ transplant procedure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (2) (C). The proviso with respect to organ transplant procedures, which undoubtedly are time-consuming and entail relatively lengthy hospitalizations, presumably would be unnecessary if Congress had intended \u00a7 1396b (v) to apply only to short-term stabilization treatment, such as that which is required by EMTALA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is, of course, presumed, both by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>this court and the Second Circuit, that the legislature did not intend to enact useless or superfluous legislation. See, e.g., <em>Lutwin </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>361 F.3d 146, 157 (2d Cir. 2004) (\u201c[w]here possible, we avoid construing a statute so as to render a provision mere surplusage\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Burlington </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. 279, 309-10, 819 A.2d 260 (2003) (\u201c [statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In light of the foregoing cases, our review of the healing officer\u2019s decision and the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision demonstrates that they are the product of an improperly narrow application of the <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>standard. In the case before us, the plaintiff sought coverage for \u201cthe finite course of treatment of the very condition that sent him to the emergency room, and not for long-term or open-ended nursing care.\u201d <em>Luna </em>v. <em>Division of Social Services, </em>supra, 162 N.C. App. 11; id., 13 (remanding case for additional factual findings in case wherein undocumented immigrant had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma). It is undisputed that the inquiry before the hearing officer was confined only to the initial chemotherapy treatments that the plaintiff received from his admission in November through December, 1998.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Furthermore, the record demonstrates that the plaintiff presented with symptoms of \u201cintense pain, nausea and overall weakness so severe that he could take only one</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>to two steps before collapsing.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Szewczyk </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 77 Conn.

In <em>Medina </em>v. <em>Division of Social Services, </em>supra, 165 N.C. App. 508, which was cited in <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Division of Social Services, </em>supra, 166 N.C. App. 209, the court relied on its analysis in <em>Luna </em>v. <em>Division of Social Services, </em>supra, 162 N.C. App. 11-12, which is the state\u2019s seminal case on the issue. In <em>Luna, </em>the court relied on the explanation of the term \u201cacute symptoms\u201d in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 232, but ultimately adopted the test set forth in <em>Scottsdale Healthcare, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Administration, </em>supra, 206 Ariz. 8, for determining the existence of an \u201cemergency medical condition.\u201d <em>Luna </em>v. <em>Division of Social Services, </em>supra, 12-13; see also footnote 15 of this opinion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>is stable enough to be transferred from one health care facility to another is a consideration under . . . [EMTALA], which uses the same definition of \u2018emergency medical condition\u2019 as [\u00a7 1396b (v) (3)] .... The concern under the EMTALA is a hospital\u2019s duty to treat patients coming to its emergency room. . . . That statute discusses stabilization of the patient with reference to when a hospital may transfer a patient to another facility. \u2022 \u2022 . However, \u00a7 1395dd does not indicate that an \u2018emergency medical condition\u2019 is no longer present when a patient is stable. Under the EMTALA, \u2018[t]he term \u201cstabilized\u201d means, with respect to an emergency medical condition . . . that no material deterioration of the condition is likely, within reasonable medical probability, to result from or occur during the transfer of the individual from a facility.\u2019 . . . Thus under the EMTALA, a patient is \u2018stabilized\u2019 if his or her condition will not materially deteriorate during the short time necessary to transfer the patient to another facility. But, under [\u00a7 1396b (v)] . . . stabilization is not an express factor in determining whether an emergency medical condition exists.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Scottsdale Healthcare, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Administration, </em>supra, 6 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Indeed, the appendicitis and cardiac bypass surgery examples cited by the dissent are illustrative of the distinction between EMTALA as a screening statute, and \u00a7 1396b (v) as a payment for treatment statute. With respect to appendicitis, the patient with an infected appendix is actually more at risk for death or serious complications as time passes before definitive treatment. After that patient is admitted to the hospital and time passes, however, EMTALA is no longer applicable. Thus, under the dissent\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1396b (v), that patient would not be eligible for medicaid reimbursement for the necessary emergency surgical treatment of an \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d because that patient would not have been discharged or transferred, but rather already would have been admitted to the hospital as an inpatient. Moreover, the dissent\u2019s apparent limitation of \u00a7 1396b (v) only to treatment rendered in the emergency room places apremium on the entrance to the hospital used by the patient, rather than that patient\u2019s actual medical condition that precipitated the hospitalization in the first instance. In our view, this result, as a product of the dissent\u2019s construction of \u00a7 1396b (v), is beyond irrational, and clearly inconsistent with the letter and purpose of \u00a7 1396b (v). Cf. <em>Scottsdale Healthcare, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Administration, </em>supra, 206 Ariz. 7 (noting \u201cwide variety of emergency conditions or patients\u2019 responses to treatment\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b505-5\"> The plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s ruling will affect patient access to emergency care adversely under EMTALA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd, which shares the same definition of \u201cemergency medical condition\u201d as is used in \u00a7 1396b (v). See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1) (A). Under EMTALA, adherence to which is a condition for hospitals participating in the medicare program, when any patient comes to a hospital emergency room, the hospital personnel first must screen him or her for the existence of an \u201cemergency medical condition . . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (a). The department, however, contends that EMTALA has no impact on payments made for care under \u00a7 1396b (v) because the statutes serve different purposes; \u00a7 1396b (v) is a cost cutting measure and a payment statute, while EMTALA is a treatment entitlement for limited conditions that was enacted to combat the problem of \u201c 'patient dumping\u2019 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Moreover, we find the dissent\u2019s extensive discussion of the history and subsequent administrative interpretations of EMTALA to be illuminating with respect to that statute, but of minimal import with respect to the construction of \u00a7 1396b (v). The dissent\u2019s discussion does not provide any insight with respect to the kind of emergency medical conditions that Congress intended would be subject to the specific statute a.t issue, namely, \u00a7 1396b (v). Rather, the dissent begs the question when it describes the scope of the hospitals\u2019 screening and stabilization obligations under EMTALA, and states that EMTALA no longer is applicable once a patient has been admitted to the hospital, either directly or through the emergency department.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Instead, we find persuasive the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s explanation of the relationship between EMTALA and \u00a7 1396b (v), in <em>Scottsdale Healthcare, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Administration, </em>supra, 206 Ariz. 6 n.6.

We disagree with the dissent\u2019s contention that our analysis is driven by the hospital\u2019s billing practices; in contrast, our focus on the compensability of the initial treatment rendered is the product of the limited scope of the plaintiffs claim herein. The subsequent chemotherapies simply are not before us, and we, therefore, need not consider them now. Moreover, there is nothing in the statute or interpretive case law remotely suggesting that whether a treatment ultimately is successful renders the nature of the underlying condition any more or less emergent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b508-6\"> The plaintiff testified before the hearing officer that he went to his family physician in November, 1998, because: \u201cI had trouble with my stomach, great pain.

Then I felt weak and was about to collapse.\u201d After taking blood samples and X rays, the plaintiffs family physician then referred him to Erichson, who immediately sent him to the hospital because he could not walk.

The majority concludes that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the plaintiff, Zbigniew Szewczyk,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not suffer from an emergency medical condition as that term is defined in Title XIX of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Szewczyk </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>77 Conn. App. 38, 52, 822 A.2d 957 (2003). Accordingly, the majority concludes that the plaintiff is entitled to medical assistance payments from the defendant, the department of social services (department), pursuant to state regulation. See Department of Social Services, Uniform Policy Manual, \u00a7 3005.05 (C) (Uniform Policy Manual).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In support of its conclusion, the majority relies heavily on the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>150 F.3d 226 (2d Cir. 1998). I believe, however, that the standard for determining whether a person suffers from an emergency medical condition adopted by the court in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>is both incorrect and unworkable. Accordingly, I would not follow that case. Instead, in light of the legislative history and genealogy of \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), I would conclude that that statute was intended to be construed consistently with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (e) (l).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Applying that interpretation, I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>conclude that the plaintiff did not receive treatment for an emergency medical condition and, therefore, was not entitled to medical assistance payments from the defendant. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">I begin with a review of the relevant statutes and regulations. Medicaid law authorizes medical assistance payments from a state to an illegal alien only for medical care and services necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical condition. See Uniform Policy Manual, supra, \u00a7 3005.05 (C); see also 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Uniform Policy Manual, supra, \u00a7 3000.01 provides in relevant part: \u201cA medical condition is considered an emergency when it is of such severity that the absence of immediate medical attention could result in placing the patient\u2019s health in serious jeopardy. This . . . does not include care or services related to an organ transplant procedure.\u201d Federal medicaid law provides payment by the federal government to the states for medical assistance provided to an illegal alien only if \u201csuch care and services are necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical condition\u201d; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (2) (A); see also 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1611 (b) (1) (A);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u201c \u2018emergency medical condition\u2019 \u201d as \u201ca medical condition . . . manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in\u2014(A) placing the patient\u2019s health in serious jeopardy, (B) serious impairment to bodily functions, or (C) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v) (3). The United States Department of Health and Human Services (Department of Health and Human Services) has adopted an implementing regulation that adds to this definition the condition that the medical condition must be of \u201csudden onset.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.255.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">There is no dispute in this case that the definition of emergency medical condition in the Uniform Policy Manual, supra, \u00a7 3000.01, is at least as broad as that contained in \u00a7 1396b (v) (3).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The parties also agree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the state may provide more generous public benefits, including medical assistance, to illegal aliens than the benefits authorized by federal law only if it has enacted a law after August 22,1996, providing for such benefits. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 (d).* ***<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Connecticut legislature has passed no such law. Thus, the parties agree that the definition of emergency medical condition in \u00a7 3000.01 of the Uniform Policy Manual, supra, is neither more restrictive nor broader than the definition set forth in the federal statute and regulation, which are themselves coextensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The parties disagree, however, as to whether the phrase emergency medical condition is broad enough to cover a medical condition that presents with severe symptoms and may require long-term treatment. Although the definition of the phrase may plainly and unambiguously cover certain acute medical conditions, such as a severe laceration, that can be resolved promptly with immediate treatment, it is not clear whether the phrase was intended to encompass a condition, such as the plaintiffs, that presents with severe symptoms but requires longer term treatment and, therefore, reasonably may be characterized as chronic. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Thus, the text of the statute is ambiguous as applied in the present case. Accordingly, in construing \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), I do not believe that we are limited to the text of the statute, but may look to its genealogy and legislative history, to cases construing its language and to its relationship to other federal statutes and regulations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See In <em>re Venture Mortgage Fund, L.P., </em>282 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>185, 188 (2d Cir. 2002) (legislative history and other tools of interpretation may be relied upon if terms of federal statute are ambiguous).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The medicaid provision of which \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) is a part was enacted in 1986 in response to a ruling by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York; see <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>663 F. Sup. 1164 (E.D.N.Y. 1986), rev\u2019d in part, <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>252 F.3d 567 (2d Cir. 2001); that federal medicaid law placed no restriction on alien eligibility for medicaid assistance. See Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-509, \u00a79406, 100 Stat. 1874, 2057-58 (1986), now codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b (v); H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-1012, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 399 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3868, 4044-45. Section 1396b (v) barred medicaid assistance to aliens not residing in the United States under color of law unless the alien suffered from an emergency medical condition. The legislative history of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 indicates that the general purpose underlying its disparate provisions was to reduce government expenditures. See generally 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3868 et seq. The legislative history sheds no light, however, on the purpose of the specific provision permitting medicaid payments to the states for medical assistance to an illegal alien for an emergency medical condition or the scope and contours of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">A review of the genesis and evolution of the statutory language is instructive, however. The language defining emergency medical condition, as set forth in \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), first appeared in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.53 (b) (4).* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>regulation, which was adopted in 1985, implemented a 1982 amendment to the federal medicaid provisions that prohibited the states from imposing cost sharing requirements on individuals who received emergency medical services \u201cas defined by the Secretary . . . .\u201d See Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-248, \u00a7 131, 96 Stat. 324, 367-68 (1982), codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396o (b) (2) (D); see also 50 Fed. Reg. 23,009, 23,013 (May 30, 1985). In response to the amendment, the Department of Health and Human Services originally had adopted a regulation containing language identical to that set forth at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.170 (e), pertaining to medical services that are covered by medicaid.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See 48 Fed. Reg. 5732 (February 8, 1983). When it adopted that language, the Department of Flealth and Human Services solicited comments from the public on whether the language should be revised for purposes of the cost sharing amendment. See id. In response to the comments that it received, the Department of Health and Human Services concluded that the language of the coverage regulation was \u201ctoo limited\u201d for the cost sharing regulation; 50 Fed. Reg., supra, 23,011; and adopted the current version of the regulation; see 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.53 (b) (4); which includes \u201cservices provided in settings other than the hospital.\u201d 50 Fed. Reg., supra, 23,011.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In 1986, Congress amended federal medicare law by enacting EMTALA, or the \u201cpatient dumping act.\u201d See Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-272, \u00a7 1867, 100 Stat. 82, 166 (1986), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd. The amendment\u2019s definition of emergency medical condition contained language substantially identical to the language of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.53 (b) (4), with the exception that the statute did not list the facilities at which emergency medical services must be provided or include a sudden onset requirement. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1). The amendment requires hospitals that participate in the federal medicare program to screen and stabilize patients who come to the hospital with an emergency medical condition, including illegal aliens, if the hospital is capable of doing so. The legislative history of the amendment indicates that it was intended to address the problem of the inappropriate transfer of \u201cpatients in life threatening situations\u201d from the emergency rooms of private hospitals to public hospitals \u201cfor economic reasons alone . . . .\u201d 131 Cong. Rec., Pt. 21, 28,568 (1985), remarks of Senator David Durenberger. The legislative history also indicates that the amendment was not intended to be a \u201ccure-all,\u201d but a \u201cmodest policy\u201d; id.; and was not intended to solve the \u201clarger problem\u201d of providing medical services to the growing number of uninsured patients. Id., 28,569, remarks of Senator Edward Kennedy. Finally, the legislative history indicates that the general accounting office was conducting a study to determine whether refinements in federal medicaid law would be required to advance the purposes of the act. Id., 28,568. Six months after Congress enacted \u00a7 1395dd, it enacted the medicaid provision at issue in the present case, \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), which uses substantially identical language to define emergency medical condition.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The Department of Health and Human Services expressly recognized the relationship between \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) and \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1) when, in 1990, it revised 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.255 (c) (1), which is the implementing regulation for \u00a7 1396b (v) (3). See 55 Fed. Reg. 36,816 (September 7, 1990). The Department of Health and Human Services stated that \u201cwe have revised the definition of emergency services to say . . . \u2018after the sudden onset of a medical condition . . . .\u2019 This change will make the definition of emergency services consistent with the definition already in use in the Medicaid program at 42 [C.F.R.] \u00a7 447.53 (b) (4) and with the definition contained in section 1867 (e) (1) of the [Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1)], relating to hospital emergency [departments\u2019] inappropriate failure to treat certain patients (the anti-dumping provision).\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 55 Fed. Reg., supra, 36,816.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">This legislative background clearly suggests that \u00a7 1396b (v) (2) was intended to ensure that states and hospitals that participate in the medicare and medicaid programs will receive at least partial payment from the federal government for emergency medical services provided to indigent illegal aliens pursuant to \u00a7 1395dd.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, it is clear to me that Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>intended for the phrase emergency medical condition, as defined in \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), to have the same scope and contours as that phrase is defined in \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1) and for the phrase \u201ccare and services . . . necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical condition\u201d as used in \u00a7 1396b (v) (2) (A) to refer to the treatment required by \u00a7 1395dd.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, in construing \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), I believe that we should be guided by the meaning of \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The meaning of \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1) is determined in part by its relationship to the other provisions of \u00a7 1395dd.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>As I have indicated, the primary purpose of \u00a7 1395dd was to prohibit the inappropriate transfer of patients who arrive at a hospital with an emergency medical condition \u201csuch that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in . . . placing the health of the individual ... in serious jeopardy . . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1) (A). The statute imposes two basic obligations on participating hospitals: (1) to screen patients who come to a hospital\u2019s emergency department; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (a); and (2) to stabilize patients suffering from an emergency medical condition. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (b). Subsection 1395dd (e) (3) (A) defines \u201c \u2018to stabilize\u2019 \u201d as \u201cto provide such medical treatment of the condition as may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur <em>during the transfer of the individual from, a facility </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Once a medical condition has been stabilized, the provisions of the statute prohibiting transfer of the patient no longer apply. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (c) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Accordingly, read as a whole, the statutory language indicates that the phrase \u201cimmediate medical attention\u201d as used in the definition of \u201c \u2018emergency medical condition\u2019 \u201d; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1) (A); refers to the stabilizing treatment described in \u00a7 1395dd (e) (3) (A) and that the phrase \u201cmaterial deterioration of the condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>tion\u201d as used in \u00a7 1395dd (e) (3) (A) refers to the adverse results listed in \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1) (A) (i), (ii) and (iii). Thus, an emergency medical condition is a condition that requires stabilizing treatment in order to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during the transfer of the individual from a facility or his discharge.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, because the term to stabilize is defined entirely in terms of the treatment required in order to transfer an individual safely to another facility; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (e) (3) (A); it is apparent that, if no transfer or discharge is contemplated, the treatment provisions of the statute do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">This interpretation of \u00a7 1395dd is consistent with the interpretation of the Department of Health and Human Services. Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, \u00a7 489.24 (d) (2), is in the portion of the medicare regulations specifying \u201cthe basic commitments and limitations that [a health care] provider must agree to as part of an agreement to provide services.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 489.2. Section 489.24 (d) (2) of 42 C.F.R. provides: \u201c(i) If a hospital has screened an individual under paragraph (a) of this section and found the individual to have an emergency medical condition [definition substantially identical to definition in \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1)], and admits that individual as an inpatient in good faith in order to stabilize the emergency medical condition, the hospital has satisfied its special responsibilities under this section with respect to that individual.\u201d When it adopted the current version of this regulation, the Department of Health and Human Services stated that it had received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>several comments requesting clarification on whether \u00a7 1395dd would \u201capply to inpatients who are stable but who are scheduled for inpatient surgery for an emergency medical condition, such as patients who need an angiogram or bypass surgery, after seeing their physician for chest pain. One commenter requested clarification on the issue of individuals directly admitted to the hospital for an emergency medical condition, for example, appendicitis, although the individual is not seeking emergency services from the hospital.\u201d 68 Fed. Reg. 53,246 (September 9, 2003). The Department of Health and Human Services responded that \u201conce an individual has been admitted as an inpatient (including individuals who have been directly admitted as inpatients upon presentation to the hospital), EMTALA no longer applies\u201d; id.; unless the individual was admitted for the purpose of evading the requirements of the statute. Id., 53,245.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In support of this interpretation, the Department of Health and Human Services cited several federal cases that have concluded that \u201cthe statute requires that stabilizing care must be provided in a way that avoids material deterioration of an individual\u2019s medical condition <em>if the individual is being transferred from thefacility.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 53,244; see, e.g., <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Rectors &amp; Visitors of the University of Virginia, </em>95 F.3d 349 (4th Cir. 1996).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cThe courts gave great weight to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>the fact that hospitals have a discrete obligation to stabilize the condition of an individual when moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>that individual out of the hospital to either another facility or to his or her home as part of the discharge process. Thus, should a hospital determine that it would be better to admit the individual as an inpatient, such a decision would not result in either a transfer or a discharge, and, consequently, the hospital would not have an obligation to stabilize under EMTALA.\u201d 68 Fed. Reg., supra, 53,244. The Department of Health and Human Services also stated that \u201c[t]he courts have generally acknowledged that this limitation on the scope of the stabilization requirement does not protect hospitals from challenges to the decisions they make about patient care; only that redress may lie outside EMTALA. For example, a hospital may face liability for negligent behavior that results in harm to persons it [treats] after they are admitted as inpatients, but such potential liability would flow from medical malpractice principles, not from the hospital\u2019s obligations under EMTALA.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">This interpretation of \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1) is also consistent with the interpretation of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for investigating complaints alleging violations of \u00a7 1395dd. See United States General Accounting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Office, Report to Congressional Committees, Emergency Care: EMTALA Implementation and Enforcement Issues (June, 2001) p. 1. In 2001, Congress directed the United States general accounting office to examine the effect of the statute on hospitals and physicians who serve emergency departments. Id. During the course of the investigation, the general accounting office learned that hospitals and physicians were uncertain about the amount of care they were required to provide to comply with the statutory requirements and at what point their treatment obligations ended. Id., p. 15. The general accounting office asked CMS: (1) \u201c[wjhether the determination that a patient is stable for transfer or discharge ends the hospital\u2019s EMTALA obligation or whether the hospital must also ensure follow-up care is provided\u201d; and (2) \u201c[w]hether a hospital must ensure that followup care is obtained.\u201d Id., p. 16. CMS advised the general accounting office that: (1) \u201c[t]he requirement is fulfilled when a physician determines the patient is stable for transfer or stable for discharge. The regulations on transfer requirements refer to patients who are unstable; therefore they do not apply when a patient is stable for transfer or stable for discharge\u201d; and (2) \u201c[hjospitals are not required to ensure that follow-up care is obtained.\u201d Id. Guidelines issued by CMS state that \u201c[a]n individual is considered stable and ready for discharge when, within reasonable clinical confidence, it is determined that the individual has reached the point where his/her continued care, including diagnostic work-up and/or treatment, could be reasonably performed as an outpatient or later as an inpatient, provided the individual is given apian for appropriate follow-up care as part of the discharge instructions. The [emergency medical condition] that caused the individual to present to the dedicated [emergency department] must be resolved, but the underlying medical condition may persist. Hospitals are expected within reason to assist/provide dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>charged individuals the necessary information to secure the necessary follow-up care to prevent relapse or worsening of the medical condition upon release from the hospital . . . .\u201d Memorandum from the Director, Survey and Certification Group, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, to State Survey Agency Directors re: Revised Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) Interpretive Guidelines (May 13, 2004), p. 37 (CMS Memorandum), available at http:// www.cms.hhs.gov/Medicaid/survey-cert/sc0434.pdf.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">With this background in mind, I would conclude that the phrase emergency medical condition as used in \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1) (A) means a condition requiring stabilization in order to avoid a material deterioration of an individual\u2019s condition during the course of a transfer to another facility or during discharge.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As I have indicated, if no transfer or discharge is contemplated, or if the discharge takes place after admission for inpatient treatment, then the treatment provisions of \u00a7 1395dd (b) (1) do not apply. As I have also indicated, I believe that the phrase emergency medical condition as used in both \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) and the Uniform Policy Manual, supra, \u00a7 3000.01, was intended to be coextensive with the phrase as used in \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1) (A). Accordingly, if stabilization is not required or if no transfer or discharge is contemplated, then any treatment received by the individual does not fall within the scope of \u00a7 1396b (v) (2) (A) and the individual is not eligible for medical assistance under the Uniform Policy Manual, supra, \u00a7 3005.05 (C).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>This interpretation not only is consistent with the genealogy and legislative history of \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), but it also advances general federal policy. Federal law provides that illegal aliens are ineligible for state and local governments public benefits; see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 (a); unless the state specifically enacts a law providing for such benefits after August 22, 1996. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 (d). There are a small number of narrowly defined exceptions to this law, including one authorizing states to provide \u201c[assistance for health care items and services that are necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical condition (as defined in section 1396b [v] [3] of title 42) of the alien involved . ...\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 (b) (1). The legislative history of \u00a7 1621, which was enacted as part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105 (1996) (Welfare Reform Act), indicates that Congress understood the allowance for emergency services under \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) to be \u201cvery narrow\u201d and to apply \u201conly ... to medical care that is strictly of an emergency nature, such as medical treatment administered in an emergency room, critical care unit, or intensive care unit.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> H.R. Conf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Rep. No. 104-725, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 380 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2649, 2768. The legislative history of the Welfare Reform Act also indicates that one of its principal purposes was to \u201creduce the size and scope of the Federal Government and to provide tax relief for working American families.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 104-651, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2183, 2191. As I have indicated, that was also a primary purpose of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, of which \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) was a part. Moreover, when Congress enacted the Welfare Reform Act, it explicitly stated that \u201c[i]t is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 (6). It is apparent that a narrow, clearly delineated definition of emergency medical condition, such as that contained in \u00a7 1395dd, would advance these policies far more effectively than a definition broad enough to cover the type of treatment provided to the plaintiff in the present case.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Moreover, EMTALA is the only law <em>mandating </em>the <em>treatment </em>of an illegal alien\u2019s emergency medical condition. Section 1396b (v) merely <em>authorizes payment </em>to the states for the treatment of an emergency medical condition after it has been provided. I cannot conceive of any reasons why Congress would require hospitals to provide treatment to an uninsured person who is suffering from an emergency medical condition only to the extent required to stabilize the person for discharge or transfer but then\u2014only months later and using identical language\u2014authorize payment for the treatment of an illegal alien\u2019s emergency medical condition for as long as the underlying condition persists. The effect of giving such a broad reading to \u00a7 1396b (v) would be to limit the application of the narrow definition in \u00a7 1395dd to uninsured citizens and legal aliens. Moreover, I find it unlikely that Congress would simultaneously make illegal aliens ineligible for state and local public benefits in order to discourage illegal immigration; see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601 (6) and 1621 (a); and authorize states to provide a benefit to illegal aliens that is not provided to uninsured citizens.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The majority concludes, however, that \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) is broad enough to cover the treatment of any severe medical condition if the withholding of prompt treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>ment would be reasonably likely to cause the individual\u2019s death or place his health in serious jeopardy and if the condition can be resolved with a finite course of treatment. In support of that conclusion, it relies primarily on <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 226,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and on a number of state court cases construing the term emergency medical condition as used in \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) or in substantially identical state regulations implementing the statute. See <em>Scottsdale Healthcare, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Administration, </em>206 Ariz. 1, 75 P.3d 91 (2003); <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Division of Social Services, </em>166 N.C. App. 209, 600 S.E.2d 877 (2004) , review granted, 359 N.C. 320, 611 S.E.2d 409 (2005) ; <em>Medina </em>v. <em>Division of Social Services, </em>165 N.C.

Sup. 268, 271-73, 684 A.2d 286 (1995) (illegal alien entitled to medicaid assistance for ongoing dialysis treatment under \u00a7 1396b [v] [2]). In none of those cases, however, did the court consider the relationship between \u00a7 1396b (v) and \u00a7 1395dd.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See 131 Cong. Rec., supra, 28,568 (sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>gesting that refinements in federal medicaid law would be required to advance purposes of EMTALA); 55 Fed. Reg., supra, 36,816 (expressly recognizing that definition of emergency medical condition in \u00a7 1396b [v] was intended to be consistent with definition in \u00a7 1395dd). Instead, the courts relied primarily on the dictionary definitions of several terms used in the statute and on the general expertise of health care providers on the question of when an emergency medical condition exists. See footnote 10 of this dissenting opinion; see also, e.g., <em>Scottsdale Healthcare, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Administration, </em>supra, 7-8 (citing dictionary definitions of \u201c \u2018acute\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018chronic\u2019 \u201d and concluding that when emergency medical condition has ended \u201cshould largely be informed by the expertise of health care providers\u201d).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Accordingly, I do not find the cases persuasive.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Moreover, the rule set forth in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 233, and adopted by the majority is impossible to implement in any principled way. The majority implicitly recognizes that there are medical conditions that place an individual\u2019s health in serious jeopardy and are likely to result in serious impairment to bodily functions or of a bodily organ or part, but that do not come within \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) because they cannot be resolved with a \u201cfinite course of treatment.\u201d <em>Luna </em>v. <em>Division of Social Services, </em>supra, 162 N.C. App. 11. In other words, serious and even life threatening conditions that require an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>immediate but indefinite or unending course of treatment are not emergency medical conditions. It is apparent, however, that it is frequently impossible to determine at the time of admission, or, indeed, at any given point during treatment, if and when a particular condition will be fully resolved. If a patient suffers a serious traumatic head injury and the termination of medical treatment at any point during the remainder of the patient\u2019s life would result in immediate death or serious injury, to characterize the injury as either acute or chronic would be arbitrary. The injury is acute in the sense that it was of sudden onset and is severe, and it is chronic in the sense that it cannot be resolved with a finite course of treatment.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It is also clear that many indisputably chronic diseases have acute phases. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Under the majority\u2019s decision, whether such injuries and conditions constitute emergency medical conditions under \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) will depend \u201c \u2018largely,\u2019 \u201d which is to say, entirely, on their characterization by medical experts unguided by anything except the vague and ambiguous language of the statute. See <em>Scottsdale Healthcare, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Administration, </em>supra, 206 Ariz. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The majority concludes in the present case that the plaintiff had an emergency medical condition because he was diagnosed with a \u201c \u2018rapidly fatal\u2019 \u201d disease that had \u201c \u2018reached a crisis stage\u2019 \u201d when he arrived at the hospital and because he received a \u201c \u2018finite course of treatment ....\u2019\u201d There is no evidence in the record, however, that the treatment for which the plaintiff seeks reimbursement cured his disease or that he did not require ongoing outpatient treatment or additional hospital admissions after his discharge.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Indeed, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>suggests otherwise. See footnote 1 of this dissenting opinion. Accordingly, the majority\u2019s conclusions that the plaintiffs condition was not chronic and that he received a \u201c \u2018finite course of treatment\u2019 \u201d ultimately rest on the mere fact that the hospital handled the medical treatment that he received during his admission as a discrete course of treatment for billing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">If our only guide to the meaning of the phrase emergency medical condition were the ambiguous language of \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), I might find tolerable an outcome based on the vagaries of hospital billing practices. Courts must do the best they can when confronted with an inherently ambiguous statute and no additional evidence of legislative intent. <em>Because </em>the statute is inherently ambiguous, however, we are not limited to its express terms in construing its meaning, but may consider its legislative background. In my view, that legislative background establishes that Congress intended the statute to be construed consistently with \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">I would conclude that, in order to establish his eligibility for payments under the Uniform Policy Manual, supra, \u00a7 3005.05 (C), the plaintiff was required to establish that his condition was such that he could not have been transferred or discharged safely and that the treatment for which he seeks medical assistance payments actually was provided in order to assure, within a reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of his condition would occur during the course of his transfer to another facility or during discharge. Although the hearing officer made no factual findings on these issues, the plaintiff does not claim and there is no suggestion in the record that the treatment provided to the plaintiff was intended to stabilize him for transfer to another facility or for discharge so that he could secure the appropriate follow-up care. Rather, the record clearly indicates that the plaintiff was admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>immediately into the hospital as an inpatient for long-term treatment.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> 1 would conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff was not eligible for medical assistance under the Uniform Policy Manual, supra, \u00a7 3005.05 (C).

The emphasis is on severity, temporality and urgency.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) In my view, however, to define an emergency medical condition as a \u201c <em>\u2018sudden </em>bodily alteration such as is likely to require <em>immediate </em>medical attention\u2019 \u201d; (emphasis added) id., 232; is merely to rephrase the problem. It is clear that terms such as \u201csudden,\u201d \u201cacute,\u201d \u201cemergency\u201d and \u201cimmediate\u201d are relative terms by their very nature. For example, in the present case, the plaintiffs symptoms were of sudden onset in comparison to the symptoms of a person who has had a congenital medical condition since birth, but were not sudden in comparison to an injury suffered in a knife fight. Indeed, although the majority agrees with the court in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>that the phrase emergency medical condition is plain and unambiguous, it disagrees with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs condition was not sufficiently severe, short-lived and urgent to meet the standard in that case. I also note that federal courts construing \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1), which contains language identical to \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), have consulted that statute\u2019s legislative history.

See 53 Fed. Reg. 38,036 (September 29, 1988).

The hospital treated the plaintiffs decedent for twelve days and then determined, pursuant to its internal procedures and against the wishes of her family, that no further efforts to prevent her death should be taken and entered a \u201c \u2018do not resuscitate\u2019 \u201d order. Id. The plaintiffs decedent died eight days later. Id. The plaintiff brought an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia claiming that the hospital\u2019s refusal to resuscitate the decedent was a failure to stabilize her in violation of \u00a7 1395dd. The court dismissed the action, concluding that the statute imposed no obligation on the hospital after the patient had been admitted. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court and rejected the plaintiff\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>pretation that \u201cevery presentation of an emergency patient to a hospital covered by EMTALA obligates the hospital to do much more than merely provide immediate, emergency stabilizing treatment with appropriate followup. Rather, without regard to professional standards of care or the standards embodied in the state law of medical malpractice, the hospital would have to provide treatment indefinitely\u2014perhaps for years\u2014according to a novel, federal standard of care derived from the statutory stabilization requirement.\u201d Id., 351. Instead, the court concluded that \u201cEMTALA is a limited anti-dumping statute, not a federal malpractice statute. ... Its core purpose is to get patients into the system who might otherwise go untreated and be left without a remedy because traditional medical malpractice law affords no claim for failure to treat. . . . Numerous cases and [EMTALA\u2019s] legislative history confirm that Congress\u2019s sole purpose in enacting EMTALA was to deal with the problem of patients being turned away from emergency rooms for non-medical reasons.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The court also stated that \u201c[o]nce EMTALA has met that purpose of ensuring that a hospital undertakes stabilizing treatment for a patient who arrives with an emergency condition, the patient\u2019s care becomes the legal responsibility of the hospital and the treating physicians. And, the legal adequacy of that care is then governed not by EMTALA but by the state malpractice law that everyone agrees EMTALA was not intended to preempt. That being the legal reality, there is no justification for [the] assertion [of the plaintiff\u2019s decedent] that, under such a reading of EMTALA, a hospital could simply treat for a few days or hours and then refuse treatment if they could not stabilize quickly and cheaply. . . . Such refusal of treatment after the establishment of a physician-patient relationship would be regulated by the tort law of the several states. See, e.g., 61 Am. Jur. 2d, Physicians, Surgeons and Other Healers, \u00a7 234 ([T]he relation of physician and patient, once initiated, continues until it is ended by the consent of the parties . . . or until his services are no longer needed, and until then the physician is under a duty to continue to provide necessary medical care to the patient.), \u00a7 238 (Failure of the patient to pay for the physician\u2019s services does not justify the physician in abandoning the patient while he still is in need of medical attendance . . . .) (1981). And, EMTALA is quite clear that it is not intended to preempt state tort law except where absolutely necessary.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Rectors &amp; Visitors of the University of Virginia, </em>supra, 95 F.3d 351-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The cotut then cited the language of \u00a7 1395dd (e) (3) (A) and concluded that \u201c[t]he stabilization requirement is thus defined entirely in connection with a possible transfer and without any reference to the patient\u2019s long-term care within the system. It seems manifest to us that the stabilization requirement was intended to regulate the hospital\u2019s care of the patient only in the immediate aftermath of the act of admitting her for emergency treatment and while it considered whether it would undertake longer-term full treatment or instead transfer the patient to a hospital that could and would undertake that treatment.\u201d Id., 352; see also <em>Harry </em>v. <em>Marchant, </em>291 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>F.3d 767, 771 (11th Cir. 2002) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd does not impose guidelines for care and treatment of patient who is not transferred); <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Adventist Health System/West, </em>289 F.3d 1162,1168 (9th Cir. 2002) (statutory stabilization requirement ends when individual is admitted for inpatient care); <em>Correa </em>v. <em>Hospital San Francisco, </em>69 F.3d 1184, 1190 (1st Cir. 1995) (to establish EMTALA violation, patient must show that hospital turned away, discharged or transferred patient without first stabilizing emergency medical condition); <em>Brooker v.

The flaw in this criticism is that it incorrectly assumes that I have not established as a preliminary matter that Congress enacted \u00a7 1396b (v) to advance the purposes of EMTALA; see 131 Cong. Rec., supra, 28,568; and that Congress intended the meaning of emergency medical condition as used in \u00a7 1396b (v) to be consistent with the meaning of the phrase as used in \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1). See 55 Fed. Reg., supra, 36,816. These conclusions require me to determine the meaning of the phrase as used in \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1), hence my \u201cextensive discussion\u201d of that statute. Because my analysis establishes beyond dispute that EMTALA does not apply after a patient has been admitted to the hospital, it necessarily follows that \u00a7 1396b (v) does not apply.

This further supports the view that Congress did not intend to authorize full treatment of an emergency medical condition if such treatment is not necessary to safely discharge or transfer the patient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b529-6\"> When the Department of Health and Human Services revised the definition of emergency services in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.255 (c) (1), it stated that \u201cwe believe the broad definition allows States to interpret and further define the services available to aliens covered by [\u00a7 1396b (v) (2)] which are any services necessary to treat an emergency medical condition in a consistent and proper manner supported by professional medical judgement. Further, the significant variety of potential emergencies and the unique combination of physical conditions and the patient\u2019s response to treatment are so varied that it is neither practical nor possible to define with more precision all those conditions which will be considered emergency medical conditions.\u201d 55 Fed. Reg., supra, 36,816. In my view, this language merely recognizes that the definition of emergency medical condition is broad in the sense that it applies to a wide variety of conditions requiring stabilizing treatment. Clearly, it would be impossible to catalogue all such conditions. The definition is not broad, however, in the sense that it authorizes an expansive course of treatment for each such condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b530-6\"> 1 recognize that, even under my reading of \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), illegal aliens receive a benefit that uninsured citizens do not, namely, medical assistance payments for treatment of an emergency medical condition to the extent required to stabilize the patient for transfer or discharge. Uninsured citizens are assured of receiving such treatment under \u00a7 1395dd, but my research reveals no provision authorizing medical assistance payments for such treatment if the patient is not covered by medicaid. Under a broad reading of \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), however, an illegal alien would receive not only this narrow benefit, but would also receive treatment and reimbursement for conditions that, if suffered by an uninsured citizen, would not even entitle the citizen to treatment. For example, I am aware of no medicaid or medicare provision that even arguably would entitle an uninsured citizen to the treatment that the plaintiff in the present case received or to reimbursement for such treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\"> See footnote 10 of this dissenting opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\"> The court in <em>Scottsdale Healthcare, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Administration, </em>supra, 206 Ariz. 6 n.6, did recognize that the definition set forth in \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1) is identical to the definition in \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), but concluded that the stabilization requirement of \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1) was not a factor under \u00a7 1396b (v) (3). The court failed, however, to examine the legislative history of the statutes and, therefore, failed to discover that \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) was enacted only months after the enactment of \u00a7 1395dd and that the definitions were intended to be consistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The majority states that it finds \u201cpersuasive the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s explanation of the relationship between EMTALA and \u00a7 1396b (v)\u201d in <em>Scottsdale Healthcare, Inc. </em>The majority does not deny, however, that the legislative history and genealogy of \u00a7 1396b (v) indicate that the statute was enacted in response to the enactment of \u00a7 1395dd and was intended to be consistent with \u00a7 1395dd. It states only that it is constrained from looking at that legislative background because the court, in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 233, failed to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b532-6\"> See also <em>Scottsdale Healthcare, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Administration, </em>supra, 206 Ariz. 8 (rejecting claim that stability is primary criterion of emergency medical condition under \u00a7 1396c [v]); id., 8 n.9 (term \u201c \u2018immediate\u2019 \u201d as used in statute \u201ccontemplates a range of time frames, as opposed to some fixed standard\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\"> 1 do not dispute that the expertise of health care providers has a role in determining whether an emergency medical condition exists. That expertise, however, cannot be exercised in a vacuum, but must be guided by the proper legal standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b533-5\"> The majority may respond that, for a condition to be acute, it must be sudden, severe <em>and </em>resolvable with a finite course of treatment. My point, however, is that the phrase \u201cfinite course of treatment\u201d; <em>Luna </em>v. <em>Division of Social Services, </em>supra, 162 N.C. App. 11; is not susceptible to principled definition. In the case of a head injury, for example, any determination that treatment of the acute injury has terminated and treatment of the chronic condition has commenced necessarily will be arbitrary. The court in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 232, attempted to resolve 1his dilemma by suggesting that an emergency medical condition ends when the patient is \u201cst abilized and the risk of further direct harm from [the] injuries [is] essentially eliminated.\u201d The court rejected the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Hie patients in that case were suffering from emergency medical conditions because \u201cthe absence of continuous medical attention could reasonably be expected to place their health in serious jeopardy.\u201d Id., 233. The Court of Appeals reasoned that, even if it could be established that the patients\u2019 health would be jeopardized by the absence of immediate medical attention, they were not suffering from emergency medical conditions because their medical conditions were not manifested by acute symptoms. Id. In my view, this reasoning is circular. The patients were receiving long-term medical treatment <em>because </em>the termination of tire treatment would result immediately in acute symptoms which would then require emergency medical treatment. Thus, in the absence of the legislative evidence indicating that \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) was intended to be interpreted consistently with \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1), I would agree with the majority that the court in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc., </em>improperly concluded that whether the patients had been stabilized was a dispositive factor in determining whether they suffered from emergency medical conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b534-6\"> Thus, the majority does not follow its own holding that the \u201cdetermination of the existence of an emergency medical condition should largely be informed by the expertise of health care providers . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) It points to no medical evidence on the question of whether a medical condition is acute or chronic when it is rapidly fatal if untreated and, if treated, long-term and incurable. This description appears to apply to the condition of the patients in <em>Greenery Rehabilitation Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hammon, </em>supra, 150 F.3d 233, which the court found to be chronic.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The majority states that \u201cthere is nothing in the statute or interpretive case law remotely suggesting that whether a treatment ultimately is successful renders the nature of the underlying condition any more or less emergent.\u201d My point, however, is not that the treatment must be ultimately successful. Indeed, under my interpretation, I do not believe that to be the case. Rather, my point is that, because the open-ended treatment of a patient\u2019s chronic condition can always be broken down arbitrarily into multiple finite courses of treatment, there is no principled way under the mqj ority\u2019s interpretation to distinguish between a serious chronic condition and an emergency medical condition. The majority also states that its \u201cfocus on the compensability of the initial treatment rendered is the product of the limited scope of the plaintiffs claim . . . .\u201d To the extent that the majority suggests that, under its interpretation, an <em>unlimited </em>claim probably would not be'compensable, I do not find that limitation on the scope of \u00a7 1396b (v) (3) to be particularly helpful. The majority simply has failed to articulate the principle that it believes limited the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b536-9\"> The trial court found that the plaintiff was admitted to the hospital\u2019s emergency room. The portion of the hospital record cited by the court states, however, that the plaintiff \u201cwas directly admitted to [Stamford Hospital] for continuous course of [chemotherapy].\u201d I have carefully reviewed the rest of the record and have discovered no evidence that the plaintiff was admitted to the emergency room. Even if he was, however, there is no evidence that he received stabilizing treatment there for the purpose of transferring him to another facility or discharging him.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">I do not, as the majority states, suggest either that \u00a7 1396b (v) applies only to treatment provided in the emergency room or that all treatment provided in an emergency room is emergency medical treatment under the statute. Rather, as I have repeatedly stated, I would conclude that the statute applies to treatment provided for the purpose of stabilizing a patient\u2019s condition so that he may be safely transferred or discharged, regardless of where that treatment takes place. The majority finds this result \u201cbeyond irrational, and clearly inconsistent with the letter and purpose of \u00a7 1396b (v).\u201d The \u201cletter\u201d of \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), however, is identical to the \u201cletter\u201d of \u00a7 1395dd (e) (1), which indisputably means what I have said it means. As to the \u201cpurpose\u201d of \u00a7 1396b (v), I see nothing in the majority\u2019s opinion indicating what it believes that purpose is beyond authorizing payment for the treatment of an emergency medical condition. In contrast, my analysis shows that the underlying purpose of the statute was to advance the purposes of EMTALA. My interpretation of \u00a7 1396b (v) (3), unlike the majority\u2019s, accomplishes that purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
