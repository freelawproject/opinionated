The plaintiff, Eileen N. Greco, appeals following our grant of certification<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the Appellate Court reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment as to all financial orders imposed on the named defendant, George Greco.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>82 Conn. App. 768, 777, 847 A.2d 1017 (2004). We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider adequately the parties\u2019 current financial circumstances in forming its judgment. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The following background facts and procedural history are set forth in the Appellate Court opinion. \u201cThe plaintiff and the defendant were married on September 28, 1974. It was the second marriage for both parties. At the time of the marriage, the defendant had custody of his five children from his prior marriage and the plaintiff had custody of a child bom during her prior marriage. In 1997, DNA testing revealed that the defendant is that child\u2019s biological father. The parties also had a child together bom during their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u201cBefore the parties were married, the defendant owned and operated a gasoline service station. After they were married, the defendant sold the service station and opened an auto parts business. The defendant\u2019s five children from his prior marriage were all involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>in operating the auto parts business, Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc., as was the parties\u2019 first child. The defendant also formed and controlled a partnership called LDGG Limited Partnership. Throughout the marriage, the plaintiff was a full-time homemaker, caring for the children and managing the household.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u201cIn February, 2000, the plaintiff brought this dissolution action by a one count complaint, claiming an irretrievable breakdown in the marital relationship. She sought the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage, an equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 property, alimony and attorney\u2019s fees. On September 25, 2001, the plaintiff filed a three count third amended complaint. The first count was directed against the defendant and was identical to the one count in the original complaint. The second count was directed against the defendant, the defendant\u2019s five adult children from his prior marriage, two spray trusts established for the parties\u2019 two children and the LDGG Limited Partnership. That count alleged that the defendant\u2019s transfers of certain assets were fraudulent in violation of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, General Statutes \u00a7 52-552a et seq., and, therefore, they should be set aside and the assets returned to the marital estate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The third count essentially was identical to the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u201cOn October 11, 2001, the defendant filed an answer and a counterclaim for dissolution of marriage. On October 30, 2001, the defendant\u2019s five children from his prior marriage filed an answer, special defenses and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>four count counterclaim. They also filed a claim for a jury trial. On that same date, the LDGG Limited Partnership and the trustee of the two trusts filed their answers and special defenses. On November 8,2001, the plaintiff filed an answer and special defenses to the counterclaims of the defendant\u2019s five children from his prior marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u201cAfter a lengthy trial, the court dissolved the parties\u2019 marriage on January 11, 2002, on the basis of irretrievable breakdown. The court also determined that the plaintiff failed to prove her fraudulent transfer claims by the requisite clear and convincing evidence. The court, however, stated that although it would not set aside the transfers or include the assets involved in the marital estate, it would consider the defendant\u2019s removal of those assets from the marital estate in fashioning its financial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201cIn its orders, the court ordered the defendant to pay to the plaintiff $710 per week in alimony until the death of either party, the plaintiffs remarriage or her cohabitation. It also ordered the defendant to maintain his life insurance for the plaintiffs benefit and to provide health insurance for her for three years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *6The court further ordered the defendant to transfer to the plaintiff his interest in the marital residence at 24 Sunbrook Road in Woodbridge. In addition, the court ordered the defendant to transfer to the plaintiff his stock in Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc., or, alternatively, the value of that stock, which the court found to be $250,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, the court ordered the defendant to transfer to the plaintiff his individual retirement account, which was valued at approximately $9900, and to pay to the plaintiff $100,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>in attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 769-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court, claiming the trial court improperly: \u201c(1) overvalued the defendant\u2019s stock in Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc., (2) improperly awarded the plaintiff 98 percent of the parties\u2019 marital assets, (3) improperly relied on gross income, rather than net income, in determining the defendant\u2019s alimony obligation, (4) improperly ordered the defendant to pay alimony and other expenses that exceed his available income, and (5) abused its discretion in awarding the plaintiff $100,000 in attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Id., 769. The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant\u2019s third and fourth claims and reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment as to all financial orders, declining to reach the defendant\u2019s other claims. Id., 776-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff makes three claims. Specifically, she claims that the Appellate Court improperly: (1) disregarded the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant was not a credible witness and placed the burden on the plaintiff to disprove the defendant\u2019s allegedly unsubstantiated allegation that the trial court\u2019s award of alimony was based on gross income rather than earning capacity; (2) held the trial court\u2019s financial awards unreasonable in light of the evidence presented at trial; and (3) reversed the trial court\u2019s $100,000 award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The defendant, in response, argues that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court\u2019s alimony award was based on gross income rather than net income and properly disregarded the plaintiffs claim that the award reflected earning capacity. He further contends that the Appellate Court properly reversed the trial court\u2019s financial awards as unreasonable and contrary to law and held the award of attorney\u2019s fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>to be an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant\u2019s contention that the Appellate Court properly reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, but we affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment for different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">At the outset, we note that \u201c[t]he issues involving financial orders are entirely interwoven. The rendering of a judgment in a complicated dissolution case is a carefully crafted mosaic, each element of which may be dependent on the other.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sunbury </em>v. <em>Sunbury, </em>210 Conn. 170, 175, 553 A.2d 612 (1989). Furthermore, trial courts are endowed with broad discretion to distribute property in connection with a dissolution of marriage. <em>Bornemann </em>v. <em>Bornemann, </em>245 Conn. 508, 531-32, 752 A.2d 978 (1998). With those caveats in mind, we address in turn the three parts of the trial court\u2019s financial award.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">DISTRIBUTION OF MARITAL PROPERTY</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Although a trial court is afforded broad discretion when distributing marital property, it must take into account several statutory factors. <em>Lopiano </em>v. <em>Lopiano, </em>247 Conn. 356, 374-75, 752 A.2d 1000 (1998). These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>factors, enumerated in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> include \u201cthe age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability . . . and needs of each of the parties . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lopiano </em>v. <em>Lopiano, </em>supra, 375. Although the trial court \u201cneed not give each factor equal weight ... or recite the statutory criteria that it considered in making its decision or make express findings as to each statutory factor,\u201d it must take each into account. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">It is true that \u201ctrial courts are empowered to deal broadly with property and its equitable division incident to dissolution proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>265 Conn. 669, 682, 830 A.2d 193 (2003). Generally, we will not overturn atrial court\u2019s division of marital property unless it \u201cmisapplies, overlooks, or gives a wrong or improper effect to any test or consideration which it was [its] duty to regard.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bornemann </em>v. <em>Bornemann, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 532. We must, however, consider, the paramount \u201cpurpose of a property division pursuant to a dissolution proceeding [which] is to unscramble existing marital property in order to give each spouse his or her equitable share at the time of dissolution.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>249 Conn. 265, 275, 752 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>A.2d 1023 (1999). Under the circumstances of this case, an award of 98.5 percent of the marital estate, or $720,936.56 of the $731,870.21 estate, fails to capture this maxim.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Although the trial court stated that it had considered all of the statutory criteria when it fashioned the financial award, its final judgment indicates otherwise. As the trial court acknowledged, the defendant had only an eighth grade education, suffered from angina and other health problems, required several surgeries, underwent ongoing treatment from several physicians, and took nine different medications. The trial court also noted that the defendant\u2019s ability to work was severely compromised and indeed, he worked only a few hours per day. The defendant\u2019s primary source of income was from his automotive parts business, which paid him a gross salary of $73,840 per year. He apparently enjoyed some gambling winnings as well, although in varying amounts from year to year. Nothing in the trial court\u2019s judgment or memorandum of decision indicates that it considered the defendant\u2019s gambling winnings a viable source of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The term \u201cstation,\u201d as used in \u00a7 46b-81, refers to the parties\u2019 standard of living, which the courts carefully must consider when dividing marital property. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>207 Conn. 217, 232, 541 A.2d 1201 (1988); <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>25 Conn. App. 41, 47, 592 A.2d 424, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 903, 593 A.2d 969 (1991). The purpose of dividing marital property is to preserve, as much as possible, the parties\u2019 existing standard of living, not to award property to one spouse to the complete exclusion of the other. Although an award of such magnitude might be permissible under some circumstances, the trial court\u2019s other financial orders render the current distribution impracticable. Indeed, the trial court\u2019s order that the defendant pay considerable alimony as well as maintain two insurance policies for the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>tiffs benefit exhausted his income. See also part II of this opinion. Given the court\u2019s order that he relinquish his stock in Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc., which assured him a regular paycheck despite working only a few hours a day, the defendant\u2019s future employment prospects are uncertain at best.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s already diminished ability to generate income due to his age, health, lack of education, and other infirmities also militates against divesting him of any assets with which he could satisfy the trial court\u2019s other orders. See <em>Bartlett </em>v. Bartlett, 220 Conn. 372, 378 n.8, 599 A.2d 14 (1991) (\u201c[i]n assigning marital property, the trial court must also consider the opportunity for each party to acquire future capital assets and income, as well as the contribution of each of the parties toward the value of their respective estates\u201d). Thus, the trial court\u2019s orders leave the defendant destitute, while giving to the plaintiff all significant marital assets as well as the defendant\u2019s entire salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The plaintiff attempts to justify the disproportionate award by relying on allegations of fraud. Specifically, she relies on <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>221 Conn. 698, 709, 607 A.2d 383 (1992), in which we stated that \u201cthe trial court in a dissolution action may properly consider as part of the marital estate property that has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>fraudulently transferred even though for some reason the trial court has chosen not to set aside the transfer.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Watson, </em>the trial court applied then General Statutes \u00a7 52-552, which required that \u201c[t]he party seeking to set aside a conveyance as fraudulent bears the burden of proving . . . that the conveyance was made without substantial consideration <em>and </em>rendered the transferor unable to meet his obligations . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 707. After making a formal finding that the defendant had transferred property with fraudulent intent and without substantial consideration, the trial court in <em>Watson </em>declined to set aside the conveyance or include the value of the property in the marital estate because the conveyance had not rendered him unable to meet his obligations. Id., 706-707. This court reversed the trial court\u2019s order, concluding that, although the conveyance was not set aside because the second statutory element was unsatisfied, the trial court should have included the value of the property in the marital estate because the defendant had transferred it with the intent to defraud the plaintiff. Id., 708-709.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Although the plaintiff in the present case is correct in stating that a fraudulent conveyance not set aside may still be considered in the value of the estate, <em>Watson </em>does not support her claim that \u201cthe court could prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>erly consider the value of the transferred stock and real estate as part of the marital [property],\u201d in light of the fact that the trial court explicitly found that the conveyance at issue herein was <em>not </em>fraudulent. The determination of whether a fraudulent transfer took place is a question of fact and it is axiomatic that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s [factual] findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. . . . We cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Melillo </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>249 Conn. 138, 151, 732 A.2d 133 (1999); see also <em>National Loan Investors, L.P. </em>v. <em>World Properties, LLC, </em>79 Conn. App. 725, 731, 830 A.2d 1178 (2003) (\u201c \u2018The question of whether a fraudulent conveyance took place is solely a question of fact to be determined by the trier. . . . We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous and unsupported by the record.\u2019 \u201d), cert. denied, 267 Conn. 910, 840 A.2d 1173 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The trial court enumerated in detail the reasons supporting its finding that the plaintiff had not proven the existence of a fraudulent conveyance and we will not disturb that finding on appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>justify the vastly disproportionate property distribution by pointing to mere allegations of fraud, which the trial court itself explicitly found insufficient to meet her burden of proof. Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellate Court correctly concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in making its distribution of the marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">ALIMONY AND RELATED PAYMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Trial courts also are afforded wide discretion in awarding alimony, provided that they consider all of the criteria enumerated in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Sunbury </em>v. <em>Sunbury, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 174. These criteria are essentially identical to those set forth in \u00a7 46b-81, which applies to the distribution of marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Here, in addition to awarding the defendant less than 2 percent of the total marital assets, the trial court also ordered him to pay the plaintiff $710 per week in alimony and to maintain for her benefit two substantial insurance policies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Should the defendant elect to turn over his stock to the plaintiff, he still will be hable for more than $1000 per week in alimony payments and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>insurance premiums, plus $100,000, payable in $20,000 installments over a period of five years, in attorney\u2019s fees. On the other hand, if the defendant exercises his option to retain the stock in his company, he faces the daunting task of paying the plaintiff either an additional $250,000, or delivering to her a promissory note with adequate security through which he promises to pay to her $250,000 over a period of ten years at 7 percent interest per annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The defendant\u2019s annual salary of $73,840, reduced by $36,920 per year for alimony payments, $12,480 per year for life insurance premiums, $5972.16 per year for health insurance premiums, and $20,000 per year in attorney\u2019s fees, results in an annual gross income deficit of $1532.16 per year. <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>supra, 82 Conn. App. 774. If the defendant\u2019s net income, which he reported to be $53,872 per year', is correct, the payment of alimony and insurance premiums alone leave the defendant with an annual net income deficit of $1500.16. Id. Additionally, if the defendant were to choose to retain his stock in Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc., he would be required to pay the plaintiff an additional lump sum of $250,000 or $34,832.52 per year for ten years. Id., 776 n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The trial court\u2019s order is irreconcilable with the principle that alimony is not designed to punish, but to ensure that the former spouse receives adequate support. See <em>Fattibene </em>v. <em>Fattibene, </em>183 Conn. 433, 441, 441 A.2d 3 (1981). Requiring that the defendant pay alimony that consumes his income and distributing the marital property in this manner offends the long settled principle that the defendant\u2019s ability to pay is a material consideration in formulating financial awards. <em>Casanova </em>v. <em>Casanova, </em>166 Conn. 304, 304-305, 348 A.2d 668 (1974); see also <em>Panganiban </em>v. <em>Panganiban, </em>54 Conn. App. 634, 642-43, 736 A.2d 190 (\u201c[i]t is hornbook law that what a spouse can afford to pay for support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>and alimony is a material consideration in the court\u2019s determination as to what is a proper order\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 251 Conn. 920, 742 A.2d 359 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The plaintiff contends that the trial court was entitled to consider the defendant\u2019s \u201cunreported [income]\u201d in fashioning its alimony award. Although there was some testimony supporting the existence of such income, the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision does not refer to the defendant\u2019s alleged practice of deleting invoices and pocketing money from cash sales or otherwise \u201cskimming\u201d from his business, and the trial court apparently did not consider these alleged practices in formulating its award. The only sources of income mentioned by the trial court, aside from the defendant\u2019s salary and occasional gambling winnings, were \u201cperiodic cash gifts\u201d from one of the defendant\u2019s children and some weekly cash amounts that the defendant brought home for incidentals. These small, inconsistent and largely unsubstantiated cash sums cannot justify the otherwise excessive award of alimony that the trial court ordered in this case. See <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>180 Conn. 184, 190, 429 A.2d 470 (1980) (alimony award factoring in unsubstantiated claim that husband made substantial money as commodities broker was improper where no concrete evidence existed as to specific amounts of such income).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">We are acutely aware that trial courts have wide discretion to formulate remedies in domestic relations cases, and we reiterate that \u201c[t]he power to act equitably is the keystone to the court\u2019s ability to fashion relief in the infinite variety of circumstances which arise out of the dissolution of a marriage. Without this wide discretion and broad equitable power, the courts in some cases might be -unable fairly to resolve the parties\u2019 dispute . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sunbury </em>v. <em>Sunbury, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 174. Nevertheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>when invoking principles of equity, a court must examine both the public policy implicated and the basic elements of fairness. <em>DiLullo </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>259 Conn. 847, 853, 729 A.2d 819 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Under the trial court\u2019s order, the defendant was forced to the brink of abject poverty by his obligations to pay the required alimony and insurance premiums, and then stripped of any means with which to pay them by the disproportionate division of the marital assets. Such an order constitutes an abuse of discretion in light of the defendant\u2019s age, poor health and compromised ability to work.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\"> We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court had abused its discretion in fashioning its financial orders?\u201d <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>270 Conn. 907, 853 A.2d 524 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\"> The plaintiff also named as defendants George Greco\u2019s five adult children from a previous marriage, two spray trusts established for the benefit of the two children of the marriage at issue in this case, and LDGG Limited Partnership, which is controlled by George Greco. Because he is the only defendant participating in this appeal, all references herein to the defendant are to George Greco.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\"> \u201cBetween 1998 and 1999, the defendant transferred to his children, either directly or via trust, the majority of his stock in Greco\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc., and title to various parcels of real estate related to that business. Those assets were worth more than $1 million.\u201d <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>supra, 82 Conn. App. 771. Although the defendant originally had owned all outstanding shares in the automotive parts company, he transferred all but sixty-five of the 122 voting shares to his children.
