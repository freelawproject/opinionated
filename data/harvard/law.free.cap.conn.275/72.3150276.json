Harty, and granting the plaintiffs application to confirm the award. The trial court concluded that the arbitration panel had not manifestly disregarded the law in awarding to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>plaintiff compensatory damages for the defendant\u2019s failure to pay the plaintiff a 1999 annual bonus and, pursuant to the wage collection statute, General Statutes \u00a7 31-72,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> double damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs for the defendant\u2019s failure to pay his 1998 and 1999 annual bonuses. With respect to the award under \u00a7 31-72, the defendant\u2019s principal contention is that the trial court improperly failed to apply de novo review to its claim that the arbitrators had exceeded their authority by awarding double damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs and that, under that standard, the award must be vacated because the submission expressly barred an award of punitive damages, exemplary damages or damages in the nature of punitive or exemplary damages. With respect to the award of compensatory damages for the 1999 bonus, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly determined that the arbitrators had not manifestly disregarded the law in determining that the bonus was a \u201cwage\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-72 and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the plaintiff was entitled to the bonus. We conclude that the trial court improperly failed to vacate the award with respect to attorney\u2019s fees and costs only. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The defendant is a New York corporation doing business in Connecticut. The parties executed an employment agreement (agreement) under which the plaintiff was to serve as a managing director of one of the defendant\u2019s divisions for a term beginning on June 28, 1996, and ending on December 31, 1999. The agreement thereafter automatically would extend for successive one year periods unless either party notified the other of its intention not to renew the agreement within a prescribed time period, at which point the plaintiff would become an employee at will. Under the terms of the agreement, the plaintiff was to receive annual bonuses in addition to a base salary. The agreement also contained an arbitration provision providing in relevant part that, \u201cany disputes, differences or controversies arising under this [agreement shall be settled and finally determined by arbitration .... However, it is understood and agreed that the arbitrators are not authorized or entitled to include as part of any award rendered by them, special, exemplary or punitive damages or amounts in the nature of special, exemplary or punitive damages regardless of the nature or form of the claim or grievance that has been submitted to arbitration . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">During the plaintiffs term of employment, certain disputes arose between the parties. One of these disputes concerned the plaintiffs 1996 and 1997 bonuses. The parties ultimately executed an agreement under which the defendant would pay the plaintiff approximately $150,000 as bonus compensation in exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>for his release of claims, including any claim under \u00a7 31-72, against the defendant arising from the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">As a result of a subsequent dispute, in December, 1998, the parties exchanged letters notifying the other of their intention not to renew the agreement and that, as a result, the agreement would terminate on December 31, 1999. By letter dated December 31, 1998, the defendant ordered the plaintiff to remain on home leave until further notice and not to have any contact with the defendant\u2019s employees or clients. One year later, by letter dated December 31, 1999, the defendant notified the plaintiff that it had terminated his employment. The defendant paid the plaintiff his salary during the year he remained on home leave, but did not pay him annual bonuses for 1998 and 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a claim for arbitration asserting that the defendant had breached the employment agreement and seeking, inter alia, compensatory damages for his 1998 and 1999 bonuses and, pursuant to \u00a7 31-72, additional damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs. After seventeen days of hearings, a panel of three arbitrators rendered an award in favor of the plaintiff of compensatory damages in the amount of $1,157,393.22, plus interest, and pursuant to \u00a7 31-72, additional damages in the amount of $1,157,393.22, attorney\u2019s fees of $382,556 and costs of $39,107.88. The arbitrators did not issue a memorandum of decision setting forth factual findings and legal conclusions supporting the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The plaintiff filed an application in the trial court to confirm the award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417. The defendant filed an application to vacate the award in part pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming that the arbitrators had manifestly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>disregarded the law and evidence by awarding to the plaintiff: (1) compensatory damages for the 1999 bonus; and (2) double damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 31-72 for both the 1998 and 1999 bonuses.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At a hearing on the application to vacate, the defendant also argued that the submission was restricted because, under the terms of the employment agreement, the arbitrators could not award punitive, exemplary or special damages. Accordingly, the defendant contended that the arbitrators had exceeded their authority by awarding such damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The trial court first determined that, in the absence of clear authority to the contrary, the arbitrators properly had determined that the submission was unrestricted, despite its prohibition on an award of punitive damages, because the parties had agreed to submit to arbitration \u201cany disputes\u201d arising under their agreement. The court then concluded that the contested portions of the award must be reviewed under the manifest disregard of the law standard. Turning to the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the damages awarded under \u00a7 31-72, the trial court determined that neither the plain language of the statute, the statute\u2019s legislative history nor our case law supported the defendant\u2019s contention that the law was well-defined that double damages, fees and costs under the wage collection statute were punitive and, therefore, barred under the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>agreement. Turning to the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the award of compensatory damages for its failure to pay the plaintiff his 1999 bonus, the court concluded that the arbitrators had not manifestly disregarded the law either as to whether the plaintiffs bonus was a \u201cwage\u201d under the statute or as to whether the plaintiff was entitled to receive the bonus under the terms of the employment agreement. Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s application to vacate part of the award and granted the plaintiffs application to confirm the award in its entirety. The defendant then appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant failed to meet its burden of proving that the arbitrators exceeded their authority by rendering the award under \u00a7 31-72 and the award of compensatory damages for the 1999 bonus. It first claims that the trial court improperly reviewed under the manifest disregard of the law standard, rather than de novo, its claim that the award of double damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs under \u00a7 31-72 was outside the scope of the submission. The defendant contends that, under de novo review, the trial court should have determined that the arbitrators exceeded their authority because they were barred under the parties\u2019 agreements from awarding such damages. The defendant further contends that, even under the manifest disregard standard, the trial court improperly determined that the arbitrators had not exceeded their authority: (1) in light of the express limitations in the agreement; and (2) because the plaintiffs bonuses are not \u201cwages\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-72. Finally, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly denied its application to vacate the award with respect to the compensatory damages for the 1999 bonus because the arbitrators <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>had manifestly disregarded the law and evidence demonstrating that, under the terms of the agreement, the plaintiff was not entitled to the bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Before addressing these claims, we set forth the well established principles that guide our analysis. \u201cJudicial review of arbitral decisions is narrowly confined. . . . When the parties agree to arbitration and establish the authority of the arbitrator through the terms of their submission, the extent of our judicial review of the award is delineated by the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement. . . . When the scope of the submission is unrestricted, the resulting award is not subject to de novo review even for errors of law so long as the award conforms to the submission. . . . Because we favor arbitration as a means of settling private disputes, we undertake judicial review of arbitration awards in a manner designed to minimize interference with an efficient and economical system of alternative dispute resolution. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u201cWhere the submission does not otherwise state, the arbitrators are empowered to decide factual and legal questions and an award cannot be vacated on the grounds that . . . the interpretation of the agreement by the arbitrators was erroneous. Courts will not review the evidence nor, where the submission is unrestricted, will they review the arbitrators\u2019 decision of the legal questions involved. ... In other words, [u]nder an unrestricted submission, the arbitrators\u2019 decision is considered final and binding; thus the courts will not review the evidence considered by the arbitrators nor will they review the award for errors of law or fact. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u201cThe significance ... of a determination that an arbitration submission was unrestricted or restricted is not to determine what the arbitrators are obligated to do, but to determine the scope of judicial review of what they have done. Put another way, the submission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>tells the arbitrators what they are obligated to decide. The determination by a court of whether the submission was restricted or unrestricted tells the court what its scope of review is regarding the arbitrators\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u201cEven in the case of an unrestricted submission, we have . . . recognized three grounds for vacating an award: (1) the award rules on the constitutionality of a statute ... (2) the award violates clear- public policy . . . [and] (3) the award contravenes one or more of the statutory proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418. . . . [Section] 52-418 (a) (4) provides that an arbitration award shall be vacated if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u201cIn our construction of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4), we have, as a general matter, looked to a comparison of the award with the submission to determine whether the arbitrators have exceeded their powers. . . . We have also recognized, however, that . . . [a]n award that manifests an egregious or patently irrational application of the law is an award that should be set aside pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) because the arbitrator has exceeded [his] powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Industrial Risk Insurers </em>v. <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co., </em>273 Conn. 86, 92-95, 868 A.2d 47 (2005). With these principles in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s claims relating to whether the trial court properly concluded that the defendant had failed to meet its burden of proving that the arbitrators exceeded their authority by rendering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>an award of damages under \u00a7 31-72 because that award exceeded the scope of the submission. The defendant challenges both the standard of review applied and the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. We address each of these in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly concluded that, in light of its determination that the submission was unrestricted, the issue of whether the award under \u00a7 31-72 conformed to the submission must be reviewed under the manifest disregard of the law standard. Specifically, the defendant claims that, irrespective of whether the submission is unrestricted, that issue must be reviewed de novo, and that, under that standard, the trial court should have determined that the arbitrators exceeded their authority by awarding the double damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs because they were barred under the parties\u2019 agreements from awarding punitive or exemplary damages, or damages of such a nature.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">In response, the plaintiff contends that: (1) the defendant agreed in the proceedings before the trial court that manifest disregard of the law was the proper standard of review and, therefore, we should not review this claim; and (2) the proper standard of review of an award rendered pursuant to an unrestricted submission is manifest disregard of the law, not the heightened standard sought by the defendant. We conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>issue is preserved for review and that the trial court improperly reviewed the issue under the manifest disregard of the law standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">We agree with the plaintiff that the defendant expressly sought review solely under the manifest disregard of the law standard in each of its submissions to the trial court\u2014its application to vacate the award, its memorandum in support of the application and its supplemental brief. In the defendant\u2019s argument to the trial court on its application, however, although not a model of clarity as to this issue, the defendant expressly stated twice that the trial court must review \u201cde novo\u201d the issue of whether the arbitrators had exceeded their authority or jurisdiction by rendering the award pursuant to \u00a7 31-72. Moreover, the defendant repeatedly asserted that the submission was restricted, a claim that, if correct, would have entitled the defendant to de novo review. See <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Wisvest-Connecticut, LLC, </em>259 Conn. 665, 670 n.1, 791 A.2d 546 (2002). Therefore, we conclude that the defendant adequately preserved its claim that the trial court improperly had failed to apply de novo review.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We turn, therefore, to the issue of whether the proper standard of review for determining whether the arbitrators exceeded their authority in that the award does not conform to the submission is de novo, as contended by the defendant, or manifest disregard of the law, as contended by the plaintiff. We begin by noting that the defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the submission is unrestricted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In light of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>posture, as noted previously, \u201cthe arbitrators\u2019 decision is considered final and binding; thus the courts will not review the evidence considered by the arbitrators nor will they review the award for errors of law or fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Industrial Risk Insurers </em>v. <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co., </em>258 Conn. 101, 110, 779 A.2d 737 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Even with an unrestricted submission, however, it is well settled that the award may be reviewed to determine if the arbitrators exceeded their authority, one of the statutory grounds under \u00a7 52-418 for vacating an award. <em>Industrial Risk Insurers </em>v. <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co., </em>supra, 273 Conn. 94. We have explained that, \u201c[i]n our construction of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4), we have, as a general matter, looked to a comparison of the award with the submission to determine whether the arbitrators have exceeded their powers.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The standard for reviewing a claim that the award does not conform to the submission requires what we have termed \u201cin effect, de novo judicial review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>New England Health Care Employees Union, District 1199, AFL-CIO, </em>265 Conn. 771, 789, 830 A.2d 729 (2003). We also have recognized, however, that a claim that the arbitrators have manifestly disregarded the law may be asserted under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) as well. <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 10, 612 A.2d 742 (1992) (\u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>award that manifests an egregious or patently irrational application of the law is an award that should be set aside pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 [a] [4] because the arbitrator has \u2018exceeded [his] powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made\u2019 \u201d). Thus, a claim that the arbitrators have \u201cexceeded their powers\u201d may be established under \u00a7 52-418 in either one of two ways: (1) the award fails to conform to the submission, or, in other words, falls outside the scope of the submission; or (2) the arbitrators manifestly disregarded the law. See id., 6-8 (reviewing challenge to award on both grounds under \u00a7 52-418 [a] [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Although we have not explained precisely what \u201cin effect, de novo judicial review\u201d entails as applied to a claim that the award does not conform with the submission, that standard best can be understood when viewed in the context of what the court is permitted to consider when making this determination and the exact nature of the inquiry presented. Our review is limited to a comparison of the award to the submission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our inquiry generally is limited to a determination as to whether the parties have vested the arbitrators with the authority to decide the issue presented or to award the relief conferred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With respect to the latter, we have explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>that, \u201cas long as the arbitrator\u2019s remedies were \u2018consistent with the agreement\u2019 they were within the scope of the submission.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>New England Health Care Employees Union, District 1199, AFL-CIO, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 790; see also <em>In re Matter of Granite Worsted Mills, Inc., </em>25 N.Y.2d 451, 456, 255 N.E.2d 168, 306 N.Y.S.2d 934 (1969) (\u201cwhere it is clear from face of award itself . . . that the arbitrator has included an element of damages specifically excluded by the contract pursuant to which he obtained his very authority to act, he exceeds his powers under the contract and the award thus made must be vacated upon proper application\u201d). In making this determination, the court may not engage in fact-finding by providing an independent interpretation of the contract, but simply is charged with determining if the arbitrators have ignored their obligation to interpret and to apply the contract as written. See <em>Metropolitan District Commission </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 3713, </em>35 Conn. App. 804, 811, 647 A.2d 755 (1994) (concluding that trial court improperly granted plaintiffs application to vacate arbitration award because, in determining whether award conformed to submission, it provided an independent interpretation of contract and thus engaged in fact-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>finding beyond scope of trial court\u2019s powers of review); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Local 818, Council 4, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, </em>5 Conn. App. 636, 640, 502 A.2d 426 (1985) (\u201c[w]here one party claims that the award, as issued, is inherently inconsistent with the underlying collective bargaining agreement, the court will compare the agreement with the award to determine whether the arbitrator has ignored his obligation to interpret and apply that agreement as written\u201d), citing <em>Hudson Wire Co. </em>v. <em>Winsted Brass Workers Union, </em>150 Conn. 546, 553, 191 A.2d 557 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the issue of whether the trial court applied an incorrect standard of review. The trial court began its review of the defendant\u2019s claims by stating the general principle that, \u201c[i]f the award conforms to the submission, the arbitrators have not exceeded their powers.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Exley </em>v. <em>Connecticut Yankee Greyhound Racing, Inc., </em>59 Conn. App. 224, 228, 755 A.2d 990, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 939, 761 A.2d 760 (2000). It further noted that, to determine whether the award conformed to the submission, it must determine whether the submission was restricted or unrestricted. The trial court then determined that the arbitrators properly had determined that the submission was unrestricted because the agreement required that \u201call disputes be submitted to arbitration,\u201d and \u201c[t]he parties [had] provided no specific authority on whether [the] language proscribing the award of punitive damages by the arbitrators would change this apparent unrestricted submission to a \u2018restricted\u2019 one under Connecticut law.\u201d Thus, it concluded that the entire award must be examined under the manifest disregard of the law standard. It proceeded to determine in accordance with that standard that \u201c[t]he defendant has not bom[e] its burden of proving [that] the award did not conform to the arbitration agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The foregoing analysis indicates that the trial court failed to engage in the proper review of the issue presented. The trial court essentially collapsed the two grounds for vacating an award under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) when it subsumed its inquiry of the issue of whether the award conformed to the submission within the issue of whether the arbitrators had manifestly disregarded the law. It is clear under our case law, however, that, when raised, the two issues require independent consideration. See <em>Industrial Risk Insurers </em>v. <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co., </em>supra, 273 Conn. 95-96; <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 12-13; see also <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Local 4, Council 287, </em>195 Conn. 266, 273, 487 A.2d 553 (1985) (concluding that arbitration panel exceeded its authority in making award outside scope of submission by considering and basing its award on document that was not part of parties\u2019 agreement). Indeed, a claim that the award does not conform to the submission is predicated on the arbitrators\u2019 absolute lack of authority to decide an issue or to grant certain relief. By contrast, a necessary predicate to a claim that the arbitrators manifestly disregarded the law is that the arbitrators generally were vested with the authority to decide the issue or to grant the relief but ignored clearly applicable law in making that determination. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court improperly examined under the manifest disregard of the law standard the issue of whether the award conformed to the submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We therefore consider whether the trial court properly concluded that the defendant had failed to meet its burden of proving that the award of double damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs under \u00a7 31-72 fell outside the scope of the submission. In doing so, we are mindful that \u201c[e]very reasonable presumption and intendment will be made in favor of the award and of the arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>acts and proceedings. Hence, the burden rests on the party challenging the award to produce evidence sufficient to show that it does not conform to the submission.\u201d <em>Bic Pen Corp. </em>v. <em>Local No. 134, United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers of America, </em>183 Conn. 579, 585, 440 A.2d 774 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The defendant claims in its brief that \u201c[u]nder New York law, which governs under the contract, statutory double damages are clearly punitive or exemplary, or, at a minimum, must be considered \u2018in the nature of such damages.\u201d The defendant further contends that, even if Connecticut law were applicable to interpreting the parties\u2019 agreement, multiple damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs under \u00a7 31-72 clearly are in the nature of punitive or exemplary damages. Finally, the defendant contends that the award of attorney\u2019s fees was barred expressly under the employment handbook, which was incorporated by reference into the employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The plaintiff first responds that this issue must be determined under Connecticut law because: (1) the defendant never raised in the trial court the argument that the choice of law provision in the contract dictates that New York law govern the meaning of the agreement terms of exemplary or punitive damages, or damages \u201cin the nature of\u2019 such damages;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (2) \u00a7 31-72 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>a Connecticut statute, and, therefore, even New York courts would construe it in accordance with Connecticut law. The plaintiff claims that, under Connecticut law, the statutory double damages, fees and costs are not punitive or exemplary damages. The plaintiff further claims that the defendant conceded that it was subject to \u00a7 31-72 by virtue of the release the defendant had executed in satisfaction of the dispute over the plaintiff\u2019s 1996 and 1997 bonuses. Finally, the plaintiff claims that, even if the award falls outside the scope of the submission, the agreement cannot be raised as a defense to a claim under \u00a7 31-72 by the terms of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We agree with the plaintiff that this issue must be determined under Connecticut law because, at trial, the defendant failed to raise the New York choice of law provision as applied to \u00a7 31-72 and because the trial court rendered its decision solely by reference to Connecticut law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We also agree with the plaintiff that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>award of double damages was not outside the scope of the submission. We disagree, however, that the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs conformed to the submission and that the statute precludes raising the agreement as a basis for vacating such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">In considering whether the award conformed to the submission, we begin by noting the obvious. First, the arbitration clause does not refer expressly to statutoiy damages of any kind. Nor does it state an all-encompassing exclusion, such as providing that the arbitrators are authorized to award compensatoiy damages only and may not award any other damages, including, but not limited to, punitive or exemplary damages. Second, the award does not expressly label the damages, fees or costs under \u00a7 31-72 as \u201cpunitive\u201d or \u201cexemplary\u201d damages, and instead refers to the double damages as \u201cadditional\u201d damages. Finally, \u00a7 31-72 itself makes no reference to punitive or exemplary damages.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>we consider whether, in the absence of such express designations, the award under \u00a7 31-72 is, as a matter of law, punitive or exemplary damages or in the nature of such damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Our decision is informed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Alaimo </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>188 Conn. 36, 448 A.2d 207 (1982). In <em>Alaimo, </em>this court considered the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly had charged the jury that the plaintiff could recover both punitive and exemplary damages on her claims of fraud. Id., 37. Specifically, \u201c[t]he trial court charged the jury that the plaintiff could recover four types of damages: compensation for her financial loss; compensation for her emotional distress and mental anguish; punitive damages, which include such things as [the plaintiffs] attorney\u2019s fees, and the costs and expenses of bringing the action; and exemplary damages, which are defined by statute, and are awarded where the fraud is gross and involves moral turpitude or moral culpability under General Statutes \u00a7 52-564.\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 41-42. This court concluded that, \u201c[i]n distinguishing between punitive and exemplary damages and equating the latter with statutory treble damages the trial court erred.\u201d Id., 42. The court went on to explain that, under the well established rule governing the award of punitive damages, \u201c[p]unitive damages are awarded when the evidence shows a reckless indifference to the rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>of others or an intentional and wanton violation of those rights. ... If awarded, they are restricted to cost of litigation less taxable costs of the action being tried and not that of any former trial. . . . Further, for an award of punitive damages it is essential that evidence of the cost of the litigation of the case being tried must be offered. . . . <em>Vandersluis </em>v. <em>Weil, </em>176 Conn. 353, 358-59, 407 A.2d 982 (1978). Although some cases speak instead of exemplary damages, the same test is invoked and there can be little doubt that the two terms are merely alternate labels for the same remedy. ... In forging a new and unwarranted distinction between identities, the trial court erred.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alaimo </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>supra, 42-43. The court further concluded that \u201cthe definition of punitive damages provided by <em>Vandersluis </em>v. <em>Weil, </em>supra, [358-59] precludes the trial court\u2019s equation of exemplary and statutory damages . . . .\u201d Id., 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Thus, <em>Alaimo </em>makes clear that punitive damages and exemplary damages are one and the same under Connecticut law. See id., 42-43; see also <em>Matthiessen </em>v. <em>Vanech, </em>266 Conn. 822, 826 n.5, 836 A.2d 394 (2003) (\u201c[punitive] damages also are known as \u2018exemplary\u2019 damages\u201d). It further stands for the proposition that punitive damages are not equivalent to statutory multiple damages because of, inter alia, the different type of relief available under each.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Alaimo </em>v. <em>Royer, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>supra, 188 Conn. 43; see also <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 280, 285, 472 A.2d 306 (1984) (concluding that plaintiff was entitled to recover compensatory damages, exemplary damages and statutory treble damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The latter conclusion is bolstered by the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Caulfield </em>v. <em>Amica Mutual Ins. Co., </em>31 Conn. App. 781, 786 n.3, 627 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 913, 632 A.2d 688 (1993), concluding that an insurance policy exclusion for punitive and exemplary damages did not encompass statutory multiple damages under General Statutes \u00a7 14-295, which provides for double or treble damages for personal injury, wrongful death or property damage resulting from certain traffic violations. The court reasoned that, \u201c[ujnder Connecticut common law, the terms \u2018exemplary damages\u2019 and \u2018punitive damages\u2019 are interchangeable labels for damages awarded under certain circumstances to compensate a plaintiff for his expenses of litigation. <em>Alaimo </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>[supra, 188 Conn. 42-13]. It is well settled, however, that statutoiy multiple damages awarded pursuant to \u00a7 14-295, while serving a similar punitive purpose . . . are separate and distinct from common law punitive damages and are awarded in addition thereto in appropriate cases. [Id.], 43; see <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>[supra, 192 Conn. 285]. <em>The policy exclusions for punitive and exemplary damages are therefore ambiguous, at best, as to whether they encompass statutory multiple damages pursuant to \u00a7 </em>14-295.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Caulfield </em>v. <em>Amica Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 786 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Indeed, the Appellate Court\u2019s view is in accord with that of every other court our research has uncovered that has addressed the specific question before this court, in each case concluding that a submission prohibiting an award of punitive or exemplary damages was ambiguous as applied to statutory multiple damages. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>See <em>Pacificare Health Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Book, </em>538 U.S. 401, 405-407, 123 S. Ct. 1531, 155 L. Ed. 2d 578 (2003) (treble damages for violation of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act [RICO], 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 et seq., not barred by submissions that precluded award of punitive, exemplary or extracontractual damages); <em>Investment Partners, L.P. </em>v. <em>Glamour Shots Licensing, Inc., </em>298 F.3d 314, 317-18 (5th Cir. 2002) (treble damages for violation of Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15, not barred by submission precluding award of punitive damages); <em>In re Universal Service Fund Telephone Billing Practices Litigation, </em>300 F. Sup. 2d 1107, 1127 (D. Kan. 2003) (treble damages for violation of Clayton Act not precluded; court held that version of terms and conditions of defendant communications provider \u201cdoes not expressly ban treble damages . . . [r]ather, it states that [the defendant] is not liable for \u2018punitive or exemplaiy damages\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The reasoning of these courts further suggests that the question of whether statutory multiple damages could be considered \u201cin the nature of\u201d punitive damages is questionable for two reasons. First, the United States Supreme Court noted its hesitancy in rejecting the arbitrator\u2019s authority to render such an award given that the court previously had designated certain statutes providing multiple damages as purely remedial, while treating others as strictly punitive. See <em>Pacificare Health Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Book, </em>supra, 538 U.S. 406 (\u201c[i]n light of our case law\u2019s treatment of statutory treble damages, and given the uncertainty surrounding the parties\u2019 intent with respect to the contractual term \u2018punitive,\u2019 the application of the disputed language to [the] respondents\u2019 RICO claims is, to say the least, in doubt\u201d). Second, akin to this court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Alaimo </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>supra, 188 Conn. 42-43, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals noted the substantive differences between the type of relief and the circumstances under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>which the relief is awarded.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Investment Partners, L.P. </em>v. <em>Glamour Shots Licensing, Inc., </em>supra, 298 F.3d 317-18 (distinguishing statutory multiple damages and common-law punitive damages in that conditions for assessment of statutory damages are more circumscribed and provide less discretion than conditions for assessment of punitive damages). Although we recognize that we are not bound by these cases, we find them persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The statutory double damages awarded in the present case provide substantially different relief than that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>available for common-law punitive damages, which are limited to attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Moreover, it is clear that the purpose of damages under \u00a7 31-72 extends beyond that afforded by common-law punitive damages, which are intended to do no more than make the litigant whole. <em>See Label Systems Corp. </em>v. <em>Aghamohammadi, </em>270 Conn. 291, 335, 852 A.2d 703 (2004) (\u201c[limiting punitive damages to litigation expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, fulfills the salutary purpose of fully compensating a victim for the harm inflicted on him while avoiding the potential for injustice which may result from the exercise of unfettered discretion by a jury\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>223 Conn. 786, 827, 614 A.2d 414 (1992) (common-law punitive damages \u201cserve primarily to compensate the plaintiff for his injuries and, thus, are . . . limited to the plaintiffs litigation expenses less taxable costs\u201d); <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Maryland Casually Co., </em>127 Conn. 533, 538, 18 A.2d 357 (1941) (\u201c[u]nder our law the purpose of awarding so-called punitive damages is not to punish the defendant for his offense but to compensate the plaintiff for his injuries, and they cannot exceed the amount of the plaintiffs expenses of litigation less taxable costs\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Although the defendant relies on select legislative history to \u00a7 31-72 that we have construed as indicating that the statute has a punitive purpose;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> see <em>Shortt </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>New Milford Police Dept., </em>212 Conn. 294, 309 n.13, 562 A.2d 7 (1989) (interpreting joint standing committee hearing remarks by legislator as indicating that \u201ca primary purpose [of the 1978 amendment providing double damages] was to penalize the employers\u201d); this court has indicated that the statute serves <em>both </em>a remedial and punitive or deterrent purpose. See <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 272, 828 A.2d 64 (2003) (\u201cwe previously have acknowledged the punitive and remedial purposes of \u00a7 31-72\u201d); <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Hartford Technical Institute, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 454, 463, 704 A.2d 222 (1997) (concluding that broader interpretation of term \u201cemployer\u201d under \u00a7 31-72 \u201ceffectuates the statutory policies of compensating employees and deterring employers from failing to pay wages\u201d); <em>Tianti </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>231 Conn. 690, 696, 651 A.2d 1286 (1995) (\u201c[t]he purpose of \u00a7 31-72 is remedial, and therefore it must be given a liberal construction in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Therefore, we conclude that the submission\u2019s limitation on an award of \u201cpunitive damages,\u201d or \u201cdamages in the nature of punitive damages,\u201d is ambiguous with respect to whether the contract provision was designed to exclude the double damages provided for under \u00a7 31-72. To justify vacating an award, however, we must determine that the award <em>necessarily </em>falls outside the scope of the submission. See <em>United Paperworkers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>International Union, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 38, 108 S. Ct. 364, 98 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1987) (\u201cas long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority, that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision\u201d). Here, the ambiguity as to the parties\u2019 intent precludes such a result. <em>See Providence Journal Co. </em>v. <em>Providence Newspaper Guild, </em>271 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 2001) (\u201ccourt\u2019s task \u2018is limited to determining if the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the contract is in any way plausible\u2019 \u201d); <em>American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, Milwaukee Local </em>v. <em>Runyon, </em>185 F.3d 832, 835 (7th Cir. 1999) (\u201c[t]he arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the scope of the issue must be upheld so long as it is rationally derived from the parties\u2019 submission\u201d). Therefore, we conclude that the award of double damages under \u00a7 31-72 did not exceed the scope of the submission.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We reach a different result, however, applying the reasoning above to the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The attorney\u2019s fees and costs provide the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>relief and serve the same function as would be afforded by common-law punitive damages. See <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 827 (attorney\u2019s fees are element of punitive damages); <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>supra, 127 Conn. 538 (same). It is clear, therefore, that they are \u201cin the nature of\u2019 punitive damages. Accordingly, the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs exceeded the scope of the submission and must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In light of that conclusion, we must consider the plaintiffs contention that \u00a7 31-72 bars raising a private agreement as a defense to an action under the wage collection statute. Specifically, the plaintiff relies on the first sentence of the statute, which provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen any employer fails to pay an employee wages in accordance with the provisions of sections 31-71a to 31-7U, inclusive, or fails to compensate an employee in accordance with section 31-76k . . . such employee . . . may recover, in a civil action, twice the full amount of such wages, with costs and such reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as may be allowed by the court, <em>and any agreement between him and his employer for payment of wages other than as specified in said sections shall be no defense to such action. </em>. . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-72. We disagree with the meaning ascribed by the plaintiff to this prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The statutory prohibition is not directed at an agreement that ostensibly waives the right to pursue an action under it. The prohibition in \u00a7 31-72 is directed specifically at an agreement for the \u201cpayment of wages <em>other than as </em>specified\u201d in certain statutes, ones that dictate the frequency, timing and method by which an employer must pay its employees. (Emphasis added.) See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 31-71b (requiring weekly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>payment on regular payday); General Statutes \u00a7 31-71c (requiring payment of wages on next regular payday upon voluntary termination or suspension and on next business day upon discharge). Indeed, General Statutes \u00a7 31-71i provides the sole method for deviating from those requirements, authorizing the labor commissioner to waive, upon application by an employer, the prescribed timing for payment of wages. Thus, the statute simply bars an employer from raising as a defense to an action alleging wrongful withholding of wages under \u00a7 31-72 that the employee has executed a contract agreeing to a different method or timing of the payment of wages in the absence of a waiver from the labor commissioner.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant is not barred by \u00a7 31-72 from asserting the employment agreement as a ground for vacating the award.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The defendant next asserts that the arbitrators manifestly disregarded the law by awarding damages under \u00a7 31-72 because the plaintiffs bonuses are not \u201cwages\u201d within the meaning of that statute. Under this highly deferential standard, the defendant has the burden of proving \u201cthree elements, all of which must be satisfied in order for a court to vacate an arbitration award on the ground that the arbitration panel manifestly disregarded the law: (1) the error was obvious and capable of being readily and instantly perceived by the average person qualified to serve as an arbitrator; (2) the arbitration panel appreciated the existence of a clearly governing legal principle but decided to ignore it; and (3) the governing law alleged to have been ignored by the arbitration panel is well defined, explicit, and clearly applicable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Industrial Risk Insurers </em>v. <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co., </em>supra, 273 Conn. 95. \u201c[T]he manifest disregard of the law ground for vacating an arbitration award is narrow and should be reserved for circumstances of an arbitrator\u2019s extraordinary lack of fidelity to established legal principles.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. It is clear that the defendant cannot overcome this high hurdle.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The defendant cites several trial court cases stating that a bonus is considered a \u201cwage\u201d only if it compensates the employee for his or her personal efforts alone as evidence that the arbitrators manifestly disregarded the law. This claim merits little discussion. The law allegedly ignored by the arbitration panel cannot be considered \u201cwell defined, explicit, and clearly applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ble\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 9; \u201c[if] the parameters of the . . . [applicable statute] have never been addressed by this court or the Appellate Court.\u201d <em>Saturn Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Premier Roofing Co., </em>238 Conn. 293, 307, 680 A.2d 1274 (1996). Moreover, as the defendant itself properly noted at the hearing before the trial court, the cases it relies on indicate that the relevant determination is to be made \u201con a case-by-case basis . . . .\u201d Therefore, it cannot be said that the arbitrators ignored clearly applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Finally, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly determined that the arbitrators had not manifestly disregarded the law in awarding compensatory damages for the plaintiffs 1999 bonus. The defendant contends that the arbitrators manifestly disregarded the law by awarding the 1999 bonus because: (1) the agreement conditions payment of bonuses on being employed at the time the bonus is payable, and the plaintiffs employment had been terminated at the time the bonus was due; (2) the plaintiff provided no benefit to the defendant that would entitle him to the bonus; and (3) the case law relied on by the trial court holding that an employer cannot breach an agreement to avoid paying amounts due for past services are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The plaintiff contends, and we agree, that the defendant\u2019s claim is predicated largely on the arbitrators\u2019 interpretation of the agreement and factual findings regarding the plaintiffs termination and the defendant\u2019s intent. Indeed, the agreement reflects a patent ambiguity as to whether it unilaterally bars payment of compensation already earned but not yet paid if the employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>no longer is employed at the time payment is due.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As we noted previously, these issues are beyond the scope of our review. See <em>Bic Pen Corp. </em>v. <em>Local No. 134, United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers of America, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 584 (\u201c[w]here the submission does not otherwise state, the arbitrators are empowered to decide factual and legal questions and an award cannot be vacated on the gromds that the construction placed upon the facts or the interpretation of the agreement by the arbitrators was erroneous\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Moreover, although the defendant attempts to distinguish factually the cases relied on by the trial court, it has offered no case law to support directly its contention. Indeed, one of the cases cited by the trial court, <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Cadbury Beverages, Inc., </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 3:97CV2441, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 16098 (D. Conn. June 29,1999), stands for precisely the legal argument asserted by the plaintiff\u2014namely, that an employer may be liable under \u00a7 31-72 for failing to pay a bonus, irrespective of whether the employment agreement required that the employee still be in the defendant employer\u2019s employment at the time payment is due, if it is fomd that the employee\u2019s termination substantially was motivated by the desire to avoid pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ment of the bonus. Id., *8-14. Therefore, the defendant has failed to establish that the arbitrators ignored \u201cwell defined, explicit, and clearly applicable\u201d law. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to grant the defendant\u2019s application to vacate the award with respect to attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-72 provides: \u201cWhen any employer fails to pay an employee wages in accordance with the provisions of sections 31-71a to 31-71\u00cd, inclusive, or fails to compensate an employee in accordance with section 31-76k or where an employee or a labor organization representing an employee institutes an action to enforce an arbitration award which requires an employer to make an employee whole or to make payments to an employee welfare fund, such employee or labor organization may recover, in a civil action, twice the full amount of such wages, with costs and such reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as may be allowed by the court, and any agreement between him and his employer for payment of wages other than as specified in said sections shall be no defense to such action.

In the present case, the arbitrators did not issue a memorandum of decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\"> A treatise on commercial arbitration explains that, in reviewing a challenge that the arbitrators have exceeded their powers in that the award does not conform to the submission, \u201ccourts have construed this provision [allowing an arbitrator\u2019s decision to be vacated] narrowly . . . holding that it applies only when arbitrators decide issues not presented to them or grant relief not authorized in the arbitration agreement. The parameters of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>exceeded powers inquiry are defined by the submission of issues to the arbitrator and the arbitrator\u2019s authority as set forth in the arbitration agreement.

The court must instead focus on whether the [arbitrator] had authority to reach a certain issue, not whether that issue was correctly decided. Consequently, as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of authority, the award must be enforced. The arbitrator\u2019s decision cannot be overturned even if the court is convinced that the arbitrator committed serious error.\u201d 1 M.

Nonetheless, the defendant did bring to the trial court\u2019s attention the prohibition in its entirety, and the trial court\u2019s analysis implicitly addressed whether the award was \u201cin the nature\u201d of punitive damages by virtue of its discussion of the purpose of \u00a7 31-72. Therefore, we consider whether the award was in the nature of punitive or exemplary damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\"> In its memorandum of law in support of its application to vacate the award, the defendant quoted several provisions from the employment agreement that it deemed relevant, among which was the New York choice of law provision. The defendant cited to New York law, however, only in the argument section addressing the purely contractual issue of whether the plaintiff was entitled to a bonus under the agreement. In the remainder of its memorandum addressing its three claims under \u00a7 31-72, the defendant cited only to Connecticut law. Indeed, the defendant never asserted that the contract terms of \u201cpunitive,\u201d \u201cexemplary\u201d or \u201cspecial\u201d damages had any particular meaning divorced from \u00a7 31-72. The defendant similarly relied only on Connecticut law as to this issue in its supplemental brief to the trial court and at oral argument. Had the defendant believed that it had asserted that the claim must be construed by applying New York law, it could have sought an articulation by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The defendant asserts in its reply brief that the trial court\u2019s failure to apply New York law is plain error. We reject this request. First, the defendant cannot claim error that it induced the trial court to make. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shashaty, </em>251 Conn. 768, 785-86, 742 A.2d 786 (1999) (\u201c[w]e have long held that a party cannot ordinarily claim error in the action of the trial court which [it] has induced\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1094, 120 S.

[Finally, the defendant] failed to request plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>error review of this claim in its initial brief to this court, but, rather, raised it for the first time in [its] reply brief. It is a well established principle that arguments cannot be raised for the first time in a reply brief.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 48 n.42, 717 A.2d 77 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b113-7\"> As the trial court properly noted, our statutes are replete with provisions for damages expressly designated as \"punitive,\u201d thus suggesting that, to the extent that such a factor is relevant to this inquiry, the legislature has not deemed the double damages under \u00a7 31-72 to be punitive damages. See <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>267 Conn. 524, 531, 536, 839 A.2d 1250 (2004) (concluding \u201cthat the term \u2018any loss,\u2019 as used in \u00a7 14-52 [b] [4], is facially susceptible to more than one interpretation\u201d and does not encompass statutory treble damages because such damages are extraordinary remedy, there was no express statutory language providing for indemnification for \u201cpunitive damages\u201d and legislature has stated expressly when it intends to confer right to punitive damages in other statutes); compare, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 4d-39; General Statutes \u00a7 16-8d; General Statutes \u00a7 19a-550; General Statutes \u00a7 22-351a; General Statutes \u00a7 31-51q; General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a; General Statutes \u00a7 35-53; General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g; General Statutes \u00a7 46a-98; General Statutes \u00a7 47-278; General Statutes \u00a7 52-240b. We further note that, in none of the aforementioned statutes has the legislature fixed the measures of damages as multiples of compensatory damages. But see General Statutes \u00a7 35-53 (b) (authorizing punitive damages \u201cin an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>amount not exceeding twice any award made under subsection [a]\u201d for actual damages <em>and </em>damages for uqjust enrichment); General Statutes \u00a7 52-240b (authorizing punitive damages in amount \u201cnot to exceed an amount equal to twice the damages awarded to the plaintiff\u201d). We are mindful, however, that this court has, on occasion, referred to a statutory multiple damage provision as providing punitive damages even in the absence of such express designation by the legislature. See <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>221 Conn. 674, 675, 607 A.2d 370 (1992) (referring to double damages under General Statutes \u00a7 47a-46 as \u201cstatutory punitive damages\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b114-7\"> fGeneral Statutes \u00a7 52-564 provides: \u201cAny person who steals any property of another, or knowingly receives and conceals stolen property, shall pay the owner treble his damages.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b115-6\"> We disagree with the defendant\u2019s argument that the same type of conduct is required for double damages under \u00a7 31-72 as is required for common-law punitive damages. Compare <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 269, 828 A.2d 64 (2003) (double damages under \u00a7 31-72 maybe awarded only upon finding of \u201cbad faith, arbitrariness or unreasonableness\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]) with <em>Label Systems Corp. </em>v. <em>Aghamohammadi, </em>270 Conn. 291, 335, 852 A.2d 703 (2004) (common-law punitive damages awarded for \u201cwanton or wilful malicious misconduct\u201d); <em>Alaimo </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>supra, 188 Conn. 42 (common-law \u201c[pjunitive damages are awarded when the evidence shows a reckless indifference to the rights of others or an intentional and wanton violation of those rights\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\"> Indeed, the Fifth Circuit recognized that multiple damages can be \u201cpunitive\u201d in some contexts, but not for purposes of interpreting an arbitration clause and an ensuing award, and thus rejected as significant in the arbitration context other case law referring to treble damages as punitive. The Court of Appeals held: \u201cFirst, the task in this case is to construe \u2018punitive\u2019 in a private parties\u2019 arbitration agreement, which the Supreme Court has clearly said we interpret broadly to permit arbitration as far as possible. Second, it makes sense to draw a distinction, from the standpoint of the parties\u2019 expectations when they entered the arbitration agreement, between statutory treble damages and common law punitive damages. That is, punitive damages are awarded under notoriously open-ended legal standards and a broadly defined constitutional limit concerning the amount awarded. Treble damages, however, represent a mere mathematical expansion of the actual damages calculated by the arbitrator. While private parties might well exclude common law punitive damages, with all their uncertainty, from the arbitrator\u2019s authority, the riskiness of committing antitrust damages to the arbitrator is much smaller. Thus, antitrust treble damages may indeed be \u2018punitive\u2019 simply because they exceed the actual damages that have been inflicted on the victim of violative conduct, but they are not \u2018punitive\u2019 for purposes of interpreting the scope of an arbitration clause.\u201d <em>Investment Partners, L.P. </em>v. <em>Glamour Shots Licensing, Inc., </em>supra, 298 F.3d 317-18; see also <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 614, 635-36, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1985) (\u201cNotwithstanding its important incidental policing function, the treble-damages cause of action conferred on private parties by \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act . . . seeks primarily to enable an injured competitor to gain compensation for that injury. Section 4 ... is in essence a remedial provision. ... Of course, treble damages also play an important role in penalizing wrongdoers and deterring wrongdoing .... It nevertheless is true that the treble-damages provision, which makes awards available only to injured parties, and measures the awards by amultiple of the injury actuallyproved, is designed primarily as aremedy.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b119-6\"> Specifically, the defendant points to comments made by then Senator Nancy L. Johnson in committee hearings, held in 1978 to amend \u00a7 31-72 to increase the penalties on employers. Senator Johnson stated: \u201cThe penalty for non-payment of wages is set forth in [\u00a7] 31-72. An unpaid employee must bring suit in court and if he or she wins, he or she recovers wages and [court] costs. This is hardly a sufficient penalty for so serious an offense as non-payment of wages. In fact, the employer loses nothing but court costs, while the employee has to bring a suit and go without earned wages for months or years.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Industrial Relations, 1978 Sess., pp. 154-55. Although this court construed Senator Johnson\u2019s comments to indicate that \u201ca primary purpose [of the 1978 amendment] was to penalize the employers\u201d; <em>Shortt </em>v. <em>New Milford Police, Dept., </em>212 Conn. 294, 309 n.13, 562 A.2d 7 (1989); the court did so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>specifically in the context of determining whether a plaintiff could pursue an action under \u00a7 31-72 without first establishing his entitlement to uncollected wages through the grievance procedures set forth in the collective bargaining agreement. Id., 299-300. The court concluded that \u00a7 31-72 is \u201ca remedial statute rather than one creating independent substantive rights\u201d; id., 309; and, thus, the plaintiff would be required first to exhaust the requisite collective bargaining procedures for grievance proceedings and arbitration to establish a right to the unpaid wages. Id., 305-309. Moreover, the court concluded that deterrence was <em>a </em>purpose of the statute, not <em>the </em>purpose. Id., 309 and n.13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b121-6\"> The defendant asserts in the alternative a claim that the arbitrators manifestly disregarded the law by awarding the double damages, pointing again to the limitation on remedies in the submission. In light of our rejection in part I B of this opinion of the same argument with respect to the defendant\u2019s claim that the award of double damages under \u00a7 31-72 did not conform to the submission for that same reason and the absence of any additional argument or authority, we need <em>not </em>engage in any additional analysis to resolve this alternative claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\"> The plaintiff claims that we should not consider whether the trial court properly confirmed the award with respect to attorney\u2019s fees and costs because the defendant did not raise those claims below. We disagree. In its application to vacate, the defendant asserted that the award of double damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs under \u00a7 31-72 were punitive and that, under the parties\u2019 agreements, the plaintiff had waived his right to seek any punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision stated that the defendant was challenging the award as to all three elements. Although not expressly stated, we construe the trial court\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s challenge to the double damages as dispositive of the challenge to the related fees and costs awarded pursuant to that same statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b123-5\"> We note that, at oral argument before the trial court, the defendant proffered the same construction of the statute that the plaintiff has in this appeal, when contending that the plaintiff was required to bring its claim under \u00a7 31-72 in the Superior Court, rather than in arbitration because the statute authorizes a \u201ccivil action.\u201d Specifically, the defendant asserted that it would be barred under \u00a7 31-72 from raising the employment agreement as a defense to an action in the trial court. At oral argument before this court, however, having abandoned by not briefing its claim that arbitration is not a \u201ccivil action\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-72, the defendant asserted a contradictory interpretation of the statute, namely, that the bar on raising private agreements does not apply to this type of claim. Because the plaintiff invoked the statute as a defense, we are required to interpret it de novo. We note, however, our disapproval of the defendant\u2019s conduct in improperly asserting contradictory interpretations of a statute in the same case to advance its interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b123-6\"> We also are compelled to reject the plaintiffs contention that the award under \u00a7 31-72 cannot be vacated under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) in light of the release that the parties executed in satisfaction of a dispute over payment of the plaintiffs 1996 and 1997 annual bonuses, which expressly required that the plaintiff forgo a claim under \u00a7 31-72. The plaintiff contends, as he did before the trial court, that this release constituted an admission by the defendant that damages under \u00a7 31-72 were not \u201cpunitive damages\u201d within the meaning of the arbitration clause. Whatever the merits arguably might be to such a claim, the arbitrators did not indicate that the release was the basis on which they rendered the award. Although we might be able to consider that issue if the arbitrators expressly had made findings in support of such a determination in a memorandum of decision; see footnote 6 of this opinion; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>tive arbitrators did not do so. Accordingly, under our well established case law, we are limited to a comparison of the award to the submission, and we may not speculate as to possible reasons that the arbitrators may have concluded that express limitations on their authority did not apply in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\"> Section 3 (f) of the agreement provides: \u201cAU compensation shall be payable only if Employee is employed by [the defendant] or an Affiliate at the time payment is made. Employee agrees that any compensation paid to Employee subsequent to the termination of Employee\u2019s employment with [the defendant] shall only be paid upon execution by Employee of a general unconditional release in favor of [the defendant] in a form satisfactory to [the defendant].\u201d Thus, although the first sentence appears to unequivocally bar any payment of compensation to an employee who is no longer employed by the defendant at the time payment is due, the second sentence indicates that such payment shall be made, but conditioned upon execution of a release. Moreover, we note serious questions as to the enforceability of the provision under the defendant\u2019s construction, as the refusal to pay wages that were earned but not due to be paid until after the employee\u2019s employment had been terminated would seem to violate public policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
