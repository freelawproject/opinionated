The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict, and the defendant appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sole issue in this appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion in failing to replay for the jury all of the testimony that the juiy had requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>to review at the outset of its deliberations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in the circumstances of this case and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On December 20, 1989, Reverend Kenneth Gray found the body of the victim in a parking lot of the Bethel Church<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in Southington as Gray was walking his twelve year old daughter to her school bus stop. The office of the chief medical examiner determined that the cause of the victim\u2019s death was asphyxia from ligature strangulation and further observed that the victim also had sustained a puncture wound to his forehead from \u201ca pointed, sharp instrument, [such as] a needle.\u201d It was estimated that the victim\u2019s death had occurred sometime between 9 p.m. and 12 a.m. on December 19 and 20, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">Shortly after Gray discovered the victim\u2019s body, the Southington police department learned that, on Decem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>ber 19, 1989, the victim had been driving a Honda Civic that was owned by his sister, Laura Schmidt. That car subsequently was found in the parking lot of Banquer\u2019s restaurant in New Britain where the victim had been employed as a bartender and bouncer by Jeffrey Stenner, the owner and operator of that restaurant. Thirteen latent finger and palm prints were lifted from the interior of the car and forwarded to the state police forensic laboratory for analysis. The laboratory, however, could not positively identify any of the prints.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">At the time of the victim\u2019s murder, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was investigating two armored car robberies that had occurred in West Hartford in 1987 and 1988. Because the victim and Stenner were suspects in those robberies, the FBI contacted the Southington police department to inquire whether the victim\u2019s murder and the robberies potentially were related. In 1992, the FBI arrested Stenner, Jill St. John and Perfecto Valle in connection with the two armored car robberies. Although the Southington police had pursued all available leads up to that point, the victim\u2019s murder remained unsolved, and the case was classified as dormant in 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The Southington police department reopened its investigation of the victim\u2019s murder in 2000, when Michael Shanley, a detective with the Southington police department, took another look at the case. Shanley contacted the cold case committee of the state police forensic laboratory, which agreed to reexamine certain evidence. Due to technological advancements, the laboratory was able to identify, inter alia, a fingerprint that had been lifted from Laura Schmidt\u2019s Honda Civic shortly after the murder. The print belonged to John Grzeszczyk, who, in 1989, had worked for and socialized with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">With this new information in hand, Shanley and Lawrence E. Skinner, an investigator with the office of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>state\u2019s attorney, contacted Grzeszczyk for questioning in late July, 2001. After multiple interviews, Grzeszczyk confessed his role in the victim\u2019s murder and implicated the defendant, Stenner, Salvatore Zampi and Gilberto Delgado, all of whom subsequently were charged in connection with the victim\u2019s murder. Grzeszczyk, Zampi, and Delgado admitted their involvement in the crime and testified against the defendant at his trial. All three claimed that the defendant had ordered Grzeszczyk and Delgado to murder the victim, and that the defendant did so at the behest of Stenner. Stenner\u2019s motive for the murder was twofold. First, Stenner wanted to silence the victim because of his indiscretions concerning the armored car heists that the two had perpetrated together in West Hartford. Second, Stenner sought to collect the proceeds of a life insurance policy that he had purchased on behalf of the victim, naming himself as the sole beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">To orchestrate the murder, Stenner turned to the defendant, whom he had befriended at a local gym. The defendant enlisted the help of Zampi, his \u201csecond in command,\u201d Grzeszczyk and Delgado. The murder plot was hatched by the defendant, Zampi, Grzeszczyk and Delgado at a meeting that was held on December 19, 1989, at the first floor apartment of a two-family house located at 86 Austin Street in New Britain. After discussing various \u201c[w]ays\u201d in which to kill the victim, the defendant directed Grzeszczyk and Delgado to strangle him with a piece of rope later that evening. The defendant, however, decided that a backup plan was needed in the event that Grzeszczyk and Delgado \u201cbotch[ed]\u201d the strangulation attempt. Their backup plan was to inject an \u201cair bubble\u201d into the victim\u2019s bloodstream using a syringe.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Because Grzeszczyk never had met the victim, the defendant and Grzeszczyk drove to Banquer\u2019s restaurant so that Stenner could \u201cpoint out\u201d the victim to</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Grzeszczyk. Stenner subsequently arranged for the victim to accompany Grzeszczyk on an \u201cerrand\u201d later that evening. Grzeszczyk and the defendant then returned to 86 Austin Street. Thereafter, Grzeszczyk and Delgado went to Banquer\u2019s restaurant to pick up the victim for their errand, and the victim willingly left with them in his sister\u2019s Honda Civic. Grzeszczyk drove, the victim sat in the front passenger seat and Delgado sat in the backseat directly behind the victim. While en route to their fictitious destination, Delgado took out a rope and strangled the victim from behind. As the victim struggled to free himself, Delgado tied the rope, which remained around the victim\u2019s neck, to the headrest of the victim\u2019s seat and then stabbed him in the forehead with a syringe. Grzeszczyk also struck the victim in the face with his forearm as he was driving. After Schmidt finally succumbed, Grzeszczyk and Delgado dumped his body in the parking lot of the Bethel Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Grzeszczyk and Delgado thereafter returned to the Austin Street apartment in New Britain, where they met the defendant and Zampi. At the defendant\u2019s urging, Grzeszczyk and Delgado removed the clothes that they were wearing during the murder and gave them to Zampi, who disposed of them. Zampi also drove the Honda Civic in which the victim had been murdered back to Banquer\u2019s restaurant and left it in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The defendant and Delgado were arrested for Schmidt\u2019s murder on August 14, 2001, and the arrests of Stenner, Zampi and Grzeszczyk followed soon thereafter. The defendant\u2019s trial commenced on May 13,2002, and included testimony from various law enforcement officials, forensic experts and other various witnesses. The focal point of the trial, however, was the testimony of Grzeszczyk, Delgado and Zampi regarding the defendant\u2019s role in planning and supervising the victim\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The jury began deliberating in the early afternoon of May 23, 2002, after the trial court instructed it on the law and the rules governing its deliberations. With respect to the latter, the court stated: \u201cYou have the right to request testimony to be read . . . back for you .... If you want this done, I recommend that you be somewhat precise in what it is that you are actually interested in hearing. If . . . your request is phrased broadly, simply the testimony of a witness, for example, I will give you the direct examination, cross-examination, redirect [and] recross [examination] of the witness in such a case. If that is what you want, your request will be honored. However, if that is not what you want, if you simply want a specific portion of testimony on a specific point, please so indicate so that we will be able to comply precisely with your request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Later that afternoon, the jury sent a note to the court asking it to play back the testimony of certain witnesses on four different topics. Specifically, the jury asked to rehear the testimony of: (1) Grzeszczyk, Zampi, Delgado, Norma I. Cruz<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Noel Torres<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as to who was living at 86 Austin Street in New Britain on December 19, 1989; (2) Grzeszczyk, Zampi and Delgado with respect to who was present at the \u201cpoint out\u201d meeting that occurred at Banquer\u2019s restaurant; (3) Grzeszczyk, Zampi and Delgado concerning the removal and disposal of Grzeszczyk\u2019s and Delgado\u2019s clothes after the murder; and (4) Grzeszczyk and Skinner, the investigator with the office of the state\u2019s attorney, regarding the dates and substance of Skinner\u2019s interviews with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Grzeszczyk, which ultimately led to his arrest and the arrest of his coconspirators, including the defendant. After the court reviewed the jury\u2019s request with the jury foreperson in the presence of all of the jurors, the court excused the jury for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The following morning, the trial court convened the jury and explained that its request entailed a substantial amount of testimony and that it would take the court monitor a considerable amount of time to locate all of it in the record. The court reread its initial charge regarding requests to rehear testimony and asked the jury to consider whether its request could be pared down. In particular, the court stated: \u201c[I]f you can be more precise on these things that you\u2019ve requested, I think that we would appreciate that. But ... if you cannot, if this is what you want, this much testimony, then we\u2019d be glad to do that. But it is taking some time to get it together, and the [court] monitors have spent four or five hours now, getting [the requested testimony] together .... As you know, they have to go through every day and each individual [witness], and so it does take some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u201cSo, with that, I guess I\u2019m telling you that we\u2019re not ready to answer your questions quite yet. So I will ask that you take a look at this, the request. And if there\u2019s nothing you can do with [it], and this is what you want, we\u2019ll . . . give you whatever you want. We want to do that. But I will excuse you to the jury room. And you may deliberate. You may do whatever you wish at this point. You may take a look at these questions and give me some indication ... if you want something different ... or whatever. We\u2019re working on it. We will call you out as soon as we have anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">The jury caucused briefly and then sent a second note to the court that narrowed the scope of its first request. Specifically, the jury indicated that it wanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>to rehear testimony from Grzeszczyk during \u201cdirect and redirect\u201d examination and all of Zampi\u2019s testimony regarding \u201cwho lived on the first floor of 86 Austin Street on [December, 19] 1989.\u201d The second note further stated: \u201c[The jurors] are reviewing the initial request to narrow [its] scope. We will send additional correspondence. We would prefer to start with this request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Shortly thereafter, the jury foreperson informed the court that, in the second note, the jury meant to ask to rehear Grzeszczyk\u2019s testimony on direct and cross-examination, but that it still wanted to rehear all of Zampi\u2019s testimony. After a brief recess, the court had the court monitor play back the requested testimony for the jury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Before the court excused the jury to continue its deliberations, it stated, \u201cwe\u2019re working on other things, and we\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Later that morning, the court monitor advised the court that she had retrieved all of the testimony that the jury had sought in its initial note with respect to topics two and three, namely, testimony relating to the \u201cpoint out\u201d meeting that had occurred at Banquer\u2019s restaurant and to the removal and disposal of Grzeszczyk\u2019s and Delgado\u2019s clothes after the murder. The court consulted with the state\u2019s attorney and defense counsel to determine whether it should ask the jury if it still wanted to rehear that testimony or whether the jury had \u201cmade any other decisions at this point.\u201d The state\u2019s attorney objected to such an inquiry because, in his view, the jury\u2019s second note superseded its first. He contended that the jury had indicated through its second note that it would get back to the court if it wanted to rehear additional testimony. Because the jury had not yet requested additional testimony, the state\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>urged the court not to offer the jury \u201cany more information\u201d at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Conversely, defense counsel argued that the jury did not intend to abandon its initial request, and, therefore, that the court should inform the jury that some of the testimony that it had requested in its initial note was available, and should ask the jury if it still wanted to rehear it. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the court stated that it did not intend to ask the jury whether it still wanted to rehear the testimony relating to topics two and three but that it would inform the jury that the court would honor any additional requests that the jury might have. Thereafter, the court reconvened the jury and reminded it that its second note indicated that it was reviewing its initial request to rehear testimony in order to narrow the scope of its initial request and that it would send additional correspondence. The court then stated: \u201cI\u2019m not encouraging that. I\u2019m not discouraging that. . . . It\u2019s your decision what you want [and] when you want it. . . . I\u2019m just let[ting] you know that we are here ... to answer any request.\u201d The jury then was excused for lunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Later in the afternoon, the jury sent a third note to the court in which it requested testimony that was not encompassed within the scope of either its first or second note. Specifically, in the third note, the jury asked to review the testimony of Grzeszczyk on \u201cdirect, cross, redirect and recross\u201d examination concerning the meeting that occurred at 86 Austin Street on December 19, 1989. The court promptly had the court monitor replay that testimony for the jury. Approximately two hours later, the jury announced that it had reached its verdict, and it found the defendant guilty of murder as an accessory. The trial court thereafter rendered judgment in accordance with that verdict and sentenced the defendant to sixty years imprisonment. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to replay for the jury all of the testimony that the jury had requested in its initial note. In support of his claim, the defendant argues that the jury\u2019s request to rehear testimony on the four topics embodied in its initial note was reasonable,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, therefore, that the trial court should have directed the court monitor to replay that testimony for the jury. The defendant further contends that the trial court\u2019s error was harmful because the testimony that the juiy initially had requested but was never afforded an opportunity to rehear was material and exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The state responds that the defendant\u2019s argument is flawed because the jury abandoned its initial request to rehear testimony when it sent its second note to the court. Put another way, the state contends that the jury indicated in its second note that it would inform the court if it sought to review additional testimony, including testimony pertaining to the four topics encompassed in its initial note, and that, because the jury did not ask to review additional testimony on those topics after it had submitted the second note, the trial court did not abuse its discretion under the circumstances of this case. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">As a preliminary matter we note that \u201c[t]he trial court has discretion to grant a jury\u2019s request to review testimony. Practice Book \u00a7 [42-26];<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>223 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Conn. 41, 48, 612 A.2d 749 (1992). What portions of the record, if any, will be submitted to the jury for [its] consideration is a matter of sound judicial discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>227 Conn. 751, 770-71, 631 A.2d 309 (1993). In determining whether the trial court has abused its discretion, \u201cthe unquestioned rule is that great weight is due to the action of the trial court and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>PSE Consulting, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frank Mercede &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>267 Conn. 279, 328-29,838 A.2d 135 (2004). \u201c[T]he exercise of [the trial court\u2019s] discretion will not constitute reversible error unless it has clearly been abused or harmful prejudice appears to have resulted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 156, 864 A.2d 666 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">In order to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in this case, we proceed to review the court\u2019s responses to each of the four topics covered in the jury\u2019s initial request.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Topic One: Who Lived at 86 Austin Street?</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">In the jury\u2019s initial note, it asked to review the testimony of Grzeszczyk, Zampi, Delgado, Cruz and Torres on the subject of who lived at 86 Austin Street on December 19, 1989. The jury thereafter narrowed that request in its second note, indicating that, in lieu of rehearing the testimony of all five witnesses, it wanted to rehear only the \u201cdirect and redirect\u201d examination testimony of Grzeszczyk and all of Zampi\u2019s testimony. The trial court convened the jury to confirm its understanding of the revised request insofar as it pertained to Grzeszczyk\u2019s testimony. At that time, the jury foreperson informed the court that the jury meant to ask for the testimony elicited from Grzeszczyk on direct and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>cross-examination, as opposed to direct and redirect examination, as stated in its second note.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">After the jury was excused, the state\u2019s attorney told the court that he thought that the jury wanted to rehear all of Grzeszczyk\u2019s and Zampi\u2019s testimony on the subject of who lived at 86 Austin Street. In order to resolve any lingering confusion regarding the jury\u2019s revised request, the court reconvened the juiy and explained to it the difference between direct examination, cross-examination and redirect examination. The court then asked the jury foreperson repeatedly whether the jury only wanted to rehear Grzeszczyk\u2019s testimony on direct and cross-examination. The jury foreperson answered \u201cyes\u201d or \u201ccorrect\u201d each time. After a short recess, the court had the court monitor replay Grzeszczyk\u2019s direct examination testimony and informed the jury that Grzeszczyk did not testify on cross-examination about who resided at Austin Street. The court monitor then replayed all of Zampi\u2019s testimony on that topic.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Even though defense counsel represented to the trial court that he was satisfied with its efforts to clarify the jury\u2019s revised request, the defendant now argues on appeal that the trial court was bound to replay all of Grzeszczyk\u2019s testimony, including that elicited on recross-examination, because the jury asked to review all of Grzeszczyk\u2019s testimony in its initial note. In other words, the defendant claims that the court should have compelled the jury to rehear testimony that it subsequently decided not to review. The law is clear, however, that a trial court does not abuse its discretion \u201cwhen it allowfs] the jury to rehear only that testimony that the jury indicated that it wished to rehear.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 48; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 771 (\u201c[u]nlessthe court was convinced that an injustice would result, it was not . . . required to force the jury to listen to what it did not want to hear\u201d). Thus, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>trial court abused its discretion in failing to replay all of Grzeszczyk\u2019s testimony concerning the issue of who resided in the Austin Street apartment on December 19, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Topics Two and Three: The \u201cPoint Out\u201d Meeting and the Clothes</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">In its initial note, the jury also asked to rehear testimony concerning the attendees at the \u201cpoint out\u201d meeting at Banquer\u2019s restaurant and testimony concerning the removal and disposal of Grzeszczyk\u2019s and Delgado\u2019s clothes after the murder. After the court monitor retrieved that testimony from the record, a colloquy ensued between the court, the state\u2019s attorney and defense counsel that focused principally on how the court should proceed with the newly retrieved testimony in light of the jury\u2019s second note. As we noted previously, the state\u2019s attorney argued that the second note superseded the initial note and, therefore, that the court should not inform the jury that the testimony pertaining to the second and third topics was available until the jury notified the court that it wanted to review it. In contrast, defense counsel maintained that the jury did not intend to abandon its initial request by virtue of its second note and, consequently, that the court must ask the jury if it still wanted to rehear that testimony. Although the court acknowledged the arguments advanced by both parties with respect to the meaning of the jury\u2019s second note, it stated: \u201cI\u2019m not [going to] read their minds . . . and this is what it meant. It says, \u2018We will send additional correspondence.\u2019 \u201d This statement and other excerpts from the transcript of the proceedings suggest that the trial court adopted the interpretation urged by the state, namely, that the second note superseded the jury\u2019s initial note and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the jury would notify the court if it wanted to review additional testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">At the same time, however, the court expressed concern that the jury might not know how to proceed in the absence of further direction from the court. Thus, the court reconvened the jury and: (1) reminded the jury that it had promised to send correspondence once it had made further decisions regarding its initial request; and (2) informed the jury that the court was ready and willing to honor that request or any other requests that it may have. The court did not ask the jury, however, whether it still wanted to rehear the newly retrieved testimony pertaining to topics two and three, which the jury had requested in its initial note. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to make that inquiry. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">In reviewing claims under the abuse of discretion standard, we have stated that \u201cthe ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>PSE Consulting, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frank Mercede &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>supra, 267 Conn. 329. Thus, to resolve the defendant\u2019s claim with respect to the jury\u2019s initial request to rehear testimony concerning topics two and three, we must determine whether the trial court reasonably could have interpreted the jury\u2019s second note to mean that the juiy did not wish to rehear additional testimony beyond that specified in the second note unless and until it so notified the court. The second note provided in relevant part: \u201cWe are reviewing the initial request to narrow the scope. We will send additional correspondence. We would prefer to start with this request.\u201d We believe that those sentences, when viewed in the context of the court\u2019s suggestion to the jury that it reconsider its initial request, reasonably could be interpreted to mean that: (1) the jury first would rehear the testimony of Grzeszczyk and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Zampi concerning who lived at 86 Austin Street on December 19, 1989; and (2) following that review, the jury would send correspondence to the court if the jury decided that it wanted to rehear some or all of the testimony pertaining to the other three topics that the jury had requested in its initial note.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">We recognize, moreover, that the court\u2019s interpretation of the jury\u2019s second note is consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>events that transpired after the court had received that note. Specifically, in the jury\u2019s third and final note to the court, it did not request testimony pertaining to the topics that it had requested in its initial note. Instead, the jury requested testimony relating to a wholly separate topic, namely, the meeting that occurred at the Austin Street apartment on December 19, 1989. Furthermore, the fact that the jury reached its verdict without reviewing all of the testimony that it had requested in its initial note suggests that the jury subsequently determined that it did not need to rehear that testimony in order to decide the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt, and, consequently, it did not send additional correspondence to the court renewing its request to do so.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In so concluding, we do not suggest that the defendant\u2019s inteipretation of the jury\u2019s second note is entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>implausible. We merely observe that the abuse of discretion standard requires us to indulge in \u201cevery reasonable presumption\u201d in favor of the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the note and the correctness of its ruling. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Moreover, when we review claims for an abuse of discretion, \u201cthe question is not whether any one of us, had we been sitting as the trial judge, would have exercised our discretion differently.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Day, 233 Conn. 813, 842, 661 A.2d 539 (1995). Rather, our inquiry is limited to whether the trial court\u2019s ruling was arbitrary or unreasonable. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>261 Conn. 708, 711, 805 A.2d 705 (2002). In this case, it was neither. Consequently, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to inquire of the jury whether it wanted to review the testimony pertaining to topics two and three that it had requested in its initial note when that testimony became available for playback.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Topic Four: Investigator Skinner\u2019s Interviews with Grzeszczyk</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to replay testimony regarding Skinner\u2019s interviews with Grzeszczyk at the Southington police department, which was the fourth topic in the jury\u2019s initial request for testimony. In our view, this claim is entirely without merit because there is no indication in the record that the court monitor notified the court that she had retrieved this testimony before the jury reached its verdict. Moreover, even if we assume, arguendo, that the trial court did receive such notification off-the-record, we nonetheless conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in failing to replay this testimony for the same reason that underlies our conclusion in part II of this opinion: the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>court reasonably could have interpreted the jury\u2019s second note to mean that the jury did not want to rehear any additional testimony, including that pertaining to topic four, until it so notified the court through correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to replay for the jury all of the testimony that the jury had requested in its first note.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">In this opinion SULLIVAN, C. J., and KATZ and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b24-11\"> The defendant appealed directly from the trial court\u2019s judgment to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b25-8\"> The defendant states in his brief that the testimony that the trial court improperly failed to replay for the jury was \u201cmaterial and exculpatory\u201d and that, consequently, the trial court\u2019s actions were harmful. The defendant further states that the trial court abused its discretion and, therefore, the defendant was denied his right to a fair trial in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. To the extent that the defendant makes these statements to suggest that the harm was occasioned by the trial court\u2019s alleged abuse of its discretion, we need not reach this argument because we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion. To the extent that the defendant is advancing a separate constitutional claim that is premised on his right to a fair trial, we note that he offers no analysis or legal support for this claim. \u201cWe are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . . We consistently have held that [ajnalysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly. . . . [When] the parties cite no law and provide no analysis of their claims, we do not review such claims.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>270 Conn. 815, 823 n.8, 856 A.2d 358 (2004). Accordingly, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b25-10\"> The Bethel Church is now known as the Apple Valley Worship Center.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b29-7\"> Cruz is the defendant\u2019s former girlfriend and the mother of his two children.

The reasonableness of the jury\u2019s initial request, however, is not the issue in this case. Rather, as we explain further in this opinion, the issue is whether the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the jury, through its submission of the second note, did not wish to review any additional testimony until it so notified the court through correspondence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b33-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 42-26 provides: \u201cIf the jury after retiring for deliberations requests] a review of certain testimony, [it] shall be conducted to the courtroom. Whenever the jury\u2019s request is reasonable, the judicial authority, after notice to and consultation with the prosecuting authority and counsel for the defense, shall have the requested parts of the testimony read to the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\"> The dissent disagrees with our conclusion that the trial court reasonably could have interpreted the jury\u2019s second note in this way because, in that note, the jury wrote: \u201cWe would prefer to <em>start </em>with this request.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In light of that sentence, the dissent contends that the only reasonable interpretation of the second note is that the jury would start by reviewing the testimony specified in that note, \u201cbut that it still wished to rehear the rest of the testimony that it had requested [in its first note].\u201d The dissent fails to explain, however, how its position can be squared with the additional passage contained in the jury\u2019s second note that provides: \u201cWe will send additional correspondence.\u201d In other words, if, as the dissent maintains, the only reasonable interpretation of the jury\u2019s second note is that the jury did not intend to abandon the requests embodied in its first note, then why would the jury have a need to send additional correspondence to the court? Although we could engage in extensive debate with the dissent over the meaning of the second note, we need not do so in order to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in this case. Rather, we merely must determine whether the court reasonably could have interpreted that note as it did. See <em>PSE Consulting, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frank Mercede &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>supra, 267 Conn. 329. For the reasons that we set forth in this opinion, we conclude that a full reading of the jury\u2019s second note, when considered in the context of the jury\u2019s communications with the court, warrants the conclusion that the court\u2019s interpretation of that note was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The dissent also asserts that, even if it were to conclude that the court\u2019s interpretation of the jury\u2019s second note was reasonable, it nonetheless would hold that the trial court abused its discretion because there was no justification for the court to interpret the second note at all. According to the dissent, the court simply could have asked the jury if it still wanted to rehear the newly retrieved testimony that it had requested in its initial note, and its failure to do so \u201cwas itself an abuse of discretion.\u201d We disagree with the dissent that the trial court was precluded from: (1) interpreting communications from the jury pertaining to requests to rehear testimony; and (2) making decisions on the basis of its reasonable interpretation of those communications. Indeed, we believe that the dissent\u2019s view runs counter to the well settled principle that we afford trial courts discretion to determine \u201c[w]hat portions of the record, if any, will be submitted to the jury for [its] consideration . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 770-71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\"> Although our standard of review requires us to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions were reasonable; <em>see PSE Consulting, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frank Mercede &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>supra, 267 Conn. 329; the dissent also examines the jury\u2019s expectations in light of its communicalions with the court. To that end, the dissent concludes that the jury must have thought that the court was still assembling the testimony that it had requested in its first note and that the court would inform the jury when that testimony became available. The dissent does not explain how its position can be reconciled with the events that transpired after the jury sent its second note to the court and reheard the testimony requested therein. In our view, these events are incompatible with the dissent\u2019s conclusion that the jury must have thought that it would rehear all of the testimony requested in its initial note. Moreover, the fact that the jury reached a verdict without rehearing that testimony undermines the dissent\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\u2019s actions were harmful to the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinds, </em>86 Conn. App. 557, 570-72, 861 A.2d 1219 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 915, 871 A.2d 372 (2005). In <em>Hinds, </em>the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion in failing to inform the jury that the court monitor had retrieved additional testimony on a topic on which the jury had submitted a question to the court. Id., 570-71. The Appellate Court also concluded, however, that the error was harmless. Id., 571-72. In so concluding, the Appellate Court noted that, \u201c[i]f the jury had believed that it needed a definitive answer to its question in order to reach a verdict, it surely could have awaited the court\u2019s review of [the witness\u2019] testimony, and its failure to do so indicates that this information was not a critical factor in its verdict.\u201d Id., 571.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b41-9\">BORDEN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Adx\">dissenting. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and, thereby, deprive the defendant, Scott Cancel, of the right to a fair trial. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">It is important to note that (1) the trial took only eight days of testimony, and (2) all of the exchanges concerning requests to review testimony between the jury and the court occurred over a very short period of time, namely, from approximately 5 p.m. on one day, to 3 p.m. on the next day. An understanding of precisely what the trial court told the jury in its general instructions, what the jury asked for in its various notes to the trial court, and what the court said, and, even more important, did not say to the jury in response to those notes is also critical. In its general instructions, the court told the jury that it had the \u201cright\u201d to request that testimony be reread to it, that it should be precise in making such requests, and that its requests would be honored.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">In its first note, the jury asked for four sets of testimony to be reread to it: (1) the testimony of the defendant\u2019s three accomplices, all of whom were key state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>witnesses, namely, John Grzeszczyk, Salvatore Zampi and Gilberto Delgado, as well as Norma I. Cruz and Noel Torres, about who was living at the residence where the defendant met with the accomplices to plan the murder when that meeting took place; (2) the testimony of the same three accomplices about the meeting at the restaurant where the victim, Robert Schmidt, was pointed out to Grzeszczyk; (3) the testimony of the same three accomplices about the disposal of the clothing of Grzeszczyk and Delgado after the murder; and (4) the testimony of Grzeszczyk and Lawrence E. Skinner, an investigator with the office of the state\u2019s attorney, about the interviews in which Grzeszczyk confessed and implicated the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The next morning, the court notified the jury that this request entailed a lot of testimony, and that it would take the court monitor considerable time to locate all of it. The court asked the jury if it could be more precise in its request, but stated \u201cif you cannot, if this is what you want, this much testimony, then [we would] be glad to do that. <em>... So, with that, I guess I\u2019m telling you that we\u2019re not ready to answer your questions quite yet,\u201d </em>but that <em>\u201c[wje\u2019re working on it. We will call you out as soon as we have anything.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The court also told the jury that it could continue to deliberate if it wished. The clear import of this response, especially in light of the court\u2019s initial general instructions, was that complying with the jury\u2019s request would take time because the court monitor would have to retrieve a lot of material, but that the court was \u201cworking on\u201d complying with it and would let the jury know when it was ready to comply with the request\u2014 \u201cWe will call you out as soon as we have anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The second note, which followed shortly after the court\u2019s response to the first note, was a more narrow version of the first request made in the first note, namely, for the testimony of only two of the accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>plices\u2014Grzeszczyk and Zampi\u2014about who lived at the residence where the murder was planned; the jury did not ask for the testimony of Delgado, Cruz or Torres regarding this subject. The second note also contained the following explanation for this request: \u201cWe are reviewing the initial request to narrow the scope. We will send additional correspondence. <em>We would prefer lo start with this request.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The obvious purpose of this second note was the jury\u2019s attempt to respond, by narrowing its request from five witnesses to two, to the court\u2019s request, in response to the first note, that the jury attempt to be more precise in its request. It is also clear, however, that the second note was not meant as a replacement request because the jury stated that it preferred \u201cto <em>start </em>with this request.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The clear implication of this statement was that the jury would start with this material, but that it still wished to rehear the rest of the testimony that it had requested. Indeed, given that there were several items in the first request that the jury was never supplied with, as I explain in more detail later in this opinion, it is impossible for me to see how this second request reasonably could be interpreted by the trial court as superseding the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">After complying with the request in the second note, the court stated: \u201c[W]e\u2019re working on other things, and we\u2019ll let you know. \u201d I fail to see how the jury could have interpreted the court\u2019s statement as indicating anything other than that the court was \u201cworking on <em>[the] </em>other things, and we\u2019ll let you know\u201d when they have been located, and that those \u201cother things\u201d were the \u201cthings\u201d that the jury had requested in its first note. Indeed, that this interpretation is the only way that the jury could have understood this response is compelled by the fact that it was the only way that the court could have meant it, because, in fact, neither the court nor the parties were working on any \u201cother things.\u201d Thus, taken in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>context with the court\u2019s response to the first note, the only reasonable interpretation of this entire exchange between the jury and the court is that the court was telling the jury that it was still attempting to comply with all of the requests made by the jury in the first note and would \u201clet [the jury] know\u201d when it would be able to comply with those requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Thus, after the second note and the court\u2019s response, the jury must have believed that, although its narrowed request for the testimony about the evidence of who was living where the murder was planned had been complied with, the court was still attempting to locate the remaining testimony requested in the first note. That testimony, not yet produced for the jury, consisted of the testimony of Delgado, Cruz and Torres about who was living where the murder was planned, plus the other three items requested in the first note\u2014 namely, the meeting at the restaurant, the disposal of the clothes after the murder, and the interviews with the police in which one of the accomplices confessed and implicated the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Later that morning, a critical thing happened: the court monitor told the trial court that it had retrieved <em>all </em>of the testimony sought by the jury in its second and third requests of the first note. These requests were for the testimony of the three accomplices about the meeting at the restaurant where the victim was pointed out to Grzeszczyk, and the testimony of the same three accomplices about the disposal of the clothes after the murder. Despite the defendant\u2019s specific request to the court that it tell the jury that it now had available this evidence, which the jury had specifically requested, the court acceded to the state\u2019s position that the second note had superseded the first note. None of this discussion, of course, was in the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The court then convened the jury and made the following statement: \u201c[Y]our last correspondence indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>cated that you were reviewing the initial request to narrow the scope.\u201d The court then quoted to the jury from its second note: \u201c \u2018We will send additional correspondence.\u2019 \u201d The court then stated: \u201cI\u2019m not encouraging that; I\u2019m not discouraging that. I\u2019m not getting into this at all with you people. It\u2019s your decision. It\u2019s your decision what you want, when you want it. We\u2019re here to do that, <em>if we can. </em>I\u2019m just suggesting that\u2014and to let you know that we are here and\u2014to answer any request. And that was something that seemed to be hanging, and I\u2019m just reminding you of that. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to, probably. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re diligently going about your task of deliberation. So that\u2019s all I have.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">This statement to the jury was ambiguous at best. It is true that the court reminded the jury of its first note, and that the requests made therein had not been complied with\u2014\u201cthat was something that seemed to be hanging . . . .\u201d At the same time, however, the court also reminded the jury that it had narrowed the scope of the first request, and that it had indicated that it would \u201csend additional correspondence.\u201d The court then told the jury that it was there to respond to \u201cwhat you want, when you want it,\u201d but it then qualified that response with \u201c[w]e\u2019re here to do that, <em>if we can.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The jury could have heard this only as at least an implicit repetition of the court\u2019s initial response to its first note, namely, that it would take a long time for the court monitor to locate the requested testimony, and that retrieval of that testimony had not yet been accomplished. As I indicate later in this opinion, I can see no justification for the court\u2019s refusal to tell the jury that the information that it sought in two of the four requests in its first note had now been located and was available to be read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The third note, sent to the court at 2:45 p.m. on the same day, requested testimony that had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>included in either of the first two notes, namely, testimony of Grzeszczyk regarding the meeting on Austin Street. The court complied with that request. Yet, the court still did not tell the jury that much of the testimony that it originally had sought in its first note was now available to it. Less than two hours later, the jury rendered its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">I conclude that the court abused its discretion in its treatment of the jury\u2019s requests for the rehearing of the testimony that they had requested in their first note. First, it is beyond dispute that very little of the testimony that the jury sought in that first note was ever presented to it; nor was the jury ever told that at least some of the testimony that was not presented was available to it before it rendered its verdict. Given the short length of the trial, and even taking into account the jury\u2019s understandable responses to the court\u2019s suggestion to it that it attempt to narrow its requests <em>while the court attempted to comply with the jury\u2019s first request, </em>I simply fail to see why the court did not make any additional efforts to comply with those requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Second, the court\u2019s response to that first note sent the clear message to the jury that the court was attempting to comply with those four requests, and that <em>the court would tell the jury when that compliance would be forthcoming. </em>The jury\u2019s response, in the second note, to that message was that it was willing to narrow its request, but that narrowing was something that it was willing \u201cto <em>start with . . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, the clear implication of this exchange was that the court would tell the jury when it was prepared to comply with the jury\u2019s first four requests, and the jury was willing to start with less than it originally had requested until the court informed it that the court was ready to comply. Thus, I see no basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion that it was reasonable for the court to conclude that the jury\u2019s second note super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>seded its requests in the first note. If that were so, then the jury\u2019s response to the court\u2019s initial statements to it, namely, that the jury would narrow its requests \u201cto start with,\u201d meant nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Third, even if I were to agree that it was unclear whether the jury\u2019s second request was intended to supersede its first request, and that it was reasonable for the court to <em>interpret </em>it as such, I see no justification on this record for the court to have gone through that interpretive exercise at all. At that point, the court knew that the court monitor had located two of the four batches of testimony that the jury had requested in its first note, and the defendant had requested that the court simply ask the jury whether it still wanted that testimony read to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">It is beyond me why, instead of granting that eminently reasonable request, which could not have taken more than a moment, the court shielded that important information from the jury and, instead, issued the ambiguous instructions to the jury that it did. Had the court told the jury that the testimony it had asked for was now available, as the defendant asked the court to do, the jury, the state, the defendant, and this court, would <em>know, </em>rather than have to guess, whether the second jury note superseded the first note. Furthermore, and most important, the jury would have had the information that it never had in formulating its second and third requests, namely, that at least some of what it had requested in its first note was now available to it and intelligently could have decided whether it still wanted that testimony. The failure of the court to give the jury this important information was itself an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Having decided that the trial court abused its discretion as it did, I also conclude that the error was harmful. This was a case against the defendant that depended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>primarily on the testimony of his three accomplices. Indeed, the defendant was not even the actual killer; that task was reserved for Delgado, the rereading of whose testimony the jury sought but did not receive. The requests for rereading of testimony that were never honored by the trial court involved critical testimony of those accomplices, whose credibility as such was necessarily subject to question. I cannot see how it could be otherwise that the <em>absence </em>of an opportunity to rehear that testimony, and the jury\u2019s ignorance of the fact that some of the testimony was available for it to rehear substantially affected the verdict that the jury ultimately reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">I would, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
