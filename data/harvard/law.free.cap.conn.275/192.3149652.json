In particular, the defendant contends that, in view of the fact that the charge of burglary in the first degree was predicated on the theory that the defendant was vicariously liable for the acts of his alleged coconspirator, the state was collaterally estopped from prosecuting the defendant for that offense because his alleged coconspirator previously had been acquitted, at a separate trial, of that same offense. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim and, therefore, affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At approximately 11:30 a.m. on January 28, 2000, the defendant and Bryant Browne traveled in Browne\u2019s car to a residence located at 320 Kelsey Street in Middle-town for the purpose of burglarizing it. Browne parked his car in the driveway, and the two men broke into the home and searched it for valuables. They collected certain items, including a television set and jewelry, and placed them in the foyer and living room in preparation of loading them into Browne\u2019s car. At approximately 11:45 a.m., while Browne and the defendant still were inside the residence, Rosemary Fraulino, who lived there with her family, returned home and observed an unfamiliar car in her driveway. Alarmed by the presence of the vehicle in her driveway, Fraulino drove by her home and called the police from her cellular telephone to report the suspicious vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Officer John Labbadia of the Middletown police department responded to the call and, at about 12 p.m., arrived at the Fraulino residence. Labbadia parked his cruiser in the driveway and, after conducting a cursory examination of the front of the house, proceeded to the backyard. The defendant and Browne, who had seen the cruiser arrive, ran out the front door to Browne\u2019s car and sped off, leaving behind much of what they had intended to remove from the house. Labbadia saw the two men and pursued them in his cruiser. He also radioed the police dispatcher, and other officers, including Connecticut state police troopers, subsequently joined the pursuit. Eventually, Browne, who was driving, entered Route 9 heading southbound and proceeded at a high rate of speed. Despite police efforts to stop Browne\u2019s vehicle,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Browne eluded capture<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, eventually, entered Interstate 95 heading southbound. Using \u201cstop sticks\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> between exits 59 and 58 of Interstate 95, the police finally caused two of Browne\u2019s tires to deflate. Browne ultimately brought his car to a stop near exit 54 in Branford, a distance of approximately forty-six miles from the Fraulino residence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>two men were apprehended, the defendant was seated in the front passenger seat of Browne\u2019s vehicle. Several items that had been removed from the Fraulino residence were found inside and outside of Browne\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">After being placed under arrest, the defendant initially told police that he had remained in Browne\u2019s vehicle when Browne entered the residence. He then stated that he had been injecting heroin and was not sure whether he had gone into the house. According to the defendant, Browne told him that he needed to go to that home because a man who lived there owed Browne money.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The defendant and Browne both were charged with numerous offenses, including burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> rpjie two men were tried separately, with Browne\u2019s trial proceeding first. Although Browne was convicted of multiple offenses, he was acquitted of burglary in the first degree.8 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. Browne, 84 Conn. App. 351, 354, 355 n.2, 854 A.2d 13, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 931, 859 A.2d 930 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Thereafter, the defendant\u2019s trial commenced. At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, the defendant filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>charge of burglary in the first degree.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In support of his motion, the defendant claimed that the state\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove the second prong of \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2), namely, that he intentionally, knowingly or recklessly had inflicted or attempted to inflict bodily injury on one or more of the pursuing police officers as alleged in the information. Specifically, the defendant maintained that, although the state\u2019s evidence may have implicated Browne, the driver of the getaway car, in such conduct, there was no evidence to indicate that the defendant, as a passenger in the getaway car, had injured or attempted to injure any of the pursuing officers. The defendant also claimed that the state was foreclosed by principles of collateral estoppel from proceeding against him on that charge under the doctrine of <em>Pinkerton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 646-48, 66 S. Ct. 1180, 90 L. Ed. 1489 (1946), which permits the state to hold a conspirator vicariously liable for the criminal offenses committed by a coconspirator if those offenses \u201care within the scope of the conspiracy, are in furtherance of it, and are reasonably foreseeable as a necessary or natural consequence of the conspiracy.\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Garner, </em>270 Conn. 458, 484, 853 A.2d 478 (2004). In particular, the defendant maintained that the state was collaterally estopped from establishing the second prong of \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2) under a theory of vicarious liability because the evidence adduced by the state to prove that element of the offense derived entirely from the conduct of Browne, who previously had been acquitted of that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal of burglary in the first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>with respect to two of the three theories of liability that the state had advanced in support of that charge, namely, principal liability<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and accessorial liability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court, however, rejected the defendant\u2019s collateral estoppel argument and, therefore, denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of burglary in the first degree insofar as the state\u2019s case against the defendant on that charge was predicated on a theory of vicarious liability under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine. Accordingly, the trial court instructed the jury under that doctrine. The court also instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of burglary in the third degree. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103 (a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found the defendant not guilty of burglary in the first degree but found the defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of burglary in the third degree.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant thereafter filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal on the offense of burglary in the third degree. In support of his motion, the defendant once again claimed that the state was collaterally estopped from proceeding against him on the charge of burglary in the first degree under <em>the Pinkerton </em>doctrine and that, consequently, the jury should not have been permitted to consider the lesser included offense of burglary in the third degree. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. On appeal, the defendant renews the claim of collateral estoppel that he raised in the trial court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\u201cThe common-law doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, embodies a judicial policy in favor of judicial economy, the stability of former judgments and finality. . . . Collateral estoppel means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit. . . . Issue preclusion arises when an issue is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and that determination is essential to the judgment. . . . Collateral estoppel expresses] no more than the fundamental principle that once a matter has been fully and fairly litigated, and finally decided, it comes to rest.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>262 Conn. 45, 58, 808 A.2d 1107 (2002). Generally, \u201c[application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel is neither statutorily nor constitutionally mandated.\u201d Id. With respect to criminal cases, however, \u201ccollateral estoppel is a protection included in the fifth amendment guarantee against double jeopardy.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Garner, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 482. \u201cThe constitution embodies this doctrine [however] only to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>that it precludes a retrial of a <em>defendant.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In the present case, because the defendant was tried only once on the charge of burglary in the first degree, he does not claim that double jeopardy principles barred the state from prosecuting him for that offense. Rather, he contends that the purposes of the doctrine of collateral estoppel would be served by prohibiting the state from trying him on that charge because the state sought to hold him vicariously liable for the acts of an alleged coconspirator who previously had been acquitted of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">We have recognized, however, that \u201cthe application of the collateral estoppel doctrine has dramatic consequences for the party against whom the doctrine is applied. [Consequently] [c]ourts should be careful that the effect of the doctrine does not work an injustice. . . . Thus, [t]he [doctrine] . . . should be flexible and must give way when [its] mechanical application would frustrate other social policies based on values equally or more important than the convenience afforded by finality in legal controversies.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 59-60. We are persuaded that overriding policy considerations militate against applying the doctrine to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">As we have stated in the closely related context of conspiratorial liability under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201c[w]hen coconspirators are tried separately, the acquittal of one on charges of conspiracy should not dictate the acquittal of the other simply because the state in one case has failed to prove an element necessary to a conspiracy charge. . . . The acquittal of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>codefendant in a separate trial could . . . [result] from a multiplicity of factors completely unrelated to the actual existence of a conspiracy ... for example, certain evidentiary issues that might render evidence inadmissible in one trial but not in another. ... In separate trials, [t]he evidence presented to the juries and the manner in which that evidence is presented may be significantly different and certainly never will be identical. ... As a result, [different juries may rationally come to different conclusions, especially when differing evidence is presented. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u201cAn . . . unsuccessful prosecution of an alleged coconspirator in a separate trial means nothing more than that on a given date the prosecution failed to meet its burden of proving the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all of the elements constituting conspiracy. It certainly does not mean . . . that a conspiracy did not occur. It has long been recognized that criminal juries in the United States are free to render not guilty verdicts resulting from compromise, confusion, mistake, leniency or other legally and logically irrelevant factors. . . . Consequently, an acquittal is not to be taken as the equivalent of a finding of the fact of innocence; nor does it necessarily even reflect a failure of proof on the part of the prosecution.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>257 Conn. 587, 602-603, 778 A.2d 875 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">This reasoning applies with equal force in the present context. Indeed, for purposes of the applicability of the doctrine of collateral estoppel, we see no material distinction between an accused who, like the defendant in <em>Colon, </em>was charged with conspiracy after his alleged coconspirator was acquitted of conspiracy at a separate trial, and an accused who, like the defendant in the present case, was charged with a substantive offense under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine after his coconspirator was acquitted of that substantive offense at a separate trial. In neither scenario should the prior acquittal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>one alleged coconspirator bar the state from prosecuting a second alleged coconspirator because the acquittal of the first alleged coconspirator may have been wholly unrelated to that coconspirator\u2019s actual guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Our conclusion, moreover, is consistent with the determination of the legislature, as reflected in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-9,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that an accused may be convicted of being an accessory under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8; see footnote 13 of this opinion; even though the principal has been acquitted in a separate trial. This legislative mandate undoubtedly is predicated on the same general policy reasons that led us to conclude in <em>Colon </em>that an accused may be prosecuted for conspiracy notwithstanding his coconspirator\u2019s prior acquittal on that charge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 603. Because those considerations are no less persuasive in the present case, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that Browne\u2019s acquittal on the charge of burglary in the first degree precluded the state from subsequently prosecuting the defendant for that offense under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine. In view of the fact that the state was free to charge the defendant with burglary in the first degree, the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the lesser included offense of burglary in the third degree.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-10\"> The defendant also was found guilty of larceny in the sixth degree, attempt to commit larceny in the sixth degree, conspiracy to commit burglary in the third degree and interfering with an officer.

Several such efforts were unsuccessful, however, because Browne was able to veer away from the strips.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\"> On one such occasion, Labbadia, who had been able to position his cruiser in front of Browne\u2019s vehicle, decelerated in an attempt to thwart Browne\u2019s flight. Browne, however, swerved sharply away from Labbadia, toward the cruiser operated by Middletownpolice Sergeant George Dingwall, who had joined the chase. In his effort to avoid Browne\u2019s vehicle, Dingwall lost control of his cruiser and spun off the highway, striking a heavily wooded portion of the median.

Thus, in order to establish the defendant\u2019s accessorial liability for burglary in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2), the state was required to prove, inter alia, that the defendant had the intent to inflict or to attempt to inflict bodily iqjury on one or <em>more </em>of the police officers involved <em>in </em>the pursuit of Browne\u2019s vehicle. The trial court concluded, however, that the evidence adduced by the state was insufficient to prove that element of the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of burglary in the third degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b222-4\"> Because the trial court properly instructed the jury in accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>227 Conn. 566, 583, 630 A.2d 1064 (1993) (jury must be instructed that, before considering any lesser included offenses, it first must decide guilt or innocence of accused as to greater offense), the jury\u2019s finding of not guilty with respect to the charge of burglary in the first degree is implicit in its finding of guiliy with respect to the offense of burglary in the third degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b222-5\"> Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we note, preliminarily, that the defendant does not contend that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of burglary in the third degree. Rather, his claim is limited to the assertion that the jury should not have been permitted to consider the charge of burglary in the third degree as a lesser included offense of burglary in the first degree because the state was barred, under principles of collateral estoppel, from proceeding against him on that greater charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">We further note that the defendant\u2019s claim is predicated on the fact that the information charged the defendant with one count of burglary in the first degree and did not contain a count charging him with burglary in the third degree. Rather, as we have explained, the trial court instructed the jury on the charge of burglary in the third degree as a lesser included offense of burglary in the first degree. Thus, as the defendant recognizes, if the information had contained a count charging him with burglary in the third degree, he would have no claim that his conviction on that charge was improper. Moreover, even if the defendant could prevail on his claim that the state was collaterally estopped from prosecuting him for the offense of burglary in the first degree, it is by no means clear that the defendant was harmed as a result of his conviction of burglary in the third degree because he was on notice that the state could charge him with that offense and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>he could be convicted of that offense.

For the reasons set forth previously, we do not find these cases to be persuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
