The plaintiff claims that the board improperly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision because: (1) the town has a paid municipal police department of which he is apart; (2) the state\u2019s interest in providing heart and hypertension benefits to municipal law enforcement officers preempts the town\u2019s interest in denying such benefits; and (3) the town concedes that members of its police force are entitled to benefits under \u00a7 7-433c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>We reject the plaintiffs claim and, accordingly, affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The following relevant facts, as found by the commissioner, are set forth in his decision of December 5,2002. In 1989, the town hired the plaintiff as a full-time police officer. Thereafter, the plaintiff claimed that he had injured his knee in the course of his employment on January 21, 1992. On that date, Joseph Zeppieri, an orthopedic surgeon, treated the plaintiff for his injury, but counseled against going forward with surgery because of the plaintiffs elevated blood pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Zeppieri referred the plaintiff to another physician, George Burton, who met with the plaintiff on January 28, 1992, and diagnosed him with hypertension.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs blood pressure readings continued to be elevated between January 28, 1992, and November 20, 1997. Burton prescribed medication to treat the condition. The plaintiff also received treatment for hypertension from two other physicians, but failed to file a timely claim for hypertension benefits with the commissioner or his employer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">In September, 1999, the plaintiff experienced what he initially believed were back spasms. Ultimately, it was determined that the spasms were caused by a myocardial infarction. The plaintiff filed a claim under \u00a7 7-433c for heart and hypertension benefits related to the myocardial infarction, with a claimed injury date of October 8, 1999. The commissioner determined, however, that the plaintiffs hypertension was a factor in the development of his coronary artery disease. He therefore found that, because the plaintiff had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>receiving continuous treatment for his hypertension and heart condition since January 21,1992, the October 8,1999 injury was part of one continuous incident beginning in January, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The commissioner also found that the plaintiff was working as a constable for the town on the date of his alleged injuries in 1992 and 1999, and that the town did not have a municipal police department. As a result, the commissioner dismissed the plaintiffs claim because it was untimely and because the plaintiff was not a regular member of a paid municipal police department organized pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-274* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <em>Zimmer </em>v. <em>Essex, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 419, 421, 449 A.2d 1053 (1982).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff thereafter appealed to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>In reviewing the plaintiffs claim, the board first addressed the threshold issue of whether the plaintiff fell within the class of employees to which \u00a7 7-433c benefits apply, namely, \u201ca regular' member of a paid municipal police department . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c (a). Following its examination of the commissioner\u2019s findings, the board noted that the town had established a constabulary and that it had contracted with the state department of public safety to participate in the resident state trooper program.* **<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The board thus concluded that the plaintiff was a constable. The board further noted that the facts of the present case were analogous to the facts of <em>Zimmer </em>v. <em>Essex, </em>supra, 38 Conn. Sup. 419-20, in which the Superior Court determined that a municipal police force not organized in conformity with the provisions of \u00a7 7-274 is a police force to which \u00a7 7-433c does not apply. See id., 421. The board then observed that, according to testimony presented at formal hearings on the matter, law enforcement operations in the town differed from those of a municipal police force organized under \u00a7 7-274 because the town did not have a lockup, the town\u2019s first selectman served as the chief of police, an East Lyme police officer\u2019s powers of arrest were limited and the plaintiffs duties as a constable differed from those of \u201ca regular member of a paid municipal police force.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The board added that \u00a7 7-433c has been characterized as \u201cbonus\u201d legislation and must be strictly construed. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The board concluded that the plaintiff was</p>\n<p id=\"A6e\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>not a member of the class of persons to which \u00a7 7-433c applies and affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision on that ground alone, finding it unnecessary to reach the issue of whether the plaintiffs claim was time barred.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We begin by setting forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cIt is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and [the] board. ... A state agency is not entitled, however, to special deference when its determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny. . . . Whe[n] ... [a workers\u2019 compensation] appeal involves an issue of statutory construction that has not yet been subjected to judicial scrutiny, this court has plenary power to review the administrative decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bergeson </em>v. <em>New London, </em>269 Conn. 763, 769, 850 A.2d 184 (2004). The present appeal raises an issue of statutory construction that is of first impression for this court. Our review of the board\u2019s administrative decision is therefore plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The plaintiff claims that, although he was employed as a full-time constable by the town at the time of his injury, he is entitled to heart and hypertension benefits under \u00a7 7-433c because he was \u201ca regular member of a paid municipal police department . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c. The town responds that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>does not qualify for \u00a7 7-433c benefits because there is a difference between apaid municipal police department and a constabulary, and the town has chosen to ensure public safety by establishing a constabulary. We agree with the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The plaintiffs claim that his status as a constable does not preclude him from being considered a regular member of a paid municipal police department under \u00a7 7-433c requires us to examine, first, whether the statutory provisions distinguish between a constable and \u201ca regular member of apaid municipal police department,\u201d and, second, whether the town has a \u201cpaid municipal police department\u201d under the statutory scheme. General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c. We consider each of these questions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The gravamen of the plaintiffs complaint is that, despite his status as a constable, he is a regular member of apaid municipal police department. We first consider whether there is a difference between a constable and a regular member of a paid municipal police department within the meaning of the relevant statutory provisions. We conclude that there is.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>269 Conn. 527, 534-35, 849 A.2d 777 (2004). When construing a statute, we first look to its text, as directed by General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z, which provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the present case, we conclude, following an examination of the language of the statute and its relationship to other statutes, that a constable is not \u201ca regular member of a paid municipal police department,\u201d as that term is used in General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c (a) provides in relevant part that heart and hypertension benefits shall be available to \u201ca regular member of a paid municipal police department who successfully passed a physical examination on entry into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of hypertension or heart disease, [and who] suffers either off duty or on duty any condition or impairment of health caused by hypertension or heart disease resulting in his death or his temporary or permanent, total or partial disability . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Section 7-433c contains no functional definition of the term \u201cpaid municipal police department.\u201d Moreover, there is no provision in the statutory scheme that contains such a definition. We therefore turn for guidance, as directed by \u00a7 l-2z, to related statutes that distinguish between police departments and constabularies to determine whether a constable is \u201ca regular member of a paid municipal police department . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">It is clear from a review of the relevant statutory provisions that local law enforcement arrangements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>can take many forms and that a police department is not a constabulary. General Statutes \u00a7 7-294a employs the generic term \u201c \u2018law enforcement unit\u2019 \u201d to describe \u201cany agency, organ or department of this state or a subdivision or municipality thereof, whose primary functions include the enforcement of criminal or traffic laws, the preservation of public order, the protection of life and property, or the prevention, detection or investigation of crime . . . .\u201d The statute then distinguishes between constables and members of a police department by defining the generic term \u201c \u2018police officer\u2019 \u201d as \u201ca sworn member of an organized local police department, an appointed constable who performs criminal law enforcement duties, a special policeman appointed under section 29-18, 29-18a or 29-19 or any member of a law enforcement unit who performs police duties . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 7-294a.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 7-277a further differentiates between municipal police departments and constabularies in the context of police assistance agreements. Subsections (a) and (b) of that statute describe the rules governing cooperation between the \u201cpolice forces\u201d of the requesting and responding municipalities. The statute specifically provides that, after the chief executive officer of a town receives a request for assistance from his counterpart in another town, \u201cthe chief executive officer, or chief of police or board of police commissioners or other duly constituted authority\u201d may make available for duty \u201csuch part of the police forces under his control as he deems consistent with the safety and well-being of his municipality. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>277a (a). Subsection (c) of the statute separately provides: \u201cThe chief executive officer of any town . . . which provides police protection solely by a constabulary force may enter into an agreement with one or more municipalities to furnish or receive police assistance . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-277a (c). The statute thus draws a sharp and explicit distinction between a \u201cpolice force\u201d and a \u201cconstabulary force\u201d by granting primary authority, in towns with a police department, to the chief of police<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or the board of police commissioners to make police officers available for the purpose of assisting another municipality,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> while granting similar authority, in towns with a constabulary, to the chief executive officer of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Numerous other statutes similarly distinguish between police officers who are members of a local police department and constables. General Statutes \u00a7 1-24 (13) (oaths may be administered by \u201cany sworn member of any local police department ... in all affidavits, statements, depositions, complaints or reports made to or by any member of any local police department . . . or any constable who is under the supervision of [the] commissioner [of public safety]\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 5-259 (a) (comptroller \u201cshall arrange and procure a group hospitalization and medical and surgical insurance plan or plans for . . . [6] the surviving spouse, and any dependent children until they reach the age of eighteen, of ... a member of an organized local police department ... or a constable who performs criminal law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>enforcement duties who dies ... as the result of injuries received while acting within the scope of such officer\u2019s ... or constable\u2019s employment and not as the result of illness or natural causes\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 9-230 (\u201c[t]he registrars of voters may request the head of the police department of the municipality, or, if none, a constable serving such municipality, to provide police protection at any polling place of any regular or special state or municipal election where they may anticipate disorder\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 14-152 (\u201ceach municipal police department and each constable of any town\u201d shall report theft or recovery of stolen motor vehicle to commissioner of motor vehicles and National Automobile Theft Bureau); General Statutes \u00a7 15-76 (a) (\u201c[t]he commissioner [of transportation], any employee of the department [of transportation], any officer attached to an organized police department, any state police officer or any constable, within his or her precinct\u201d may take abandoned aircraft into custody for storage in suitable place); General Statutes \u00a7 29-7m (b) (\u201c[t]he police department, resident state trooper or constable who performs law enforcement duties for each town shall monitor, record and classify all crimes committed within such town\u201d motivated by bigotry or bias); General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (9) (\u201c[p]eace officer means a member of the Division of State Police within the Department of Public Safety or an organized local police department . . . [or] a constable who performs criminal law enforcement duties\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b (1) (person is guilty of capital felony if convicted of \u201c[m]urder of a member of the Division of State Police within the Department of Public Safety or of any local police department . . . [or] a constable who performs criminal law enforcement duties\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 54-If (a) (\u201c[p]eace officers, as defined in subdivision [9] of section 53a-3, in their respective precincts, shall arrest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>without previous complaint and warrant, any person for any offense in their jurisdiction\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf (c) (\u201c[m] embers of any local police department or the Office of State Capitol Police and constables . . . when in immediate pursuit of one who may be arrested under the provisions of this section, are authorized to pursue the offender outside of their respective precincts into any part of the state in order to effect the arrest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The only logical conclusion to draw from the legislature\u2019s repeated distinction in numerous statutory contexts between police officers who are constables and those who are members of a local police department is that the two positions are not synonymous. The fact that there is no language in \u00a7 7-433c that specifically refers to constables is, therefore, significant in light of the legislature\u2019s express reference in other statutory provisions to constables <em>and </em>members of a local police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Moreover, if the legislature wants to grant benefits to both constables and members of a local police department in a single statutory provision, it knows how to do so. For instance, \u00a7 5-259 (a) (6) requires the state comptroller to procure health insurance for a surviving spouse and certain dependent children of a member of an organized local police department <em>or </em>a constable who performs criminal law enforcement duties. Had the legislature intended that constables receive benefits under \u00a7 7-433c, it presumably would have expressed its intention directly, as it did in \u00a7 5-259 (a) (6). E.g., <em>Oxford Tire Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>253 Conn. 683, 699, 755 A.2d 850 (2000) (if legislature had intended to confer tax benefit on certain class of taxpayers, it easily could have expressed that intent). Accordingly, we conclude that related statutory provisions clearly distinguish between members of a local police department and constables, and that constables <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>were not intended to come within the class of persons eligible for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We next consider whether the plaintiff is a constable or a regular member of a paid municipal police department under the law enforcement arrangements adopted by the town. The plaintiff claims that he qualifies for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c because the town has a paid municipal police department of which he is a member. We disagree on the ground that statutes pertaining to the organization and function of police departments and constabularies, when applied to the facts of this case as found by the commissioner, firmly establish that the town has a constabulary.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Part I of chapter 104 of the General Statutes, entitled \u201cPolice Departments,\u201d begins by providing that any town may establish by ordinance an elected or appointed board of police commissioners \u201cfor the purpose of organizing and maintaining a police department in such town.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-274. The commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>sioners\u2019 powers shall include the \u201cgeneral management and supervision of the police department . . . and of the property and equipment used in connection therewith . . . [and the] appointment, promotion and removal of the officers and members of such police department . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-276.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201c[t]he expenses, salaries and all costs of maintenance and equipment for such police department shall be paid by such town . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-277. Accordingly, the existence of a board of police commissioners that establishes, oversees and manages the operations of a municipal police force whose expenses are borne by the town is necessary to a finding that a town has a paid municipal police department as contemplated in the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Although a constable may be considered a police officer under \u00a7 7-294a and may perform some of the same duties as a regular member of a paid municipal police department,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the two positions are fundamen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>tally different. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-86 through 7-97. The statutory scheme provides that constables may be elected to a term of office; see General Statutes \u00a7 7-88; and that special constables may be appointed by the chief executive officer of a municipality; see General Statutes \u00a7 7-92; but provides that regular members of a police department are appointed and promoted<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> by the board of police commissioners under regulations adopted for that purpose, hold their positions during good behavior and are removed for cause only upon the filing of written charges and after a hearing. General Statutes \u00a7 7-276. Regular members of a municipal police department and constables thus serve under different conditions of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Finally, towns that do not have a police department, including those that have constabularies, are permitted to utilize resident state troopers in meeting their law enforcement needs. General Statutes \u00a7 29-5<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> provides that towns \u201clacking an organized police force\u201d may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>procure the services of resident state policemen from the regular state police force through agreements or contracts not exceeding two years and shall pay 60 or 70 percent of their compensation and other expenses, depending on the date of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We conclude that the town does not have a paid municipal police department but, instead, has chosen to protect its residents by creating a constabulary and utilizing the services of two resident state troopers to supervise its local law enforcement operations. The legal basis for this arrangement is described in the town charter and ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Constables are employed by the town pursuant to an amended ordinance adopted in 1979 concerning the appointment and qualifications of constables. The amended ordinance vests the town board of selectmen with the sole authority to appoint constables and special constables and to prepare and to enter into agreements for their examination and training. With respect to the terms of employment, the ordinance further provides that the appointment of a constable shall terminate upon the occurrence of certain events. One such event involves <em>\u201cthe town[\u2019s] establish[ment] [of] a police department in accordance with the provisions of chapter 104, part I of the Connecticut General Statutes.'\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Town of East Lyme, Charter Ordinances and Special Laws, Amended Ordinance Concerning Terms of Appointment and Qualifications of Constables \u00b6 2.1.1.4 (amended February 20,1979) (hereinafter Amended Ordinance Concerning Constables). There can be no plainer indication that the town is aware of the distinction between a police department and a constabulary, has chosen to establish a constabulary and knows that the continued employment of constables will not be appropriate if and when it decides to establish a police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>In addition, the town charter authorizes the town selectmen \u201cto enter into contracts or other agreements with the State of Connecticut, or the officials thereof, as may be necessary for the establishment of a resident State Policeman in the Town . . . .\u201d Town of East Lyme, Charter Ordinances and Special Laws, Resolution Regarding Establishment of a Resident State Policeman in the Town of East Lyme (1998). A separate charter provision designates the first selectman as the chief of police, who may \u201cexercise such authority as is necessary for the protection of and for the best interest of the Town . . . .\u201d Town of East Lyme, Charter Ordinances and Special Laws, Resolution Designating the First Selectman as Town Agent to Act as Chief of Police (1998). Under these provisions, resident state troopers serve the town pursuant to a contract between the town and the state, which grants authority to the state police \u201cto supervise and direct the operations of the appointed constables and police in the Town, including their working schedules . . . .\u201d The contract also provides that the commissioner of public safety shall \u201cexercise such supervision and direction over any resident police so appointed, as he deems necessary,\u201d a fact noted by the plaintiff. These contract terms are in direct conflict with the statutory mandate that, in a town with an organized police department, the board of police commissioners shall be responsible for the general management and supervision of the department. General Statutes \u00a7 7-276. Furthermore, only towns \u201clacking an organized police force\u201d may utilize resident state troopers to meet their public safety needs. General Statutes \u00a7 29-5. The fact that the town has contracted for the services of resident state troopers thus indicates that the town does not have a paid municipal police department.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiff is a constable, not \u201ca regular member of a paid municipal police department\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c; and, consequently, is not eligible for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The plaintiff argues, however, that towns have discretion to organize police departments in any way they choose, and that the absence of a board of police commissioners has no bearing on whether the town has a police department because this court previously has construed \u00a7 7-274 as \u201cpermissive . . . .\u201d <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>v. <em>White, </em>171 Conn. 553, 563, 370 A.2d 1070 (1976). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">In <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>this court concluded that \u00a7 7-274 was \u201cclearly permissive,\u201d and that the New Haven board of police commissioners was validly constituted because it derived its powers from city charter provisions enacted in 1861, even though its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>commissioners were appointed by the mayor, rather than elected, \u201cas the later enacted \u00a7 7-274 . . . would require.\u201d Id. The court, however, was referring to the fact that, in municipalities with police departments organized pursuant to charter provisions adopted <em>before </em>the enactment of \u00a7 7-274, such as New Haven, the requirement of a board of police commissioners under \u00a7 7-274 was \u201cpermissive\u201d in the sense that, if the town did not have such a board, it could ignore the statutory provision. <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>therefore has no precedential value in the present context because there is no evidence in the record that the town\u2019s law enforcement operations are based on charter provisions preceding the enactment of \u00a7\u00a7 7-274 and 7-433c.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Nevertheless, even if we assume that the existence of a board of police commissioners is not essential to a finding that a town has established a police department pursuant to chapter 104 of the General Statutes, the town has taken certain steps that only can be construed to mean that it does not have such a department. As we previously noted, these steps include the adoption of a provision in the amended ordinance regarding the termination of constables if <em>\u201cthe town establishes a police department in accordance with the provisions of chapter 104, part I of the Connecticut General Statutes\"-, </em>(emphasis added) Amended Ordinance Concerning Constables, supra, \u00b6 2.1.1.4; and contracting with the state for the services of two resident state troopers, which is permitted by statute only if a town lacks \u201can organized police force . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 29-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Although the plaintiff argues otheiwise, the charter provision designating the first selectman as the chief of police and empowering him to \u201cexercise such authority as is necessary for the protection of . . . the Town\u201d does not overcome the fact that resident state troopers are responsible for the general management and super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>vision of the town\u2019s law enforcement activities and that the troopers are supervised in turn by the commissioner of public safety. The fact that the constables\u2019 duties may be similar to those of a regular member of a police department similarly fails to outweigh the fact that the town\u2019s law enforcement operations lack the bureaucratic and decision-making structure essential to a municipal police department established pursuant to chapter 104 of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The plaintiff claims that the town\u2019s choice of law enforcement arrangements, which do not include a board of police commissioners, cannot override the \u201cstate\u2019s edict\u201d that municipalities with a paid, full-time police force must provide their officers with \u00a7 7-433c benefits. The plaintiff argues that the state\u2019s superseding interest in providing heart and hypertension benefits to local police officers is rooted in the nature of their work, the effect of which transcends the boundaries of a single community. The plaintiff, however, misconstrues the Heart and Hypertension Act, which, by its very terms, is applicable only to \u201ca regular member of a paid municipal police department . . . .\u201d General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u00a7 7-433c. Because the law enforcement arrangements that the town has chosen to adopt do not meet that standard, we conclude that the plaintiff does not qualify for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the town concedes that members of its police force are entitled to benefits under \u00a7 7-433c. The plaintiff notes that the collective bargaining agreement between the police union and the town provides that \u201c[o]fficers collecting benefits pursuant to [\u00a7] 7-433c . . . are not eligible for [insurance] benefits . . . for disabilities covered by [\u00a7 7-433c].\u201d The plaintiff argues that the reference to \u00a7 7-433c benefits in the collective bargaining agreement means that such benefits are available to constables employed by the town. The plaintiff further argues that an unreported case, namely, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New London, Docket No. 527383 (April 5, 1994) (9 C.S.C.R. 450) <em>(Hurley, </em>J.), documents the fact that the town paid \u00a7 7-433c benefits to a former constable, thus implying a concession on the part of the town that constables are eligible to receive \u00a7 7-433c benefits. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The mere reference to \u201cofficers collecting benefits pursuant to [\u00a7] 7-433c\u201d in a collective bargaining agreement does not establish that constables are entitled to such benefits under the law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The plaintiff also mischaracterizes the <em>Smith </em>case, in which the plaintiff, Robert B. Smith, a former constable of the defendant town of East Lyme, sought damages arising out of the defendant\u2019s alleged breach of an agreement to pay the plaintiff certain disability benefits. Although, in <em>Smith, </em>the plaintiff filed a claim for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>and entered into an agreement with the defendant pursuant to which the defendant was to compensate the plaintiff temporarily for his disability, there was no indication in that case that the defendant entered into that agreement with the understanding that it was making payments thereunder pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The plaintiff strains to convince this court that constables quality for \u00a7 7-433c benefits, without recognizing that the legislature chose to limit \u00a7 7-433c benefits to regular members of \u201cpaid municipal police department[s] . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c; see <em>Stitzer </em>v. <em>Rinaldi\u2019s Restaurant, </em>211 Conn. 116, 119, 557 A.2d 1256 (1989) (legislature knows how to use limiting terms when it chooses to do so). \u201c[T]his court cannot, by judicial construction, read into legislation provisions that clearly are not contained therein.\u201d <em>Stitzer </em>v. <em>Rinaldi\u2019s Restaurant, </em>supra, 119. Accordingly, we conclude that, under the clear and unambiguous provisions of the statutory scheme, the town does not have a police department, the plaintiff cannot be considered a regular member of a paid municipal police department and, therefore, is not entitled to benefits under \u00a7 7-433c.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">In this opinion SULLIVAN, C.

Although this court does not rely on <em>Zimmer </em>as precedent, we note that the court in <em>Zimmer </em>interpreted \u00a7\u00a7 7-433c and 7-274 under facts similar to those of the present case. See <em>Zimmer </em>v. <em>Essex, </em>supra, 38 Conn. Sup. 419-20. The plaintiff, Charles Zimmer, who worked for the town of Essex as a constable, brought an action seeking benefits under \u00a7 7-433c after being diagnosed with ischemic heart disease. Id. The town of Essex did not have an organized police department pursuant to \u00a7 7-274, but employed a resident state trooper to supervise the plaintiff. Id., 420. The plaintiffs duties included the routine duties of a police officer, including street patrol, traffic regulation, investigation of accidents and making arrests. Id. The commissioner dismissed the plaintiffs claim, however, after finding that \u201che was not a regular member of a paid municipal police department\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-433c. Id.

The majority thus applies the law, as defined in the relevant statutory provisions, to the facts of the case. The majority does not use the charter and ordinances to determine what a police department <em>is. </em>Rather, the majority uses them to determine whether the town\u2019s law enforcement agency is a constabulary or a police department under the relevant statutes. The concurring opinion\u2019s suggestion that we interpret a statute by seeking guidance from the facts of the case turns the process of statutory interpretation on its head.

A close examination of the concurring opinion\u2019s analysis, however, does not support this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">The analysis that the concurrence employs, which can be found in the last few paragraphs of its opinion, is based on: (1) the language of the relevant statutory scheme; (2) the remedial purpose of the statute; and (3) the law enforcement arrangements adopted by the town. Notably, the majority also considers two of these factors. Indeed, the concurrence cites several of the same statutory provisions that the majority cites in concluding that there is a legislative distinction between a police department and a constabulary. See part I of this opinion, citing General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-277a (a) and (c), and 7-294a; see also part II of this opinion, citing General Statutes \u00a7 29-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">The only significant factor considered by the concurrence that was not addressed by the majority is the remedial nature of the statute and, thus, the application of the tenet of statutory construction that the statute should be liberally construed. This is because the lack of ambiguity in the statutory scheme does not require the application of a tenet that only becomes relevant when there is some doubt as to its meaning. Indeed, because the concurrence itself finds the remedial purpose of the statute to be a nonfactor in light of <em>\u201cthe persuasive statutory differences between municipal policemen and constables\u201d-, </em>(emphasis added); we find its invocation of this particular maxim rather puzzling. That being said, we ultimately are compelled to conclude that, despite its assertion to the contrary, the concurrence essentially agrees that the meaning of \u00a7 7-433c is plain and unambiguous when considered in the context of the broader statutory scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\"> The plaintiff argues that certain municipalities without a board of police commissioners, such as New London and Groton, provide police officers with benefits under \u00a7 7-433c.

Rather, those cases were decided on other grounds. In addition, the cases do not indicate whether the alleged police departments were established under city charter provisions that were adopted prior to the enactment of \u00a7\u00a7 7-284 and 7-433c. See footnote 16 of this opinion. Consequently, they provide no support for the plaintiffs assertion that the town has a police department within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 7-284 and 7-433c, even in the absence of a board of police commissioners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\"> The town suggests that the provision may have been included in the collective bargaining agreement to protect the town against a potential award of benefits over the town\u2019s objection or a potential demand for additional disability benefits by a constable already collecting \u00a7 7-433c benefits from a previous employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b290-9\">BORDEN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AUN\">with whom NORCOTT, J., joins, concurring.

I do not agree, however, that the majority has taken the proper analytical route in reaching that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">There are three fundamental and closely related flaws in the majority\u2019s analysis. The first is that the majority has artificially divided one question of statutory interpretation into two purportedly separate questions, namely, \u201cwhether there is a difference between a constable and a regular member of a paid municipal police department\u201d and \u201cwhether the town [of East Lyme] has a \u2018paid municipal police department\u2019 under the statutory scheme.\u201d The second flaw in the majority\u2019s analysis is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>that, in its application of General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it improperly conflates two separate analyses: (1) whether the meaning of a particular statutory term or phrase, as ascertained from \u201cthe text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes,\u201d is plain and unambiguous; General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z; and (2) based on such a textual analysis, what the more likely or probable\u2014or even the most probable\u2014meaning of that text is. The two are simply not the same. The third flaw is that, despite the majority\u2019s insistence that the statutory text is plain and unambiguous and, therefore, governed by the provisions of \u00a7 l-2z, the majority has in fact relied upon extratextual sources in ascertaining the meaning of \u00a7 7-433c (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Before continuing with my criticism of the majority\u2019s approach, it is useful to recall the facts of the present case. The plaintiff, Edward Genesky, is a full-time appointed, paid constable of the defendant, the town of East Lyme (town), who began his service as such in 1989. In his capacity as a constable of the town, the plaintiff was required to undergo and successfully complete training with the Connecticut Police Academy in Meriden. In that capacity, the plaintiff performs general law enforcement functions within the town. The plaintiffs powers of arrest, however, are limited, and the town does not have a lockup. Furthermore, although the plaintiff is a full-time constable, other constables serve only part-time. The first selectman of the town serves as the chief of police.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Because the plaintiff claims benefits under \u00a7 7-433c (a), and because those benefits are provided only to \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>regular member of a paid municipal police department,\u201d the broad question posed by the case is whether the plaintiff is \u201ca regular member of apaid <em>municipal police </em>department,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-433c (a). (Emphasis added.) There is no question that the plaintiff works full time as a constable and that he is paid. Therefore, the town does not contest that he is a \u201cregular member\u201d and that he is \u201cpaid.\u201d The more precise question, therefore, is whether, as the plaintiff contends, that membership is in a \u201cmunicipal police department,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-433c (a), or, as the town contends, it is membership in something else, namely, a constabulary. That question presents the only question of statutory interpretation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">As the majority acknowledges, \u201c[t]he process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutoxy language <em>as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.'\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>269 Conn. 527, 534-35, 849 A.2d <em>777 </em>(2004);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 562 n.20, 816 A.2d 562 (2003). These two sentences \u201cset forth the fundamental task of the court in engaging in the process of statutory interpretation . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 562. Thus, the process of statutory interpretation necessarily involves determining the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case; indeed, it is difficult for me to see how it could be otherwise, because that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>is inevitably how a case presents a question of statutory interpretation to us. By way of illustration, the present case raises the question of whether the plaintiff, a full-time paid member of the constabulary of the town, is a member of a municipal police department within the meaning of \u00a7 7-433c (a), or, to put the same question another way, whether \u00a7 7-433c applies to the plaintiff so as to afford him heart and hypertension benefits under that statute. With this background in mind, I now turn to the three flaws in the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The first flaw in the majority\u2019s analysis is that it has artificially divided one question of statutory interpretation into two. The crux of that flaw is contained in the following brief passage: \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s claim that his status as a constable does not preclude him from being considered a regular member of a paid municipal police department under \u00a7 7-433c (a) requires us to examine, first, whether the statutory provisions distinguish between a constable and \u2018a regular member of a paid municipal police department\u2019 and, second, whether the town has a \u2018paid municipal police department\u2019 under the statutory scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">I can see absolutely no difference between these two questions insofar as they relate to the facts of this case. There is no factual dispute that the plaintiff is a paid constable of the town and that the town has no law enforcement officers other than constables. Thus, \u201cwhether the statutory provisions distinguish between a constable and \u2018a regular member of a paid municipal police department\u2019 see General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c (a); the majority\u2019s purported first question, is no different a question from \u201cwhether the town has \u2018a paid municipal police department\u2019 [General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c (a)] under the statutory scheme,\u201d the majority\u2019s purported second question. Both questions are the same question of statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>tory interpretation, because they both require us to decide whether the plaintiff, a constable, is a member of a \u201cmunicipal police department\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-433c (a); and they both require us to decide that question by deciding whether the language of \u00a7 7-433c (a) applies to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Furthermore, the majority answers this first question of statutory interpretation without any reference to the facts of the case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Absent from this analysis is any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>acknowledgment of the facts\u2014favorable to the plaintiffs interpretation of the statute\u2014that constables in the town have law enforcement duties, including a limited power of arrest, that the first selectman is the chief of police, and that the plaintiff was required to go through the state police training course in order to be a constable in the town. Surely, these facts are at least <em>relevant </em>to the process of statutory interpretation, which involves determining the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Indeed, that there is simply no difference between these questions is vividly demonstrated by the majority\u2019s answer to the first question: \u201cAccordingly, we conclude that related statutory provisions clearly distinguish between members of a local police department and constables, <em>and that constables were not intended to come within the class of persons eligible for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Based on this conclusion\u2014that constables are not intended to come within the scope of \u00a7 7-433c (a)\u2014clearly, this case is over and the plaintiff loses, because the plaintiff is a constable.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">I can see no substantive difference between the majority\u2019s answers to its purported second question and its answer to its purported first question. Compare: \u201cstatutes pertaining to the organization and function of police departments and constabularies, when applied to the facts of this case as found by the commissioner, firmly establish that the town has a constabulary,\u201d rather than a \u201cpaid municipal police department\u201d; and \u201cthe plaintiff is a constable, not a \u2018regular member of a paid municipal police department\u2019 . . . and, consequently, is not eligible for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c\u201d (the majority\u2019s answers to its purported second question); (citation omitted); with \u201crelated statutory provisions clearly distinguish between members of a local police department and constables, and that constables were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>not intended to come within the class of persons eligible for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c\u201d (the majority\u2019s answer to its purported first question). If there is a substantive difference among any of the majority\u2019s formulations of the questions or among these answers, that difference wholly escapes me.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The nub of each question is: Is the plaintiff, who is a member of the town constabulary, a member of a \u201cmunicipal police department\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-433c (a)? The nub of each answer is: No; a member of a constabulary like that of the town is not a member of a \u201cmunicipal police department\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-433c (a). No amount of linguistic torture of this single question and this single answer into two questions and answers can change those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Why, then, does the majority formulate the second question, when it has already purported to resolve the only issue in the case pursuant to the first question? Apparently, the majority, in answering the second question, somehow feels free to use extratextual sources in engaging in the process of statutory interpretation. Thus, the artificial bifurcation of one question into two creates the appearance that the present case involves two different types of questions to which the majority may apply two different modes of analysis. I discuss this in more detail in part III of this concurring opinion. Suffice it to say that both questions are questions of statutory interpretation, and I do not read the majority opinion to disagree with that characterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The second flaw in the majority\u2019s analysis is that, in its application of \u00a7 l-2z, it improperly conflates two separate questions: (1) whether the meaning of a particular statutory term or phrase, as ascertained from \u201cthe text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes,\u201d is plain and unambiguous; General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\u00a7 l-2z; and (2) based on such a textual analysis, what the more likely or probable\u2014or even the most probable\u2014 meaning of that text is. This conflationary flaw results in a transformation of the plain meaning rule from a threshold determination of ambiguity into the following result: once the majority has examined the statutory texts and arrived at a conclusion as to a probable meaning on the basis of those texts, that meaning then becomes, ex post facto, plain and unambiguous, precluding any resort to extratextual sources of the meaning of that text under \u00a7 l-2z. That is precisely what the majority opinion has done. Moreover, in doing so the majority has failed to demonstrate, as \u00a7 l-2z requires, that the statutory language in question is plain and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Instead, the first analysis noted previously\u2014namely, whether the meaning of the text is plain and unambiguous\u2014requires that the court examine all of the relevant statutes and conclude that there is but <em>one </em>reasonable meaning conveyed by those statutes. This inquiry, however, is <em>not </em>whether, after that full, factually contextual analysis of the statutory language, the court is convinced of the correctness of one party\u2019s interpretation; it is whether the other party\u2019s interpretation lacks <em>any </em>plausibility. Put another way, in order to reach the initial conclusion of a lack of ambiguity, the court must first conclude, not what the likely or probable or even most probable meaning of the statute is after a full textual analysis, but that there is only one reasonable meaning and that any other meaning is simply not plausible or tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">For example, in order for the majority to conclude that \u00a7 7-433c (a) plainly and unambiguously does not apply to the plaintiff under the facts of the present case, the majority must first determine that any interpretation of \u00a7 7-433c (a), taken together with all other relevant statutes, that would apply it to the plaintiff, is not rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>sonable or plausible. As I demonstrate later in this concurring opinion, there is a quite reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes that yields an interpretation that \u00a7 7-433c (a) applies to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Section l-2z provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extra-textual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 l-2z, we are to go through the following initial steps in interpreting statutes: first, we consider only the text of the statute at issue and its relationship to other statutes, as applied to the facts of the case; second, if after the completion of step one, having confined ourselves to the text of the relevant statutes, we conclude that, as so applied, there is but one reasonable or plausible meaning of the statutory language, we stop there; but third, if after the completion of step one, we conclude that, as applied to the facts of the case, there is more than one reasonable or plausible meaning of the statute, we may consult other sources, beyond the statutory language, to ascertain the meaning of the statute as applied to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">It is useful to remind ourselves of what, in this context, we mean when we say that a statutory text has a \u201cplain meaning,\u201d or, what is the same, a \u201cplain and unambiguous\u201d meaning. This court has already defined that phrase. \u201cBy that phrase we mean the meaning that is so strongly indicated or suggested by the language as applied to the facts of the case, without consideration, however, of its purpose or the other, extratextual sources of meaning . . . that, when the language is read as so applied, it appears to be <em>the </em>meaning and appears to preclude any other likely meaning.\u201d (Empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>sis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 573 n.30. Put another way, if the text of the statute at issue, considering its relationship to other statutes, as applied to the facts of the case, would permit more than one likely or plausible meaning, its meaning cannot be said to be \u201cplain and unambiguous.\u201d In my view, the analysis of the statutory language at issue in the present case by the majority fails this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">First, I turn to the language at issue that is most relevant, namely, the language of \u00a7 7-433c (a) as applied to the facts of this case. That language is \u201cmunicipal police department . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c (a). If we look at each word separately, and apply each to the relevant facts, there is an interpretation that quite reasonably favors the plaintiff. The town is certainly a municipality; therefore, \u201cmunicipal\u201d is satisfied. The constabulary of the town performs law enforcement functions, including a limited power to arrest, and the first selectman serves as the \u201cchief of police\u201d; therefore, \u201cpolice\u201d is satisfied. The constabulary is certainly a constituent part of the government of the town; therefore, \u201cdepartment\u201d\u2014and even \u201cpolice department\u201d\u2014is satisfied. Furthermore, there is nothing in the other statutes considered by the majority that would necessarily exclude this quite straightforward application of the ordinary meaning of the text of \u00a7 7-433c (a) to the facts of the case. Therefore, solely on the basis of this reading of the relevant statutory texts, there is a reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 7-433c (a) that favors the plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 7-433c (a) applies to him so as to afford him heart and hypertension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Second, we have stated that \u201call workers\u2019 compensation legislation, because of its remedial nature, should be broadly construed in favor of disabled employees . . . [and that] [t]his proposition applies as well to the provisions of [\u00a7] 7-433c . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>214 Conn. 552, 557, 573 A.2d 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>(1990). Thus, this prior judicial interpretive maxim regarding \u00a7 7-433c supports a broad interpretation of the phrase \u201cmunicipal police department\u201d as applied to the facts of the present case, and such a broad interpretation reasonably would include a full-time, paid constable of the town.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Third, the majority concedes that none of our statutes, including \u00a7 7-433c (a), contains a definition of \u201cpaid municipal police department.\u201d In addition, a canvass of our General Statutes indicates that, in addition to its use in \u00a7 7-433c (a), the term \u201cmunicipal police department,\u201d without any statutory definition thereof, has been used by the legislature at least twenty-eight times,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that some uses of the term probably would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>and others probably would not include a constabulary like that of the town, depending on the statutory context and the facts of the case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, the fact that the statutory phrase in question has been used so many times and in so many different contexts, suggests two things. First, the frequent and varied use of the term strongly suggests that it cannot be \u201cplain and unambiguous\u201d in any one context; it must be interpreted in accordance with that context, and in accordance with the purpose for which it was used in any given context. Put another way, it is difficult, perhaps impossible, for me to look at a statutory phrase that is used, without definition, <em>twenty-nine </em>times, in <em>twenty-nine </em>different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>contexts, and say with any degree of confidence that in this one context it is plain and unambiguous as applied to the facts of the present case. A second, corollary conclusion is that, in arriving at its implicit conclusion that the statutoiy language of \u00a7 7-433c (a), considering its relationship to other relevant statutes, is plain and unambiguous, the majority cannot have considered these statutes and analyzed them as statutes that are certainly relevant to the use of the same language in \u00a7 7-433c (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Fourth, the majority\u2019s analysis, including its answers to its purported second question, takes up approximately two thirds of its opinion. It is simply counterintuitive that it would take that much analysis and discussion to arrive at the meaning, as applied to the facts of the case, of a three word term\u2014\u201cmunicipal police department\u201d\u2014if that meaning were truly plain and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Thus, all these factors convince me that the meaning of the term, \u201cmunicipal police department,\u201d as used in \u00a7 7-433c (a) and as applied to the facts of the case, is not plain and unambiguous. This litany of factors demonstrates that the meaning of the term, wherever used, can properly be discerned only by a careful analysis of its use in the particular statutory text at issue and of other statutory texts, along with any other relevant nontextual sources of meaning, and that it is not a term the meaning of which as so used and as applied to the facts of the case is plain and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Instead of attempting to demonstrate, first, that the text of \u00a7 7-433c (a), including its relationship to other statutes, has only <em>one </em>reasonable <em>or </em>plausible meaning as applied to the facts of the case, the majority has simply examined the text of \u00a7 7-433c (a) and of certain other statutes and arrived at a conclusion as to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>meaning. That meaning, then, has become, ex post facto, the only reasonable meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The bases of the majority\u2019s conclusion are that, although the term \u201cmunicipal police department\u201d is not defined anywhere, either in \u00a7 7-433c (a) or elsewhere, the legislature has often referred \u201cin other statutory provisions to constables <em>and </em>members of a local police department,\u201d and the legislature has in other statutes made certain benefits available to the \u201csurviving spouse and certain dependent children of a member of an organized local police department <em>or </em>a constable who performs criminal law enforcement duties.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Thus, the majority concludes, in answering its purported first question, \u201cthat constables were not intended to come within the class of persons eligible for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">I agree that this statutory analysis presents persuasive reasons why \u00a7 7-433c (a) does not apply to the plaintiff. My disagreement is over whether that statutory analysis establishes that the majority\u2019s interpretation is the <em>only reasonable meaning </em>of the text of \u00a7 7-433c (a) and that, therefore, resort to extratextual sources of its meaning is precluded by \u00a7 l-2z. The majority apparently thinks that it is. In my view, for the reasons I have explained previously in this concurring opinion, it is not. There remains a quite reasonable interpretation of the statutory language that, if followed, would apply \u00a7 7-433c (a) to the plaintiff. \u201c[W]e have stated that statutory language does not become ambiguous \u2018merely because the parties contend for different meanings.\u2019 . . . <em>Glastonbury Co. </em>v. <em>Gillies, </em>209 Conn. 175, 180, 550 A.2d 8 (1988). Yet, if parties contend for different meanings, and each meaning is plausible, that is essentially what \u2018ambiguity\u2019 ordinarily means in such a context in our language.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 571-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Indeed, the majority\u2019s treatment of its purported second question demonstrates that, despite its efforts to view this case as one to which \u00a7 l-2z applies, it, too, albeit implicitly, uses extratextual sources in interpreting \u00a7 7-433c (a). This brings me to the third fundamental flaw in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The third fundamental flaw in the majority\u2019s analysis is that, despite its insistence that the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, and that, therefore, under \u00a7 l-2z it is prohibited from using extratextual sources in interpreting \u00a7 7-433c (a), it does in fact use those extratextual sources. These sources include the town charter and ordinances, the collective bargaining agreement between the police union and the town, and the canon of statutory interpretation that the \u201clegislature knows how to use limiting terms when it chooses to do so . . . [and] [t]his court cannot, by judicial construction, read into legislation provisions that are not contained therein.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) See part II of the majority opinion, quoting <em>Stitzer </em>v. <em>Rinaldi\u2019s Restaurant, </em>211 Conn. 116, 119, 557 A.2d 1256 (1989).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, although specifically declining to \u201crely on <em>Zimmer </em>[v. <em>Essex, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 419, 421, 449 A.2d 1053 (1982)], as precedent,\u201d the majority \u201cnote[s] that the court in <em>Zimmer </em>interpreted [\u00a7] 7-433c and [General Statutes \u00a7] 7-24 under facts similar to those in the present case\u201d in a manner consistent with the majority\u2019s conclusion. See footnote 6 of the majority opinion. Section l-2z does not say that a court may not <em>rely for support </em>on extratextual evidence of a statute\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>meaning; it says that we may not \u201cconsider\u201d such evidence. I suggest that the majority\u2019s \u201cnote\u201d of <em>Zimmer\u2019s </em>conclusion consistent with that of the majority, constitutes such consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">My point is that none of these materials, considered and employed by the majority, is contained in the text of the statute at issue and they are, therefore, presumably barred from our consideration by the literal terms of \u00a7 l-2z. Indeed, it is telling that the majority cannot <em>decide </em>the case without answering its purported <em>second </em>question and, in doing so, considering extratextual sources of the meaning of \u00a7 7-433a as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The majority\u2019s response to this point is as follows: \u201cThe majority does not use the charter and ordinances to determine what a police department <em>is. </em>Rather, the majority uses them to determine whether the town\u2019s law enforcement agency is a constabulary or a police department under the relevant statutes.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) See footnote 14 of the majority opinion. This response is a red herring, and only proves my point.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">It is a red herring because I do not suggest that the majority is determining \u201cwhat a police department <em>is.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) Such a metaphysical question has no relevance to the present case. What a police department \u201cis\u201d is a meaningless question, unless it is linked to a particular statute and the facts of the case, such as in the present case, namely, whether the town constabulary \u201cis\u201d a \u201cmunicipal police department\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-433c (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">The majority\u2019s response proves my point, because it acknowledges that it \u201cuses [the town charter and ordinances] <em>to determine whether the town\u2019s law enforcement agency is a constabulary or a police department under the relevant statutes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) See footnote 14 of the majority opinion. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>is an accurate description of the question of statutory interpretation posed by the majority\u2019s questions in the present case. Thus, the majority acknowledges that it uses the town charter and ordinances\u2014which are not included in the text of any of the relevant statutes\u2014 to decide whether \u00a7 7-433c (a) applies to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">I reiterate that I do not disagree with the ultimate conclusion of the majority that the town\u2019s law enforcement agency is a constabulary and not a municipal police department, as that term is used in \u00a7 7-433c. Such a conclusion, however, is not plainly and unambiguously compelled by the texts and facts involved in the majority\u2019s analysis and discussion, as I have indicated previously in this concurring opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Thus, in order to decide the present case, I would instead recognize that the question of whether the plaintiff is a member of a \u201cmunicipal police department\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-433c (a) presents a singular question of statutoiy interpretation, the answer to which is not clear or obvious from the language of that statute and other statutes. Put another way, considering both the text of \u00a7 7-433c (a) itself and the text of other relevant statutes, the meaning of that term as applied to the facts of the case is not plain and unambiguous. Consequently, the limitations imposed on our analytical method by \u00a7 l-2z do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">I would, therefore, start with the language of the statute but would not confine myself only to that language. I would also consider other nontextual sources of its meaning, namely, our prior jurisprudence regarding the statute\u2019s remedial purpose, the proper role of maxims of statutoiy interpretation, and what we know as a matter of history regarding towns served by a constabulary. Without belaboring the point, this mode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>of analysis leads me to conclude, along with the majority, that under the facts of the present case the plaintiff is a member, not of a \u201cmunicipal police department\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-433c (a), but of a constabulary.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">First, the language of the relevant statutory scheme suggests that, despite the fact that constables perform many of the same functions as other law enforcement officers and, therefore, might be considered for some purposes as members of a municipal police department, the legislature has often considered constables and policemen as similar but different officers. As both I and the majority have already noted, the term, \u201cmunicipal police department,\u201d is nowhere defined in our statutes. Other related statutes, however, indicate a legislatively understood difference between apolice department and a constabulary. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 7-277a (a)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provides a mechanism by which the chief execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>tives of municipalities may request police assistance from other municipalities. Section 7-277a (c) specifically provides, however, that the \u201cchief executive officer\u201d of any municipality \u201cwhich provides police protection <em>solely by a constabulary force </em>may enter into an agreement with one or more municipalities to furnish or receive police assistance under the conditions and terms specified in subsection (a).\u201d (Emphasis added.) Similarly, General Statutes \u00a7 7-294a,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>sets forth the definitions for purposes of the police officer standards and training council, defines a \u201c \u2018police officer\u2019 \u201d as \u201ca sworn member of an organized local police department, [as well as] <em>an appointed con</em>stable* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>who performs criminal law enforcement duties </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In addition, General Statutes \u00a7 29-5<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> provides for the appointment by the commissioner of public safety of resident state troopers for towns \u201clacking an organized police force . . . .\u201d We know as a matter of history\u2014i.e., a nontextual source of the meaning of the statutory scheme\u2014that, as the town in the present case points out, such towns have usually been towns served by a constabulary. See, e.g., <em>Bieluch </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>999 F.2d 666, 668 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1094, 114 S. Ct. 926, 127 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1994); <em>Zimmer </em>v. <em>Essex, </em>supra, 38 Conn. Sup. 420. Although the language \u201corganized police force\u201d is not identical to \u201cmunicipal police department,\u201d it is close enough to conclude that the two legislative terms are synonymous or nearly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">This analysis suggests that there is a legislatively recognized difference between a municipal police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>department and a constabulary. Although we have characterized \u00a7 7-433c as remedial and, therefore, to be broadly construed; <em>Szudora </em>v. Fairfield, supra, 214 Conn. 557; we have also stated that \u201c[a]xioms such as this . . . cannot displace the need for careful and thoughtful interpretation of [the statutory provisions at issue], nor can they displace the film conclusions that such a process of interpretation yields. [Such] axioms, like all rules or canons of statutory construction, serve as important guidelines to the determination of legislative meaning. To permit them to displace the conclusions that careful interpretation yields, however, would be a disservice to the legislative process, as well as to the judicial exercise of interpreting legislative language based upon the premise that the legislature intends to enact reasonable public policies.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carriero </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>243 Conn. 747, 762, 707 A.2d 706 (1998). Thus, the fact that the statute is remedial is simply insufficient to overcome the persuasive statutory differences between municipal policemen and constables. The repeated legislative distinction drawn between police departments and constabularies indicates that the plaintiff does not come within the category of municipal policeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In addition, I also consider the extratextual sources of the town charter and ordinances, and the collective bargaining agreement between the town and the police union. I conclude that the language of the 1979 town ordinance supports the conclusion that the plaintiff is not a member of a municipal police department, because it provides for the termination of the town constabulary if \u201cthe town establishes a police department in accordance with the provisions of chapter 104, part I of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d Town of East Lyme, Charter Ordinance and Special Laws, Amended Ordinance Concerning Terms of Appointment and Qualifications of Constables \u00b6 2.1.1.4 (February 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>1979). With respect to the collective bargaining agreement, I acknowledge that it lends support to the <em>plaintiffs </em>claim, because it specifically refers to \u00a7 7-433c, but I conclude that that support is not persuasive enough to overcome all of the other factors leading to the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Finally, I note that, under all of the facts of the case, although the plaintiff has law enforcement duties, the plaintiffs powers of arrest are limited, and the town does not have a lockup, which is an ordinary hallmark of a \u201cpolice department.\u201d Further, although the plaintiff is a full-time constable, other members of the constabulary serve only part-time, a status that seems inconsistent with the notion of a \u201cmunicipal police department.\u201d Moreover, although the first selectman serves as the town\u2019s chief of police, the resident state trooper has administrative supervision over the plaintiff. Those facts support the conclusion that the plaintiff is a member, not of a \u201cmunicipal police department\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7-433 (a), but of a local constabulary.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">I would, therefore, affirm the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board affirming the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner dismissing the plaintiffs claim for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c (a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 568 or any other general statute, charter, special act or ordinance to the contrary, in the event a uniformed member of a paid municipal fire department or a regular member of a paid municipal police department who successfully passed a physical examination on entry into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of hypertension or heart disease, suffers either off duty or on duty any condition or impairment of health caused by hypertension or heart disease resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>in his death or his temporary or permanent, total or partial disability, he or his dependents, as the case may be, shall receive from his municipal employer compensation and medical care in the same amount and the same manner as that provided under chapter 568 if such death or disability was caused by a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment and was suffered in the line of duty and within the scope of his employment, and from the municipal or state retirement system under which he is covered, he or his dependents, as the case may be, shall receive the same retirement or survivor benefits which would be paid under said system if such death or disability was caused by a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment, and was suffered in the line of duty and within the scope of his employment. If successful passage of such a physical examination was, at the time of his employment, required as a condition for such employment, no proof or record of such examination shall be required as evidence in the maintenance of a claim under this section or under such municipal or state retirement systems. The benefits provided by this section shall be in lieu of any other benefits which such policeman or fireman or his dependents may be entitled to receive from his municipal employer under the provisions of chapter 568 or the municipal or state retirement system under which he is covered, except as provided by this section, as a result of any condition or impairment of health caused by hypertension or heart disease resulting in his death or his temporary or permanent, total or partial disability. As used in this section, the term \u2018municipal employer\u2019 shall have the same meaning and shall be defined as said term is defined in section 7-467. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained <em>from </em>the <em>text of </em>the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\"> As the majority notes in footnote 10 of its opinion, \u00a7 l-2z \u201clegislatively overruled that part of <em>Courchesne </em>in which we stated that we would not require a threshold showing of linguistic ambiguity as a precondition to consideration of sources of the meaning of legislative language in addition to its text.\u201d <em>Paul Dinto Electrical Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>266 Conn. 706, 716 n.10, 835 A.2d 33 (2003). Thus, the legislature did not purport to overrule our judicial definition of the task of statutory interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\"> The majority, in footnote 14 of its opinion, claims that my \u201csuggestion that we interpret a statute by seeking guidance from the facts of the case turns the process of statutory interpretation on its head. If the facts of a case were used to determine the meaning of any given statutory provision, there would be an infinite number of possible interpretations of the statute, depending on the circumstances of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">I suggest, in response, first, that the majority ignores this court\u2019s own\u2014 and the majority\u2019s own acknowledged\u2014definition of statutory interpretation: \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.\u201d <em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 534-35; see also part I of the majority opinion. Thus, I do not interpret a s1 atute by \u201cseeking guidance from the facts of the case . ...\u201d I simply do what our precedents require: I seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question\u2014as in the present case\u2014of whether the statute does apply to the facts of the case. This does not turn the process of statutory interpretation on its head; it performs that process.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Second, the appropriate analytical process, which I advocate in this concurring opinion, of interpreting a statute as applied to the facts of the case, is the approach that we have always taken to statutory interpretation, both before and after the enactment, of \u00a7 l-2z, and that approach has not resulted in, nor will it result in \u201can infinite number of possible interpretations of the statute, depending on the circumstances of the case.\u201d See footnote 14 of the majority opinion. On the contrary, the necessarily factually contextual approach to the interpretation of statutes simply means that, depending on the s1 atute, there may be a very large\u2014or very small\u2014number of <em>questions </em>that parties may present under any given statute or statutory scheme and any given set of facts. But the answers to those questions will always be finite and consistent, if the court answers them by performing the process of statutory interpretation defined previously in an intellectually honest manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\"> 1 am cognizant, however, that, under the restrictions imposed by \u00a7 l-2z, we are prohibited from examining extratextual sources of the meaning of statutory language unless and until we have, <em>first, </em>determined that it is plain and unambiguous. It may be, therefore, that under the terms of \u00a7 1-2z themselves, we may not even consult our prior interpretive maxims such as that stated in <em>Szudora, </em>in order to determine whether the language is ambiguous, because that maxim does not appear anywhere in the text of the statute. I note also that the majority does not anywhere in its opinion refer to this judicially well established maxim. I suspect that it does not do so for precisely this reason, namely, its view that \u00a7 l-2z prohibits it. If it be so, however, that \u00a7 l-2z has this effect\u2014which its text certainly suggests\u2014 then it seems to me that it might well be unconstitutional under the doctrine of the separation of powers, at least as to that effect, and perhaps more broadly, as a statute that significantly interferes with the core judicial task of statutory interpretation.
