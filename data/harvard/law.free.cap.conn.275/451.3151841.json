The petitioner claims that her trial counsel was ineffective because he conceded that her confession was made voluntarily, thereby precluding her from appealing an issue of state constitutional law. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">In the underlying criminal action, the petitioner was charged with felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, conspiracy to commit robbery in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) and 53a-48 (a), attempt to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) and 53a-49 (a) (2), and robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3). A jury found the petitioner guilty of all charges except robbery in the first degree. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict, sentencing the petitioner to a total effective term of fifty years imprisonment. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>263 Conn. 1, 22, 818 A.2d 1 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The petitioner thereafter filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The habeas court denied the petition and subsequently granted certification to appeal to the Appellate Court. The petitioner appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The record reveals the following relevant facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the predawn hours of February 24, 1996, the petitioner, a fourteen year old runaway from an \u201calternative to detention\u201d program affiliated with the department of children and families (department), and Lucis Richardson attempted to rob a taxicab driver by entering the taxicab\u2019s backseat and demanding money while threatening the driver with an object that resembled a firearm. When the driver did not respond immediately, Richardson struck the driver with the object. A struggle ensued, and the petitioner fatally stabbed the driver with a kitchen knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Using telephone records, officers of the Hartford police department took less than four hours to trace the perpetrators of the crime to an apartment where the petitioner and Richardson had been staying with friends that evening. Id., 6-7. When the police arrived at the apartment, the petitioner fled through a back door. Id., 7. Richardson remained to answer the door and, in response to police questioning, denied that he had any knowledge of the taxicab incident and told the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>police that the petitioner had been at the apartment earlier that evening. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"AZgv\">The Hartford police located the petitioner and took her into custody on the evening of February 27, 1996. That evening at the police station, the petitioner met privately with her estranged father, Willie Ledbetter, who long ago had relinquished guardianship of the petitioner but retained his parental rights. The petitioner\u2019s father encouraged the petitioner to make a statement to the police describing her role in the incident, advising her that it would be in her best interests and a \u201cChristian\u201d thing to do. The petitioner\u2019s father also advised the petitioner that, because she claimed not to have stabbed the victim, she could not be charged with murder, and that, because she was a juvenile, she could not be held beyond her eighteenth birthday.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANx\">While the petitioner\u2019s father had had considerable experience with Connecticut\u2019s criminal courts as a consequence of his own criminal record, his advice was inaccurate on both points. The petitioner was unaware of this inaccuracy, however, when she received her father\u2019s advice. The police never informed the petitioner that her case could be transferred to the regular criminal docket and, if so, that she would be tried and sentenced as an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Disregarding the advice of a department social worker that she consult an attorney, the petitioner waived her <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights and tendered a written statement to the police shortly after midnight on February 28, 1996. In her statement, the petitioner described her active role in the attempted robbery, but accused Richardson of inflicting the fatal stab wound. The peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>tioner was arrested and charged with the victim\u2019s murder. Thereafter, her case automatically was transferred from juvenile court to the regular criminal docket.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Assistant public defender Michael Isko represented the petitioner at her criminal trial. Prior to trial, Isko filed a motion to suppress the petitioner\u2019s statement to the police on the grounds that the petitioner: (1) was not advised, or at least was provided with incomplete information, about the consequences of her statement, one of which was that her case could be transferred to the regular criminal docket; and (2) received no information about the role or function of counsel. As a consequence, Isko argued, the petitioner had not \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waive[d] her <em>Miranda </em>rights . . . and her statement was not voluntary, knowingly and intelligently made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">At the December 16, 1999 suppression hearing, however, Isko conceded that the petitioner had made her statement voluntarily. In response to the court\u2019s questioning, Isko repeatedly confirmed that the petitioner had made her statement voluntarily while continuing to contend that she had not made it \u201cintelligently and knowingly . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court denied the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>to suppress, concluding that the petitioner\u2019s statement was knowing, intelligent and voluntary. In so concluding, the trial court considered the totality of the circumstances, including Isko\u2019s concession regarding voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Isko later explained that he conceded voluntariness \u201cto preclude\u201d the court from charging the jury regarding the statement\u2019s voluntariness. Isko believed that any charge regarding vohmtariness would harm his client\u2019s chances with the jury by highlighting the state\u2019s \u201cvery powerful evidence\u201d contradicting any possible claim of involuntariness by the petitioner.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Following her conviction and sentencing, and an unsuccessful direct appeal to this court,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the petitioner filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petitioner claimed that Isko ineffectively had represented her at trial and had prejudiced her defense, thereby violating her rights under the United States and Connecticut constitutions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Before the habeas court, the petitioner identified Isko\u2019s concession of voluntariness as the only deficient aspect of his performance. The petitioner argued that, by failing to preserve the issue of voluntariness, Isko had precluded her from appealing on the theory that the failure of the police to inform her that she could be charged and tried as an adult rendered her statement involuntary, in violation of article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The respondent, the commissioner of correction, countered that Isko\u2019s decision to concede voluntariness was largely immune from judicial second-guessing as a \u201cstrategic or tactical [choice] . . . .\u201d The respondent also argued that, even if Isko had performed deficiently, \u201cthe petitioner has still failed to show that the deficient performance prejudiced [her defense]. In addition to the [petitioner\u2019s] confession . . . there was more than enough evidence to sustain a verdict of guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The habeas court applied the test set forth in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), which requires an ineffective assistance of counsel claim to be supported by evidence establishing both (1) counsel\u2019s deficient performance, and (2) prejudice suffered by the claimant as a result of such deficient performance. With respect to the first element, the habeas court characterized Isko\u2019s concession as a \u201ctactical decision,\u201d which, \u201c[a]s a rule, courts are reluctant to second guess . . . .\u201d With respect to the second element, the habeas court concluded that the statement\u2019s voluntariness \u201cremained an issue throughout the trial and was presented to the jury,\u201d and, therefore, that Isko\u2019s concession did not prejudice the petitioner\u2019s defense. The habeas court also rejected the petitioner\u2019s theoiy based on her right against self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>incrimination under article first, \u00a7 8, as \u201cspeculative at best.\u201d Accordingly, the habeas court denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">We begin our discussion by noting that the effectiveness of an attorney\u2019s representation of a criminal defendant is \u201ca mixed determination of law and fact that . . . requires plenary review . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>220 Conn. 112, 131, 595 A.2d 1356 (1991). The sixth amendment to the United States constitution guarantees a criminal defendant \u201cthe assistance of counsel for his defense.\u201d U.S. Const., amend. VI. \u201cIt is axiomatic that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel consists of two components: a \u201cperformance prong\u201d and a \u201cprejudice prong. \u201d To satisfy the performance prong, a claimant must demonstrate that \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed ... by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 687. To satisfy the \u201cprejudice prong,\u201d a claimant must demonstrate that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id., 694. The claim will succeed only if both prongs are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The petitioner claims that Isko ineffectively represented her by failing to preserve the issue of the voluntariness of her written confession, thereby precluding an appeal based on the theory that article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut \u201crequires that a juvenile suspect be told that he or she may (or will) be tried as an adult ... in adult court . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The petitioner relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>218 Conn. 714, 722, 591 A.2d 119 (1991), in which the defendant, Paul Perez, advanced the same theory as the defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the present case now advances. In that case, fourteen year old Perez waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and confessed to a murder. Id., 717-21. Perez entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere and was sentenced as an adult after a trial court denied his motion to suppress the confession. Id., 717-18. On appeal to this court, Perez claimed that the failure of the police to advise him that he \u201cwas subject to criminal prosecution as an adult, rather than [as a juvenile]\u201d; id., 724; had rendered his confession unknowing, unintelligent, and involuntary in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. See id., 722, 724. Perez urged a per se rule requiring the police to give such a warning to juvenile suspects. See id., 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">This court rejected Perez\u2019 federal constitutional claim, concluding that the fifth amendment requires only that a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test be applied to the statements of juvenile suspects. Id., 726-27. Applying this test, we upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that Perez\u2019 confession was voluntary, knowing and intelligent. Id., 728. We declined, however, to consider Perez\u2019 claim under article first, \u00a7 8, due to his inadequate briefing of the issue. Id., 723. We therefore left undecided the issue of whether article first, \u00a7 8, requires the police to advise juvenile suspects that they may be prosecuted as adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The petitioner nonetheless contends that <em>\u201cPerez </em>was a road map for a competent defense lawyer to follow . . . .\u201d The petitioner asserts that the issue of whether article first, \u00a7 8, requires the police to make a similar warning to juvenile suspects \u201cnever should have been waived by . . . Isko.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The respondent counters that the petitioner has not satisfied either of <em>Strickland's </em>two prongs. With respect to the performance prong, the respondent argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Isko\u2019s performance simply was not deficient insofar as Isko was not required to recognize and to preserve a novel state constitutional argument. Alternatively, the respondent argues that Isko\u2019s choice to concede voluntariness was a reasonable tactical decision. With respect to the prejudice prong, the respondent argues that the petitioner was not prejudiced by Isko\u2019s concession, first, because she was not precluded from raising her theory under article first, \u00a7 8, on direct appeal from the judgment of conviction and, second, because her theory lacks merit. The respondent further asserts, as an alternative ground for affirmance, that we \u201cneed not and should not reach the novel issue of whether article first, \u00a7 8 . . . requires that juvenile felony suspects be told that they may be treated as adult offenders because, as a matter of law . . . Isko\u2019s failure to recognize and preserve that issue for appeal did not constitute deficient performance.\u201d We agree with the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Turning first to the performance prong, we note that the petitioner must show that Isko\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d in order to establish ineffective performance. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 688. In other words, the petitioner must demonstrate that Isko\u2019s representation was not \u201creasonably competent or within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>170 Conn. 273, 283, 365 A.2d 1167, cert. denied, 425 U.S. 962, 96 S. Ct. 1748, 48 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1976). In analyzing Isko\u2019s performance, we \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance . . . .\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 689. The petitioner bears the burden of overcoming this presumption. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">First, to perform effectively, counsel need not \u201crecognize and raise every conceivable constitutional claim.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 134, 102 S. Ct. 1558, 71 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1982). In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>218 Conn. 403, 425-28, 589 A.2d 1214 (1991), modified on other grounds, <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>219 Conn. 215, 592 A.2d 910 (1991), we held that defense counsel\u2019s failure to recognize and to raise an equal protection challenge to a state statute governing jury selection did not constitute ineffective assistance despite other defendants\u2019 subsequent successful equal protection challenges to the same statute. Likewise, Isko\u2019s failure to recognize and to raise the petitioner\u2019s theoiy of article first, \u00a7 8\u2014regardless of the theory\u2019s prospects for success and the fact that it had been identified in Perez\u2014does not, in and of itself, constitute ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Moreover, numerous state and federal courts have concluded that counsel\u2019s failure to advance novel legal theories or arguments does not constitute ineffective performance. E.g., <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 F.3d 749, 754 (8th Cir. 2005) (\u201c[cjounsel\u2019s failure to raise [a] novel argument does not render his performance constitutionally ineffective\u201d); <em>Box </em>v. <em>Petsock, </em>697 F. Sup. 821, 835 (M.D. Pa. 1987) (\u201c[cjounsel is not required to . . . pursue novel theories of defense\u201d), aff'd mem., 860 F.2d 1074 (3d Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1028, 109 S. Ct. 1161,103 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1989); <em>Weaver v. State, </em>339 Ark. 97, 102, 3 S.W.3d 323 (1999) (\u201c[a]n attorney is not ineffective for failing to raise every novel issue which might conceivably be raised\u201d); <em>Haight </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>41 S.W.3d 436, 448 (Ky.) (\u201cwhile the failure to advance an established legal theory may result in ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland, </em>the failure to advance a novel theory never will\u201d), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 998, 122 S. Ct. 471, 151 L. Ed. 2d 386 (2001); <em>People </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>453 Mich. 685, 695, 556 N.W.2d 858 (1996) (\u201ccounsel\u2019s performance cannot be deemed deficient for failing to advance a novel legal argument\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>571 Pa. 112, 131, 811 A.2d 994 (2002) (\u201c[c]ounsel cannot be faulted for failing to advance a novel legal theory which has never been accepted by the pertinent courts\u201d). Nor is counsel required to \u201cchange then-existing law\u201d to provide effective representation. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>State, </em>472 N.E.2d 1260, 1265 (Ind. 1985). Counsel instead performs effectively when he elects \u201cto maneuver within the existing law, declining to present untested . . . legal theories.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McNeill, </em>83 Ohio St. 3d 438, 449, 700 N.E.2d 596 (1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1137, 119 S. Ct. 1792, 143 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The petitioner has not demonstrated that Isko did anything except conform to the existing law of this state. The petitioner\u2019s theory of article first, \u00a7 8, was a novel one; it had (and has) never been accepted by the courts of this state, and, consequently, its chances of success were speculative. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 723-24. Isko\u2019s failure to adopt and to advance such a speculative theory, therefore, does not render his performance ineffective. See <em>Elledge </em>v. <em>Dugger, </em>823 F.2d 1439, 1443 (11th Cir.) (\u201c[r]easonably effective representation cannot and does not include a requirement to make arguments based on predictions of how the law may develop\u201d), modified on other grounds, 833 F.2d 250 (11th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1014, 108 S. Ct. 1487, 99 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1988); see also <em>Walton </em>v. <em>State, </em>847 So. 2d 438, 445 (Fla. 2003) (\u201ccounsel cannot be faulted for failing to assert claims that did not exist at the time [he] represented [the defendant]\u201d). To conclude that counsel is obligated to recognize and to preserve previously undecided constitutional claims, the viability of which is purely speculative, would be to require criminal defense lawyers to possess a measure of clairvoyance that the sixth amendment surely does not demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Finally, counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure to raise every issue which might have support from other jurisdictions\u201d does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Honeycutt </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>698 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir. 1983); see also <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>642 F.2d 903, 908 (5th Cir. 1981) (\u201c[c]ounsel is normally not expected ... to research parallel jurisdictions\u201d). The petitioner\u2019s intimation that Isko should have looked to <em>State </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>126 N.H. 6, 490 A.2d 295 (1985),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in support of her theory under article first, \u00a7 8, therefore, also does not bear on the effectiveness of his performance. Isko\u2019s failure to preserve a novel state constitutional argument, especially one supported only by the law of some other states, is not an ineffective performance within the meaning of the sixth amendment.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>A court evaluating an ineffective assistance claim need not address both components of the <em>Strickland </em>test \u201cif the [claimant] makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. 697. As the petitioner has failed to satisfy <em>Strickland's </em>performance prong, we need not, and do not, analyze her claim with reference to <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\"> We are mindful that, in a habeas action in which the petitioner alleges ineffective assistance of trial counsel, \u201cthe underlying historical facts found by the habeas court may not be disturbed unless they were clearly erroneous . . . .\u201d <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>220 Conn. 112, 131, 595 A.2d 1356 (1991).

[Yjou\u2019re not challenging the voluntariness of the statement?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">\u201c[Isko]: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">\u201cThe Court: What is your main thrust of attack?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">\u201c[Isko]: The main thrust of the argument is that the statement was made because [the petitioner] did not intelligently or\u2014she was not knowledgeable and intelligent concerning the consequences of her waiver, and she did not receive information that would give her that knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>\u201cThe Court: All right. But is it fair to say that your principal thrust is that the waiver was not <em>intelligently, knowingly or voluntarily </em>made?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">\u201c[Isko]: Yes, <em>intelligently and knowingly </em>made, I feel, would be more accurate and fair.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b478-11\"> Isko was referring particularly to the petitioner\u2019s father, who \u201cwas there for his daughter, listened to what she had to say and gave her his heartfelt advice,\u201d and the social worker who encouraged the petitioner to seek legal counsel. Isko stated that, from his perspective and in light of the testimony available to him, \u201cthe voluntariness issue . . . stunk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b478-13\"> The petitioner did not raise issues regarding Isko\u2019s concession of voluntariness in her direct appeal. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 9-22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b478-14\"> The petitioner also asserted a second claim, which concerned Isko\u2019s handling of a witness who spoke at the petitioner\u2019s sentencing hearing. The petitioner, however, did not pursue this claim at her habeas trial. The habeas court determined that, \u201cin her brief, [the] \u2018[petitioner limit[ed] the issue of . . . Isko\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness to one narrow question. Was he ineffective when he conceded voluntariness of the [petitioner\u2019s] confession . . . ?\u2019 \u201d In accordance with the habeas court\u2019s determination, we conclude that the petitioner abandoned her second claim before that court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut guarantees that \u201c[n]o person shall be compelled to give evidence against himself . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b485-5\"> <em>Benoit </em>reached the conclusion championed by the petitioner under the New Hampshire constitution: \u201c[W]hen a confession is to be admitted against a child in adult criminal court . . . for a judge to conclude that the statements were made knowingly and intelligently, the child, when facing a charge that would be a felony if committed by an adult, must have been advised of the possibility of his being tried as an adult and of his being subject to adult criminal sanctions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>supra, 126 N.H. 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b485-6\"> Finally, we briefly address an argument that the petitioner raises in her reply brief in response to the respondent\u2019s argument that a failure to raise a previously <em>unrecognized </em>constitutional argument is not ineffective assistance of counsel. The petitioner suggests that Isko recognized the potential claim regarding the application of article first, \u00a7 8, to juveniles but nonetheless failed to preserve it at the suppression hearing. Isko\u2019s abandonment of a previously recognized issue, the petitioner contends, forms an independent basis for deeming his performance ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The record, however, does not support the petitioner\u2019s contention that Isko recognized a potential claim under article first, \u00a7 8, prior to the suppression hearing, or at any other time. Isko testified before the habeas court that he had \u201clooked at [the voluntariness issue] as a coercion matter rather than also taking into consideration the other due process issues that exist in that claim . . . .\u201d This testimony directly contradicts the petitioner\u2019s argument that Isko recognized voluntariness not as a \u201ccoercion matter\u201d but, rather, as a state constitutional matter. The petitioner\u2019s habeas counsel did not clarify this discrepancy at the habeas trial by asking Isko about his understanding of article first, \u00a7 8, when Isko filed the motion to suppress. It is also significant that Isko\u2019s trial court brief in support of the motion to suppress provides no independent analysis under article first, \u00a7 8. As both the content of Isko\u2019s brief and his testimony before the habeas court belie</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>the petitioner\u2019s contention that Isko recognized a potential claim under article first, \u00a7 8, the petitioner\u2019s argument is untenable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b486-12\"> The fact that the habeas court reached the same result by relying on <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong is inconsequential: \u201cThis court is authorized to rely upon alternative grounds supported by the record to sustain a judgment.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Siano, </em>216 Conn. 273, 282 n.8, 579 A.2d 79 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
