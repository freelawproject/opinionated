The defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) admitted, under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, several statements attributed to the victim; (2) charged the jury concerning the intent to be ascribed to a person who uses a deadly weapon on the vital part of another person; and (3) charged the jury concerning the presumption of innocence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>The defendant, Christopher Smith, was charged with one count of murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a (a), two counts of assault of a peace officer in violation of \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1), and one count of intimidation of a witness in violation of \u00a7 53a-151a (a) (1). The jury found the defendant guilty of all charges. The trial court rendered judgment of conviction in accordance with the verdict. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant was romantically involved with the victim, Elizabeth Ross, during the six to seven month period prior to her death on April 8, 2001. Prior to and during that same time period, the defendant was also romantically involved with Christie Auger. Despite the defendant\u2019s denials to Auger that he was romantically involved with the victim, Auger was aware of his relationship with the victim. Auger\u2019s awareness of the defendant\u2019s relationship with the victim led to several incidents between the two women during the months leading up to the victim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The last of these incidents occurred the night before the victim\u2019s death when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the victim used a baseball bat to smash the glass out of a side window of Auger\u2019s car while it was parked at Joker\u2019s Cafe, a local bar in Dayville.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Although the defendant was with Auger inside the bar when this incident occurred, he had been with the victim earlier that day. At approximately 4 a.m. on April 7, 2001, the victim\u2019s mother, Patricia Ross, and her boyfriend, Peter Ouellette, were awakened by screaming and crying coming from the victim\u2019s adjacent bedroom. Upon entering the victim\u2019s bedroom, Ouellette noticed that the victim was standing by the door crying, while the defendant was kneeling by the window with his handgun nearby on the windowsill. After assuring Patricia Ross that everything was all right, the victim drove the defendant to his apartment. The defendant spent the rest of the early morning hours at his apartment with Auger. After work that day, Auger returned to her home, where she resided with her father, stepmother and sister, and called the defendant. A few minutes later, the defendant returned her call from outside her home. When the defendant got into Auger\u2019s car with her, he displayed his handgun and asked her to put it in her house, which Auger did. After eating dinner at the defendant\u2019s apartment, the two proceeded to Joker\u2019s Cafe.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Upon discovering the broken window in her car, Auger suspected the victim of having smashed it. After assuring Auger that he would take care of it, the defendant returned with Auger to her home, where she retrieved the defendant\u2019s handgun at his request. The two then proceeded to a location near the victim\u2019s neighborhood, where the defendant exited the car, taking his handgun with him. After waiting in her car for approximately thirty minutes, Auger attempted to reach the defendant on his cellular telephone before driving around to look for him. Auger located the defendant standing on the sidewalk next to the victim\u2019s house. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>After the two returned to the defendant\u2019s apartment, the defendant told Auger that he was going to shoot the victim in the head, smash out a window in her car or have a friend, Tyrus Hines, steal her car. Auger remained at the defendant\u2019s apartment that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The next day, April 8,2001, after taking the defendant to the residence of Amanda Cahoon, the mother of the defendant\u2019s daughter, Auger returned to her home, where she did the defendant\u2019s laundry. Meanwhile, the defendant placed ten separate telephone calls to the victim. He placed the first telephone call at 12:38 p.m.; he placed the last telephone call at 5:42 p.m. The defendant met with the victim sometime after placing the last telephone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The defendant called Auger sometime between 7:30 and 8 p.m. that night to request that she pick him up on Wrights Crossing Road, near the home of a friend of hers. When Auger picked him up, the defendant instructed her to drive down Holmes Road, a dirt road that intersects Wrights Crossing Road. While driving down Holmes Road, Auger observed the victim\u2019s car on the side of the road. The defendant directed Auger to drive past the victim\u2019s car, turn around in a driveway up the road, and drive past the car a second time. Auger noticed that the headlights and interior lights in the victim\u2019s car were on, and that the driver\u2019s side window had been broken; she did not see anyone in the car. The defendant told Auger, after she had driven by the car the second time, that \u201cit\u201d was taken care of.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Auger then drove the defendant back to his apartment, where, upon arrival, she observed a blood spot on his shirt. The defendant removed his blue jeans, white shirt and gray boots and placed them on the kitchen floor while he showered. After he showered, he gathered the clothing from the kitchen floor and placed it in a black garbage bag. As the defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Auger were returning to Auger\u2019s car, the defendant also placed in the garbage bag the gray jacket that he had been wearing when Auger picked him up.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">As directed by the defendant, Auger then drove to a dirt turnaround on Litchfield Avenue in Killingly. The defendant removed from the car the garbage bag containing his clothes, walked a short distance into a wooded area and set fire to the garbage bag.1 *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Auger waited for the defendant to return to the car, then drove him to the Burger King in Dayville. The defendant remained at the Burger King, and Auger returned home.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Meanwhile, Gary Kazmer and Jennifer Simoniello were traveling on Holmes Road at approximately 8 p.m. when they noticed the victim\u2019s car on the side of the road, approximately 0.3 miles from the intersection with Wrights Crossing Road. The driver\u2019s side tires of the car were on the road, while the passenger\u2019s side tires were off the road in swamp-like water. As Kazmer and Simoniello passed the car, they saw that the headlights and interior lights were on, and that the driver\u2019s side window had been broken. They did not see anyone in the vehicle. Rather than stopping to investigate, Kazmer and Simoniello proceeded to a home on Wrights Crossing Road, where Simoniello requested to use the telephone. Simoniello placed the initial 911 call at 8:06 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The residents of the home, Jennifer Rosen and Douglas Rosen, then decided to drive to the location of the victim\u2019s car. Upon arrival at the scene, they noticed that the engine was running, the windshield wipers, headlights and interior lights were all on, the driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>side window had a hole in it and the glass was shattered, and the passenger\u2019s side door was open. They also saw the unresponsive victim seated in the driver\u2019s seat and laying over to the right in the passenger\u2019s seat. The Rosens placed a second 911 call at 8:23 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">While the Rosens were still at the scene, Laurie Blanchette and Mark Racine stopped and observed the same circumstances. Blanchette and Racine donned gloves and attempted to determine if the victim was alive. After being unable to detect a pulse and noting that the victim was not breathing, Blanchette and Racine placed a third 911 call at 8:29 p.m. When Daniel Bavosi, a state police trooper, arrived at the scene at 8:34 p.m., he noted that the victim had been shot and had no pulse.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The forensic evidence revealed that the victim had sustained three gunshot wounds. She first had been shot in the right side of her face, by her nose, from a distance of two to four inches, while driving her car in an easterly direction on Holmes Road. After she had moved slightly forward and to the left, the second shot had entered the back of her head and had come to rest in her brain. Once the vehicle had rolled to a stop in the swampy water, she had fallen to her right over the center console. The shooter then had exited the passenger\u2019s side of the vehicle and had attempted to open the driver\u2019s side door, which had been locked. The third shot had been fired through the driver\u2019s side window into the victim\u2019s back, and the bullet had come to rest in the victim\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">At 9:28 p.m., as Richard Woods, a state police trooper, was preparing to set up a checkpoint near the intersection of Wrights Crossing Road and Holmes Road, he pursued and stopped a car occupied by Robert Thoren, Audrea Beauregard and the defendant. The defendant had met Thoren and Beauregard at the Burger King in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Dayville, where Auger had left him, and had asked them for a ride. The defendant had then directed them to Wrights Crossing Road. On the way to Wrights Crossing Road, Beauregard had overheard the defendant say, \u201c T have to find my gun.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Woods wrote down the names of all three vehicle occupants and permitted them to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Thoren then drove the defendant to Putnam and dropped him off. The defendant called Auger from Putnam, and she picked him up and took him to his apartment before going to a friend\u2019s apartment in Willimantic for the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Sometime after midnight, Frank Paparelli, a state police trooper who was driving near the defendant\u2019s apartment and had been advised at roll call that the police wanted to question the defendant, observed the defendant. Upon seeing Paparelli, the defendant proceeded into his apartment and began playing loud music. The defendant initially refused to respond when police officers attempted to speak with him but eventually allowed Sergeant John Turner and Detective Richard Bedard of the state police into his apartment at approximately 2:30 a.m., after calling Auger to find out if she knew why the police were outside his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The officers informed the defendant that the victim\u2019s body had been found and questioned him about his whereabouts that day. When the officers began confronting the defendant about inconsistencies in his story, he terminated the interview and, at approximately 3:30 a.m., he left with Cahoon, whom he had called earlier. Cahoon dropped him off in Putnam.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">At approximately 5:45 a.m. on April 9, 2001, state police Detectives Charles Sarant and David LeBlanc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>proceeded to Auger\u2019s home to interview her. Auger\u2019s father informed the detectives that she was not at the residence. He then called her workplace to inform her that the two detectives were at the home and would like to interview her. Auger told him that she would leave work and return home to speak with the detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Before leaving work, Auger called the defendant to notify him that the detectives were at her house. The defendant responded that he was coming to her workplace. As Auger started to drive away from her workplace, she saw the defendant arrive in a vehicle driven by an unknown female. The defendant got into Auger\u2019s car and prevented her from going home by repeatedly shifting the transmission to \u201cpark.\u201d The defendant proceeded to hit Auger in the head several times and to choke her. He also told her not to leave his side when she spoke with the detectives. Approximately thirty minutes after telling her father that she would return home, Auger called her father from a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts in Brooklyn to say that she could not come home. When Auger\u2019s father notified the two detectives of her location, they proceeded to the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Upon their arrival at the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, the detectives observed that Auger was in her car with the defendant. When they approached the car and identified themselves as detectives, Auger got out of the car. She told Sarant that she was willing to speak with him, but that the defendant was acting crazy and had choked her. Meanwhile, the defendant was yelling for Auger to get back into the car and that she did not have to speak to the detectives. LeBlanc informed the defendant that he was interfering with an investigation and was going to be placed under arrest. LeBlanc then attempted to remove the defendant from the vehicle, at which time the defendant began fighting with him. While Sarant assisted LeBlanc in trying to subdue the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Auger returned to her car and drove away. The detectives eventually subdued the defendant, sustaining some abrasions and bruising in the process; the defendant sustained a laceration to the top of his head that required stitches.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The state filed charges against the defendant in two separate amended informations that were joined for trial. The first information contained one count of murder associated with the death of the victim. The second information contained two counts of assault of a peace officer associated with the defendant\u2019s altercation with Sarant and LeBlanc, and one count of intimidating a witness associated with the defendant\u2019s actions with respect to Auger on the day after the murder. The defendant was tried before a jury and found guilty on all of the charges. The trial court sentenced the defendant to imprisonment for life for the murder conviction, two consecutive terms of five years imprisonment for the convictions for assault of a peace officer, and a consecutive term of five years imprisonment for the conviction for intimidating a witness. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">HEAESAY STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The defendant, on appeal, first claims that the trial court improperly admitted testimony from five separate witnesses concerning statements made by the victim to the effect that she feared the defendant. The defendant argues that the admission of each statement constitutes an independent basis for reversal of his conviction under two separate, but related, theories: (1) the admission of the statements violated certain evidentiary rules codified in the Connecticut Code of Evidence; and (2) the admission of the statements violated the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>federal constitutional right<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to confront the witnesses against him under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Evidentiary Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">We first address the defendant\u2019s evidentiary claims. The defendant contends that each witness\u2019 testimony concerning the victim\u2019s statements was inadmissible hearsay because it failed to satisfy one or more of the requirements of the exception for statements of the declarant\u2019s state of mind. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\u201c[A]n out-of-court statement that is offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted is inadmissible hearsay unless the statement falls within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. . . . One such exception provides that statements expressing a declarant\u2019s present state of mind may be offered for the truth of the matter asserted, if relevant.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dehaney, </em>261 Conn. 336, 355-56, 803 A.2d 267 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1217, 123 S. Ct. 1318, 154 L. Ed. 2d 1070 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Evidence is relevant when it has a logical tendency to aid the trier of fact in deciding an issue that is material to the determination of the proceeding. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargo, </em>255 Conn. 113, 123-24, 763 A.2d 1 (2000); Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-1. It is well established in our jurisprudence that, where a marital or romantic relationship existed between a homicide victim and the defendant, evidence of the victim\u2019s fear of the defendant suggests a deterioration of that relationship, which is relevant to the issues of motive and intent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>210 Conn. 481, 502, 556 A.2d 154 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>205 Conn. 279, 285-86, 533 A.2d 553 (1987). This view finds support in the case law of multiple jurisdictions as well as common experience. See <em>Gattis </em>v. <em>State, </em>637 A.2d 808, 818 (Del.) (\u201c[i]n a prosecution for homicide arising out of a marital or romantic relationship, evidence of previous discord between the victim and the defendant is clearly material to issues of motive and intent\u201d), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 843, 115 S. Ct. 132, 130 L. Ed. 2d 75 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borodine, </em>371 Mass. 1, 8, 353 N.E.2d 649 (1976) (\u201c[ejvidence of a poor marital relationship between a victim and a defendant is admissible to show the defendant\u2019s motive for the murder of his spouse\u201d), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1049, 97 S. Ct. 760, 50 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1977); <em>People </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>449 Mich. 441, 453, 537 N.W.2d 577 (1995) (\u201c[i]n fact, numerous prior cases have upheld the admissibility of evidence showing marital discord as a motive for murder, or as circumstantial evidence of premeditation and deliberation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In addition to being relevant to prove the state\u2019s theory of the case, evidence that a homicide victim feared the defendant may also be relevant to rebut the defense\u2019s theory of the case. \u201cA defendant\u2019s articulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>or implied theory of defense may make the victim\u2019s state of mind material to the determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. . . . Indeed . . . this court has not limited the use of the victim\u2019s state of mind to affirmative defenses recognized by law, such as self-defense or suicide .... Rather, we have permitted] its use to rebut <em>theories </em>of defense, such as a claim of innocence. . . . Moreover, we have approved the use of testimony about a victim\u2019s expressions of fear of the accused when such evidence helps to rebut aspects of [an] asserted defense.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargo, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 139 n.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded by the trial court if the court determines that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value. ... Of course, [a]ll adverse evidence is damaging to one\u2019s case, but it is inadmissible only if it creates undue prejudice so that it threatens an injustice were it to be admitted. . . . The test for determining whether evidence is unduly prejudicial is not whether it is damaging to the defendant but whether it will improperly arouse the emotions of the jury. . . . The trial court . . . must determine whether the adverse impact of the challenged evidence outweighs its probative value. . . . We acknowledge the heightened potential for prejudice in cases such as this, in which the evidence considered is from the voice of the victim. As we have recognized, a real risk of prejudice exists in allowing surrogates to speak for the victim pointing back from the grave. . . . Because of that risk, trial courts must take special care in evaluating the relevance of such evidence and in weighing its probative value and prejudicial effect.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dehaney, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 357-58. \u201c[B]ecause of the difficulties inherent in this balancing process [however] . . . every reasonable presumption should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. . . . Reversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">With these principles in mind, we now turn to the challenged evidence in the present case. Although the defendant relies on some of the same arguments in challenging each witness\u2019 testimony, other arguments are sufficiently distinct to warrant consideration of each challenge on an individual basis. Accordingly, we consider the testimony of each witness in turn in light of the applicable standard of review for evidentiary claims. \u201cUnless an evidentiary ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, [t]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling .... Moreover, evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>272 Conn. 798, 811, 865 A.2d 1135 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Testimony of Patricia Ross</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">We first consider the testimony of Patricia Ross. Prior to Ross\u2019 testimony, the defendant requested that the trial court instruct the state to avoid certain incidents of the defendant\u2019s bad conduct, especially where those incidents required hearsay testimony from the witness. The state responded that it did not intend to ask Ross about those incidents, but that it did \u201cintend to elicit from [Ross] statements by the victim . . . that she was afraid of the defendant and that she was afraid the defendant was going to kill her. That is relevant. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>shows her state of mind.\u201d In response, the defendant argued that the testimony would be unduly prejudicial. The trial court ruled that it would permit evidence of the victim\u2019s state of mind as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule but would not permit collateral facts that supported the state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">On the stand, Ross testified that, upon returning home from driving the defendant to his apartment on the morning preceding the day the victim was murdered, she appeared \u201c[s]cared, upset.\u201d When the state attempted to elicit what the victim had said with respect to why she was afraid, the defendant objected to the question as calling for hearsay. After the trial court indicated that it had already ruled on the objection and would allow the testimony, Ross stated that the victim had said, \u201c \u2018[m]om, I\u2019m afraid he was going to kill me.\u2019 \u201d Ross further testified that she understood the victim to be referring to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The defendant argues that the trial court improperly admitted Ross\u2019 testimony under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule for the following reasons: (1) the victim\u2019s use of \u201cwas\u201d indicates that the statement did not evince a <em>then existing </em>state of mind; (2) the statement referred to facts or events and included the reasons for the state of mind because it referred to the incident earlier that morning between the victim and the defendant; (3) the statement was not a natural expression of the victim\u2019s condition because Ross initiated the conversation; (4) the statement was not introduced exclusively for the victim\u2019s state of mind because that state of mind did not affect her actions; (5) the victim\u2019s fear of the defendant was irrelevant to the case because it did not relate to any defense claim or provide context to any relevant action of the victim; and (6) admission was more prejudicial to the defendant than probative of any relevant issue. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>It was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to conclude that the victim\u2019s statement referred to her then existing state of mind, especially in light of Ross\u2019 own observation that the victim appeared \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cupset\u201d when the statement was made. Moreover, although the state of mind exception does not encompass statements pointing to acts of another as the cause of the declarant\u2019s state of mind; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dehaney, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 359-60; the victim\u2019s statement, \u201c[m]om, I\u2019m afraid he was going to kill me,\u201d contains no reference to an act of the defendant or the cause of the victim\u2019s fear. The prohibition against the declarant\u2019s statement containing the cause of her state of mind does not preclude admissibility of that statement under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule just because the party offering the statement previously offered evidence that would induce that state of mind. In other words, Ross\u2019 testimony concerning the victim\u2019s statement was not made inadmissible by Ross\u2019 previous testimony concerning what she witnessed in the victim\u2019s bedroom earlier that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Nor was the statement inadmissible because Ross initiated the conversation. Generally, to be admissible, an out-of-court statement introduced to establish the declarant\u2019s state of mind must be \u201cmade in a natural manner, in apparent good faith and without reason for fabrication . . . [and] offered exclusively as evidence of the declarant\u2019s state of mind.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bova, </em>240 Conn. 210, 238, 690 A.2d 1370 (1997). Nothing in Ross\u2019 testimony suggests that the victim\u2019s statement was not made in a natural manner during a conversation between a mother and a daughter, regardless of which of the participants initiated the conversation. The state indicated that the evidence was offered to show the victim\u2019s state of mind, namely, fear of the defendant. No requirement exists that the state prove actions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the part of the victim in conformity with that state of mind as long as it is relevant to some issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">As stated previously in this opinion, we have consistently held that evidence of deterioration in a marital or romantic relationship, such as a victim\u2019s fear of the defendant, is relevant to motive and intent in a homicide prosecution and may be relevant to rebut the defense\u2019s theory of the case. In the present case, the victim\u2019s expressions of fear of the defendant were relevant to show the deterioration in their romantic relationship. The defendant contends that the victim\u2019s fear was not relevant to motive because her statement was not made in the defendant\u2019s presence, nor was there obvious evidence of a deteriorated relationship. The defendant also contends that the state did not argue the deterioration in the relationship as the defendant\u2019s motive for murdering the victim; rather, the state argued that the defendant\u2019s motive was control. We conclude that the jury properly could have inferred that the defendant was aware that the relationship had deteriorated from the victim\u2019s multiple expressions of fear and other evidence that the relationship had deteriorated, namely, the argument between the two less than forty-eight hours before the homicide and the defendant\u2019s statement to Auger that he would shoot the victim in the head, and that the defendant\u2019s resulting fear that he would lose the ability to control the victim provided his motive to commit the murder. Moreover, one of the defendant\u2019s implied theories of defense was that it was Auger, not he, who had the motive to kill the victim. This made evidence of the victim\u2019s fear relevant. Considering the probative value of this evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that the evidence was more probative than prejudicial. Finally, any potential prejudice was mitigated by the trial court\u2019s limiting instructions to the jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Testimony of Jeffrey Dailey</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We next consider the testimony of Jeffrey Dailey, the defendant\u2019s cousin and a friend of the victim. During direct examination of Dailey, the state asked, \u201cDid [the victim] ever say anything to you about being scared at all?\u201d The defendant objected to the question as calling for hearsay. The state maintained that the state of mind exception applied, and the trial court overruled the objection. The following exchange then took place between the state and Dailey:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\u201cQ. Did [the victim] indicate to you anything about being scared in the past when you knew her?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">\u201cA. Yeah, she said it one time. Just once.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">\u201cQ. What did she say?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">\u201cA. She just said that she was afra\u2014you know, I mean, she didn\u2019t\u2014she was just afraid of how he was acting. You know what I mean? Once in a while.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">\u201cQ. Of who?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">\u201cA. How [the defendant] was acting once in a while.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">The defendant argues that the trial court improperly admitted Dailey\u2019s testimony under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule for the following reasons: (1) the statement \u201cwas about facts or events\u201d; (2) the statement contained \u201cthe cause or reason for the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>of mind\u201d; (3) the statement was not presented exclusively as evidence of the victim\u2019s state of mind because, although it \u201ctouched on\u201d the victim\u2019s state of mind, it also established that the defendant did something to cause her to be fearful; (4) the victim\u2019s state of mind was irrelevant to any material issue in the case; and (5) the evidence was more prejudicial than probative.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Dailey\u2019s testimony that the victim stated that \u201cshe was just afraid of how he was acting,\u201d contains no reference to specific facts or events involving the defendant that caused the victim\u2019s state of mind. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Dehaney, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 359, we concluded that those portions of an affidavit filed by the homicide victim in support of her request for an ex parte restraining order against the defendant that referred to specific acts of alleged prior misconduct by the defendant were inadmissible \u201cbecause they [were] statements] of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The inadmissible portion of the affidavit included statements such as, \u201cI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ana physically abused at least once a month and verbally abused daily\u201d; id., 353; and \u201c[a]t least once a month, my husband starts fights with me.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In the present case, Dailey\u2019s testimony contains no such statements of memory or belief by the victim, nor does the victim\u2019s statement refer to any specific act of the defendant that caused her to be fearful. Thus, the defendant\u2019s argument that the statement was not offered exclusively for the victim\u2019s state of mind also fails. The defendant\u2019s remaining arguments fail for the reasons discussed in part IA1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Testimony of Tia Daviau</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">We next consider the testimony of Tia Daviau, a coworker of the victim. During direct examination of Daviau, the state attempted to elicit what the victim had told Daviau, during conversations between the two in the three weeks prior to the victim\u2019s death, about how she felt about the defendant. The defendant objected to the line of inquiry several times on relevance and hearsay grounds. The state countered that the testimony was relevant and fell under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, and that it had \u201cbeen argued and ruled on before by the court.\u201d After the trial court overruled the objection, Daviau testified that \u201c[the victim] was frighten of [the defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">The defendant argues that the trial court improperly admitted Daviau\u2019s testimony under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule because the state\u2019s question was not limited exclusively to the victim\u2019s state of mind; rather, it referred to how the victim felt about the defendant. The defendant also argues that the evidence was irrelevant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Daviau\u2019s response to the state\u2019s question went directly to the state of mind of the victim, namely, fear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>of the defendant. The evidence was offered to establish that state of mind. As discussed in part I A 1 of this opinion, the victim\u2019s fear of the defendant tended to show a deterioration in the relationship and to rebut the defendant\u2019s implied theory of defense, which were relevant to the issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Testimony of Peter Ouellette</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">We next consider the testimony of Peter Ouellette, the boyfriend of the victim\u2019s mother at the time of the murder. During the state\u2019s direct examination of Ouellette, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">\u201cQ. And the few weeks prior to [the victim] being murdered, did she ever express to you her state of mind towards the defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">\u201cQ. What did she tell you?</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">\u201cA. That sometimes she was afraid when she was around him.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">\u201cQ. Excuse me.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">\u201cA. That she was afraid when she was around him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">The defendant did not object to this testimony at the time it was offered but did request that it be stricken in his motion to strike and for a curative instruction. See footnote 10 of this opinion. The defendant argues that the trial court improperly admitted Ouellette\u2019s testimony because: (1) doubt exists as to whether the victim expressed a present state of mind; (2) the testimony failed to describe a constant state of mind; (3) the victim\u2019s state of mind was not relevant; and (4) the evidence was more prejudicial than probative. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The defendant contends that the lack of an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the victim\u2019s statements, in conjunction with Ouellette\u2019s testimony that the victim experienced fear \u201csometimes\u201d and \u201cwhen she was around [the defendant],\u201d makes it questionable whether the victim expressed a present state of mind. Although the wording of Ouellette\u2019s testimony may raise doubts as to whether the victim expressed a present state of mind, we cannot say that it was a clear abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine that she had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The defendant also contends that, because the only value of the victim\u2019s state of mind was to explain the victim\u2019s actions or motives, testimony that she was afraid only \u201csometimes\u201d or only \u201cwhen she was around [the defendant],\u201d was irrelevant because her state of mind was not constant. As explained in part I A 1 of this opinion, however, the evidence was relevant to explain the defendant\u2019s motive and to rebut the defendant\u2019s defense, regardless of whether it helped explain the victim\u2019s actions or motives. The defendant\u2019s argument that the evidence was more prejudicial than probative also fails for the reasons explained in part IA 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">5</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Testimony of Tyras Hines</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Finally, we consider the testimony of Tyras Hines, a friend of both the victim and the defendant. The defendant challenges the admissibility of two separate portions of Hines\u2019 testimony. First, the defendant challenges portions of the following exchange between the state and Hines:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">\u201cQ. Did [the victim] state to you in the time leading up to her murder her state of mind regarding [the defendant]?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u201cA. Not really. She just\u2014basically, she was\u2014she wanted to get away from him, like. She ain\u2019t want to be around him, be with him no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u201cQ. Did she say why she needed to do that? What her state of mind was?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u201cA. Why she needed to do it? She never really said why. She just\u2014they was arguin\u2019, fightin\u2019, I guess.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u201cQ. I can\u2019t hear you, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\u201cA. They were arguin\u2019, fightin\u2019, I guess. Arguing a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">To refresh his recollection, Hines was then shown a copy of a statement he had given the police. Afterwards, the following exchange occurred between the state and Hines:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">\u201cQ. Does that refresh your recollection about what [the victim] said to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">\u201cA. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">\u201cQ. What did she say to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">\u201cA. She said\u2014at what point? Basically, she was scared.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">\u201cQ. How does she describe her being scared? What was she scared of?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-16\">\u201cA. Of [the defendant] killin\u2019 her mother and brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-17\">\u201cQ. Excuse me.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-18\">\u201cA. Of [the defendant]. She was scared of [the defendant].</p>\n<p id=\"b250-19\">\u201cQ. [The defendant] doing what?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-20\">\u201cA. Killin\u2019 her, her mother or brother, or even her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-21\">The defendant did not object to this testimony at the time it was offered but did request that it be stricken in his motion to strike and for a curative instruction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>See footnote 10 of this opinion. The defendant argues that the trial court improperly admitted the evidence for the following reasons: (1) the testimony stated the reason for the victim\u2019s state of mind; (2) the declaration was a reference to past events and was an implied accusation of the defendant; (3) the victim\u2019s fear was irrelevant; and (4) the evidence was more prejudicial than probative. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The defendant contends that the state improperly asked for the reason that the victim wanted to get away from the defendant, and that Hines\u2019 response that \u201cthey was arguin,\u2019 fightin,\u2019 I guess,\u201d improperly supplied that reason. In light of Hines\u2019 statement that \u201c[s]he never really said why\u201d immediately preceding that response, however, it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to conclude that the challenged response was nothing more than speculation on Hines\u2019 part, rather than a statement made by the victim. The defendant also contends that the state asked for the reason for the victim\u2019s state of mind by asking \u201cWhat was [the victim] scared of?\u201d The state\u2019s question was not, \u201cwhy was the victim scared, \u201d which would have been a request for the reason for the victim\u2019s state of mind. Furthermore, the witness\u2019 response did not refer to any specific act of the defendant as the reason for the victim\u2019s fear. See part I A 2 of this opinion. Nor can we discern any reference to past events or an implied accusation of the defendant in the statements of the victim. The evidence was relevant and more probative than prejudicial for the reasons explained in part I A 1 of this opinion. Although the defendant now refers to Hines\u2019 testimony as \u201cshocking,\u201d his failure to object at the time the testimony was offered leaves us with the impression that the testimony was less shocking than the defendant would have us now believe. Certainly, it was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion to refuse to strike the testimony when the defendant subsequently requested that it do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>The defendant also challenges the admissibility of two voice mail messages left on Hines\u2019 cellular telephone by the victim on the day she was murdered. The messages were introduced, as follows, during Hines\u2019 testimony in both voice and transcript form:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u201cElizabeth, um, give me a call, I\u2019m at my house now. Um, cause I\u2019ve got to leave here soon or something, because I don\u2019t trust him. He keeps calling me trying to find out where the fuck I\u2019m at, so give me a call like as soon as you can. Bye.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u201cTyrus, it\u2019s Elizabeth, give me a call as soon as possible. I\u2019m trying to get ahold of you and you\u2019re not picking up your phone, um? This little shit is go\u2019n on. I can\u2019t even, I\u2019m like not at my house right now because I can\u2019t be at my house right now, so give me a call when you get this message.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">When the state initially offered the voice recording into evidence, the defendant objected as follows: \u201cYour Honor, no probative value whatsoever. Not relevant. Got nothing at all to do with anything that my client may or may not have done. It\u2019s the victim\u2019s phone calls to Mr. Hines. My client is not identified. There\u2019s a reference to \u2018him.\u2019 There\u2019s a reference that she can\u2019t hang out at her house. . . . There\u2019s a reference to \u2018him\u2019 or \u2018he\u2019 and a reference to the fact that she can\u2019t hang out at her own house. Nothing tying my client to anything. I would object based on relevance and lack of probative value.\u201d After the state responded that the victim\u2019s state of mind could be inferred from her statements and was relevant, the trial court admitted the recording into evidence with the instruction that it was \u201coffered to show the state of mind of the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The defendant argues that the trial court improperly admitted the evidence for the following reasons: (1) the messages contained facts and events; (2) the messages contained the reason for the victim\u2019s state of mind; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the evidence was not offered exclusively to show the victim\u2019s state of mind; (4) the victim\u2019s state of mind was irrelevant; and (5) the evidence was more prejudicial than probative. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The defendant contends that the victim\u2019s references to being at her home and to the defendant\u2019s repeated telephone calls in the first message and to \u201c[t]his little shit . . . go\u2019n on\u201d in the second message make the messages inadmissible under our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dehaney, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 359. The defendant misinterprets the holding in <em>Dehaney. </em>As discussed in part I A 2 of this opinion, we concluded that the statements of facts and events in the <em>Dehaney </em>affidavit were inadmissible because they \u201creferred ... to specific acts of alleged prior misconduct by the defendant.\u201d Id. The messages in the present case do not refer to similar acts on the part of this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The defendant\u2019s arguments concerning exclusivity and relevance are consistent with the arguments he made with respect to Ross\u2019 testimony, and we reject those arguments for the same reasons discussed in part IA 1 of this opinion. The defendant also contends that this evidence was particularly prejudicial because the recordings were of the victim\u2019s voice only hours before her death, resulting in a greater emotional impact on the jury. The trial court had the opportunity to hear the voice messages and to gauge their emotional impact on the jury. We cannot say that it was an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine that the evidence was more probative than prejudicial in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Constitutional Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">We next address the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims. The defendant contends that the testimony concerning the victim\u2019s statements violated the confronta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tion clause of the sixth amendment because it lacked \u201c \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980), overruled in part, <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004). We conclude that, because the testimony fell under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, which is a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d exception under federal law, admission of the testimony was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The conclusion that evidence is admissible under a hearsay exception does not preclude the possibility, in a criminal trial, that the same evidence will be inadmissible under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment. The confrontation clause limits the state\u2019s use of hearsay evidence against a criminal defendant at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>supra, 272 Conn. 812. Although \u201cthe confrontation clause does not erect a per se bar to the admission of hearsay statements against criminal defendants . . . [it] bars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule. \u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 812-13. Hearsay evidence satisfies the confrontation clause\u2019s strictures for admissibility if \u201c(1) the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or (2) it contains particularized guarantees of trustworthiness such that adversarial testing would be expected to add little, if anything, to the statements\u2019 reliability.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 124-25, 119 S. Ct. 1887, 144 L. Ed. 2d 117 (1999), quoting <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 66.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>State law governs whether evidence falls within an exception to the hearsay rule, but federal law governs whether that exception is \u201c \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 \u201d for confrontation clause purposes. <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 125. Because we concluded, in part I A of this opinion, that the victim\u2019s statements fell within the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, we now examine federal law to determine whether that exception is \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d for confrontation clause purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has not yet considered whether the state of mind exception is \u201cfirmly rooted.\u201d Therefore, in order to identify the relevant factors for consideration, we examine those instances where it has made that determination for other hearsay exceptions. In general, an exception to the hearsay rule qualifies \u201cas firmly rooted if, in light of longstanding judicial and legislative experience ... it rest[s] [on] such [a] solid foundatiofn] that admission of virtually any evidence within [it] comports with the substance of the constitutional protection.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 126. In determining whether a hearsay exception is \u201cfirmly rooted,\u201d the Supreme Court has considered the following factors: (1) the length of time the exception has been recognized;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (2) whether it has been incorporated in the Federal Rules of Evidence;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and (3) its acceptance among the states.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Applying these factors to the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, we conclude that it is \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d for confrontation clause purposes. The state of mind exception has been recognized by the Supreme Court since its decision in <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hillmon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>145 U.S. 285, 295-96, 12 S. Ct. 909, 36 L. Ed. 706 (1892), more than one century ago. Moreover, the exception has been codified as rule 803 (4) of the Federal Rules of Evidence and \u201cexists in every jurisdiction in the country, whether by statute, court rule, or common law tradition.\u201d <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>York, </em>311 F.3d 321, 325 (4th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 979, 123 S. Ct. 1803, 155 L. Ed. 2d 669 (2003). Not surprisingly, every federal circuit that has considered the issue, including the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> has concluded that the state of mind exception is \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d for confrontation clause purposes. See, e.g., <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>370 F.3d 75, 85 (1st Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1093, 125 S. Ct. 971, 160 L. Ed. 2d 905 (2005); <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>York, </em>supra, 326; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>153 F.3d 1086, 1107 (10th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1025, 119 S. Ct. 1266, 143 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1999); <em>Terrovona </em>v. <em>Kincheloe, </em>852 F.2d 424, 427 (9th Cir. 1988); <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>731 F.2d 1073, 1075 (2d Cir. 1984); <em>Lenza </em>v. <em>Wyrick, </em>665 F.2d 804, 811 (8th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The defendant asserts that we should assess the evidence in the present case against the <em>Roberts </em>standard of \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d; <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 66; because the state of mind exception, as applied to declarations made by the victim in a homicide case, is not \u201cfirmly rooted.\u201d That application of the exception, he argues, has not enjoyed consistent admissibility and has been examined on a case-by-case basis since the Supreme Court restricted its use in <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>290 U.S. 96, 54 S. Ct. 22, 78 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1933), due to its high probability for prejudice. He also claims that because the exception finds application in a wide range of case types, including probate, civil and criminal cases, it is like the hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>exception for admissions against penal interest, which \u201cdefines too large a class for meaningful [c]onfrontation [cjlause analysis.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 127. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In <em>Shepard, </em>the victim\u2019s husband was convicted of murder after the victim\u2019s nurse had testified that the victim, then ill in bed, had stated, \u201c \u2018Dr. Shepard has poisoned me.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 290 U.S. 98. After concluding that the statement was not a dying declaration, the Supreme Court turned to the question of whether the evidence was admissible as indicative of a state of mind inconsistent with suicidal intent to rebut evidence proffered by the defendant that the victim had contemplated suicide. Id., 102. Although the court commented on the potential for prejudice of the evidence; id., 104 (\u201c[t]he reverberating clang of those accusatory words would drown all weaker sounds\u201d); it did not rule that the evidence was inadmissible on that basis, as suggested by the defendant, nor did it restrict the use of the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule as applied to declarations made by the victim in a homicide case. Rather, because the victim\u2019s statement faced backward and referred to someone else\u2019s actions, the court rejected the argument that the evidence fell under the state of mind exception. Thus, the case is inapposite to whether the state of mind exception is \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d other than as further evidence of the Supreme Court\u2019s consistent recognition of the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The defendant\u2019s second argument is similarly flawed. In <em>Lilly, </em>the Supreme Court did not conclude that, in order to perform a meaningful confrontation clause analysis, it had to break down the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest into the three principal situations where such statements are offered into evidence because they are offered in a wide range of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>case types. In fact, the court focused solely on admission of such statements in criminal trials. <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 127. Hearsay exceptions in federal cases are not limited to distinct case types.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, acceptance of the defendant\u2019s argument would prevent any hearsay exception from being \u201cfirmly rooted.\u201d Such a result does not correspond with previous United States Supreme Court jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">JURY CHARGE ON INTENT</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erroneously charged the jury concerning the intent element of the murder charge. Specifically, the defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction violated his constitutional right to due process by establishing a mandatory presumption that improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant and also violated this court\u2019s mandate in <em>State </em>v. <em>Aponte, </em>259 Conn. 512, 522, 790 A.2d 457 (2002), pursuant to our supervisory authority over the administration of justice, that the trial courts of this state should refrain from using the challenged jury instruction. Because the defendant failed to preserve this claim at trial, he urges us to review the constitutional argument under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the plain error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>doctrine,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and under our supervisory authority. The defendant cannot prevail under <em>Golding, </em>and, although the challenged instruction violated this court\u2019s direction in <em>Aponte, </em>we disagree that the violation warrants reversal under either the plain error doctrine or this court\u2019s supervisory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Constitutional Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">We first address the defendant\u2019s constitutional argument. Our conclusion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Aponte, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 522, is dispositive of this argument. In <em>Aponte, </em>which was also a murder case, the defendant claimed that the following jury instruction violated his due process rights: \u201cAn intent to cause death may be inferred from circumstantial evidence such as the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading to it [and] immediately following death. One who uses a deadly weapon on the vital part of another will be deemed to have intended the probable result of that act [and] from such a circumstance a proper inference may be drawn that there was an intent to kill.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 519-20. The defendant argued that this language \u201cimpermissibly shifted to him the burden of proof regarding intent because the charge created a mandatory presumption that he had the intent to kill solely by virtue of his use of a deadly weapon.\u201d Id., 520. We concluded that the defendant\u2019s <em>Golding </em>challenge to the jury instruction failed because it did not satisfy the third prong, namely, that the constitutional violation clearly existed and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial. Id., 519. In reaching that conclusion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>we noted that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s instruction was qualified, both immediately preceding and following the challenged language, by its use of the permissive may. . . . We have determined previously that the inclusion of such permissive language tempers the challenged portion of the instruction and ensures that a reasonable jury will not interpret the charge in an unconstitutional manner.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The challenged jury instruction in the present case is virtually identical to that in <em>Aponte. </em>Accordingly, our reasoning in that case applies. In the present case, the trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cAn intent to cause death <em>may </em>be inferred from circumstantial evidence such as a type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted, and the events leading to it and immediately following the death. One who uses a deadly weapon on the vital part of another will be deemed to have intended the probable result of that act, and from such a circumstance a proper inference <em>may </em>be drawn that there was an intent to kill.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We can distinguish no substantial difference between the two jury instructions. Indeed, the defendant concedes \u201cthat the surrounding language in this case is nearly identical to that in <em>Aponte\u201d </em>but requests that we revisit our conclusion that the language satisfies constitutional requirements. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Plain Err or</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">We next address the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s contravention of this court\u2019s direction to discontinue use of the challenged jury instruction warrants reversal under plain error. \u201cThe plain error doctrine is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, for reasons of policy. . . . The plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. ... A party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>272 Conn. 432, 455-56, 862 A.2d 817 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The defendant fails to satisfy this difficult burden. We directed the trial courts to discontinue the use of the challenged instruction in <em>Aponte </em>because we were concerned that it \u201ccould give rise to a danger of juror misunderstanding.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Aponte, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 522. Nevertheless, we are not convinced that the potential danger of misunderstanding in the present case was so significant as to affect the fairness and integrity of or the public confidence in the proceeding, especially where intent was not a contested issue in the case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Supervisory Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Finally, we address the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s contravention of this court\u2019s direction to discontinue the use of the challenged jury instruction warrants reversal under our supervisory authority. \u201cHistorically, the exercise of this court\u2019s supervisory powers has been limited to the adoption of judicial procedures required for the fair administration of justice.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>265 Conn. 35, 61, 826 A.2d 1126 (2003). \u201cSupervisory powers are exercised to direct trial courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>to adopt judicial procedures that will address matters that are of utmost seriousness, not only for the integrity of a particular trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole. . . . [0]ur supervisory authority is not a form of free-floating justice, untethered to legal principle. . . . Rather, the integrity of the judicial system serves as a unifying principle behind the seemingly disparate use of our supervisory powers.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 61 n.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Accordingly, we exercise our supervisory authority sparingly and then, typically, only to provide procedural guidance; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Padua, </em>273 Conn. 138, 179, 869 A.2d 192 (2005) (reviewing court must address defendant\u2019s insufficiency of evidence claim if properly briefed and sufficient record exists); <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>261 Conn. 309, 329, 803 A.2d 287 (2002) (where defendant pleads not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, and state substantially agrees with defendant\u2019s claim of mental disease or defect, trial court must canvass defendant to ensure plea made voluntarily and with full understanding of consequences); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delvalle, </em>250 Conn. 466, 475-76, 736 A.2d 135 (1999) (trial courts should refrain from using \u201c \u2018ingenuity of counsel\u2019 \u201d language in jury charges); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>241 Conn. 1, 15, 695 A.2d 1022 (1997) (videotaped deposition testimony must be played under supervision of trial judge in open court and in presence of parties and counsel rather than in juiy room); not to address common claims of error. \u201cOur supervisory powers are not a last bastion of hope for every untenable appeal. They are an <em>extraordinary </em>remedy to be invoked only when circumstances are such that the issue at hand, while not rising to the level of a constitutional violation, is nonetheless of utmost seriousness, not only for the integrity of a particular trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole. ... In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>context, the supervisory powers serve a narrow purpose. In each case in which we have invoked our supervisory authority, we have acted to provide additional procedural safeguards for some salient aspect of the right to a trial before an impartial jury.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 815, 709 A.2d 522 (1998) .</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Accordingly, \u201cwe do not consider this an appropriate case for the exercise of our supervisory powers.\u201d Id., 814. The trial court\u2019s failure to heed our direction to discontinue the use of the challenged jury instruction was not such an extraordinary violation that it threatened the integrity of the trial, and it certainly did not rise to the level of implicating the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole. The defendant does not suggest that the trial court deliberately disregarded this court\u2019s mandate. Nor do we consider a new trial necessary to emphasize the importance of our direction in <em>Aponte </em>to the trial courts of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">JURY CHARGE ON THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court erroneously charged the jury concerning the presumption of innocence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Specifically, the defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction violated his constitutional right to due process by misleading the jury on its understanding of the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt standards and also violated this court\u2019s mandate in <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 175, 728 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999) , pursuant to our supervisory authority over the administration of justice, that the trial courts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>state should refrain from using the challenged jury instruction. Because the defendant failed to preserve this claim at trial, he seeks to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40; see footnote 17 of this opinion; the plain error doctrine; see footnote 18 of this opinion; and under our supervisory authority. The defendant cannot prevail under <em>Golding, </em>and, although the challenged instruction violated this court\u2019s direction in <em>Schiappa, </em>we disagree that the violation warrants reversal under either the plain error doctrine or this court\u2019s supervisory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Constitutional Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">We first address the defendant\u2019s constitutional argument. Our conclusion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 176, is dispositive of this argument. In <em>Schiappa, </em>a manslaughter case, the defendant claimed \u201cthat the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury that the principle requiring the state to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is a \u2018rule of law . . . made to protect the innocent and not the guilty\u2019 impermissibly undermined the presumption of innocence, thereby diluting the state\u2019s burden of proof,\u201d and, thus, violated her due process rights and her sixth amendment right to a jury trial. Id., 168. We concluded that the defendant\u2019s <em>Golding </em>challenge to the jury instruction failed because it did not satisfy the third prong, namely, that the constitutional violation clearly existed and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial. Id., 176-77. In reaching that conclusion, we noted that the sentences concerning the presumption of innocence that immediately proceeded and immediately followed the challenged instruction,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u201ctaken together with the court\u2019s repeated explanations of the presumption of innocence and the state\u2019s burden of proving the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, eliminated any reasonable likelihood of juror misunderstanding as to the state\u2019s burden and the proof necessaiy for a conviction.\u201d Id., 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The defendant concedes that this court has held consistently that language similar to that used in the present case does not violate the defendant\u2019s due process rights because of the clarity of other parts of the charge; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Delvalle, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 472; <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 172; <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>228 Conn. 118, 135, 635 A.2d 762 (1993); but suggests that, because we have stated our support for the holding in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>130 F.3d 523 (2d Cir. 1997), in <em>Schiappa </em>and subsequent cases, we should conclude that the same language in this jury charge did violate the defendant\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In <em>Schiappa, </em>we pointed out that \u201cthe court in <em>Doyle </em>expressly acknowledged that instructions correctly explaining the presumption of innocence and the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, when given repeatedly . . . can render a charge in its entirety adequate to avoid reversal, despite inclusion of the objectionable protect-the-innocent language. . . .

We directed the trial courts to discontinue use of the challenged instruction in <em>Schiappa </em>because \u201cwhen viewed in isolation, [it] gives rise to a danger of juror misunderstanding.\u201d Id., 175. Nevertheless, the challenged instruction was not offered in isolation, and we are not convinced that the potential danger of misunderstanding in the present case was so significant as to affect the fairness and integrity of or the public confidence in the proceeding, as required for reversal under the plain error doctrine.

In that motion, the defendant argued, inter alia, that the mental state of the victim was irrelevant. Following the verdict, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial in which he again raised the issue of the victim\u2019s statements and offered additional grounds for excluding the evidence not offered at trial or in the motion to strike and for curative instructions.

See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>[supra, 541 U.S. 36], In reaching its conclusion, the Supreme Court drew a distinction between testimonial hearsay statements and those deemed nontestimonial.

These classes include: (1) ex parte in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>court testimony or its functional equivalent; (2) extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials; and (3) statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statements would be available for use later at trial.

Although we have consistently included unavailability as a requirement in our references to the <em>Roberts </em>test in the past; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>supra, 272 Conn. 813; <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 158, 728 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S.

See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Inadi, </em>475 U.S. 387, 394, 106 S. Ct. 1121, 89 L. Ed. 2d 390 (1986) <em>(\u201cRoberts </em>must be read consistently with the question it answered, the authority it cited, and its own facts. All of these indicate that <em>Roberts </em>simply reaffirmed a longstanding rule, foreshadowed in <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400 [85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965)], established in <em>Barber </em>[v. <em>Page, </em>390 U.S. 719, 88 S. Ct. 1318, 20 L. Ed. 2d 255 (1968)], and refined in a line of cases up through <em>Roberts, </em>that applies unavailability analysis to prior testimony. <em>Roberts </em>cannot fairly be read to stand for the radical proposition <em>that no </em>out-of-court statement <em>can be </em>introduced by the government without a showing that the declarant is unavailable.\u201d); <em>White </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 354, 112 S.

Ed. 2d 848 (1992) (\u201c[s]o understood, <em>Roberts </em>stands for the proposition that unavailability analysis is a necessary part of the [c]onfrontation [c]lause inquiry only when the challenged out-of-court statements were made in the course of a prior judicial proceeding\u201d). Because unavailability is not an issue in the present case, we leave the question of when unavailability is required to satisfy the confrontation clause to a future case when it can be fully briefed by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\"> See <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 130 (statements against penal interest consisting of accomplices\u2019 confessions that inculpate criminal defendant not within \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d exception to hearsay rule where \u201c[t]he practice of admitting statements in this category under an exception to the hearsay rule ... is ... of quite recent vintage\u201d); <em>White </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 355 n.8, 112 S.
