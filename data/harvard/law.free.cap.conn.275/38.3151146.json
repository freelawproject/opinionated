We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The record reveals the following factual and procedural history. The commission is a political subdivision of the state, specially chartered by the Connecticut General Assembly for the purpose of water supply, waste management and regional planning.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See 20 Spec. Acts 1204, No. 511 (1929); see <em>also Rocky Hill Convalescent Hospital, Inc. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan District, </em>160 Conn. 446, 450-51, 280 A.2d 344 (1971). The commission owns 24,000 acres of property in the state, including a recreational area known as \u201cGreenwoods,\u201d which consists of 400 acres of partially wooded land through which the west branch of the Farmington River flows. The commission does not use Greenwoods for water provision or waste management services. Rather, it has opened the area to the public, free of charge, for hunting and fishing. To facilitate these activities, the commission maintains a parking lot on the property and a handicapped fishing pier. The property also has an old unpaved service road, but the commission did not create the service road and does not maintain it. Additionally, there are dirt trails located in Greenwoods. Although some commission employees were aware of these trails, the commission did not create the trails and does not maintain them. The defendants are not aware of what activities, if any, for which the dirt trails are used.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">On July 7, 2001, the plaintiff went mountain biking on an unpaved dirt trail in Greenwoods. One-half mile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>into the trail, the plaintiff arrived at a washed out area covered with small branches and logs that caused him to lose his balance and fall into an abutting ravine, a distance of approximately fifteen to twenty feet. As a result of the fall, the plaintiff sustained serious physical injuries, including paralysis from the chest down.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The plaintiff filed the present action against the defendants seeking compensatory damages for the injuries he had sustained as a result of his fall. The plaintiff alleged in his complaint that the defendants were negligent in one or more of the following ways: (1) they \u201cfailed to exercise reasonable care in the design, supervision, and maintenance of the trail\u201d; (2) they \u201cpermitted the trail to be located immediately adjacent to a [fifteen to twenty] foot vertical drop into a ravine\u201d; (3) they \u201cfailed to take adequate measures to guard against trail users entering the ravine\u201d; (4) \u201cthe area where the incident took place was, and had been for more than a reasonable time, dangerous and unsafe in that it was not clearly marked, and yet the defendants] had failed to correct or remedy this condition\u201d; (5) \u201cthe surface of the trail was, and had been for more than a reasonable time, dangerous and unsafe in that there was an area that had been washed out and yet the defendants] had failed to correct or remedy this condition\u201d; (6) they \u201cfailed to adequately inspect the trail to ensure it was in a reasonably safe condition\u201d; (7) they \u201cfailed to reroute or close the trail until proper measures were taken to ensure it was in a reasonably safe condition\u201d; (8) they \u201cfailed to warn the plaintiff and others of the dangerous and unsafe condition of this area\u201d; and (9) they \u201cfailed to erect barricades or other devices so as to protect trail users from going into the ravine . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The defendants, in their answer to the complaint, denied the plaintiffs allegations and asserted six special defenses, including governmental immunity pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>to \u00a7 52-557n.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendants moved for summary judgment claiming, inter alia, that the plaintiffs cause of action was barred by \u00a7 52-557n. In its opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff claimed that issues of fact existed as to whether: (1) the defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent acts were discretionary in nature pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n (a) (2) (B); (2) the defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent acts were performed for pecuniary benefit pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (B); and (3) \u00a7 52-557n (b) (4) provides the plaintiff with a direct cause of action against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court noted that \u00a7 52-557n \u201cprotects political subdivisions of the state and its employees from liability when a negligent act or omission is committed within the discretionary duties of the political subdivision or its officers and was not done for pecuniary gain.\u201d The trial court concluded that the allegedly negligent acts of the defendants \u201crequire[d] the exercise of judgment.\u201d The trial court noted that the plaintiff failed to submit any evidence demonstrating that the defendants were ministerially required to maintain and supervise the trails in Greenwoods and to ensure safety on the property and, therefore, concluded that the alleged failure of the defendants to perform these duties \u201cmust be considered a discretionary act.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion to reargue on the grounds that the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision failed to address the plaintiffs claims that (1) the defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent acts were performed for pecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>niary benefit and (2) \u00a7 52-557n (b) (4) provides the plaintiff with a direct cause of action. The trial court denied the plaintiffs motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">On July 13, 2004, subsequent to the filing of the present appeal, the plaintiff moved for an articulation of the trial court\u2019s decision because the memorandum of decision failed to address the plaintiffs claims that the defendants\u2019 acts were proprietary in nature and that \u00a7 52-557n (b) (4) provides the plaintiff with a direct cause of action. The defendants opposed the plaintiffs motion, and the trial court never ruled on it. On June 7, 2005, this court, sua sponte, remanded the present matter to the trial court with direction to articulate its judgment in accordance with the plaintiffs motion for articulation. In its articulation, the trial court stated that the plaintiffs claim that the defendants were \u201cinvolved in a proprietary function for a pecuniary benefit .. . was so specious an argument and so unrelated to the plaintiffs personal injury claim that no specific response was required. Even if the allegations proved to be true, they would be insufficient to support [the] plaintiffs claim that [the] defendants] [were] conducting a proprietary rather than a governmental function on the land. No material question of fact presented itself as to this claim.\u201d In addition, the trial court articulated that the plaintiff \u201chad no viable cause of action under ... \u00a7 52-557n (b) (4) . . . . The allegations and the offer of proof, in the opinion of this court, raised no material question of fact as to whether the accident occurred because of the condition of an unpaved trail. Nor was there a material question of fact as to whether [the] defendants] had received notice of the alleged defect prior to the accident. Furthermore, [the] plaintiffs claim is adequately ruled out by [\u00a7 52-557n (b) (1)] providing immunity [for these] defendants] for an accident resulting . . . from the condition of natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>land or unimproved property . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants because issues of fact existed as to whether: (1) the defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent acts were discretionary in nature; (2) the defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent acts were performed for pecuniary benefit; and (3) \u00a7 52-557n (b) (4) provides the plaintiff with a direct cause of action because the defendants had notice and a reasonable opportunity to correct the condition of the trail on which the plaintiff was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The defendants respond that the trial court properly rendered summary judgment in their favor because: (1) the defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent acts were discretionary in nature as a matter of law; (2) the defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent acts were not proprietary in nature as a matter of law; and (3) \u00a7 52-557n (b) (4) does not provide the plaintiff with a direct cause of action. Additionally, the defendants set forth the following alternate grounds for affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment: (1) the plaintiffs claims are barred by governmental immunity because they seek damages resulting from the \u201ccondition of natural land or unimproved property\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-557n (b) (1); and (2) the defendants did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff because mountain biking is an inherently hazardous sport, the plaintiff was a licensee on the commission\u2019s property and the commission is an owner of recreational land within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 52-557g.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>We agree with the defendants that the trial court properly rendered summary judgment in their favor pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n because the defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent acts were discretionary in nature and were not performed for a pecuniary benefit. We further agree with the defendants that \u00a7 52-557n (b) (4) does not provide the plaintiff with a direct cause of action. Accordingly, we do not reach the defendants\u2019 alternate grounds for affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the appropriate standard of review. \u201cIn seeking summary judgment, it is the movant who has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any issue of fact. The courts are in entire agreement that the moving party for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all the material facts, which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law. The courts hold the movant to a strict standard. To satisfy his burden the movant must make a showing that it is quite clear what the truth is, and that excludes any real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact. ... As the burden of proof is on the movant, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opponent. . . . When documents submitted in support of a motion for summary judgment fail to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact, the non-moving party has no obligation to submit documents establishing the existence of such an issue. . . . Once the moving party has met its burden, however, the opposing party must present evidence that demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>strates the existence of some disputed factual issue. ... It is not enough, however, for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue. Mere assertions of fact . . . are insufficient to establish the existence of a material fact and, therefore, cannot refute evidence properly presented to the court under Practice Book \u00a7 [17-45]. . . . Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant [a] motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Boone </em>v. <em>William W. Backus Hospital, </em>272 Conn. 551, 558-59, 864 A.2d 1 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment in the present matter because issues of fact existed concerning whether the defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent acts were discretionary in nature. The defendants respond that their allegedly negligent acts were discretionary in nature as a matter of law. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u201cThis court has previously stated that [a] municipality itself was generally immune from liability for its tortious acts at common law .... We have also recognized, however, that governmental immunity may be abrogated by statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>263 Conn. 22, 28, 818 A.2d 37 (2003). General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, a political subdivision of the state shall be liable for damages to person or property caused by: (A) The negligent acts or omissions of such political subdivision or any employee, officer or agent thereof acting within the scope of his employment or official duties . . . .\u201d We previously have concluded that \u201c[t]his language clearly and expressly abrogates the traditional common-law doctrine in this state that municipalities are immune <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>from suit for torts committed by their employees and agents.\u201d <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Subdivision (2) of \u00a7 52-557n (a) lists two exceptions to the statutory abrogation of governmental immunity. The exception relevant to this appeal provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, a political subdivision of the state shall not be liable for damages to person or property caused by . . . (B) negligent acts or omissions which require the exercise of judgment or discretion as an official function of the authority expressly or impliedly granted by law.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n (a) (2) (B). Because the parties in the present matter assume that the immunity provided by \u00a7 52-557n (a) (2) (B) is identical to a municipal employee\u2019s qualified immunity for discretionary acts at common law, we also assume, without deciding, that \u00a7 52-557n (a) (2) (B) codifies the common law. See <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>245 Conn. 385, 410-11, 715 A.2d 27 (1998) (assuming, without deciding, that \u00a7 52-557n [a] [2] [B] codifies common law); see also <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>84 Conn. App. 395, 401, 853 A.2d 621 (\u00a7 52-557n [a] [2] [B] codifies common-law qualified immunity for municipal employees\u2019 discretionary acts), cert. denied, 271 Conn. 927, 859 A.2d 582 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u201cThe [common-law] doctrines that determine the tort liability of municipal employees are well established. . . . Generally, a municipal employee is liable for the misperformance of ministerial acts, but has a qualified immunity in the performance of governmental acts. . . . Governmental acts are performed wholly for the direct benefit of the public and are supervisory or discretionary in nature.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 35-36. \u201cThe hallmark of a discretionary act is that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>requires the exercise of judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Lombard </em>v. <em>Edward J. Peters, Jr., P.C., </em>252 Conn. 623, 628, 749 A.2d 630 (2000). \u201cIn contrast, [mjinisterial refers to a duty which is to be performed in a prescribed manner without the exercise of judgment or discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 36. \u201cAlthough the determination of whether official acts or omissions are ministerial or discretionary is normally a question of fact for the fact finder . . . there are cases where it is apparent from the complaint.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Lombard </em>v. <em>Edward J. Peters, Jr., P.C., </em>supra, 628; see also <em>Evon </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>211 Conn. 501, 506-507, 559 A.2d 1131 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In <em>Evon </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 505-507, the plaintiffs brought a common-law tort action against the defendant municipality and its employees for their allegedly negligent failure to inspect adequately a rental dwelling. We determined that the defendants\u2019 acts were discretionary in nature because \u201cwhat constitutes a reasonable, proper or adequate inspection involves the</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>exercise of judgment.\u201d Id., 506. Accordingly, we concluded that the trial court properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to strike because qualified governmental immunity precluded the plaintiffs\u2019 claim as a matter of law. Id., 506-507; see also <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 411 (parties did not dispute that defendants\u2019 conduct in allowing hunting on watershed land and failing to improve safety of that activity required exercise of discretion under \u00a7 52-557n [a] [2] [B]); <em>Segreto </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>71 Conn. App. 844, 857, 804 A.2d 928 (city\u2019s allegedly negligent design and maintenance of stairwell was discretionary in nature under \u00a7 52-557n [a] [2] [B] because \u201c [d] eterminations as to what is reasonable or proper under a particular set of circumstances necessarily involve the exercise of judgment\u201d), cert. denied, 261 Conn. 941, 808 A.2d 1132 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In the present matter, the plaintiffs complaint essentially alleges that the defendants were negligent in their: (1) design, supervision, inspection and maintenance of the trail on which the plaintiff was injured; (2) failure to warn recreational users of the trail\u2019s dangerous and unsafe condition; and (3) failure to barricade or close the trail. The plaintiff, in its opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, did not present any evidence demonstrating that a policy or directive existed requiring the defendants to perform these duties. Absent evidence of such a policy or directive, we conclude that the defendants\u2019, in determining whether to supervise, inspect and maintain the trails in Greenwoods and when to mark, close or barricade the trails, if at all, were engaged in duties that inherently required the exercise of judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Evon </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>Andrews, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 505-507; <em>Segreto </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>supra, 71 Conn. App. 857-58. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent acts were discretionary in nature as a matter of law and that, therefore, the trial court properly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The plaintiff claims, however, that a trier of fact reasonably could conclude, from the manifestly hazardous condition of the trail and the known use of the property for recreational activities, that the defendants had a ministerial duty to take corrective action in the present matter. The plaintiff cites no law and provides no legal analysis in support of this proposition.* *******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>we decline to review the plaintiffs claim because it is inadequately briefed. See <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>270 Conn. 815, 823 n.8, 856 A.2d 358 (2004) (\u201cWe consistently have held that [a]nalysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly. . . . Where the parties cite no law and provide no analysis of their claims, we do not review such claims.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment in the present matter because issues of fact exist concerning whether the defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent acts were performed for pecuniary gain. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the commission acquired Greenwoods for the development of future water supplies and, therefore, that the defendants\u2019 maintenance of the property was \u201cinextricably linked to [the proprietary] operation of its water utility.\u201d The defendants respond that the acts alleged were not proprietary in nature as a matter of law because the plaintiff failed to produce any evidence demonstrating a link between their allegedly negligent conduct and their proprietary functions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Section 52-557n (a) (1) provides that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by law, apolitical subdivision of the state shall be hable for damages to person or property caused by . . . (B) negligence in the performance of functions from which the political subdivision derives a special corporate profit or pecuniary benefit . . . With minor exception not relevant to our analysis, the parties assume that \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (B) codifies the common-law abrogation of governmental immunity for proprietary acts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we also assume, without deciding, that \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (B) codifies the common law. <em>See Elliott v. Waterbury, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 410-11 (assuming, without deciding, that \u00a7 52-557n [a] [1] [B] codifies common law).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">It is well established that a proprietary function is an act done \u201cin the management of [a municipality\u2019s] property or rights for its own corporate benefit or profit and that of its inhabitants . . . .\u201d <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>96 Conn. 582, 588, 115 A. 11 (1921). The municipal operation of a water utility for corporate profit is a proprietary function. See <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>167 Conn. 143, 150, 355 A.2d 68 (1974); <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 588; <em>Hourigan </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>77 Conn. 358, 364-66, 59 A. 487 (1904). A municipal entity is subject to liability pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) (B), however, only if its allegedly tortious conduct was inextricably linked to a proprietary function. <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 388-89, the decedent, who was jogging on watershed land near the Waterbury reservoir, was shot and killed by a hunter who was hunting on the watershed property. The plaintiff, as administratrix of the decedent\u2019s estate, asserted negligence claims against the city of Waterbury (city) and certain employees pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n for their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>alleged negligence in permitting hunting on watershed land and failing to take certain steps to improve the safety of that activity. Id., 387-90. The trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants, concluding that the governmental immunity provided by \u00a7 52-557n precluded the plaintiffs claims. Id., 391, 409. The plaintiff argued on appeal to this court that the city and its employees were not shielded by governmental immunity because their alleged negligence arose from a proprietary function, namely, the operation of a water utility. Id., 409-10. We rejected this argument because the city\u2019s \u201callegedly tortious conduct\u2014opening the watershed land to hunting, and the manner in which it regulated that activity\u2014is unconnected to its operation of a water utility.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., 413. We distinguished <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>supra, 167 Conn. 143, <em>Richmond, </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 96 Conn. 582, and <em>Hourigan </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 77 Conn. 358, noting that \u201cin each of those cases, the allegedly tortious conduct of the municipalities was inextricably linked to the operation of the water utility for corporate gain.\u201d <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 413. Specifically, we noted that \u201c[i]n <em>Hourigan, </em>the plaintiffs negligence claim arose out of a fatal accident that occurred during the construction of an expansion of the defendant\u2019s reservoir. <em>Hourigan </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, [360-62]. In <em>Richmond, </em>the plaintiff sought recovery for injuries she had suffered when she was shot by a city employee who was hired to guard the reservoir. <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, [586]. Finally, in <em>Abbot[t], </em>the plaintiff landowners sought recovery for diminution of their property value caused by the city water department\u2019s construction of a large storage tank on adjoining land. <em>Abbot[t] </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>supra, [150].\u201d <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 413. Because the allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>negligent conduct in <em>Elliott </em>was not inextricably linked to a proprietary activity, we concluded that the trial court properly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Id., 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">In the present matter, the commission did not use Greenwoods for any purpose connected to its provision of water supplies and waste management services<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and derived no pecuniary gain from the hunting and fishing activities that took place on the property. The plaintiff claims that the allegedly negligent conduct of the defendants was proprietary in nature, however, because Greenwoods may have been acquired initially for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>purpose of developing future water supplies and, consequently, the defendants\u2019 \u201cmaintenance of the Green-woods property, was inextricably linked to [their] operation of [a] water utility.\u201d The plaintiff fails to explain, and we fail to discern, how the defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent supervision and maintenance of the trail on which the plaintiff was injured was inextricably linked to the commission\u2019s alleged purpose in acquiring the property. Accordingly, the plaintiffs claim fails. To the extent that the plaintiff claims that <em>all </em>maintenance of the Greenwoods property must be considered inextricably linked to the commission\u2019s proprietary functions because of the commission\u2019s alleged proprietary purpose in acquiring Greenwoods, we reject the plaintiffs claim. The plaintiffs broad interpretation of the inextricable link requirement is contrary to this court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Elliott v. Waterbury, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 413, which requires an <em>inextricable link </em>or inherently close connection between the plaintiffs <em>specific </em>allegations of negligence and the defendants\u2019 operation of a water utility. Id., 413-14 (\u201c[T]he Waterbury defendants\u2019 allegedly tortious conduct\u2014opening the watershed land to hunting, and the manner in which it regulated that activity\u2014is unconnected to its operation of a water utility. ... It is apparent, rather, that that activity consisted of a set of policy decisions\u2014which the plaintiff concedes required the exercise of judgment and discretion\u2014concerning the use of city land for recreational purposes.\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the allegedly negligent acts of the defendants in the present matter were not proprietary in nature as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Lastly, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants because \u00a7 52-557n (b) (4) provides a direct cause of action against municipal defendants and, in the present matter, issues of fact existed concerning whether the defendants had constructive notice and a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>able opportunity to correct the condition of the trail on which the plaintiff was injured. The defendants respond that \u00a7 52-557n (b) (4) does not provide the plaintiff with a direct cause of action and, instead, merely provides a limited exception to the imposition of governmental liability contained in \u00a7 52-557n (a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u201cIssues of statutory construction raise questions of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tarnowsky </em>v. <em>Socci, </em>271 Conn. 284, 287, 856 A.2d 408 (2004). General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z provides that \u201c[t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extra-textual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d Further, it is well established that \u201c[wjhen a statute is in derogation of common law or creates a liability where formerly none existed, it should receive a strict construction and is not to be extended, modified, repealed or enlarged in its scope by the mechanics of [statutory] construction. ... In determining whether or not a statute abrogates or modifies a common law rule the construction must be strict, and the operation of a statute in derogation of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>mon law is to be limited to matters clearly brought within its scope.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We begin our analysis with the language of the statute. Section 52-557n (a) (1) provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, a political subdivision of the state shall be liable for damages to person or property caused by: (A) The negligent acts or omissions of such political subdivision or any employee, officer or agent thereof acting within the scope of his employment or official duties . . . .\u201d Section 52-557n (b) provides in relevant part: <em>\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, </em>a political subdivision of the state or any employee, officer or agent acting within the scope of his employment or official duties <em>shall not be liable </em>for damages to person or property resulting from ... (4) the condition of an unpaved road, trail or footpath, the purpose of which is to provide access to a recreational or scenic area, if the political subdivision has not received notice and has not had a reasonable opportunity to make the condition safe . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The plaintiff appears to argue that \u00a7 52-557n (b) (4), like subsection (a) of the statute, abrogates the common-law governmental immunity of a municipality. Specifically, the plaintiff seems to argue that because \u00a7 52-557n (b) (4) provides that a municipality <em>\u201cshall not be liable\u201d </em>for injuries incurred as a result of \u201cthe condition of an unpaved road, trail or footpath ... [if it] has <em>not </em>received notice and has <em>not </em>had a reasonable opportunity to make the condition safe,\u201d then a municipality <em>must be liable </em>for said injuries if it <em>has </em>received notice and <em>has </em>had an opportunity to make the condition safe. (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff claims that because factual issues exist in the present matter concerning whether the defendants had constructive notice of the dangerous condition of the trail on which the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>was injured and whether the defendants had a reasonable opportunity to make the condition of the trail safe, summary judgment was improper. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">As discussed in part I of this opinion, subsection (a) of \u00a7 52-557n abrogates the common-law governmental immunity of a municipality. See <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 29. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 52-557n provides that \u201c[notwithstanding . . . subsection (a),\u201d a municipality \u201cshall not be liable\u201d if certain conditions are met. We conclude that this language plainly and unambiguously provides <em>exceptions </em>to the liability imposed by subsection (a) of the statute and, thus, functions to limit, rather than expand the legislative abrogation of common-law governmental immunity contained in \u00a7 52-557n. See <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 33 (\u201csubsection [b] of \u00a7 52-557n, which references subsection [a], sets forth many exceptions under which an injured party may not pursue a direct action in negligence against a municipality\u201d); <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 395 (\u201c[sjubsection [a] [of \u00a7 52-557n] sets forth general principles of municipal liability and immunity, while subsection [b] sets forth [ten] specific situations in which both municipalities and their officers are immune from tort liability\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Because we conclude in parts I and II of this opinion that the defendants enjoy governmental immunity pursuant to subsection (a) of \u00a7 52-557n, subsection (b) of the statute is inapplicable to the plaintiffs claims.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-12\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b61-13\"> The defendant employees are: (1) Anthony V.

At oral argument before this court, the plaintiff informed this court that he rested on his brief concerning the impropriety of the trial court\u2019s conclusion. Our review of the plaintiffs brief, however, reveals that this issue was not briefed on appeal. Accordingly, we deem the claim to be abandoned. See, e.g., <em>Updike, Kelly &amp; Spellacy, P.C. </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>269 Conn. 613, 642-43, 850 A.2d 145 (2004) (claims not briefed on appeal are deemed to be abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b72-6\"> The plaintiff also claimed at oral argument before this court that the allegedly negligent acts or omissions of a municipality or a municipal employee cannot be considered discretionary in nature unless the evidence affirmatively established that the municipal employee made decisions and exercised judgment. Essentially, the plaintiff claimed that summary judgment was improper in the present matter because no evidence was produced demonstrating that the defendants had considered inspecting and main-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>taming the trails in Greenwoods and had exercised their judgment by deciding not. to do so. We are not persuaded. Our case law reveals that the determination of whether an act or omission is discretionary in nature and, thus, whether governmental immunity may be successfully invoked pursuant 1o \u00a7 52-557n (a) (2) (B), turns on the \u201ccharacter of the act or omission complained of in the complaint.\u201d <em>Segreto </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>supra, 71 Conn. App. 854; see also <em>Evon </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 506. Accordingly, where it is apparent from the complaint that the defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent acts or omissions <em>necessarily </em>involved the exercise of judgment, and thus, necessarily were discretionary in nature, summary judgment is proper. In the present matter, we conclude that even if the defendants did not <em>expressly </em>consider inspecting and maintaining the trails in Greenwoods, the fact that they did not do so reflects an implicit exercise of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b73-14\"> The plaintiff does cite a Superior Court case in support, of his claim for the first time in his reply brief. The plaintiffs belated reliance on nonbinding authority, however, combined with his failure to analyze the facts in the present matter in relation to the law and facts of the case cited, are insufficient, to render the plaintiffs claim adequately briefed. See <em>New London Federal Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Tucciarone, </em>48 Conn. App. 89, 100, 709 A.2d 14 (1998). In any event, we find the facts of the case cited by the plaintiff to be distinguishable from the present matter. In <em>Silver </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford at Hartford, Docket No. CV980585357-S (October 14, 1999), the plaintiffs brought a negligence action against the town of West Hartford (town) and its employees pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n for the death of their son who drowned while on a field trip with a town operated summer recreational program. The defendants moved to strike the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint because it \u201cfailed to allege that the defendants owed a duty of supervision to the decedent or the other children\u201d and the defendants\u2019 duty to supervise therefore was discretionary. The trial court disagreed because the plaintiffs had pleaded sufficient facts to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>that the defendants \u201chad a duty to supervise the young children <em>under their care, </em>with special attention owed to the children who were poor swimmers . . . (Emphasis added.) Id. Accordingly, the trial court concluded that the defendants\u2019 duty to supervise the children was ministerial in nature and denied the defendants\u2019 motion to strike. In the present matter, however, the care, custody or control of the plaintiff was not at issue. Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiffs reliance on <em>Silver </em>is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\"> Alternatively, the defendants claim that \u00a7 52-557n (a) (2) (B) modifies the common law by extending a statutory grant of governmental immunity to discretionary acts performed for pecuniary benefit. Because we conclude that the defendants\u2019 allegedly negligent conduct was not proprietary in nature as a matter of law, we need not address this claim and we express no opinion on it. See <em>Elliott v. Waterbury, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 410 n.16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\"> See footnote 10 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b76-5\"> We noted that \u201cthe plaintiff does not allege, and there is no indication in the record, that [the city] received corporate gain or benefit from the hunting.\u201d <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 414.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\"> The plaintiff claims that summary judgment was improper absent some evidence of the \u201cregulatory classification of . . . [Greenwoods] and whether its location, adjacent to the west branch of the Farmington River, played a role in maintaining water purity of a distribution reservoir . . . We are not persuaded. In support of their motion for summary judgment, the defendants produced evidence, in the form of affidavits and testimony of commission employees, establishing that the commission did not use Greenwoods for water provision or for waste management services. The plaintiff failed to produce any contrary evidence and, instead, relied on evidence that the commission had, over time, acquired land for the development of future water supplies and on the fact that water company land that is available for future use is classified pursuant to \u00a7 25-37c-l et seq. of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. It is well established, however, that once the party moving for summary judgment demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists, the \u201copposing party must present <em>evidence </em>that demonstrates the existence of some disputed <em>factual </em>issue [and] [i]t is not enough . . . for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Boone </em>v. <em>William W. Backus Hospital, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 558-59. The plaintiff in the present matter, in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion, failed to produce any countervailing evidence demonstrating that the commission maintained Greenwoods for the purpose of preserving water purity. Accordingly, this fact was not in dispute and did not preclude the trial court from rendering summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Even assuming, arguendo, however, that this fact was in dispute, the plaintiff failed to produce any evidence demonstrating the existence of an inextricable link between the commission\u2019s allegedly negligent supervision and maintenance of the trail on which the plaintiff was injured and the commission\u2019s proprietary maintenance of the property for purposes of preserving water purity.
