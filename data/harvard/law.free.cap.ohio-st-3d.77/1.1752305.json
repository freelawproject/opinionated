Upon review, we affirm the appellate court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">We are initially troubled by the implication that claimant sustained a relatively minor injury. The citation to claimant\u2019s conservative course of treatment, in this instance and without more explanation, does not substantiate this conclusion. While conservative treatment can indeed suggest a minor injury, when that treatment, as here, is preceded by two surgeries that did not resolve claimant\u2019s complaints, that treatment, standing alone, may not accurately reflect the severity of the claimant\u2019s conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">We have similar difficulty with the commission\u2019s characterization of a fifty-nine percent impairment as being \u201clow to moderate.\u201d We note that in <em>State ex rel. Lopez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 445, 449, 633 N.E.2d 528, 531, we viewed a fifty percent impairment as high. The record also does not support the conclusion that claimant\u2019s impairment \u201cdoes not significantly reduce his functional capacity to engage in work activity.\u201d To the contrary, his allowed conditions prohibit medium exertion work and, according to some examiners, limit claimant to even lighter work.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">A second problem with the commission\u2019s order arises from its ambiguous discussion of claimant\u2019s residual work capacities. Drs. Fallon and Holbrook reached different conclusions. The former seemingly released claimant to light duty work. Dr. Holbrook was more restrictive, confining claimant to sedentary employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>At various points, the commission\u2019s order can be read as accepting or rejecting Holbrook\u2019s report and as accepting or rejecting Fallon\u2019s report. If the commission indeed accepted Holbrook\u2019s sedentary restrictions, that finding may be inconsistent with its determination that claimant could resume his inspection duties, a job that has not been classified as sedentary. The commission must therefore clarify the type of work which it finds claimant medically capable of doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and issue a limited writ that returns the cause to the commission for further consideration and amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b138-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion. This case involves a claimant who, to his credit, overcame a disability, retrained, and reentered the job market. He now seeks total permanent disability compensation again.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">After carefully reviewing all the medical and non-medical factors, the commission denied the claimant total permanent disability compensation. The reports of the examining physicians sometimes differ but mostly agree. There are some matters in conflict. However, all the doctors\u2019 reports cited by the commission agree that the claimant is capable of \u201csome employment.\u201d The commission evaluated these reports and factors, assessed disability, stated its conclusions and explained them. The decision of the commission is clearly supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d To reject its findings is to improperly substitute our judgment for the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">The commission\u2019s order does not make light of claimant\u2019s impairment, as the majority suggests, but rather concludes that the 55-59 percent impairment, coupled with the positive factors of his age, job skills, retraining, and others, is not sufficient to consider him <em>totally </em>disabled. The commission\u2019s order <em>is </em>clear that the claimant can engage in \u201csustained remunerative employment\u201d of a sedentary nature. The commission does not have to provide a list of specific employment opportunities to fulfill its task.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">Accordingly, I would reverse the court of appeals and find no abuse of discretion by the commission.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
