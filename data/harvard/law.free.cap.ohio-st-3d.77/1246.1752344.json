Grossman from further proceedings in this case. The earlier affidavit of disqualification was found not well taken and denied. <em>In re Disqualification of Grossman </em>(May 7, 1996), No. 96-AP-063, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">In this affidavit, affiant contends that Judge Grossman is disqualified \u201cunder the law\u201d from presiding over a contempt of court proceeding involving an order issued by the judge. Judges are vested -with inherent authority to issue contempt citations to compel obedience with court orders. The mere fact that a judge issues an order does not disqualify that judge from future proceedings designed to ensure compliance with that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">Accordingly, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is denied. The case shall proceed before Judge Grossman.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
