Steiner </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 86, 61 O.O.2d 335, 290 N.E.2d 841, paragraph one of the syllabus. Section 4(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, states that \u201c[t]he courts of common pleas and divisions thereof shall have such original jurisdiction over all justiciable matters * * * as may be provided by law.\u201d It is well settled that \u201c \u2018[t]he court of common pleas is a court of general jurisdiction. It embraces all matters at law and in equity that are not denied to it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schucker v. Metcalf </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 33, 34, 22 OBR 27, 28, 488 N.E.2d 210, 212 (quoting <em>Saxton v. Seiberling </em>[1891], 48 Ohio St. 554, 558-559, 29 N.E. 179, 180; <em>Dumas v. Estate of Dumas </em>[1994], 68 Ohio St.3d 405, 408, 627 N.E.2d 978, 980).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, courts of common pleas may \u201cdeclare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed,\u201d R.C. 2721.02. <em>Am. Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. of Kentucky v. Jones </em>(1949), 152 Ohio St. 287, 40 O.O. 326, 89 N.E.2d 301; <em>Herrick v. Kosydar </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St.2d 128, 130, 73 O.O.2d 442, 443, 339 N.E.2d 626, 628. See, also, <em>Jones v. Chagrin Falls </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 456, 674 N.E.2d 1388, decided today. Pursuant to R.C. 2727.02 <em>et seq., </em>courts of common pleas have jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">The appellant contends, however, that R.C. 4301.10(B)(1) and 4301.31 operate to divest the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County of subject-matter jurisdiction over BCL\u2019s complaint. The first of those statutes, R.C. 4301.10(B)(1), at the time this action was initiated provided: <em>\u201cThe department </em>[of liquor control] may * * * [s]ue, but <em>may be sued only in connection with </em>the execution of leases of real estate and such purchases and contracts necessary for the operation of the state liquor stores that are made under this chapter and Chapter 4303. of the Revised Code * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The second statute, R.C. 4301.31, provided at the time the action was initiated: \u201cExcept as provided in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>4301.28<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Revised Code, <em>no court, other than the court of common pleas of Franklin county, has jurisdiction </em>of any action against the * * * department of liquor control, <em>to restrain the exercise of any power or to compel the performance of any duty </em>under Chapters 4301. and 4303. of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis and footnote added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The court of appeals held that, despite these statutory provisions, the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County is vested with jurisdiction to entertain actions against the department seeking declaratory or injunctive relief even where the case does not involve real estate leases or contracts and purchases necessary for the operation of state liquor stores. While expressing no opinion as to whether such relief should be granted, we affirm the holding of the court of appeals that the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas does have subject-matter jurisdiction to consider BCL\u2019s entitlement to such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">We reject the contention that R.C. 4301.31 <em>establishes </em>subject-matter jurisdiction in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County to restrain or compel departmental action. In providing that \u201cno court, <em>other than </em>the court of common pleas of Franklin [C]ounty has jurisdiction\u201d to restrain or compel the department\u2019s conduct, R.C. 4301.31 operates not to <em>confer </em>jurisdiction on the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, but rather to <em>abrogate </em>subject-matter jurisdiction of all other courts of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Historically, declaratory judgment actions were permitted against state agencies, and courts have been deemed to possess jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief. See, <em>e.g., Racing Guild of Ohio, Local 304 v. State Racing Comm. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 317, 320, 28 OBR 386, 388, 503 N.E.2d 1025, 1028, citing Aw. <em>Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. </em>See, also, <em>Hoffman Candy &amp; Ice Cream Co. v. Dept. of Liquor Control </em>(1950), 154 Ohio St. 357, 43 O.O. 250, 96 N.E.2d 203 (approving assertion of trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over the merits, but nevertheless finding the issuance of specific-performance relief affecting the Department of Liquor Control improper). Accordingly, underlying R.C. 4301.31 is an unstated assumption that jurisdiction to enter injunctive relief would exist in any common pleas court throughout the state but for the express language of the statute limiting jurisdiction to the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Nor does R.C. 4301.10(B)(1), which provides that the department \u201cmay be sued only in connection with\u201d certain types of contractual agreements, affect the fundamental power, <em>i.e., </em>jurisdiction, of a court of common pleas to hear the merits of a dispute in which the Department of Liquor Control is named a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>defendant. In general, when the General Assembly has intended to abrogate the subject-matter jurisdiction of Ohio courts in particular types of actions it has done so expressly. See, <em>e.g., </em>R.C. 3745.04 (\u201cThe environmental board of review has <em>exclusive original jurisdiction </em>over any matter which may, under [R.C. 3745.04], be brought before it.\u201d [Emphasis added.]); R.C. 2743.02(F) (\u201cA civil action against an officer or employee * * * shall first be filed against the state in the court of claims, which has <em>exclusive, original jurisdiction </em>to determine, initially, whether the officer or employee is entitled to personal immunity * * * and whether the courts of common pleas have jurisdiction over the civil action.\u201d [Emphasis added.]) In contrast, R.C. 4301.10(B)(1) includes no reference to \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of either courts or other adjudicatory or administrative bodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Rather we interpret R.C. 4301.10(B)(1) as creating a defense in the nature of a statutorily created immunity against suit which may be pled by the department as an affirmative defense. As such, R.C. 4301.10(B)(1) does not create a <em>jurisdictional </em>defense to a declaratory judgment action. See <em>State ex rel. Koren v. Grogan </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 590, 594, 629 N.E.2d 446, 450 (\u201cIn general, immunity is an affirmative defense, which must be raised and proven, <em>i.e., </em>it usually does not affect the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d [Citations omitted.]). See, also, 1 Baldwin\u2019s Ohio Civil Practice (1988), Text 13.03, at 35 (providing the following as examples of affirmative defenses: \u201c * * * failure to exhaust available administrative remedies; <em>sovereign immunity; </em>self-defense; <em>official immunity; </em>parental immunity; policeman/fireman immunity; interspousal immunity; allowance of workers\u2019compensation; <em>immune from suit; </em>charitable immunity; judicial immunity * * [Emphasis added.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">We acknowledge that, where the General Assembly has established a complete and comprehensive statutory scheme both creating new rights and prescribing a means to enforce them, review of administrative actions as to those rights may be deemed to be exclusively within the jurisdiction of a statutorily created administrative, rather than judicial, body. <em>Kazmaier Supermarket, Inc. v. Toledo Edison Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 147, 153, 573 N.E.2d 655, 659 (Public Utilities Commission); <em>Franklin Cty. Law Enforcement Assn. v. Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge No. 9 </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 167, 572 N.E.2d 87 (State Employment Relations Board). However, application of that doctrine to the case at bar would be inconsistent with the statutory acknowledgment in R.C. 4301.31 of jurisdiction in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas to \u201crestrain [the department from exercising] any power or to compel the performance of any duty under Chapters 4301. and 4303. of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">On remand we instruct the trial court to determine whether, under the facts of this case, BCL\u2019s claims justify the discretionary exercise of its authority to grant declaratory or injunctive relief. In making that determination it is appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>for the court to consider the department\u2019s timely asserted alleged affirmative defense that BCL failed to invoke an administrative remedy available to it. See <em>Jones. </em>Further, the court in exercising its jurisdiction may consider the effect of R.C. 4301.10(B)(1) to determine whether that statute provides an immunity defense sufficient to justify dismissal of BCL\u2019s claims for failure to state a legally cognizable claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b606-6\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\">.
