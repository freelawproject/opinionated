On October 23, 1996, this case was dismissed for want of prosecution because appellant had failed to file a memorandum in support of jurisdiction due October 18, 1996. It has come to the attention of the court that appellant did tender a memorandum in support of jurisdiction in compliance with this court\u2019s order and the Rules of Practice but the memorandum was inadvertently rejected for filing. Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">IT IS ORDERED by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>effective October 24, 1996, that this case shall be restored to the docket; appellant\u2019s memorandum in support of jurisdiction shall be filed as of October 15, 1996; and appellee\u2019s memorandum in response shall be due within thirty days of the date of this entry.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
