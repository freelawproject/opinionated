Crabtree\u2019s complaint included claims for injunctive and mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">\n<em>Injunctive Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">In her complaint, Crabtree contended that the court of appeals could \u201crestrain the Franklin County Health Board from withholding fully drafted regulations that would benefit the entire Columbus area.\u201d The court of appeals concluded that \u201c[t]o the extent that relator\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus asks for injunctive relief, this court must dismiss appellant\u2019s action for want of jurisdiction.\u201d Neither this court nor a court of appeals has original jurisdiction in prohibitory injunction. <em>State ex rel. Governor v. Taft </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 640 N.E.2d 1136, 1137-1138; <em>State ex rel. Pressley v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St.2d 141, 40 O.O.2d 141, 228 N.E.2d 631, paragraph four of the syllabus. Therefore, the court of appeals properly dismissed that portion of Crabtree\u2019s complaint which requested injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">\n<em>Mandamus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">The court of appeals dismissed Crabtree\u2019s mandamus claim pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). In order to dismiss a complaint under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, it must appear beyond doubt from the complaint that the relator can prove no set of facts warranting relief after all factual allegations are presumed true and all reasonable inferences are made in the relator\u2019s favor. <em>State ex rel. Neff v. Corrigan </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 12, 14, 661 N.E.2d 170, 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">Crabtree contends that she is entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel the board to enact the tabled tattoo regulation. Public duties having their basis in law may be compelled by a writ of mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Levin v. Schremp </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 733, 735, 654 N.E.2d 1258, 1260. R.C. 3709.21 provides that \u201c[t]he board of health of a general health district may make such orders and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>regulations as are necessary for its own government, for the public health, the prevention or restriction of disease, and the prevention, abatement, or suppression of nuisances.\u201d As conceded by Crabtree, R.C. 3709.21 vests the board with discretion to issue regulations concerning the public health.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u201cThe extraordinary writ of mandamus cannot be used to control the exercise of administrative or legislative discretion.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dublin v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 55, 60, 577 N.E.2d 1088, 1093. \u201cAbsent an abuse of discretion, mandamus cannot compel a public body or official to act in a certain way on a discretionary matter.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Veterans Serv. Office v. Pickaway Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 461, 463, 575 N.E.2d 206, 207. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d implies an attitude that is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. <em>State ex rel. Bitter v. Missig </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 249, 253, 648 N.E.2d 1355, 1358.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Crabtree asserts that her complaint alleged an abuse of discretion by the board sufficient to withstand a motion for dismissal. Crabtree claims that the board\u2019s failure to enact the proposed tattooing regulation endangered the public health. However, the materials incorporated in Crabtree\u2019s complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> indicate that some states have declined to enact tattooing regulations due, in part, to the minimal public health risk associated with tattooing and the possibility that regulating the practice would drive it underground. In addition, an article attached to Crab-tree\u2019s complaint noted that an epidemiologist employed by the Georgia Office of Infectious Disease stated that he doubted that regulating tattooing would be beneficial, since it would likely target those artists who already sterilize their equipment. Finally, the attached materials also indicate that there have been no documented cases linking unregulated tattooing to transmission of the AIDS virus. Contrary to Crabtree\u2019s contentions on appeal, the possibility that the board may have decided to table the regulation because it did not want to legitimate tattooing does not indicate bad faith. Therefore, based on the evidence contained in articles incorporated in Crabtree\u2019s own complaint, the board did not abuse its discretion in not adopting the proposed tattooing regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Furthermore, Crabtree\u2019s complaint indicates that she instituted the action because the court of appeals denied her motion to intervene in a similar case. A writ of mandamus will not be issued when there is a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. R.C. 2731.05. In order for an alternative remedy to constitute an adequate remedy at law, it must be complete, beneficial, and speedy. <em>State ex rel. Huntington Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Duryee </em>(1995), 73 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>St.3d 530, 536, 653 N.E.2d 349, 355. Crabtree alleged in her complaint that she brought her mandamus action rather than an appeal of the order denying intervention after a final judgment by the court of appeals in the other case because an appeal \u201cwould prove quite dilatory.\u201d However, \u201c \u2018[w]here a constitutional process of appeal has been legislatively provided, the sole fact that pursuing such process would encompass more delay and inconvenience than seeking a writ of mandamus is insufficient to prevent the process from constituting a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Newton v. Court of Claims </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 553, 557, 653 N.E.2d 366, 370, quoting <em>State ex rel. Willis v. Sheboy </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 167, 6 OBR 225, 451 N.E.2d 1200, paragraph one of the syllabus; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Gillivan v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 196, 200, 638 N.E.2d 74, 77 (argument that appeal is inadequate because it is too time-consuming and expensive to pursue is generally insufficient to justify writ of mandamus).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">For the foregoing reasons, after construing the allegations of Crabtree\u2019s complaint and all reasonable inferences therefrom most strongly in her favor, it appears beyond doubt that she cannot prove a set of facts entitling her to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b384-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
