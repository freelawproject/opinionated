For the reasons that follow, we hold that the judgment was not obtained \u201con the grounds of conduct associated with an act or transaction of a broker or salesman\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 4735.12(B). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">The Fund was created in 1974 with the enactment of R.C. 4735.12. 135 Ohio Laws, Part II, 1196. R.C. 4735.12(B) states that \u201c[w]hen any person * * * obtains a final judgment * * * against any broker or salesman licensed under this chapter, <em>on the grounds of conduct that is in violation of this chapter or the rules adopted under it* </em>* * <em>and that is associated with an act or transaction of a broker or salesman specified or comprehended in division (A) or (C) of section 4735.01 of the Revised Code, </em>such person may file a verified application * * * in any court of common pleas for an order directing payment out of the real estate recovery fund of the portion of the judgment that remains unpaid and that represents the actual and direct loss sustained by the applicant. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">The statute specifically states that payment from the Fund is available when the final judgment obtained against the broker or salesperson was the result of an act or conduct in violation of R.C. Chapter 4735 <em>and </em>when the act or conduct that occasioned the loss was \u201cassociated with an act or transaction of a broker or salesman specified or comprehended in\u201d R.C. 4735.01(A) or (C). Thus, the Harbeitners\u2019 application for payment can be accepted only if both of these statutory requirements are met. We now turn to the statute to examine whether these prerequisites to payment from the Fund have been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">After a careful review of R.C. 4735.01(A) and (C), it is clear to us that the burglary in this case was not an act \u201cassociated with an act or transaction of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>broker or salesman.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no question that Santora obtained entry to the Harbeitners\u2019 house by using the key in the lock box and that he garnered the information necessary to do so through his job as a real estate salesperson. However, nothing in the record suggests that the actual burglary had anything to do with Santora\u2019s job as a real estate salesperson. For example, nothing in the record indicates that Santora was involved in selling real estate, exchanging real estate, purchasing real estate, renting real estate, leasing real estate, or negotiating the sale of real estate at the time of the burglary. See R.C. 4735.01(A)(1). Nothing in the record suggests that Santora was offering, attempting, or agreeing to negotiate the sale, exchange, purchase, rental, or leasing of any real estate. See R.C. 4735.01(A)(2). The same analysis holds for subsections (3) through (10) of R.C. 4735.01(A) as well as R.C. 4735.01(C). In sum, nothing in the record indicates that Santora was involved in any conduct \u201cassociated with an act or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>transaction of a broker or salesman\u201d at the time of the burglary. See <em>Dent v. Van Winkle </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 80, 84, 30 OBR 228, 231, 507 N.E.2d 345, 349 (recovery from the Fund depends on whether the real estate broker engaged in dishonest conduct in his capacity as a real estate broker).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Accordingly, we hold that Santora was not involved in an act or transaction as a broker or salesperson when he burglarized the Harbeitners\u2019 house. Since the Harbeitners are entitled to an order for payment only upon a showing that they have met both of the requirements of R.C. 4735.12(B) mentioned above, we need not determine whether the burglary in this case was conduct \u201cin violation of [R.C. Chapter 4735]\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 4735.12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and enter judgment for the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b418-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
