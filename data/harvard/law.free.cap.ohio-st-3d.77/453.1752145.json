For the reasons that follow, we hold that a workshop, for the purpose of Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-5, is a place located within some form of structural enclosure. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-01(A) defines the scope of that chapter and provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\u201cThe specific requirements of this code are requirements upon an employer for the protection of such employer\u2019s employees and no others and apply to all workshops and factories subject to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (sections 4123.01 to 4123.99 of the Revised Code). * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">In explaining why LCETA was not obliged to comply with Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-17(E), the court of appeals wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">\u201c[Waugh], who sustained a work-related injury while mowing the grass on the grounds of the waste water treatment plant in Lorain, contends that, pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>State ex rel. Wiers Farms Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 569 [634 N.E.2d 1019], and <em>State ex rel. Buurma Farms, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 111 [630 N.E.2d 686], he is entitled to a further hearing to determine his right to receive compensation inasmuch as he was injured in a workshop. [Waugh\u2019s] argument, however, ignores the facts in both <em>Wiers Farms </em>and <em>Buurma Farms, </em>in that the claimant in each of those cases was working with machinery in <em>a building, </em>whereas in this instance, [Waugh] was not working in a building.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">\u201cIn <em>Buurma Farms, </em>* * * [69 Ohio St.3d at 112, 113, 630 N.E.2d at 686, 687, the court] defined a \u201cworkshop\u2019 as \u2018a room or place where[in] power-driven machinery is employed and manual labor is exercised by way of trade for gain or otherwise.\u2019 In <em>Buurma Farms </em>and <em>Wiers Farms, </em>the court found Ohio Adm. Code [Chapter] 4121:1-5 to apply because the claimants\u2019 employment was within the specific boundaries of a fixed building and the injuries occurred while working on machinery in those buildings. Here, [Waugh\u2019s] injury occurred while mowing grass in an open area outside of a building, and Ohio Adm.Code [Chapter] 4121:1-5 is not applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">As the court of appeals observed, we have defined \u201cworkshop\u201d as \u201c \u2018a room or place wherein power-driven machinery is employed and manual labor is exercised by way of trade for gain or otherwise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buurma Farms, supra. </em>Waugh contends that Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-5 also applies to workplaces without structural boundaries by seizing on the \u201croom <em>or place </em>\u201d language. Since this language is in the disjunctive, he argues that the definition transcends boundaries, extending to <em>any </em>place where the requisite machinery and labor are in use. This expansive interpretation makes sense, he insists, because other sections within the chapter, specifically Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-28 (specific safety requirements for helicopter use) and 4121:1-5-29 (specific safety requirements for blasting operations), extend protections to activities commonly conduct-' ed outdoors.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>We disagree. Our definition refers to a place wherem the relevant power machinery and manual labor is employed, not whereat these activities occur. The court of appeals in <em>State ex rel. York Temple Country Club, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(Apr. 18, 1985), Franklin App. 84AP-818, unreported, recognized this small but significant distinction and, adopting its referee\u2019s reasoning, concurred that \u201cthe \u2018shop\u2019 portion of \u2018workshop\u2019 connotes some form of enclosure.\u201d The <em>York </em>court therefore concluded that a claimant\u2019s injury by an errant golf ball while working at a golf course driving range had not occurred in a workshop. We find this logic compelling, as is manifest from our decisions in <em>Buurma Farms, Wiers Farms, </em>and <em>State ex rel. Double v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 13, 599 N.E.2d 259 (construction site does not constitute a workshop).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In the face of this logic, we cannot transform the accepted meaning of workshop to account for provisions in Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-5 that seemingly regulate outdoor activity. Our admonition in <em>Double </em>at 16-17, 599 N.E.2d at 261, prevents any construction contrary to the reasonable expectations of employers:</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">\u201cA VSSR is an employer penalty and must be strictly construed in the employer\u2019s favor. [Citation omitted.] It must also be specific enough to \u2018 \u201cplainly * * * apprise an employer of his legal obligations to his employees.\u2019\u201d <em>State ex rel. Frank Brown &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 162, 163, 524 N.E.2d 482, 484. It thus follows that an employer should not have to speculate as to whether it falls within the class of employers to whom a specific safety requirement applies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals, therefore, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b590-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
