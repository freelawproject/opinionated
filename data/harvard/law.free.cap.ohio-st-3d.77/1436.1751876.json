On October 30, 1996, the Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association filed a motion for leave to file instanter an <em>amicus curiae </em>motion for reconsideration of this court\u2019s decision entered October 16,1996. Pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. XI(2)(B), an <em>amicus curiae </em>may not file a motion for reconsideration without prior leave of this court. Whereas the motion for leave to file a motion for reconsideration was not filed within ten days after the entry of the court\u2019s order, it is considered by the court to be untimely. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">IT IS ORDERED by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>that the motion to file instanter an <em>amicus curiae </em>motion for reconsideration be, and hereby is, stricken.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
