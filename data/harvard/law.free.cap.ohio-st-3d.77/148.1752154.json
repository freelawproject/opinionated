Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. The commission seeks to uphold its order as is. For the reasons to follow, we find in the commission\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Medically, Dr. Kackley anchors the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant is physically capable of sustained remunerative employment. Equally important, the only evidence that claimant\u2019s psychological condition was work-prohibitive was properly rejected by the commission. Thus, there was \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s determination that claimant has a medical capacity for sedentary to light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">We note with interest that claimant\u2019s allowed conditions did not remove him from sustained remunerative employment. Claimant was working until the plant closed in 1974. Claimant never worked again, despite the lack of any medical prohibition. Claimant\u2019s paucity of treatment suggests that his medical condition has changed little, if any, since that time. This, in turn, implies that the allowed conditions were not work-prohibitive then, nor are they now.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">In the nonmedical analysis that followed, the commission discounted Dr. Riccio\u2019s vocational report after finding that his review of claimant\u2019s work history was incomplete. This determination was within the commission\u2019s prerogative and not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">The commission\u2019s independent review of claimant\u2019s nonmedical factors determined that claimant\u2019s age, education, and work history, while not entirely favorable, were not insurmountable barriers to re-employment. The commission stressed the claimant\u2019s failure to make any effort to enhance his re-employment prospects.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">The commission \u2014 as do we \u2014 demands a certain accountability of this claimant, who, despite the time and medical ability to do so, never tried to further his education or to learn new skills. There was certainly ample opportunity. At least fifteen years passed between the plant closure and claimant\u2019s application for permanent total disability compensation, and claimant was only age forty-seven when the plant shut down. Under these circumstances, we do not find that the commission\u2019s decision constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b287-14\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
