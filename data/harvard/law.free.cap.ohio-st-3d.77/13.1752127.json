Upon review, we find that a writ of mandamus pursuant to <em>Gay </em>is inappropriate under these facts and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">We agree with claimant\u2019s contention that the commission\u2019s order did not sufficiently explain its reasoning as required by <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245. The commission \u201cnoted\u201d claimant\u2019s age, education and work history, but did not indicate whether it viewed those factors favorably or unfavorably; further, it failed to indicate how those factors combined to produce a claimant who can perform sustained remunerative employment. The commission\u2019s statement that claimant\u2019s work history \u201clikely\u201d provided him with transferable skills, without further elaboration, is too speculative to constitute an adequate explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">We do not, however, agree that <em>Noll </em>noncompliance dictates relief consistent with <em>Gay. </em>Dr. Reynolds, on whom the commission relied, assessed only a twenty-five-percent impairment. The rehabilitation division, moreover, listed claimant\u2019s age and work history as assets for retraining and re-employment. These factors contrast sharply with the uniformly negative characteristics that have prompted <em>Gay </em>relief in the past. While the claimant indeed alleged that his rehabilitation efforts were foreclosed by other problems, the commission was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>required to accept this statement, particularly given the absence of corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and issue a limited writ that returns the cause to the commission for further consideration and an amended order pursuant to <em>Noll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and limited writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-7\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Cook and Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b150-8\">Douglas, Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., dissent and would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
