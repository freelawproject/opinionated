The Andersons v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 539, 597 N.E.2d 143. Claimant concededly made less over the disputed period than he did at Sisters of St. Francis. At issue is whether the wage diminution was causally related to his injury. For the reasons to follow, we find that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Claimant maintains that once an inability to return to the former position of employment has been causally related to his injury, wage loss eligibility is established. This is incorrect. Where compensation, as here, is sought pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(D), it is necessary to explore why the particular alternative job was selected. As we stated in <em>State ex rel. Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v. Morse </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 210, 216, 648 N.E.2d 827, 832-833:</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">\u201cPepsi\u2019s better argument is one that may ultimately prove inherent whenever lower-paying alternate employment underlies a request for wage-loss compensation \u2014 the reason for taking the job. This is particularly relevant where the alternate employment is a part-time job, since the combined amount of wages and compensation could produce close to a full-time weekly income for part-time work. Wage-loss compensation was not intended to provide a disincentive to resumption of full-time employment or to subsidize \u2014 at the State Insurance Fund\u2019s or self-insured employer\u2019s expense \u2014 a part-time lifestyle. Conversely, if a part-time job is the only work available within a claimant\u2019s post-injury capabilities, he or she should not be discouraged from accepting it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">The present claimant had a minimal physical-capability restriction \u2014 no repetitive lifting of over seventy-five pounds \u2014 that would preclude few jobs. This left claimant with a wide array of lighter jobs that he could have performed on a full-time basis. Since claimant provided no evidence of a job search that might have shown that such full-time work was unavailable, the commission did not abuse its discretion in concluding that claimant voluntarily removed himself from the full-time labor market and thus limited himself to part-time work for reasons unrelated to his injury. Such a voluntary limitation bars wage-loss compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b586-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
