The court of common pleas may also appoint counsel to represent the defendant at the hearing if the defendant desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED by the court that, as soon as the court of common pleas has made findings of fact pursuant to this order, the court of common pleas shall immediately transmit the record of the hearing, including all exhibits thereto and the findings and opinion of the court of common pleas, directly to this court for further proceedings. At all times during this limited remand, this court shall retain jurisdiction of this cause.
