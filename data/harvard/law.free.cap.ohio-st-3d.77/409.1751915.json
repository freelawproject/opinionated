For the reasons that follow, we find that the decision of the BTA upholding the Tax Commissioner\u2019s denial of the resident income tax credit for that portion of appellants\u2019 adjusted gross income which was subject to the SBT was neither unlawful nor unreasonable and, accordingly, we affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">R.C. 5747.02 levies an annual- tax on every individual residing in or earning or receiving income in Ohio. The annual tax in the case of an individual is measured by adjusted gross income less certain exemptions. R.C. 5747.05 allows certain tax credits against adjusted gross income, including a resident income tax credit for those portions of the adjusted gross income of a resident taxpayer that in another state or in the District of Columbia are subjected to a tax on income or a tax measured by income. As it existed in 1988, R.C. 5747.05 provided, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">\u201cThe following credits shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by section 5747.02 of the Revised Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">U $ $ $</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u201c(B)(1) The amount of tax otherwise due under section 5747.02 of the Revised Code on such portion of the adjusted gross income of a resident taxpayer that in another state or in the District of Columbia <em>is subjected to a tax on income or measured by income[.]\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Am.Sub.H.B. No. 171, 142 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2170, 2380.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The parties agree that the SBT is not a tax on income. Indeed, the fact that the SBT is not a tax on income is a well-established principle of Michigan law. In <em>Trinova Corp. v. Dept. of Treasury </em>(1989), 433 Mich. 141, 149-150, 445 N.W.2d 428, 431-432, affirmed (1991), 498 U.S. 358, 111 S.Ct. 818, 112 L.Ed.2d 884, the Michigan Supreme Court described some of the components of the SBT and specifically determined that the SBT is a value-added tax and not a tax on income:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u201cThe single business tax is a form of value added tax, although it is not a pure value added tax. * * * \u2018Value added is defined as the increase in the value of goods and services brought about by whatever a business does to them between the time of purchase and the time of sale.\u2019 [Haughey, The Economic Logic of the Single Business Tax (1976), 22 Wayne L.Rev. 1017, 1018.] In short, a value added tax is a tax upon business activity. The act [the Michigan Single Business Tax Act] employs a value added measure of business activity, but its intended effect is to impose a tax upon the privilege of conducting business activity within Michigan. <em>It is not a tax upon income. </em>MCL [Mich.Comp.Laws] 208.31(4); MSA [Mich.Stat.Ann.] 7.558(31)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u00ab * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\u201cThe computation of the tax involves several steps beginning with the calculation of the taxpayer\u2019s tax base. Under the act, \u2018tax base\u2019 is defined as business income (or loss) before apportionment subject to certain adjustments. MCL 208.9; MSA 7.558(9). \u2018Business income\u2019 is essentially federal taxable income. MCL 208.3(3); MSA 7.558(3)(3). Common adjustments to business income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>include additions to reflect the business consumption of labor and capital. Those include adding back compensation, depreciation, dividends, and interest <em>paid </em>by the taxpayer to the extent deducted from federal taxable income. Common deductions from business income include dividends, interest, and royalties <em>received </em>by the taxpayer to the extent included in federal taxable income. This income is deducted for the purpose of value added computation because it does not result from capital expenditure by the taxpayer.

Dept. of Treasury </em>(1985), 422 Mich. 473, 496-497, 373 N.W.2d 730, 741, and fn. 14 (finding that the SBT is a consumption-type value-added tax); <em>Caterpillar, Inc. v.

Dept. of Treasury </em>(1986), 152 Mich.App. 748, 753-754, 394 N.W.2d 472, 475 (recognizing that the SBT is a tax imposed upon business activity rather than upon the income which results from that activity); and <em>Wismer &amp; Becker Contracting Engineers v. Dept. of Treasury </em>(1985), 146 Mich.App. 690, 696, 382 N.W.2d 505, 507 (\u201cThe single business tax is a tax upon the privilege of doing business and not upon income.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In <em>Trinova, </em>498 U.S. 358, 111 S.Ct. 818, 112 L.Ed.2d 884, the United States Supreme Court described some of the general differences between a value-added tax (a \u201cVAT\u201d) and a corporate income tax:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u201cA VAT differs in important respects from a corporate income tax. A corporate income tax is based on the philosophy of ability to pay, as it consists of some portion of the profit remaining after a company has provided for its workers, suppliers, and other creditors. A VAT, on the other hand, is a much broader measure of a firm\u2019s total business activity. Even if a business entity is unprofitable, under normal circumstances it adds value to its products and, as a consequence, will owe some VAT. Because value added is a measure of actual business activity, a VAT correlates more closely to the volume of governmental services received by the taxpayer than does an income tax. Further, because value added does not fluctuate as widely as net income, a VAT provides a more stable source of revenue than the corporate income tax.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363-364, 111 S.Ct. at 824, 112 L.Ed.2d at 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Although the SBT is clearly not a tax on income, appellants contend that the SBT is a tax \u201cmeasured by income.\u201d Specifically, appellants suggest that the tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>base of the SBT is essentially federal taxable income and that the SBT is therefore based upon, computed, and measured by a taxpayer\u2019s net income. Conversely, the commissioner argues that \u201c[although the MSBT starts its calculation with federal taxable income, numerous adjustments are made to that amount in order to derive the Michigan tax base. Among those adjustments are additions of salary, depreciation, rent, interest, and other expenses that were deducted by the corporation for purposes of computing its federal taxable income. Those adjustments are so significant that any relationship that the starting point for the MSBT may have had to \u2018income\u2019 was lost on the way to computing the MSBT base.\u201d Thus, the commissioner urges that the SBT is not a tax measured by income.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In <em>Gillette, </em>198 Mich.App. 303, 497 N.W.2d 595, a Michigan appellate court specifically addressed the question whether the SBT is a tax \u201cmeasured by net income.\u201d In <em>Gillette, </em>the Gillette Company (\u201cGillette\u201d) challenged certain single business tax assessments that had been issued against it by the Michigan Department of Treasury. Gillette challenged the assessments based on Section 381, Title 15, U.S.Code, which prohibits states from levying a \u201cnet income tax\u201d on certain interstate commerce. Section 383, Title 15, U.S.Code defines \u201cnet income tax\u201d as \u201cany tax imposed on, or measured by, net income.\u201d Thus, the issue presented in <em>Gillette </em>was whether the Michigan SBT is a tax imposed on, or measured by, net income. The court in <em>Gillette </em>found that the SBT is a consumption-type value-added tax and not a tax on income. <em>Id. </em>at 308-309, 497 N.W.2d at 597-598. The court then turned its attention to the question whether the SBT is a tax measured by net income:</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\u201cNext, we consider whether the single business tax is a tax \u2018measured by\u2019 net income. The computation of the single business tax begins with the calculation of the taxpayer\u2019s tax base. \u2018Tax base\u2019 is defined as business income (or loss) before apportionment subject to certain adjustments. MCL 208.9; MSA 7.558(9); <em>Trinova, supra </em>* * * [433 Mich. 141, 150, 445 N.W.2d 428, 432]. \u2018Business income\u2019 is essentially federal taxable income. MCL 208.3(3); MSA 7.558(3)(3). Adjustments to business income include additions to reflect business consumption of labor and capital. Additions to business income include adding back compensation, depreciation, dividends, and interest <em>paid </em>by the taxpayer to the extent deducted from federal taxable income. Common deductions from business income include dividends, interest, and royalties <em>received </em>by the taxpayer to the extent included in federal taxable income. This income is deducted for the purpose of value added computation because it does not result from capital expenditure by the taxpayer. MCL 208.9; MSA 7.558(9); <em>Trinova, supra, </em>433 Mich, [at 150-151, 445 N.W.2d at 432]. Once the tax base is calculated, the portion of the value added that is attributable to Michigan must be determined. MCL 208.45; MSA 7.558(45). After the tax base has been apportioned and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>subjected to certain adjustments, it is multiplied by 2.35 percent to determine the taxpayer\u2019s tax liability. MCL 208.31(1); MSA 7.558(31)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u201cIt is clear from the theory underlying the single business tax and the methods used to calculate the tax base and the apportionment formula, that <em>the single business tax is not a tax \u2018measured by net </em>income.\u2019 Although business income or federal taxable income is a starting point for and a component of the tax base, because of the extensive adjustments required to compute the single business tax, we cannot say that the tax is \u2018measured by\u2019 net income. Accordingly, we conclude that the restriction imposed by * * * [Section 381, Title 15, U.S.Code] does not apply to taxes imposed under the Single Business Tax Act.\u201d (Emphasis added in part; footnotes omitted.) <em>Gillette, </em>198 Mich.App. at 309-311, 497 N.W.2d at 598-599.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Therefore, the Michigan appellate courts have clearly determined that the SBT is neither a tax on income nor a tax measured by income. Research reveals that a number of authorities throughout this country agree with the view that Michigan\u2019s SBT is neither a tax on income nor a tax measured by income. See, <em>e.g., Kellogg Sales Co. v. Dept. of Revenue </em>(1987), 10 Ore. Tax Rep. 480, 1987 WL 18463; <em>In re Appeal of Dayton Hudson Corp. </em>(Feb. 3, 1994), Cal. Bd. of Equalization Nos. 89A-0405-JV and 90R-0247-JV, unreported; and <em>In re Ruling Request </em>(Oct. 17, 1994), Va.Dept. of Tax. No. P.D. 94-313, unreported. See, also, <em>Revenue Cabinet v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(Ky.App.1990), 794 S.W.2d 178. We find no compelling reason to deviate from the Michigan decisional law on this issue. Accordingly, we follow the lead of the Michigan appellate courts in finding that the SBT is not a tax on income or a tax measured by income.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The BTA determined that the SBT is neither a tax on income nor a tax measured by income and that, therefore, appellants were not entitled to a resident income tax credit under former R.C. 5747.05(B) relative to the single business taxes paid by Simplex to Michigan. The decision of the BTA is neither unlawful nor unreasonable and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b548-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
