Our examination of the appellate record shows that appellate counsel did raise the issue contained in proposed assignment of error II. But as to the issues contained in proposed assignments of error I, III, IV, and V, we agree with Allen that his counsel did not raise these issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>It does not follow, however, that the judgment must be reversed. It has long been established \u201cthat where the judgment is correct, a reviewing court is not authorized to reverse such judgment merely because erroneous reasons were assigned as the basis thereof.\u201d <em>Agricultural Ins. Co. v. Constantine </em>(1944), 144 Ohio St. 275, 284, 29 O.O. 426, 430, 58 N.E.2d 658, 663. See, also, <em>e.g., Myers v. Garson </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 610, 614-615, 614 N.E.2d 742, 745; <em>State ex rel Keenan v. Calabrese </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 176, 179, 631 N.E.2d 119, 122; <em>Wright v. Ghee </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 465, 467, 659 N.E.2d 1261, 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The judgment in this case was correct. An applicant under App.R. 26(B) must show that \u201cthere is a genuine issue as to whether the applicant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d App.R. 26(B)(5). Allen made no such showing here. His allegedly ineffective appellate counsel raised twenty-two assignments of error on appeal. \u201cCounsel could have reasonably decided they could not add [eight] more issues without \u2018burying good arguments * * * in a verbal mound made up of strong and weak contentions.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 53, 630 N.E.2d 339, 353, quoting <em>Jones v. Barnes </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 745, 753, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 3313, 77 L.Ed.2d 987, 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Nor are Allen\u2019s new assignments of error especially compelling; indeed, all eight are factually, legally, and logically weak. A competent attorney could easily discount the chance of success of these issues and elect to spend time on other issues instead. Appellate counsel\u2019s refusal to raise these weak arguments simply does not create a genuine issue of ineffective assistance. Allen\u2019s first proposition of law is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">In Allen\u2019s second proposition of law, he contends that the court of appeals prematurely decided the merits of proposed assignments of error VI through VIII. On the initial application for reopening, the court of appeals is to determine the existence of \u201ca genuine issueE<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] as to whether the applicant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d App.R. 26(B)(5). If the applicant raises a genuine issue on that point, the application is granted, <em>id., </em>and the applicant wins the right to brief both the ineffective-assistance issue and the merits of the appeal. See App.R. 26(B)(7) and (B)(9), and July 1, 1993 Staff Note to App.R. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Allen claims that the court of appeals skipped a step: instead of confining itself to deciding whether Allen\u2019s application raised a <em>genuine issue </em>of ineffective assistance, the court simply decided the merits of his claims. Allen contends that the court of appeals could not make that determination on the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>application alone; that his proposed assignments of error had arguable merit; and that therefore the court of appeals should have given him a chance to fully brief his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">It is admittedly unclear whether the court of appeals applied the \u201cgenuine issue\u201d standard. However, as already stated, we find that Allen\u2019s claims fail to raise a genuine issue of ineffective assistance. Thus, the judgment was correct even if the reasoning was not. We overrule Allen\u2019s second proposition of law. The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b308-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\">. We perceive no merit in Alien\u2019s proposed distinction <em>between </em>\u201ca genuine issue,\u201d which is the <em>term </em>used in App.R. 26(B), and \u201ca colorable claim of ineffective assistance,\u201d the formulation used in the 1993 Staff Note to App.R. 26. Of course, if there were any distinction, the language of the rule would control over the Staff Note, Allen\u2019s argument to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
