Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946, and <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Where medical evidence establishes only a claimant\u2019s permanent partial impairment due to industrial injury, the commission must deny PTD unless the claimant\u2019s age, work experience, education, or other relevant characteristics, commonly referred to as the <em>Stephenson </em>factors, foreclose sustained remunerative employment. <em>State ex rel. Hopkins v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>36, 39-40, 635 N.E.2d 1257, 1259; <em>State ex rel. Lawrence v. Am. Lubricants Co</em>. (1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 321, 322, 533 N.E.2d 344, 345-346; <em>State ex rel. Hartung v. Columbus </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 257, 258, 560 N.E.2d 196, 198. And, for all its determinations, <em>Noll </em>requires the commission \u201cto prepare orders that are \u2018fact-specific and which contain reasons explaining its decisions. * * * Such order[s] must specifically state what evidence has been relied upon to reach its conclusion and, most important, briefly explain the basis of its decision[s].\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Pass v. C.S.T. Extraction </em>Co. (1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 373, 375, 658 N.E.2d 1055, 1057, quoting <em>Noll, </em>57 Ohio St.3d at 206, 567 N.E.2d at 249. The commission\u2019s failure to specify and explain the impact of the <em>Stephenson </em>factors, in accordance with <em>Noll, </em>is an abuse of discretion, and a writ of mandamus will issue to correct the abuse. <em>State ex rel. Ranomer v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 134, 137, 642 N.E.2d 373, 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Dr. Amendt estimated King\u2019s impairment at forty-two percent. In considering the <em>Stephenson </em>factors, the commission found that King\u2019s low level of education reduced his employment prospects, but that his age and varied work history suggested his potential for retraining and that his severed forefinger and blindness were not impediments to employment based on his work record. The commission also found, based on Dr. Amendt\u2019s report, that King was physically capable of performing light duty jobs not performed at heights. This explanation is explicit enough to allow meaningful judicial review, which was the purpose behind <em>Noll. Noll, </em>57 Ohio St.3d at 206, 567 N.E.2d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">King, however, argues that these conclusions are insufficient under <em>Noll </em>because they do not account for rehabilitation reports suggesting his inability to perform heavy labor, his lack of skills transferable to sedentary employment, and his inability to be retrained. King also seems to argue that in determining a claimant\u2019s capacity for sustained remunerative employment, the commission can consider only \u201cnonmedical\u201d evidence from vocational experts; it cannot deduce employability from evidence prepared by a medical expert. King\u2019s arguments, which are directed more to the weight of evidence than to the order\u2019s compliance with <em>Noll </em>as to form and content, see <em>State ex rel. Ellis v. McGraw Edison Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 92, 94, 609 N.E.2d 164, 165, lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Various reports completed by staff at the J. Leonard Camera Industrial Rehabilitation Center are evidence that King\u2019s allowed condition, together with his other physical and vocational characteristics, significantly impede his reemployment even in a sedentary capacity. The reports further suggest that his prospects for rehabilitation were poor. The commission, however, credited Dr. Amendt\u2019s contrary assessment to the effect that King was presently capable of light lifting and could benefit from rehabilitation programs for pain and stress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>management. It also drew its own conclusions from King\u2019s age and work experience as a truck driver, church bell installer, and drywaller.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The commission is the exclusive evaluator of disability and evidentiary weight. <em>Ellis, supra, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 94, 609 N.E.2d at 165. It is the commission\u2019s prerogative to interpret evidence and draw reasonable inferences. <em>State ex rel. West v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 354, 356, 658 N.E.2d 780, 782. Moreover, the commission was not bound to accept the vocational reports of the rehabilitation center staff. Rather, \u201cSpecialized vocational or rehabilitation reports are not accorded greater weight than other evidence.\u201d <em>Ellis, supra, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 94, 609 N.E.2d at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The commission exercised its authority here by choosing between the competing assessments of King\u2019s physical capacity and inferring from Dr. Amendt\u2019s report, King\u2019s relative youth, and his assorted work experience that he was not foreclosed from all employment. The facts underlying this conclusion were uncontested. Thus, \u201csome evidence\u201d exists for the commission\u2019s decision and it does not manifest an abuse of discretion. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936; <em>West, supra, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 356, 658 N.E.2d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\"><em>State ex rel. Haddix v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 59, 636 N.E.2d 323, does not persuade us to hold otherwise. Under <em>Haddix, Noll </em>compliance requires that the commission specifically articulate the basis for its inferences about employment potential, which the commission did not do here with respect to its assessment of King\u2019s \u201cvariety of jobs.\u201d There, we granted mandamus to vacate the commission\u2019s denial of PTD because the commission had cited only the \u201cvaried vocational background\u201d of a sixty-year-old claimant who had an eighth grade education as some evidence that the claimant could return to the workforce notwithstanding his sixty-five percent impairment. <em>Id. </em>at 60, 636 N.E.2d at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">In <em>Haddix, </em>however, the claimant\u2019s work experience was the only <em>Stephenson </em>factor that justified the denial of PTD; here, the commission also relied on King\u2019s relative youth in combination with his ability to perform light duty work. Thus, at least one <em>Stephenson </em>factor, age, continues to represent some evidence in support of the commission\u2019s order. The evidence is not particularly compelling to us, but we have often said that we will not substitute our judgment for the commission\u2019s. <em>State ex rel. Moss v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 414, 417, 662 N.E.2d 364, 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Accordingly, we find that the commission\u2019s decision was written in compliance with <em>Stephenson </em>and <em>Noll </em>and based on \u201csome evidence.\u201d The court of appeals\u2019 judgment, therefore, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Moyer, C.J., F.E.
