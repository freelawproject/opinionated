On objections to submission of fees and costs. The court, having considered appellee\u2019s fee application, grants fees in the amount of $2,000. This fee award reflects the court\u2019s skepticism as to the reasonableness of thirty-five hours of a partner\u2019s time plus twenty-nine hours of an associate\u2019s time for preparation of a thirteen-page memorandum opposing jurisdiction \u2014 particularly because appellee pointed to the repetitive nature of this appeal as a justification to impose sanctions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b784-14\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., dissent and would award the attorney fees requested.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
