In no event shall such compensation exceed the maximum reimbursement relief award established by the state which the claimant would have been entitled to had he not been injured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Appellant claims that her award should not have been based upon R.C. 4127.04, but, rather, former R.C. 4123.59(B), which provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">\u201cIn case an injury to or an occupational disease contracted by an employee causes his death, benefits shall be in the amount and to the persons following:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">\u201c * <em>* </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">\u201c(B) If there are wholly dependent persons at the time of the death, the weekly payment shall be sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the average weekly wage, but not to exceed a maximum aggregate amount of weekly compensation which is equal to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the statewide average <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, <em>and not in any event less than a minimum amount of weekly compensation which is equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, regardless of the average weekly wage </em>* * <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) 136 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In support of her position that her weekly death benefit award should have been based upon R.C. 4123.59(B), appellant relies, <em>inter alia, </em>on R.C. 4127.03 and 4127.13. Former R.C. 4127.03, 1953 H.B. No. 1, provided, in part, that \u201c[e]very work-relief employee who sustains an injury and the dependents of such as are killed, in the course of and arising out of employment, * * * shall be entitled to receive out of the public work-relief employees\u2019 compensation fund, compensation [and] death benefits * * * for loss sustained on account of such injury or death, <em>as is provided for by sections 4123.01 to 4123.94, inclusive, of the Revised Code.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Relying on this italicized language, appellant points out that R.C. 4123.59(B) falls within R.C. Chapter 4123 and, therefore, she is entitled to at least fifty percent of the statewide average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Further, former R.C. 4127.13, 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3964, provided that \u201c[sjections 4123.01 to 4123.94, except sections 4123.519, 4123.62, and 4123.64, apply to sections 4127.01 to 4127.14, of the Revised Code.\u201d Appellant contends that because R.C. 4127.13 does not specifically exclude R.C. 4123.59 from applying to R.C. Chapter 4127, the General Assembly intended that R.C. 4123.59(B) govern the amount of benefits available to dependent persons of work-relief employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">At first glance, appellant\u2019s statutory arguments regarding R.C. 4127.03 and 4127.13 appear to have some merit. Appellant\u2019s position is arguable given the general policy of workers\u2019 compensation legislation, which requires a liberal construction of such laws. See R.C. 4123.95.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 3 However, it is apparent that the General Assembly, in enacting R.C. Chapter 4127 and, particularly, R.C. 4127.04, intended to establish a separate method for determining benefits for work-relief employees and their dependents. The last paragraph of R.C. 4127.03 provided that \u201c[a]ll compensation payable under sections 4127.01 to 4127.14, inclusive, of the Revised Code, shall be paid on the basis of computation provided for in such sections.\u201d Further, R.C. 4127.13 specifically excludes from application to work-relief claims the foundational statute (R.C. 4123.62[C]) for calculating benefits under R.C. 4123.59(B). Hence, it is evident that the General Assembly intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>that R.C. 4127.04 be the applicable statute when determining awards to work-relief employees and their dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Appellant also contends that even if we conclude that the commission\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 4127.04 was proper, its classification scheme, which treats dependents of work-relief employees differently from dependents of non-work-relief employees, violates the Equal Protection Clauses of both the Ohio and United States Constitutions. We agree. R.C. 4127.04 clearly violates appellant\u2019s right to equal protection of the laws. R.C. 4127.04 also contravenes the public policy which prompted Ohio\u2019s system of workers\u2019 compensation legislation and defeats the purpose of Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In considering appellant\u2019s constitutional claim, we are mindful of the fundamental principle that legislative enactments are presumed constitutional. <em>Adamsky v. Buckeye Local School Dist. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 360, 361, 653 N.E.2d 212, 214; <em>State v. Gill </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 53, 55, 584 N.E.2d 1200, 1201; and <em>Arnold v. Cleveland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 35, 38, 616 N.E.2d 163, 166. We are also aware that \u201cdiscrimination against individuals or groups is sometimes an inevitable result of the operation of a statute. The mere fact that a statute discriminates does not mean that the statute must be unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Roseman v. Firemen &amp; Policemen\u2019s Death Benefit Fund </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 443, 446-447, 613 N.E.2d 574, 577. See, also, <em>Adamsky, supra, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 362, 653 N.E.2d at 214. However, all laws, including legislation involving workers\u2019 compensation, are subject to the limitations imposed by the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. See <em>Kinney v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp. </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 120, 122, 70 O.O.2d 206, 207-208, 322 N.E.2d 880, 882, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; * * * nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Similarly, Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution states that \u201c[a]ll political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal protection and benefit, and they have a right to alter, reform, or abolish the same, whenever they may deem it necessary; and no special privileges or immunities shall ever be granted, that may not be altered, revoked, or repealed by the general assembly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">These constitutional guarantees require that all similarly situated individuals be treated in a similar manner. <em>State ex rel. Doersam v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 115, 119, 543 N.E.2d 1169, 1173. In other words, laws are to operate equally upon persons who are identified in the same class.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Ohio\u2019s system of compensating employees and their dependents is predicated upon Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. This provision establishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>that one objective of such a system is to compensate <em>\u201cworkmen and their dependents, </em>for death, injuries or occupational disease, occasioned in the course of such workmen\u2019s <em>employment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Clearly, R.C. 4127.04 and 4123.59 were enacted to fulfill this objective of compensating employees and their dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Appellant\u2019s decedent was a \u201cwork-relief employee\u201d as defined in R.C. 4127.01(A), and his death occurred as a result of a disease contracted in the course of his employment. Further, R.C. 4123.01(A)(1)(a) defines \u201cemployee\u201d to include \u201c[ejvery person in the service of the state, or of any county, municipal corporation, township, or school district therein.\u201d Appellant\u2019s decedent was thus an \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of receiving compensation due. See <em>Indus. Comm. v. McWhorter </em>(1934), 129 Ohio St. 40, 1 O.O. 353, 193 N.E. 620, syllabus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Notwithstanding, appellant was awarded a weekly benefit of $33.11, as a dependent of a work-relief employee, which was far below the minimum benefit available to dependents of non-work-relief employees set forth in R.C. 4123.59(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In <em>State ex rel. Nyitray v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 2 Ohio St.3d 173, 176, 2 OBR 715, 717, 443 N.E.2d 962, 965, relying on <em>Kinney, supra, </em>we noted that legislation could survive constitutional scrutiny if the statute at issue were \u201crationally related to the accomplishment of some state objective at least as important as the purpose contained in the Constitution [Section 35, Article II] and reflected in the statute.\u201d In <em>Doersam, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 120, 543 N.E.2d at 1174, we stated that \u201ca classification of persons will not be suspect when the law establishing the classification relates to a legitimate governmental purpose. If the means employed by the law to achieve its ends is the classification of persons who are accorded differing benefits or assessed differing burdens, the law will be tested under the equal protection guarantee. If the classification does not meet or does not have a sufficient relationship to a required governmental purpose, then the law cannot withstand scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d We noted further that \u201c \u2018[e]qual protection of the laws requires the existence of reasonable grounds for making a distinction between those within and those outside a designated class.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Nyitray, </em>2 Ohio St.3d at 175, 2 OBR at 717, 443 N.E.2d at 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>R.C. 4127.04 creates a separate classification of dependent persons based only on the status of the employee. The statute does not treat similarly situated persons \u2014 all employees and their dependents \u2014 in a similar manner. Thus, we must determine whether this disparate treatment is based upon \u201cany legitimate governmental purpose. If it was, then the legislation meets constitutional muster. If not, then a violation of equal protection must be found.\u201d <em>Doersam, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 120, 543 N.E.2d at 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The Public Works Relief Compensation Act (R.C. Chapter 4127) was originally enacted as emergency legislation \u201cnecessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety.\u201d Section 17, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 495, 116 Ohio Laws, Part I, 212, 217. Section 17 also provided that \u201c[t]he reason for such necessity lies in the fact that it has become immediately necessary to provide a separate system of compensation for public work-relief employes and their dependents, due to the fact that considerations arise with respect to the hazards of employment and injuries of such employes which do not apply to the other employes mentioned in the workmen\u2019s compensation law of Ohio, and also because of the fact that this class of employment was neither foreseen nor contemplated by the legislature in originally framing the workmen\u2019s compensation law of Ohio, and there has been accordingly an unexpected increased burden placed upon the state insurance fund in compensating such employes out of that fund.\u201d 116 Ohio Laws at 217-218.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">However, this court has previously rejected classifications in legislation to ensure the financial security of the workers\u2019 compensation insurance fund. See <em>Doersam, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 120, 543 N.E.2d at 1174. In fact, we have specifically held that \u201c \u2018conserving funds is not a viable basis for denying compensation to those entitled to it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121, 543 N.E.2d at 1174, quoting <em>Nyitray, supra, </em>2 Ohio St.3d at 177, 2 OBR at 719, 443 N.E.2d at 966. Moreover, it escapes us how the classifications created by R.C. 4127.04 tend to further the \u201chealth, peace, morals, education or the good order of the people. Nor do the classifications increase the industry of the state, develop our resources, or add to the state\u2019s wealth or prosperity.\u201d <em>Doersam, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 121, 543 N.E.2d at 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The court of appeals held that R.C. 4127.04 is rationally related to a legitimate government objective. Specifically, the court of appeals adopted the referee\u2019s finding that \u201cdifferent social and economic goals\u201d justified the disparate treatment .afforded employees and their dependents under R.C. 4127.04. While the court of appeals did not expand on this statement, we take it to mean that providing lesser benefits to dependents of a deceased employee who engaged in work relief would somehow discourage reliance on public assistance. We cannot accept this argument as being a rational basis for such blatant disparate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>R.C. 4127.04 treats those who are less fortunate, simply because they are less fortunate, differently from others similarly situated. Appellant\u2019s decedent was an employee. He was working in accordance with the requirements to receive public assistance. He contracted a disease as part of that employment, and died as a result of the disease. Appellant\u2019s widow should be afforded the protection that other widows of other deceased injured employees receive. In this regard, we view R.C. 4127.04 as. inherently unfair and contrary to the purpose of compensating employees and dependents stated in Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. See, <em>e.g., Nyitray, </em>2 Ohio St.3d at 175-176, 2 OBR at 717, 443 N.E.2d at 964-965.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The arbitrary nature of R.C. 4127.04 can best be illustrated by an example which considers the minimum award available to non-work-relief dependents, <em>regardless of the employee\u2019s weekly wage. </em>For instance, if appellant\u2019s decedent had been engaged the week preceding his death in non-work-relief employment paying a weekly wage of $33.11, appellant would not have been limited to a weekly death benefit of $33.11. Rather, appellant would have been entitled to a benefit equal to fifty percent of the statewide average weekly wage, according to R.C. 4123.59(B), which is considerably greater than $33.11. See R.C. 4123.62(C). We can conceive of no reasonable justification for such disparate treatment between work-relief employees and non-work-relief employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The classification created by R.C. 4127.04 is not rationally related to a legitimate government objective. \u201cClearly, the workers\u2019 compensation system is designed to aid workers and their dependents and not intended to penalize victims by denying compensation where due.\u201d <em>Nyitray, </em>2 Ohio St.3d at 178, 2 OBR at 719, 443 N.E.2d at 966. As was eloquently stated by Judge Wilkin in <em>McWhorter, supra, </em>129 Ohio St. at 46, 1 O.O. at 355-356, 193 N.E. at 622:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u201cIt seems to this court more in harmony with the spirit of work-relief legislation to hold the claimant to be an employee than to hold him to be a pauper or ward. A sound public policy prompts the efforts of the state to preserve the self-reliance of its citizens, even if at extra expense. It is as important to preserve the character as to preserve the lives of its citizens. \u2018Ill fares the land * * * where wealth accumulates and men decay.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Accordingly, we hold that R.C. 4127.04 unjustifiably discriminates against dependents of work-relief employees by preventing such dependents from receiving the same benefits as dependents of other employees whose death is caused by a work-related injury or disease. Therefore, R.C. 4127.04 violates the Equal Protection Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals denying appellant\u2019s writ of mandamus is reversed, and the commission is ordered to determine appellant\u2019s benefits in accordance with this decision. Appellant is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>dependent person of a decedent whose injury and subsequent death were caused by a work-related disease, and, therefore, she is entitled to the minimum benefit set forth in R.C. 4123.59(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b342-5\">Resnick, F.E.

In <em>Indus. Comm. v. McWhorter </em>(1934), 129 Ohio St. 40, 1 O.O. 353, 193 N.E. 620, syllabus, this court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u201cOne who applies to a municipality for relief and is given the opportunity, and required, to work for the support which he is to receive, and who, in response to such opportunity and requirement, works in one of the municipal departments which employs labor, under the direction of a municipal foreman, at a regular\u2019 daily wage, payable alternately in groceries and in cash, is in the service and is an employee of the municipality within the meaning of Section 1465-61 of the General Code; and if he sustains an injury while engaged in such work, is entitled to the benefits of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b342-8\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AWs\">concurring. I write only to express my incredulity that this matter has reached this court. Ohio\u2019s welfare and workers\u2019 compensation systems heartlessly memorialized the difficult life of Frank Patterson with a cruel epitaph: \u201cHe Shouldn\u2019t Have Tried.\u201d Patterson attempted to live his life with some dignity. He did not take a handout \u2014 he was willing to work in order to receive public assistance. God knows it was not pleasant work \u2014 his on-the-job exposure to pigeon droppings caused his mortal illness. But \u201cworkfare\u201d and its promise of improved self-esteem and self-reliance left Patterson dead and his widow with an insulting $33.11 per week. How poor off are we that this state cannot offer the families of work-relief employees killed on the job the same treatment as other workers killed on the job? Is death on work relief jobs so prevalent that the Department of Human Services cannot afford to reimburse the workers\u2019 compensation fund for the cost of the benefits? Did the General Assembly really intend that the widow Patterson should survive on $1,721.72 per year? Would the extra seven thousand dollars a year Mrs. Patterson requests bust Ohio\u2019s $16 billion budget? Or is our deficit not monetary but rather a shortfall in compassion and humanity?</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b342-9\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-T\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent on the basis that the appellant has not shown an equal protection violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">In order for this court to strike down a democratically produced statute based on equal protection, we must follow a legitimate process independent of our social or moral preferences. We start with the presumption of constitutionality and must uphold the statute unless its unconstitutionality is shown beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 558, 560, 664 N.E.2d 926, 928. In this case, the challengers must show that the classification is wholly irrelevant to any state purpose. <em>Roseman v. Firemen &amp; Policemen\u2019s Death Benefit Fund </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 443. 447. 613 N.E.2d 574. 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The majority finds appellant has met the burden of demonstrating the unconstitutionality of the separate compensation system for work-relief employees with broad conclusions sounding in the realm of social \u201crightness,\u201d such as \u201cinherently unfair,\u201d \u201cblatant disparate treatment,\u201d \u201cthose who are less fortunate,\u201d and this \u201cwidow should be afforded the protection that other widows * * * receive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">My personal preference about the treatment of widows falls right in line with the majority\u2019s. Such personal preferences necessarily aside, however, I believe the appellant has failed to demonstrate that the legislative decision to set up different systems for compensating relief-workers and wage-earning workers upon death or injury is wholly irrelevant to any state purpose. The majority outlines the origins of this separate system for relief workers and the case to which the legislature was responding. Classifying such workers differently need only bear some rational relationship to a legitimate governmental objective. <em>Id. </em>The legitimacy of the objective is judged by relevance to a state purpose \u2014 not by whether we judges personally can abide such objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">I agree with the court of appeals that the challenged statute does not offend equal protection principles. I would, therefore, affirm the judgment and deny the writ.</p>\n<judges id=\"b343-7\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b343-8\">Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent and join Justice Cook\u2019s dissent. This was a tragic death and my sympathies are the same as those of the majority of this court. There is great temptation to aw\u00e1rd Patterson\u2019s widow a sum greater than $33.11 per week. It is easy to do with the stroke of a pen. But to do so requires that we invalidate an entire statutory system based solely on the definition of \u201cemployee,\u201d without taking into account all of the other circumstances that legitimately surround that single word.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system is designed to provide protection to the employee for work-related injuries without relation to fault. In return, the employer is protected from suits, but funds the system. Thousands of Ohio companies, large and small, contribute to provide the financial basis of workers\u2019 compensation. The cost and risks are spread broadly throughout the system, but those who benefit from the employee\u2019s work shoulder the burden of its costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">The work-relief system is wholly different in character and purpose. It is a system of public works designed to supplement welfare. It is not funded by employers who benefit from such work. Instead, it is funded by the taxpayer, as is the rest of the welfare system. Although the legislature added a workfare-related compensation plan, the plan specifically related to the workfare and was an extension of welfare protection. It is distinguished by statute from the employer-funded workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The majority would now discard the entire system under an equal protection argument because appellant\u2019s decedent was an \u201cemployee\u201d and because cost should be no deterrent. But as Justice Cook pointed out, the equal protection argument fails because the two systems are wholly unequal in purpose, character, and basis. The beneficiary of a workfare employee who dies as a result of a work-related injury will now receive far greater benefits than the workfare employee received when alive from a system funded by the taxpayer \u2014 an extended, increased welfare benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">This is a decision that should not be made by the courts under the guise of \u201cequal protection.\u201d There are enormous costs associated with this decision. How will these new expenses be funded? These are issues that require debate, testimony, studies, compromise \u2014 all part of the legislative process. We as a court are not equipped to play that role, as tempting and sympathetic as the facts in this case are.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The reality is that a workfare recipient is a welfare recipient whereas a wage-earner is supported by the Ohio employers who fund the workers\u2019 compensation system. These employees are <em>not </em>similarly situated. Equal protection does not apply. Any such massive changes in the compensation system are best left to the legislature.</p>\n<judges id=\"b344-7\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
