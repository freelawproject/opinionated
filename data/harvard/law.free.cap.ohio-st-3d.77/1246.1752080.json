He asserts that Judge Cleary should be disqualified because affiant and his family were active supporters of Judge Cleary\u2019s election opponent and because her denial of a motion for a continuance in this case apparently was based on affiant\u2019s support of Judge Cleary\u2019s opponent.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Judge Cleary has requested that I recuse myself from ruling on this affidavit of disqualification because of my entry in <em>In re Disqualification of Cleary </em>(June 16, 1994), No. 94-AP-046, unreported. She asserts that this entry demonstrates a predisposition and an animosity toward her. I have reviewed that entry, in which I found the affiant\u2019s claim of bias and prejudice not to be well taken and denied the request for disqualification, and conclude that it was not the product of a predisposition or animosity toward Judge Cleary. The request to recuse is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">With respect to affiant\u2019s claim of bias and prejudice on the part of Judge Cleary, a judge\u2019s denial of a motion for a continuance is not evidence of bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Spahr </em>(1987), 36 Ohio St.3d 603, 522 N.E.2d 457. Moreover, the fact that a party or lawyer in a pending case campaigned for or against the judge is not grounds for disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Celebrezze </em>(1991), 74 Ohio St.3d 1231, 657 N.E.2d 1341. Affiant speculates that his support of Judge Cleary\u2019s opponent was the cause of the adverse ruling on the motion for a continuance (see paragraphs 1 and 7 of the affidavit), but he fails to substantiate this assertion. Based on the record before me, I cannot conclude that Judge Cleary is biased or prejudiced for or against any party to this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">For these reasons, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well taken and is denied. The case shall proceed before Judge Cleary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
