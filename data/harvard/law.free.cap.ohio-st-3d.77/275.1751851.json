Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. The court of appeals agreed with claimant\u2019s underlying contention, but did not invoke <em>Gay. </em>We affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">The commission\u2019s order violates <em>Noll </em>because it does not explain how claimant\u2019s nonmedical factors combine to make him work-amenable. The commission\u2019s mere acknowledgment of claimant\u2019s age and education is not enough. <em>State ex rel. Moss v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 414, 662 N.E.2d 364; see <em>State ex rel. Hanna v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 120, 630 N.E.2d 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">The commission\u2019s discussion of claimant\u2019s work history is also inadequate. With increasing, and disturbing, frequency we are finding that no matter what claimant\u2019s employment background is, the commission finds skills \u2014 almost always unidentified \u2014 that are allegedly transferable to sedentary work. In some cases, depending on the claimant\u2019s background, these skills are self-evident. In many cases, they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>In <em>State ex rel. Haddix v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 59, 61, 636 N.E.2d 323, 324, we held:</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u201cThe commission determined that claimant\u2019s prior work as a gas station attendant and press operator provided him with skills transferable to sedentary employment. The commission\u2019s order, however, does not identify what those skills are. Such elaboration is critical in this case, since common sense suggests that neither prior work is, in and of itself, sedentary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The present claimant was an ironworker \u2014 a position that is neither sedentary nor light duty. Again, however, the commission found skills transferable to light work, without specifying what those skills were. The reference to supervisory skills, without more, is not enough in this case, given claimant\u2019s tenure as a working, as opposed to purely administrative, supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The commission\u2019s failure to produce a satisfactory order leaves us with two remedies \u2014 an award of permanent total disability compensation pursuant to <em>Gay </em>or a return to the commission for further consideration pursuant to <em>Noll. </em>We find the latter to be appropriate here, given claimant\u2019s medical profile. Dr. McCloud rather reluctantly assessed a thirty-percent impairment after suggesting that claimant may have been less than forthright in his medical presentation. The only restriction imposed by Dr. McCloud upon claimant was repetitive lifting in excess of twenty pounds. The lack of the often-seen restrictions on prolonged walking, sitting, standing, etc., appears to leave claimant with considerably more physical reserve than most back-injury claimants. This level of impairment and residual capacity are much more favorable than that generally seen in cases where <em>Gay </em>relief issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">For these reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b412-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
