The first order was returned to the commission by the court of appeals after the latter concluded that the order did not adequately explain its reasoning as <em>Noll </em>demands. The ensuing order, now before us, was also found by the appellate court to be NoZZ-deficient \u2014 a conclusion with which we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Claimant\u2019s medical capacity for sedentary work is not seriously disputed. At issue, therefore, are claimant\u2019s nonmedical disability factors, particularly her age, work history, and education. Beginning with the last element, the commission\u2019s disposition of the education factor was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">The tenor of the commission\u2019s analysis suggests a recognition of the impediment presented by claimant\u2019s seventh grade education. The commission reasoned, however, that the lack of formal schooling was offset, to some degree, by claimant\u2019s intellectual capacity to be retrained. This is a defensible conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">We recognize the obstacle that the lack of a high school degree can present. We also, however, recognize that the absence of a high school diploma does not necessarily denote a lack of a claimant\u2019s intelligence. In some cases, an otherwise bright claimant may lack a diploma because uncontrollable circumstances forced the claimant to exit school prematurely. In this case, Dr. Tecklenburg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>concluded that claimant was intellectually capable of completing high school had she not been forced to leave to care for her siblings. The commission did not, therefore, abuse its discretion in finding that claimant\u2019s education was not a complete barrier to retraining.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The commission\u2019s treatment of claimant\u2019s work history is more tenuous. The commission noted claimant\u2019s prior factory employment, including her jobs in the 1940s as a cookie packer and as a tobacco bag catcher. While we acknowledge the commission\u2019s considerable latitude in the interpretation of nonmedical disability factors, we find that, in this instance, the commission\u2019s reliance on two positions that claimant performed nearly fifty years ago constitutes an abuse of discretion. Removing these jobs from our consideration leaves claimant with only one year of factory experience that is vastly outweighed by claimant\u2019s years of housekeeping \u2014 work she can no longer perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Two assumptions by the commission further undermine its analysis. The first is that every job produces some transferable skill. The second is that this claimant\u2019s prior jobs left her with skills transferable to sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The commission\u2019s first assumption ignores the plethora of imskilled jobs in the workplace. The second ignores that none of claimant\u2019s jobs had been sedentary. It is thus unclear how claimant\u2019s jobs would yield sedentary skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The commission could, of course, have facilitated review by identifying these perceived \u201cskills.\u201d Under similar circumstances, the court in <em>State ex rel. Haddix v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 59, 61, 636 N.E.2d 323, 324, held:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">\u201cThe commission determined that claimant\u2019s prior work as a gas station attendant and press operator provided him with skills transferable to sedentary employment. The commission\u2019s order, however, does not identify what those skills are. Such elaboration is critical in this case, since common sense suggests that neither prior work is, in and of itself, sedentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">\u201cThe commission responds that it \u2018inferred\u2019 from claimant\u2019s gas station job that claimant \u2018perform[ed] a variety of duties, which would include such things as pumping gas, washing windows, dealing with customers at retail, making change, filling out credit card slips, operating the cash register, and light custodial work.\u2019 Again, however, none of this explanation was stated in the order. Moreover, pumping gas, washing windows and light custodial duties do not suggest sedentary employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">\u201cThe commission\u2019s order, contrary to <em>Noll, </em>does not, therefore, adequately explain how these vocationally neutral and/or unfavorable factors combine to produce a claimant who is able to work. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">In summary, claimant spent all but one year of her recent work history employed as a housekeeper \u2014 a job that is now foreclosed by injury. At best, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>claimant\u2019s work history could be considered as vocationally neutral if viewed as being offset by claimant\u2019s capacity to retrain. It is perhaps more accurate to view claimant\u2019s work history unfavorably, but under no circumstances should it be deemed an asset. In so doing, the commission abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The final variable noted by the commission was claimant\u2019s age. The commission did not expressly declare claimant\u2019s age to be an asset or liability, although, again, the order\u2019s tone suggests recognition of the obstacles to employment that claimant\u2019s age (sixty-six) might provide. The effect of age, however, like other factors, can be diminished by other characteristics possessed by the claimant. An advanced age that might be employment-prohibitive to a laborer may not have the same effect on a white collar worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In this case, the commission appears to downplay the negative aspects of claimant\u2019s age by speculating that if the claimant indeed failed to return to work, it may be due to personal choice. We reject this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The claimant undeniably had that option, but there is no evidence that claimant ever voiced an unwillingness to return to work if able. To the contrary, claimant\u2019s permanent total disability compensation application and Dr. Tecklenburg\u2019s report reflect claimant\u2019s enjoyment of her work and her regret that she could not return to it. The commission\u2019s reasoning constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Taken together, these errors compel us to conclude that the commission\u2019s order does not satisfy <em>Noll. </em>Considering both the claimant\u2019s overall presentation and the commission\u2019s failure on two occasions to produce a Noii-compliant order, we hereby affirm the issuance of a writ of mandamus pursuant to our decision in <em>Gay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b146-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b146-12\">Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b146-13\">Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AE\">dissenting. Not only was the Industrial Commission\u2019s order supported by \u201csome\u201d evidence, it explained in great detail the factors involved in its denial of permanent total disability compensation. The majority seems to require an extraordinarily detailed listing of precise skills that can transfer to other work; yet I can think of a host of sedentary jobs that someone with claimant\u2019s background can perform based on the commission\u2019s summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">In addition, the majority\u2019s treatment of age virtually turns workers\u2019 compensation into a retirement program. I do not believe that the purpose of workers\u2019 compensation is to provide a cushion for everyone who reaches retirement age <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>and finds re-employment more difficult. Yet this is what this court seems to require of workers\u2019 compensation. There is inherent reverse age discrimination here \u2014 if an older worker sustains the same injury as a younger worker, under the majority\u2019s standard, the older worker is more likely to receive compensation for the same injury simply because of his or her age. This is unfair to both the younger worker and the employer. It also provides a disincentive to employers to hire older workers because of greater exposure to higher workers\u2019 compensation awards. I do not believe this is the intent of the majority\u2019s opinion, but I believe that it will be the result. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
