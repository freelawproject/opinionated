He claims that the common pleas court lost jurisdiction to convict him where he did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his constitutional right to be prosecuted by indictment. See <em>Wells v. Sacks </em>(1962), 115 Ohio App. 219, 20 O.O.2d 304, 184 N.E.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">The manner by which an accused is charged with a crime, whether by indictment returned by a grand jury or by information filed by the prosecuting attorney, is procedural rather than jurisdictional. <em>Wells v. Maxwell </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 198, 200, 22 O.O.2d 147, 148, 188 N.E.2d 160, 161; <em>Ex parte Stephens </em>(1960) , 171 Ohio St. 323, 324, 14 O.O.2d 1, 2, 170 N.E.2d 735, 737. After a judgment of conviction for the crimes charged in an indictment, the judgment binds a defendant for the crime for which he was convicted. <em>State v. Wozniak </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 517, 522-523, 18 O.O.2d 58, 61, 178 N.E.2d 800, 804. Therefore, following conviction and sentence, the defendant\u2019s remedy to challenge the validity or sufficiency of the indictment is by direct appeal rather than habeas corpus. <em>State ex rel. Simpson v. Lazaroff </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 571, 664 N.E.2d 937. Similarly, we hold that habeas corpus is not available to attack the validity or sufficiency of an information, since a judgment on an information also binds the defendant as long as the trial court has jurisdiction to try the defendant for the crime on which he was convicted and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">In addition, Beaucamp pled guilty to the charges contained in the information. His plea of guilty to the offenses waived any claimed right to an indictment. <em>Stacy v. Van Coren </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St.2d 188, 189, 47 O.O.2d 397, 398, 248 N.E.2d 603, 604 (Petitioner\u2019s actions in voluntarily entering a plea of guilty while represented by counsel constituted a waiver of his constitutional right to an indictment or information.). As in <em>Stacy, </em>Beaucamp was represented by counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>when he pled guilty and did not claim in his action that his guilty plea was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals properly dismissed Beaucamp\u2019s habeas corpus action. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b373-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
