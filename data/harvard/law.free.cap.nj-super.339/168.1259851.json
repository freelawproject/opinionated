On November 2, 1994, the Governor issued Executive Order No. 27, which required all State agencies to limit regulation of federal and state programs and to justify any decision to adopt an administrative rule for a program established under federal law or state statute that exceeds the requirements of an existing federal standard. 26 <em>N.J.R. </em>4723(a) (Dec. 5, 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-20\">On August 7, 1996, the Commissioner directed a policy memorandum to members of the Board, addressing the need for amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ment to the then-existing special education rules, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:28-1.1 to -12.1. The Board considered discussion-level drafts of proposed amendments, with comments and responses, and made them available to the public at the Board meetings of November 5,1997 and December 3, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The Board held public hearings on December 17, 1997, January 27, 28, and 29, 1998, and accepted written comments through January 30,1998. The Board received comments on the proposed special education regulations from over six hundred individuals and organizations. On March 4, 1998, the Commissioner directed a memorandum to members of the Board, summarizing the proposed new regulations and stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">This comprehensive review was conducted to improve special education programs by assuring a balance of flexibility and safeguards. An optimal level of regulation assures that the focus of special education is on instruction and the focus of the instruction is in the core curriculum content standards so that students with disabilities are afforded high quality instruction in a challenging curriculum designed to achieve high standards. Students with disabilities will also be included in the accountability system by participating in statewide assessments. Through such participation, the department may review individual progress and program effectiveness as it does for all students. Finally, the review was conducted to comply with the Individuals with Disabilities Act, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400 et seq., which was reauthorized on June 4,1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">The basis of the proposed new rules was presented as a policy statement to the State Board of Education on August 7, 1996. The major elements of the policy statement provided for: flexibility in the functioning of the child study team, changes in the evaluation process, elimination of the categorical classification system, a reduction in the number of special class types, establishment of class size limits, inclusion of all students with disabilities in statewide assessment, and incorporation of the separate rules regarding the plan to revise special education. In addition, clarification of existing rules regarding consent, notice, meetings, discipline, approved clinics and agencies, case manager, home instruction, services in nonpublie schools, and elimination of the outcomes-based innovative project were proposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">As noted above, the Individuals with Disabilities Act was recently reauthorized. There were many changes to the Act and, as a result, the regulations were further modified to reflect these new provisions. The federal requirements for discipline have been incorporated by reference. The United States Department of Education (USDOE) has indicated that they will adopt regulations in the spring of 1998 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>implement the act. It is highly likely that this will again require some revisions to these rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The Board then revised some areas of the pre-proposal and published the proposed regulations on April 6, 1998 for additional comment. 30 <em>N.J.R. </em>1219(b) (Apr. 6, 1998). The Board held a public hearing on April 15, 1998. The Commissioner sent a memorandum to the Board dated June 3, 1998, summarizing and analyzing the proposed regulations. The Board adopted the proposed regulations at its June 3, 1998 meeting, and the regulations became effective on July 6,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The challenged regulations, codified at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-1.1 to - 10.1, superseded and replaced the earlier special education regulations, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:28-1.1 to -12.1. On August 20, 1998, appellants filed a notice of appeal, challenging several provisions contained in the promulgated regulations, and raising fifty-five separate issues in their case information statement. This appeal was docketed as A-7451-97T1.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">On August 3, 1998, the Board published proposed amendments to certain sections of the new code. 30 <em>N.J.R. </em>2852(a) (Aug. 3, 1998). On October 7, 1998, the Board adopted the amendments and they became effective on November 2, 1998. 30 <em>N.J.R. </em>3491(a) (Nov. 2, 1998). On December 16, 1998, appellants filed an amended notice of appeal, to include these rule amendments in their challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">On March 12, 1999, the USDOE adopted new regulations, codified at 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>Part 300, which became effective on May 11, 1999. 64 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>12406 (Mar. 12, 1999). As a result of these revised federal regulations, the Commissioner sought to revise New Jersey\u2019s special education regulations to assure conformity, and proposed amendments for the Board to consider. On March 6, 2000, the Board issued proposed amendments to the regulations. 32 <em>N.J.R. </em>755(a) (Mar. 6, 2000). On May 5, 2000, these amendments were adopted, effective June 5, 2000. 32 <em>N.J.R. </em>2052(a) (June 5, 2000). Included in the publication of the adoption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>was a summary of comments from twelve different sources and responses thereto by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">On July 14, 2000, appellants filed a motion with this court, seeking leave to file an amended notice of appeal to encompass challenges to the June 5, 2000 rule amendments adopted by the Board. On July 27, 2000, we entered an order directing that the proposed amended notice of appeal be treated and docketed as a new appeal, and be calendared back-to-back with A-7451-97T1. In accordance with that order, the amended notice of appeal was docketed as A-6273-99T1.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Since adoption of the June 5, 2000 amendments to the regulations resolved a number of issues raised in the original appeal, A-7451-97T1, appellants, at our request, by letter dated December 15, 2000, outlined those claims that have now been resolved by the new amendments, or withdrawn, and those regulations they continue to challenge. Our opinion will focus only on those regulations still challenged by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">II. <em>The Federal Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u201cAlthough education is primarily a concern of state and local governments, the education of handicapped children is regulated by a complex scheme of federal and state statutes and administrative regulations.\u201d <em>Lascari v. Board of Educ., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>30, 33, 560 A.2d 1180 (1989).

Receipt of those funds is conditioned on a participating state\u2019s compliance with the IDEA\u2019S goals and requirements. New Jersey has elected to participate in the federal program. As such, it has enacted legislation, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:46-1 to -46, and adopted regulations, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>[now 6A:14-1.1 to -10.2], that assure all handicapped children the right to a free appropriate public education (FARE) as required by the IDEA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">[7d at 394, 702 A.2d 838 (other citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Accordingly, \u201cthe education of handicapped children is an exercise in cooperative federalism.\u201d <em>Lascari, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 33, 560 A2d 1180.

Funding eligibility, however, is conditioned upon a state\u2019s compliance with the extensive goals and procedures established in the IDEA. 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1412. A state is eligible for assistance under the IDEA if the state demonstrates that it \u201chas in effect policies and procedures to ensure that it meets\u201d the requirements of the IDEA, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1412(a), to, <em>inter alia, </em>ensure that a free appropriate public education (FAPE) is available to all children with disabilities, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A); provide a full educational opportunity to all children with disabilities and a timetable for accomplishing that goal, 20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(2); ensure the identification, location, and evaluation of children in need of special education and related services, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(3)(A); ensure the development, review, and revision of an individualized education plan (IEP) for children with disabilities, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(4); to the maximum extent, provide for the education of children with disabilities in the least restrictive environment (LEA), 20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(5)(A); es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tablish procedural safeguards for children with disabilities and their parents, 20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(6); provide for the proper evaluation of children with disabilities, 20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(7); and require the state educational agency (SEA) to examine data to determine if significant discrepancies are occurring in the rate of long-term suspensions and expulsions of children with disabilities, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(22).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The IDEA requires state or local educational agencies to conduct a full and individual initial evaluation before the initial provision of special education and related services to a child with a disability, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1414(a)(1)(A), as well as periodic reevaluations. 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1414(a)(2); 1414(b); 1414(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The LEA is required to provide notice to the parents of a child with a disability, \u201cdescrib[ing] any evaluation procedures such agency proposes to conduct.\u201d 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1414(b)(1). In conducting the evaluation, the LEA must use a variety of assessment tools and strategies, must refrain from using any single procedure as the sole criterion for the evaluation, and use technically sound instruments to assess the relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physical or developmental factors. 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1414(b)(2). Additionally, each LEA is required to apply certain criteria for the selection, use, and administering of tests used in the evaluative process, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1414(b)(3), and in the review of the evaluation data. 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1414(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">At the core of fulfilling the stated intent and purposes of the IDEA is the development, review, revision and implementation of an IEP that each SEA or LEA shall have in effect, at the beginning of each school year, for each child with a disability in its jurisdiction. 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1414(d)(2)(A).

The issues in these appeals focus on whether the New Jersey regulatory response meets the IDEA mandatory standards in the process for determination of the eligibility of children with disabilities for services; the methods of evaluation of such children; the development of the IEP; the opportunities for parental participation; the availability of critical documents in the child\u2019s native language; the effect of student discipline on the delivery of services; the sufficiency of procedural safeguards; the adequacy of program effectiveness evaluation; and several other areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Y. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">An administrative regulation is accorded a presumption of validity, and the party challenging it bears the burden of establishing that the regulation is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. <em>New Jersey State League of Municipalities v.

We have also declared several challenged regulations invalid, as violative of the IDEA, the federal special education regulations, or the New Jersey special education laws, and remanded the matter to the Commissioner and Board for the timely promulgation and adoption of curative regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Although not raised by the parties, we are compelled to make certain observations and comments that are apparent to us. One of the stated purposes and intended results of the sweeping changes made to the Department\u2019s special education regulations was to provide more flexibility and discretion to local school districts in the determination of eligibility and evaluation of children with disabilities, and in the provision of special education and related services to those children. Additionally, in general, the standards established in New Jersey\u2019s current special education regulations are intended to meet, but not exceed, the federal special education standards, as promulgated by the IDEA and its federal regulations. In contrast, the pre 1998 version of New Jersey\u2019s special education regulations exceeded the required federal standards in several respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Although, within the scope of the current challenges posed by appellants and on this record, these approaches by the Commissioner and Board are generally permissible, we are concerned with the potential adverse consequences of the application of these reduced regulatory standards, and of the effect that the greater flexibility and wider discretion vested in local school districts, will have on the eligibility and evaluation determinations concerning children with disabilities in the poorer, \u201cspecial-needs\u201d school districts in our State, and the provision of special education and related services to those children.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Since 1970, our State has been entangled in a generational struggle in an \u201cextraordinary effort to bring a thorough and efficient education to children in its poorest school districts.\u201d <em>Abbott by Abbott v.

We express this concern because of the past documented inability of the public schools in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the special needs districts to provide equal opportunities for a thorough and efficient education to their students. In our view, this concern is heightened when attention is focused on our most vulnerable student population \u2014 children with disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">[For publication purposes, we have abridged the opinion in a manner that discusses only those regulations we have invalidated.

By providing these reports and materials to parents in advance of the eligibility meeting, parents will be given the opportunity of time to, if desired, seek their own interpretation or translation of the documents, coupled with the notice in their native language, to allow for their meaningful participation in the eligibility meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Accordingly, the Board must adopt amendments to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-3.5(a), requiring local school districts to provide a copy of the evaluation report(s) and documentation of eligibility to the parents prior to the eligibility meeting.

Appellants contend these regulations should include reference to the Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) and a variety of agencies with DDD contracts, as well as the Department of Human Services, Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired (CBVI).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Appellants also note the Department\u2019s regulations only provide for the placement of secondary students in community rehabilitation programs approved by the DVRS, and do not instruct school districts to involve DDD and CBVI. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-4.7(f)(l) provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">(0 Secondary level students may be placed in community rehabilitation programs for vocational rehabilitation services according to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">1.

However, the IDEA does not require specific reference to agencies serving the blind or severely developmentally disabled. The phrase \u201cother agencies providing transition services\u201d in these regulatory provisions is sufficiently broad to encompass the DDD and CBVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">However, <em>N.J.A.C. 6A</em>:14-4.7(f)(1) fails to provide for placement of secondary-level students in programs approved by agencies other than only the DVRS.

Carroll, </em>87 F.3d 80, 82 (3d Cir.1996), there is no requirement that states must adopt regulations implementing all of the IDEA\u2019S provisions. Annexing relevant provisions of the IDEA or federal regulations is a sufficient method to achieve IDEA compliance. <em>See Booker v.

Moreover, our review of 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(k), found in Appendix A to the Department\u2019s regulations, and the federal discipline regulations, 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 300.519 to 300.529, found in Appendix D, discloses that these provisions are accessible and understandable.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Appellants also argue that the Department\u2019s regulations are arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable because they do not define certain terms that are used in 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(k)\u2014 \u201cweapon,\u201d \u201cfunctional behavioral assessment,\u201d \u201chearing officer,\u201d and \u201cpublic agency.\u201d However, respondents are under no obligation to define terms use'd in the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Appellants note that neither the annexed IDEA provisions, nor the Department\u2019s special education regulations, provide that if a \u201cmanifestation determination,\u201d made pursuant to 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1415(k)(4), results in a determination that the student\u2019s behavior was the result of his or her disability, then the student may not be expelled or suspended from school. Notwithstanding the failure of the IDEA to address the situation where the \u201cmanifestation determination\u201d results in a conclusion that the behavior was caused by the disability, appellants contend the Department\u2019s regulations must do so. We disagree. In the absence of a federal standard or mandate by the IDEA, the Board\u2019s failure to adopt a regulation as proposed by appellants is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Appellants also contend the standard contained in <em>N.J.AC. </em>6A:14-2.8(d), applied to students with disabilities who are removed from their placement for ten or more days, violates the requirement in the IDEA that states must ensure that \u201c[a] free appropriate public education is available to all children with disabilities ... including children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled from school.\u201d 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1412(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In accordance with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.8(d), when a student with a disability is removed from placement \u201cfor more than 10 cumulative or consecutive school days in the school year,\u201d services must be provided \u201cto the extent necessary to enable the student to <em>progress appropriately </em>in the general education curriculum and <em>advance appropriately </em>toward achieving the goals set out in the student\u2019s IEP.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Appellants argue that the terms \u201cprogress appropriately\u201d and \u201cadvance appropriately\u201d do not comply with the Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation of a FAPE as set forth in <em>Ridgewood Bd. of Educ. v. N.E., </em>172 <em>F.3d </em>238, 247 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">In <em>Ridgewood, </em>the court noted that the \u201cIDEA leaves to the courts the task of interpreting [what is a] \u2018free and appropriate public education.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court ruled that the IDEA calls for more than a trivial educational benefit. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Polk v.

The <em>Ridgewood </em>court stated that an IEP must provide \u201csignificant learning\u201d and confer \u201cmeaningful benefit.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We disagree with appellants\u2019 contention that the standards set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.8(d) violate a child\u2019s right to a FAPE. When a child \u201cprogresses appropriately\u201d in the educational curriculum and \u201cadvances appropriately\u201d toward achieving the goals set forth in that child\u2019s IEP, this confers a \u201cmeaningful benefit\u201d involving \u201csignificant learning,\u201d precisely the objective of a FAPE. Moreover, the language contained in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.8(d) mirrors the language contained in the federal special education regulations that \u201cthe public agency ... must ... [pjrovide services to the extent necessary to enable the child to <em>appropriately progress </em>in the general curriculum and <em>appropriately advance </em>toward achieving the goals set out in the child\u2019s IEP[.]\u201d 34 <em>C.F.R. \u00a7 </em>300.121(d)(2)(i) (Emphasis added); <em>see also </em>34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.121(d)(3) (\u201cSchool personnel, in consultation with the child\u2019s special education teacher, [must] determine the extent to which services are necessary to enable the child to <em>appropriately progress </em>in the general curriculum and <em>appropriately advance </em>toward achieving the goals set out in the child\u2019s IEP[.]\u201d (Emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Appellants further contend that, despite the IDEA\u2019S mandate of parental involvement in all discipline determinations, the Department\u2019s regulations fail to involve parents in two critical areas. They first claim parents are excluded from participating in the determination of when a series of removals of fewer than ten days constitutes a change in placement, to which greater protections attach. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.8(b)(2)(i) requires school officials to consult \u201cwith the student\u2019s case manager\u201d when determining \u201cwhether a series of short-term removals constitutes a pattern that creates a change of placement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">However, we find nothing in the IDEA or its federal regulations stating which individuals should determine whether a series of short-term removals constitute a change in placement. Accordingly, that determination is implicitly left to the discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>and determination of the states. We conclude that making a decision as to whether a series of short-term removals constitutes a pattern creating a change of placement, without direct parental consultation, does not violate the IDEA, since this decision is fundamentally different from the procedures enumerated in the IDEA requiring parental input. While parental input is vital in the areas of evaluations, assessments, IEP development, and discipline, this determination is based on the educators\u2019 technical knowledge and expertise as to what constitutes a change in placement. Moreover, the child\u2019s special education teacher is in the unique position to evaluate the extent to which a series of short-term removals is disruptive to fulfilling the goals set forth in the child\u2019s IEP.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Appellants further assert that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.8(d)(1) improperly excludes parents from the determination of the level of educational services required to provide a FAPE for a student who has been suspended for more than ten days in a school year, where the removals do not constitute a change in placement. Under those circumstances, school officials must consult \u201cwith the student\u2019s special education teacher and case manager\u201d in determining the extent to which services are needed \u201cto enable the student to progress appropriately in the general curriculum and advance appropriately toward achieving the goals set out in the student\u2019s IEP.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This argument is without merit. The Department\u2019s regulation mirrors 34 <em>C.F.B. </em>\u00a7 300.121(d)(3)(i), which states that \u201c[s]chool personnel, in consultation with the child\u2019s special education teacher\u201d shall determine the level of educational services required for the student to appropriately progress in the general curriculum and appropriately advance toward achieving the goals set forth in the child\u2019s IEP.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Additionally, appellants argue that while the Department recognizes the need to apply the IDEA\u2019S disciplinary provisions to the \u201cpotentially disabled,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-3.3(f) inappropriately narrows the group of \u201cpotentially disabled\u201d students, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>(f) When it is determined that an evaluation for eligibility for services under this chapter is warranted, the student shall be considered identified as potentially disabled. If the student is removed for disciplinary action, limitations on the amount of time the student is removed and the requirement to provide services shall be consistent with procedures in N.J.A.C. 6A:14-2.8.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Appellants allege it is improper to limit the application of discipline procedures required for disabled students to only those \u201cpotentially disabled\u201d students for whom \u201cit is determined that an evaluation for eligibility for services ... is warranted.\u201d Appellants cite to the following provision in the IDEA regarding protections for children not yet eligible for special education and related services:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">(k) Placement in alternative educational setting</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">(8) Protections for children not yet eligible for special education and related services</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">(A) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">A child who has not yet been determined to be eligible for special education and related services under this subchapter and who has engaged in behavior that violated any rule or code of conduct of the local educational agency, including any behavior described in paragraph (1), may assert any of the protections provided for in this subchapter if the local educational agency had knowledge (as determined in accordance with this paragraph) that the child was a child with a disability before the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-11\">(B) Basis of knowledge</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-12\">A local educational agency shall be deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-13\">(i) the parent of the child has expressed concern in writing (unless the parent is illiterate or has a disability that prevents compliance with the requirements contained in this clause) to personnel of the appropriate educational agency that the child is in need of special education and related services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-14\">(ii) the behavior or performance of the child demonstrates the need for such services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-15\">(iii) the parent of the child has requested an evaluation of the child pursuant to section 1414 of this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-16\">(iv) the teacher of the child, or other personnel of the local educational agency, has expressed concern about the behavior or performance of the child to the director of special education of such agency or to other personnel of the agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-17\">[20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(k)(8)(A) and (B).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The federal special education regulations, 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.527(a)-(b), mirror the language of the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Clearly, the Department\u2019s regulation is not as broad as the IDEA and its regulation. Since the Department\u2019s regulation limits the procedural safeguards to children where the school district has already determined that an evaluation for eligibility for services is warranted, numerous children are improperly excluded. Pursuant to the requirements contained in the IDEA, a parent simply has to request an evaluation, or a teacher of the child has to merely express a concern about the behavior or performance of a child to the director of special education or other school district personnel, and the procedural safeguards apply. Accordingly, we conclude <em>N.J.AC. </em>6A:14-3.3(f) violates the IDEA and must be amended or replaced with regulations that conform to these federal requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Appellants also challenge the Department\u2019s special education regulation concerning a parent\u2019s request for an expedited hearing in disciplinary matters. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.7(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">(g) If the parent disagrees with the determination that the student\u2019s behavior was not a manifestation of the student\u2019s disability or with any decision regarding placement under 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300.520 through 300.528, the parent may request an expedited hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The procedure for expedited hearings is outlined in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.7(i). When an expedited hearing is requested in a disciplinary matter, mediation shall be offered and, if requested, be scheduled and completed prior to the expedited hearing, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.7(i)(2)(i) and (iii); the expedited hearing shall be conducted within ten calendar days of the request, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6 A: 14-2.7(i)(2)(ii);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the parties shall complete the exchange of relevant records and materials at least two business days before the hearing, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.7(i)(3); and a written decision must be mailed to the parties within forty-five days of the request. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.7(i)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Appellants contend the forty-five day standard contained in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.7(i)(4) is insufficient because it is identical to the deadline for non-expedited hearings. We disagree. The forty-five day deadline is not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable because it allows for no exceptions or extensions and provides the parent with a final decision within an accelerated time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.7(l) and (m) set forth a procedure for any party seeking emergency relief as part of a request for a due process hearing or an expedited hearing. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.7(m)(l)(i) through (iv) establish the criteria and standards to be applied by the administrative law judge when considering an application for emergent relief. Appellants assert that since, pursuant to 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(k)(6)(A)(ii), the SEA or LEA must arrange for an expedited hearing in any disciplinary case when requested by a parent, any inquiries under the standards applicable to emergency relief, including a showing of irreparable harm, are inappropriate. They argue that the explicit expedited hearing requirement in the IDEA eliminates the need for meeting an emergency relief standard. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Emergency relief is an entirely separate category from the expedited-hearing procedures contained in the regulations. Emergency relief may be requested by either party <em>in addition to </em>a request for an expedited hearing. Moreover, the emergent decision is a temporary decision until the matter is fully addressed at the expedited due process hearing. <em>N.J.AC. </em>6A:14-2.7(!). The emergency relief process is not redundant to the expedited hearing process, nor does it impermissibly slow the expedited hearing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">B. <em>State Complaint Procedures</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Appellants argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">BY FAILING TO ADOPT THE MINIMUM STATE COMPLAINT PROCEDURES GUARANTEED BY FEDERAL REGULATION, DOE\u2019S REGULATIONS VIOLATE IDEA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>The Department\u2019s special education regulations pertaining to \u201ccomplaint investigation\u201d provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">(a) The State Director of the Office of Special Education Programs or designee\u00a9 shall be responsible for reviewing, investigating and taking action on any signed written complaint of substance regarding the provision of special education and related services covered under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">(b) An organization or individual may request a complaint investigation by submitting a written signed request to the State Director of the Office of Special Education Programs.

Upon reevaluation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">iv. When a request for a due process hearing is submitted to the Department of Education.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Although <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.3(e)(7) mandates that a copy of the procedural safeguards statement, which includes the complaint procedures, must be provided to parents at the indicated stages, it fails to require dissemination of the statement at parent training and information centers, protection and advocacy centers, independent living centers, and other appropriate agencies. By failing to do so, many individuals who potentially have a disabled child may not be aware of these procedural safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Relying on 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 300.660, 300.662, the court in <em>Upper Valley Ass\u2019n for Handicapped Citizens v.

No. 21, </em>973 <em>F.Supp. </em>429, 432 (D.Vt.1997), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">Implementing regulations of the IDEA require that states adopt written procedures for the receipt and resolution of complaints, from organizations or individuals, that a state or local educational agency has violated the IDEA or its regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">By failing to require dissemination of the procedural safeguards statement to agencies and centers, the Department\u2019s regulations violate federal policy. We conclude <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.3(e)(7) is not broad enough to include the proper dissemination under the federal standard. Accordingly, the Board shall promulgate and adopt a regulation that complies with this federal mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">Appellants also argue that although the Department\u2019s regulations require \u201ca report of findings [and] conclusions^]\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2(e), they do not require a determination as to whether the public agency is violating a requirement of the IDEA, as required in the following federal special education regulations: Minimum State complaint procedures.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-14\">(a) Time limit; minimum procedures.

Pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2(a), complaints address \u201cthe provision of special education and related services covered under this chapter,\u201d and a report of findings, conclusions and corrective actions, when warranted, concerning the complaint is issued pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2(e). The Department\u2019s regulation lists activities, such as reviews of records and policies, and interviews of persons, that the Department may engage in when investigating a complaint, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2(c)(l)(i)(iv), which list is not exclusive. Obviously, the very focus of the complaint procedure is an inquiry into whether the special education and related services requirements applicable to children with disabilities and their parents, contained in the IDEA and federal and state special education regulations, are being complied with. The procedures set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2 clearly require a determination as to whether the public agency is violating a requirement of the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Appellants further assert the Department\u2019s special education regulations fail to include \u201cprocedures for the effective implementation of the SEA\u2019s final decision\u201d in accordance with 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.661(b)(2). That federal regulation, establishing minimum state complaint procedures, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">(b) Time extension; final decision; implementation.

We conclude that the Department\u2019s regulations sufficiently comply with the federal requirement that a corrective action plan be developed and that all aspects of the final decision with regard to a complaint investigation be implemented, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2(e)(g), and are broad enough to encompass all needed implementation tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Appellants further argue that the Department\u2019s regulations fail to require that a copy of the district\u2019s corrective action plan be sent to the original complainant for review and comment, which they contend is essential for effective implementation. Our review of the IDEA and its regulations reveals no federal requirement that the complainant be given an opportunity to review and comment on the corrective action plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Appellants also note that the Department\u2019s regulations only require the county office of education to notify the noncompliant educational agency \u201cof the actions the Department of Education intends to take[,]\u201d and do not require notice to the complainant. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2(j).

We construe <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-9.2(j) as placing that burden on the county office of education should the LEA fail to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Appellants also contend that the Department\u2019s regulations fail to incorporate the available remedies for the denial of appropriate services to a child as specified in the following federal special education regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">Adoption of State complaint procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>(b) Remedies for denial of appropriate services.

The provisions of the IDEA cited to by appellants only establish the requirement for appointment of the surrogate parent, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(b)(2); the general requirement that procedures be established and maintained \u201cto ensure that children with disabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards[,]\u201d 20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1415(a); the mandate that LEAs have \u201cin effect policies, procedures, and programs that are consistent with the State policies and procedures established\u201d under the IDEA, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1413(a)(1); and the requirement that children with disabilities and their parents be afforded the IDEA\u2019S procedural safeguards, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(6). None of the cited sections impose standards for the methods of selecting and training surrogate parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In response to a comment to the proposed amendments to the special education regulations relating to this issue, the Department stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">32.

Appellants have not demonstrated that the IDEA mandates uniform statewide methods for selecting and training surrogate parents, or that the current regulation is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, since the Department has expressed an intent to provide technical assistance materials to local school districts without mandating specific criteria for selection and training.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Appellants also argue that the Department\u2019s regulations are contrary to the IDEA in that they do not prohibit the appointment of an employee of a nonpublic agency involved in the education or care of the child as that child\u2019s surrogate parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.2(d) mandates that \u201c[t]he person(s) serving as a surrogate parent may not be an employee of the Department of Education, the district board of education or public agency providing services to the student.\u201d Appellants contend this prohibition should be extended to nonpublic agency employees when their agency is involved in the education or care of a child. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The IDEA provides that the local educational agency must have</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">procedures to protect the rights of the child whenever the parents of the child are not known, the agency cannot, after reasonable efforts, locate the parents, or the child is a ward of the State, including the assignment of an individual (who shall not be an employee of the State educational agency, the local educational agency, <em>or any other agency that is involved in the education or care of the </em>child) to act as a surrogate for the parents[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\">[20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(b)(2) (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">This provision clearly excludes all employees of any agency, public or nonpublic, that is involved in the education or care of the child. The federal special education regulations also contain this prohibition. <em>See </em>34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.515(c)(2)(i). The failure of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.2(d) to include employees of any \u201cnonpublic\u201d agency involved in the education or care of the child frustrates the federal conflict-of-interest policy. Accordingly, the Board shall promul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>gate and adopt a regulation, amending or replacing <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-2.2(d), fully encompassing the federal conflict-of-interest standard for the appointment of surrogate parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">X. <em>Child Find Procedures</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Appellants argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">BY FAILING TO ADOPT CRITICAL PROVISIONS OF IDEA\u2019S \u201cCHILD FIND\u201d MANDATE, DOE\u2019S REGULATIONS VIOLATE IDEA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Appellants first contend the Department\u2019s \u201cchild find\u201d regulations fail to address the IDEA\u2019S requirement that a practical method be developed and implemented to determine which children are currently receiving special education and related services.

Instead, the IDEA and its regulations require that each state have policies and procedures to ensure that a practical method is developed.

The requirements for child find are found at N.J.A.C. 6A:14-3.3(a). The requirement to report students with disabilities attending nonpublic schools is located at N.J.A.C. 6A:14-6,4(b). The requirement to develop, review and revise a service plan is found at N.J.A.C. 6A:14-6.1(d)l.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">[32 <em>N.J.R. </em>2052(a), 2057 (June 5, 2000).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">We disagree with the Department\u2019s response. The federal special regulations require, in 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.125(b)(3) and (4), that each state have on file with the Secretary of Education a description of how the policies and procedures pursuant to 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.125(a) will be monitored to ensure that the state educational agency obtains information on the number of children identified within each category of disability, information adequate to evaluate the effectiveness of those policies and procedures, and a description of the method the state uses to determine which children are currently receiving special education and related services. These federal requirements have not been met by merely mandating that each school district develop written procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">We conclude that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:14-3.3 fails to incorporate all the federal requirements of child find as set forth in 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.125. By failing to do so, the Department\u2019s regulation is inconsistent with the federal mandate in 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(3)(A) and 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.12o(a)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">Although not raised, we have considered, and rejected, the proposition that since New Jersey must comply with the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>sions of the IDEA and its implementing federal regulations to be able to receive federal monies for educating children with disabilities, the failure to include every aspect of the federal provisions in the Department\u2019s regulations would not make those regulations invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">This position is similar to respondents\u2019 position on other issues \u2014 the regulations need not contain provisions mandating compliance by local school districts because the federal regulations address policies and procedures requiring that only states, not school districts, must file with the Secretary of the USDOE.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">However, the Department\u2019s \u201cregulations are written to be read and followed by non-lawyers in hundreds of school districts across the state[,]\u201d <em>In re N.J.A.C. 6:28-2.10, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>389, 403, 702 A.2d 838 (1997) (quoting <em>In re Repeal of N.J.A.C. 6:28, </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>158, 163-64, 497 A.2d 1272 (App.Div.1985)), as well as parents of disabled children, so they should be comprehensive and include all requirements set forth in the federal standard. While these requirements are for states and not local school districts, the public should still be aware of what must be filed with the federal government, such as the standards for child find and the number of children within each disability category. Otherwise, parents and other concerned individuals will not have a clear understanding of all the standards that are applicable, and how those standards are applied in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">With other portions of the IDEA, where a federal standard is not entirely clear in the Department\u2019s regulations, the Board has incorporated parts of the IDEA and its federal special education regulations by attaching them as appendices to its regulations. Here, the failure to incorporate the applicable portions of the IDEA or its regulations constitutes the adoption of a regulation inconsistent with the federal standard. Accordingly, <em>N.J.AC. </em>6A:14-3.3 must be amended, or a new regulation adopted, to make the Department\u2019s regulations consistent with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>XI. <em>Written Reports for Specific Learning Disability Evaluations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Appellants argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">BY FAILING TO REQUIRE FULL WRITTEN REPORTS FOR SLD EVALUATIONS, DOE\u2019S REGULATIONS VIOLATE IDEA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The Department\u2019s regulation concerning reports of assessment of a child suspected of having a SLD state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-9\">(f) A written report of the results of each assessment shall be prepared.

By requiring dissenting members of a team to write separate statements, or certify whether the joint report reflects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>his or her conclusions, parents who also disagree would become aware of the dissent. Without that requirement, the views of a dissenting team member may remain unknown, and the IEP report reduced to a majority decision. Such a result runs contrary to the purposes of the IDEA to \u201censure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique need[,]\u201d 20 <em>U.S. C.A. </em>\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A), and \u201cto ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected!,]\u201d 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(B). Since the absence of this requirement frustrates the federal policy, the Department\u2019s regulations must be amended to encompass the noted provisions contained in 34 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 300.543(b). The amendment incorporating the federal requirement shall have general application to all evaluations delineated in <em>N.J.AC. </em>6A:14-3.4(f), not only those pertaining to an evaluation of the existence of a SLD.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Respondents\u2019 contention that appellants\u2019 challenges of this regulation is untimely, because <em>N.J AC. </em>6A:14-3.4(f) was part of the Department\u2019s regulations in effect as of the filing of the first notice of appeal in A-7451-97T1, yet was not originally challenged, is without merit and does not warrant discussion in this opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E). <em>See also Bergen Pines County Hosp. v.
