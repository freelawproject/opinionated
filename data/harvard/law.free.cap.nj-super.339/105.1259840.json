Plaintiff asserts that it is a holder in due course and that the 1995 amendment to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118(b), governs the timeliness of its action. Defendant contends that since <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118(b) was not enacted until 1995 it should not be given retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The motion judge held that the six-year statute of limitations embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1 \u201capplie[d]\u201d and ran from the date the note was executed; that 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821 (which incorporated that New Jersey statute of limitations) applied \u201cbecause the FDIC took over the bank\u2019s assets [on July 26, 1991,] subsequent to the making of the note\u201d; and that the action was time barred. The judge further concluded that the 1995 revision to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118(b) was not to be given \u201cretroactive\u201d effect, but that even if it were, a July 28, 1991 letter from the FDIC to defendant \u201cconstituted a demand\u201d for payment and, therefore, the six-year bar of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118(b) had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Before us, plaintiff argues that the Legislature had the authority \u201cto extend the statute of limitations on a demand promissory note\u201d; that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118 \u201cwas part of a curative revision\u201d of the UCC and that the Legislature intended to give it \u201cretroactive effect\u201d; that the July 28, 1991 letter \u201cwas not a demand for payment\u201d; and that as a \u201cholder in due course,\u201d it is \u201centitled to payment from defendant corporation as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>We conclude that the 1995 revision of the UCC and the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-118 do not apply in this ease. As that amendment does not apply to demand promissory notes already in existence on its effective date, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On March 11, 1991, Rotondi executed and delivered on defendant\u2019s behalf a \u201cPROMISSORY NOTE (Demand),\u201d payable to Suburban National Bank (\u201cSuburban\u201d) in the principal sum of $140,000. While the note provided for monthly payments of interest only, beginning on April 11, 1991, it specifically stated \u201c[tjhis [ojbligation ... is payable on demand.\u201d The parties agree that this constituted a \u201cdemand note.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">On July 26,1991, Suburban was declared insolvent. The FDIC was appointed its receiver and, as a result, holder of defendant\u2019s note and Rotondi\u2019s guaranty. On July 28, 1991, FDIC sent a letter to defendant and Rotondi so advising them. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">On July 26, 1991, Suburban National Bank, Somerville, New Jersey, was declared insolvent and was closed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed Receiver and is now the holder of your obligation(s) owed to the failed bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">If your payments are current, adhere to the original contractual terms of your indebtedness by making payments as described below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">Pay to: FDIC as Receiver of Suburban National Bank</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aam\">Care of: Provident Savings Bank</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-d\">32 New Amwell Road</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Somerville, New Jersey 08876</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\n<em>If your payments are past due, you should contact this office immediately to arrange for prompt payment of the amount due.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">If your loan is secured by real estate, equipment or vehicles, advise your insurance agent to name the FDIC as \u201cLoss Payee\u201d and provide proof of insurance to this office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">Consult with the undersigned before selling or otherwise disposing of any property (including crops and livestock) pledged to secure your indebtedness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">Please follow the above correspondence instructions until further notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">As of July 28,1991, no payments had been made on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">On February 18, 1997, the FDIC assigned the note and guaranty to plaintiff \u201ceffective December 12, 1996.\u201d The assignment was made \u201cwithout recourse and without representation or warranty.\u201d Apparently as a result of a communication with plaintiff, on January 30, 1997 defendant \u201cmade an interest payment of $2,000.00 toward the Note.\u201d In the letter sent with its check, defendant stated that this was a \u201cgood faith payment,\u201d and \u201cmade without prejudice to any rights, defenses or claims which S. Rotondi &amp; Sons, Inc. may have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">It is uncontested that on May 7, 1997, plaintiff \u201cmade a demand for full payment upon defendant,\u201d and that on June 25, 1997, plaintiff \u201cmade a second demand upon the defendant for payment in full of the Note.\u201d Defendant \u201cfailed to pay the Note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">On August 7, 1997, plaintiff filed this complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its answer, defendant asserted that plaintiffs action was \u201cbarred by the Statute of Limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-15\">In granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-16\">The Court has reviewed the moving and opposing papers, and the Court finds that the Statute of Limitations is an absolute bar to the prosecution of this action. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1] applies. The case law is clear that it runs from the making of the note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>... the Court finds that the Statute of Limitations runs from the execution of the note. As a result, the six-year statute [of limitations] under the Federal Statute [12 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(14)(A)] applies because the FDIC took over the bank\u2019s assets subsequent to the making of the note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">That statute, too, has expired and I\u2019m satisfied that [the 1995 version of] <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-118(b) alters the terms of the agreement between the defendant and the original holder of the note by extending the maximum exposure under the note from a period of six years to a period of ten years with no demand for interest or no payment having been made. That\u2019s certainly significant change in the exposure of the defendant on the note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">But-even if it\u2019s error to hold that 12A:3-118(b) cannot be applied retroactively, the Court finds that the demand from the FDIC for payment, after the FDIC took over the loan, constituted a demand that started the running of the Statute of Limitations under Title 12A. And thus the action would be barred under that statute, as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">The Court finds that the making of a $2,000 payment in good faith, without prejudice to the right to dispute the efficacy of the note or its legal effect ... [,] has no effect on the tolling of the Statute of Limitations and the ... cross-motion of Plaintiff for money due and owing on the note is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Plaintiff contends that because the \u201c[LJegislature had the constitutional authority to extend the statute of limitations on a demand promissory note,\u201d the motion judge \u201cerred in concluding that the passage of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118(b) impermissibly altered the terms of the note by extending the statute of limitations from six to ten years in 1995, a time prior to the running of the six-year statute of limitations in effect prior to the enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118.\u201d The critical question before us is whether the enlarged statute of limitations governs with respect to a \u201cdemand\u201d note executed before the 1995 revision of the UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1 provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[ejvery action at law ... for recovery upon a contractual claim or liability, express or implied, ... shall be commenced within 6 years next after the cause of any such action shall have accrued.\u201d Thus, under that statute it had been established prior to adoption of the UCC that \u201c[o]n a promissory note payable on demand, the statute of limitations begins to run in favor of the maker from the date of execution and delivery of the note.\u201d <em>Rickenbach v. Noecker </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>Shipbuilding Co., </em>66 <em>N.J.Super. </em>580, 583, 169 A.2d 730 (Ch.Div. 1961). At the time that this note was executed, the UCC in effect in New Jersey, adopted in 1961, <em>see L. </em>1961, c. 120, \u00a7 3-122, provided that the \u201ccause of action against a maker or an acceptor accrues ... (b) in the case of a demand instrument upon its date or, if no date is stated, on the date of issue.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-122(1). Hence, while the statute detailed when a cause of action \u201caccrued,\u201d the UCC had no independent statute of limitations governing commencement of the action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In 1989, Congress enacted the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA). <em>See, generally, Annot. </em>\u201cSpecial Commentary: Limitation of Actions under \u00a7 2(d)(14) of Federal Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) (12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1821(d)(14)) in Actions Brought by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Receiver,\u201d 126 <em>AL.R. Fed. </em>1, \u00a7 2[a] at 12 (1995). In material part, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">Notwithstanding any provision of any contract, the applicable statute of limitations with regard to any action brought by the Corporation [FDIC] as conservator or receiver shall be-(i) in the case of any contract claim, the longer of-(I) the 6 year period beginning on the date the claim accrues; or (II) the period applicable under State law[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">[12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(14)(A).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">The statute provides further that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the date on which the statute of limitation begins to run on any claim described in such subparagraph shall be the later of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">(i) the date of the appointment of the Corporation as conservator or receiver; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-12\">(ii) the date on which the cause of action accrues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-13\">[12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(14)(B).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">Because most courts \u201chave held that assignees [of FDIC] obtain the benefit of the longer federal statute of limitations,\u201d 126 <em>A.L.R. Fed., supra, </em>at 39-40, plaintiff has been treated as the FDIC. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>e.g., F.D.I.C. v. Bledsoe, </em>989 F.2d 805, 810-11 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Remington Investments, Inc. v. Kadenacy, </em>930 <em>F.Supp. </em>446, 450-51 (C.D.Cal.1996); <em>Mountain States Financial Resources Corp. v. Agrawal, </em>777 <em>F.Supp. </em>1550, 1552 (W.D.Okla.1991). That principle is not at issue here. The interesting legal issue before us relates to \u201cthe applicable\u201d State law for purposes of 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(14). Stated differently, the question is whether the six-year statute of limitations embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1 was enlarged by the 1995 revision of the UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">As already noted, prior to June 1,1995, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-122 provided that \u201ca cause of action against a maker or an acceptor accrues ... in the case of a demand instrument upon its date or, if no date is stated, on the date of issue.\u201d That statute was repealed effective June 1, 1995, see <em>L. </em>1995, <em>c. </em>28, \u00a7 1, and replaced in material part by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">b. Except as provided in subsection d. or e. of this section, if demand for payment is made to the maker of a note payable on demand, <em>an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the note must be commenced within six years after the demand. If no demand for payment is made to the maker, an action to enforce the note is barred if neither principal nor interest on the note has been paid, for a continuous period of 10 years.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">d. An action to enforce the obligation of the acceptor of a certified check or the issuer of a teller\u2019s check, cashier\u2019s check, or traveler\u2019s cheek must be commenced within three years after demand for payment is made to the acceptor or issuer, as the case may be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">e. An action to enforce the obligation of a party to a certificate of deposit to pay the instrument must be commenced within six years after demand for payment is made to the maker, but if the instrument states a due date and the maker is not required to pay before that date, the six-year period begins when a demand for payment is in effect and the due date has passed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">If the 1995 version of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118(b) is applicable here, plaintiffs action might not be time-barred. As noted, under 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1821(d)(14)(A), \u201cthe applicable statute of limitations\u201d in the case of any contract claim is \u201cthe longer\u201d of \u201cthe 6-year period beginning on the date the claim accrues,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>or </em>\u201cthe period applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ble under State law.\u201d Thus, if the 1995 version of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118(b) is applicable, plaintiffs cause of action would not be barred unless the 1991 letter from the FDIC constituted a \u201cdemand\u201d and the complaint was filed more than six years \u201cafter the demand.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">As previously noted, the trial judge held \u201cthat 12A:3-118[(b)] cannot be applied retroactively\u201d because she was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnC\">satisfied that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118[ (b) ] alters the terms of the agreement between the defendant and the original holder of the note by extending the maximum exposure under the note from a period of six years to a period of ten years with no demand for interest or no payment having been made. That\u2019s certainly significant change in the exposure of the defendant on the note.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In <em>State v. Standard Oil Co., </em>5 <em>N.J. </em>281, 293, 74 A.2d 565 (1950), <em>aff'd sub nom Standard Oil Co. v. New Jersey, </em>341 <em>U.S. </em>428, 71 <em>S.Ct. </em>822, 95 <em>L.Ed. </em>1078 (1951), our Supreme Court made clear \u201cthat where a right of action has become barred under existing law, the statutory defense constitutes a vested right which is proof against legislative impairment.\u201d <em>See also State v. United States Steel Corp., </em>22 <em>N.J. </em>341, 346, 126 A.2d 168 (1956) (\u201cunder New Jersey law the expiration of a time limitation upon a right of action not only bars the remedy but bestows upon the debtor a vested property right immune from legislative impairment\u201d). <em>Accord State v. Short, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>47, 54, 618 A.2d 316 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">However, with respect to an \u201cordinary statute of limitations, dealing only with the remedy given to the plaintiff! ],\u201d it is well settled that, \u201cuntil the period fixed by such a statute has arrived, the statute is a mere regulation of the limitation, and, like other such regulations, subject to legislative control.\u201d <em>Bretthauer v. Jacobson, </em>79 <em>N.J.L. </em>223, 225, 75 A. 560 (Sup.Ct.1910). Thus, the statute of limitations may be extended \u201cprior to the falling of the bar created by the statute.\u201d <em>Vincent, Inc. v. Lambek, </em>9 <em>N.J.Super. </em>522, 527, 75 A.2d 748 (Ch.Div.1950). <em>See, generally, </em>51 <em>Am.Jur.2d Limitation of Actions </em>\u00a7 49 at 482-83 (2000) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">A legislature validly may enlarge the period of limitation of a procedural statute of limitations and make it applicable to existing causes of action, provided that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>does not revive a cause of action that already has become barred. There is no vested right in the running of a statute of limitations if it has not completely run and barred the action. However, once an action has become barred, in some jurisdictions a defendant may have a vested interest in the running of the statute of limitations and a statute that would impair such an interest is unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Here, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-122(1)(b), defendant\u2019s right to rely upon the statute of limitations defense did not become a vested right until March 12, 1997, that is, six years after the note\u2019s execution and delivery to Suburban on March 11, 1991. However, before March 12, 1997, the Legislature effective June 1, 1995 changed the applicable statute of limitations for a \u201cnote payable upon demand\u201d by its adoption of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">New Jersey courts have \u201clong followed a general rule of statutory construction that favors prospective application of statutes.\u201d <em>Gibbons v. Gibbons, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>515, 521, 432 A.2d 80 (1981). <em>See also Skulski v. Nolan, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>179, 202, 343 A.2d 721 (1975) (\u201cOur decisions reflect the general principle that[,] in construing legislation, statutes should not be given retrospective application unless such an intention is manifested by the Legislature in clear terms\u201d); <em>Kopczynski v. County of Camden, </em>2 <em>N.J. </em>419, 424, 66 A.2d 882 (1949) (\u201cA cardinal rule in the interpretation of statutes is that words in a statute ought not to have a retrospective operation unless they are so clear, strong and imperative that no other meaning can be annexed to them, or unless the intent of the [Legislature cannot otherwise be satisfied\u201d); <em>Woodbury Heights Bd. of Education v. Starr, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>528, 543, 725 A.2d 1180 (App.Div.1999) (\u201cA conclusion that the legislature intended retroactive application requires a compelling showing of such intention\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">This rule of statutory construction is subject to several exceptions. <em>Gibbons, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 522-23, 432 A.2d 80. For example, as plaintiff argues, a statute may be given retroactive application if it is \u201ccurative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 432 A.2d 80. Under the \u201ccurative exception,\u201d an amendment to a statute may be given retroactive effect, \u201cif it is designed merely to carry out or explain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>the intent of the original statute.\u201d <em>Kendall v. Snedeker, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283, 287, 530 A.2d 334 (App.Div.1987). As Judge (now Justice) Long has explained, \u201c[i]n essence, an amendment [to a statute] which falls within the curative exception can be retroactively applied consistent with the general rule of prospective application because its purpose is to remedy a perceived imperfection in or misapplication of a statute and not to alter the intended scope or purposes of the original act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288, 530 A.2d 334. A \u201ccurative amendment\u201d to a statute would be one that \u201cbrought the law into harmony with what the Legislature originally intended,\u201d in that such an amendment is \u201cmeant only to clarify what was originally intended.\u201d <em>Ibid.Accord Schiavo v. John F. Kennedy Hospital, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>380, 386, 609 A.2d 781 (App.Div.1992), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>400, 620 A.2d 1050 (1993) (increase in charitable immunity limitation prospective only); <em>see also Matter of D.C., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>31, 51, 679 A.2d 634 (1996); <em>Carnegie Bank v. Shalleck, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>23, 40, 606 A.2d 389 (App.Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Plaintiff notes that <em>L. </em>1995, c. 28, repealed and replaced \u201cChapters 3[and] 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code\u201d as part of a \u201ctotal overhaul and revision of the UCC.\u201d Plaintiff also notes that, \u201c[p]rior to the 1995 amendments, there was no provision in the UCC for a statute of limitations under Chapter 3.\u201d Finally, plaintiff notes that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-122, which dealt with the accrual of causes of action on various forms of instruments including demand notes, \u201cwas repealed in 1995 and <em>replaced </em>by <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-118.\u201d As plaintiff states it, the new statute, for the first time in the UCC with regard to demand notes, \u201cset forth the applicable periods within which to sue ..., making the period of limitation to sue on a [demand] promissory note ten years from the date of issue or the date of the note [if neither principal nor interest on the note has been paid for a continuous period of ten years], if no demand for payment was made, and six years from the date of a demand, if a demand for payment was in fact made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Even under plaintiffs phraseology, the 1995 revision cannot be deemed merely curative. Rather, it constituted a significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>change in the statute of limitations for demand notes. As stated in New Jersey Study Comment No. 1 to the pre-1995 <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-122, \u201c[i]n the case of a demand instrument, the statute of limitations starts to run in favor of the primary parties at the moment of issue, for it is clear that no demand for payment is needed to charge the maker on a demand note, or the acceptor of a demand draft or check.\u201d <em>See also Ligran, Inc. v. Medlawtel, Inc., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>583, 588, 432 A.2d 502 (1981) (\u201cwe affirm the principle that[,] where a maker also signs a demand note as a guarantor of payment, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date of issue, not from the date of demand for payment following dishon- or\u201d). As a result of the 1995 revision, the statute of limitations runs from the demand and has been elongated to ten years from the last payment of principal or interest if no demand is made. The revision is substantive and not merely \u201ccurative.\u201d <em>Cf. Hudson Neurological Clinic, Inc. v. PNC Bank, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>373, 375-76, 765 A.2d 205 (App.Div.2000) (declining to apply another provision of the 1995 UCC revision to a claim against a bank for conversion); <em>Leeds v. Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>416, 421 n. 6, 752 A.2d 332 (App.Div.2000) (noting that <em>L. </em>1995, c. 28, constituted an \u201coverall revision of Article 3 of the UCC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">We conclude that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118 has prospective application only. While enacted on February 15, 1995, the 1995 revision of the UCC, <em>L. </em>1995, c. 28, did not take effect until June 1, 1995, <em>see L. </em>1995, c. 28, \u00a7 15 (\u201c[t]his act shall take effect on the first day of the first calendar month which follows the 90th day after enactment\u201d), and an indicia of legislative intent that an \u201centire statute should apply prospectively\u201d is a \u201cpostponed effective date.\u201d <em>Twiss v. State, Dept. of Treasury, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>461, 468, 591 A.2d 913 (1991). <em>See </em>Norman J. Singer, 2 <em>Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 41.04 at 410 (5th ed. 2001) (\u201cPostponement of an effective date for an act indicates that it should have only prospective application\u201d). <em>See also Handy &amp; Harman v. Park Ridge, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super </em>558, 565-66, 695 A.2d 747 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>10, 702 A.2d 349 (1997) (\u201cthe fact that the effective date of the [Spill] Act was postponed for more than three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>months weighs in favor of prospective application of the entire original Act\u201d); <em>Thomas v. Romeis, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>364, 374, 560 A.2d 1267 (App.Div.1989) (\u201c[m]aking the statute effective on a date certain ..., rather than on the date it was signed into law, is an indication that only prospective effect was intended\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In <em>Interchange State Bank v. Veglia, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>164, 668 A.2d 465 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>377, 676 A.2d 1092 (1996), we noted that <em>L. </em>1995, c. 28, \u201c[essentially ... repealed and replaced <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-101 through 3-805.\u201d 286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 184, 668 A.2d 465. Referring to <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-420 (which in 1995 replaced the repealed <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-419), \u201c[w]e decline[d] to apply the statute retroactively inasmuch as there is no indication that the Legislature intended that effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185, 668 A.2d 465.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Hudson Neurological Clinic, </em>we recently concluded that the 1995 revision to the UCC could not save the grant of summary judgment to plaintiffs. Speaking through Judge Alley, we declined to apply <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-420, which replaced <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419, effective June 1, 1995, \u201cbecause it had not been adopted at the time of the events complained of by plaintiffs and is inapplicable.\u201d <em>Hudson Neurological Clinic, supra, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 375, 765 A.2d 205, citing <em>Interchange State Bank; see also Ingram v. Earthman, </em>993 S.W.2d 611 (Tenn.Ct.App.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>986, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>445, 145 L.Ed.2d 362 (1999); <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>244 <em>Ill.App.Sd </em>518, 185 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>214, 614 N.E.2d 348 (1993). It has, therefore, become part of our consistent State court jurisprudence that the 1995 revision of the UCC should be considered a wholesale revision of the Code to apply prospectively to transactions occurring after its effective date, irrespective of whether a particular revised provision is beneficial or detrimental to plaintiffs cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Our disposition makes it unnecessary to decide whether the FDIC letter of July 28, 1991 constituted a \u201cdemand,\u201d as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>of law, which would commence the six-year statute of limitations under the 1995 revision to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118(b). To the contrary, we decline to decide what constitutes a \u201cdemand\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-118. Suffice it to say that our interpretation of the statute\u2019s prospectivity is supported by the belief that what may constitute a \u201cdemand\u201d in 1991 should not turn on the interpretation of a statute adopted four years later. Commercial transactions require more stability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The judgment dismissing the complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-9\"> Plaintiff had filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, and although no order was entered denying it, plaintiff seems to press its position on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>While defendant contends we cannot consider that issue in the absence of a cross-appeal, our disposition renders the question academic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-11\"> On March 11, 1991, Rotondi also executed and delivered a \"Guaranty\" to Suburban.
