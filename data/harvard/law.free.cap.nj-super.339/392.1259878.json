Mody, filed a complaint against defendants, Geraldine Brooks (Brooks) and Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate), seeking property damages that allegedly resulted from an automobile accident on January 3, 1999. Plaintiff made no claim for personal injuries and evidently suffered none.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">This appeal turns on whether, as the motion judge ruled, plaintiffs action is barred by the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 to -35. (No Fault Act or \u201cAct\u201d), in particular <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.5, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">Failure to maintain required medical expense coverage; effect on recovery for noneconomic loss</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">a. Any person who, at the time of an automobile accident resulting in injuries to that person, is required but fails to maintain medical expense benefits coverage mandated by section 4 of P.L.1972, c. 70 (C.39:fiA-4) or section 4 of P.L.1998, c. 21 (C.39:6A-3.1) shall have no cause of action for recovery of economic or noneconomic loss sustained as a result of an accident while operating an uninsured automobile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">We conclude that the claim is not barred and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">The incident in suit occurred in the early morning of January 3, 1999, when plaintiff was driving his automobile southbound on Routes 1 and 9 in Newark. Brooks, the owner and operator of another automobile, struck plaintiffs automobile from behind, allegedly resulting in its total loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">At the time of the accident, Brooks maintained an automobile insurance policy through Allstate. According to plaintiff, Allstate represented to him \u201cthat it would pay the claim arising out of the accident involving\u201d Brooks. Allstate then issued a payoff check for plaintiffs loss, but thereafter notified plaintiff that it was denying his claim in light of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.5, \u201cbecause he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>... driving an uninsured motor vehicle ...\u201d and stopped payment on the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Plaintiff concedes that, at the time of the accident, his automobile was not insured and that it was not covered by an automobile insurance policy which afforded personal injury protection (PIP) benefits. Plaintiff maintains, however, that the trial court erred in ruling that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.5(a) bars him from recovering property damages. He takes the position that the statute bars recovery only for economic and noneconomic losses resulting from bodily injury. We agree both because of the plain language of the statute, and in the alternative, to the extent the statute may be seen as ambiguous, because that is an appropriate implementation of the legislative intent and the case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">As stated, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.5(a) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">Any person who, at the time of an automobile accident resulting in injuries to that pei\u2019son, is required but fails to maintain medical expense benefits coverage mandated by section 4 of P.L.1972, c. 70 (C.39:6A-4) or section 4 of P.L.1998, c. 21 (C.39:6A-3.1) shall have no cause of action for recovery of economic or noneconomic loss sustained as a result of an accident while operating an uninsured automobile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">To us, the preclusive language of the statute is plain. Only if there is an accident \u201cresulting in injuries to that person,\u201d is the uninsured party barred from suit. Plaintiff in this case did not sustain personal or bodily injury. He sustained only property damage, and the statute thus does not preclude him from bringing suit. We note that the term \u201cinjuries to that person\u201d or \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in the statute is of course employed in the automobile accident context. We thus have no occasion to explore more expansive possible usages of that expression that have been urged, though not necessarily adopted, in other fields, such as racial discrimination cases, <em>see Powell v. Alemaz, Inc., </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>33, 760 A.2d 1141 (App.Div.2000), or appraiser malpractice, <em>see Johnson v. American Homestead Mortg. Corp., </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>429, 703 A.2d 984 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">If the Legislature had intended to preclude an uninsured person who had sustained any type of damages in an automobile accident from bringing suit, it would have been familiar with the general, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>all-encompassing term, \u201cdamages,\u201d and presumably would have used it in the statute under review. In the ordinary automobile cases, the general, all-encompassing term \u201cdamages\u201d includes not only bodily injury but all categories of losses for which recovery may be had: bodily or personal injury; medical expenses; damage to physical property, and so forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Although this usage of the term \u201cdamages\u201d is not entirely consistent in every case, numerous examples comport with our interpretation. For example, at the outset of the opinion in <em>Rappeport v. Flitcroft, </em>90 <em>N.J.Super. </em>578, 579, 218 A.2d 873 (App.Div.1966), Judge Goldmann stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">Plaintiffs two-count complaint, filed December 3, 1964, sought damages for (1) damage to his automobile and (2) personal injuries resulting from a collision with the automobile of defendant Suburban Discount Garden Centers, Inc., operated by defendant, Flitcroft, its employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">And in <em>Werner v. Latham, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>76, 83, 752 A.2d 832 (App.Div.2000) Judge Pressler wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">We think it plain that the $600,000 in available coverage was unlikely to compensate this catastrophically injured plaintiff for the full amount of his damages considering his pain and suffering, disability, and loss of income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">The Legislature chose not to use the term \u201cdamages,\u201d however, and instead it limited the statutory bar to a single category, an accident \u201cresulting in injuries to that person,\u201d a term we view as clearly synonymous with \u201cpersonal injuries\u201d or \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Because plaintiff has made no claim for such injuries, and evidently has no such claims to assert, the statute patently does not bar his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Even if the statute were considered ambiguous, by referring to the legislative history it becomes evident that plaintiffs claim is not barred. In construing a statute, our \u201cfirst obligation is to consider the statute\u2019s plain meaning.\u201d <em>State v. Marchiani, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>541, 546, 765 A.2d 765 (App.Div.2001); <em>accord State v. Hoffman, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>564, 578, 695 A.2d 236 (1997); <em>State v.

When a statute is ambiguous, a court\u2019s function is to ascertain and to effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent. Extrinsic aids, such as legislative history, committee reports, and contemporaneous construction, may be used to help resolve any ambiguity and to ascertain the trae intent of the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\"><em>[Hoffman, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 578, 695 A.2d 236 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\"><em>Accord Szemple, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 422, 640 A.2d 817; <em>see also Maros v.

At that time,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">a victim injured in an automobile accident waited many years to have his claim processed through the courts, all the while incurring huge expenses for medical bills and lost wages that could only be recovered as an element of damages in the claim against the tortfeasor. The fact that any automobile accident victims received inadequate reimbursement for their injuries, or none at all, was considered a major deficiency ... causing substantial and unwarranted hardship for such victims. This ... situation was exacerbated by the then-operative common law principles of contributory negligence that barred any recovery by an injured driver unless he was entirely blameless. The Comparative Negligence Act, which softened the effect on a somewhat negligent plaintiff, was adopted effective August 1973. That act, N.J.S.A 2A:15-5.1 <em>et seq., </em>no longer barred recovery by such a person but merely diminished plaintiffs recovery by the percentage of his or her own negligence as long as it was less than that of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-10\">[Cynthia M.

Craig and Pomeroy, <em>New Jersey Auto Insurance Law, supra, </em>at \u00a7 4:3-8. In particular, AICRA amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.5. <em>Monroe v.

The 1997 amendment of section 4.5 provides that such a person shall have no cause of action for recovery of economic or noneconomic loss sustained as a result of an accident while operating an uninsured motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The legislative history and the evolution of the enactments in this field show that a primary focus of the No Fault Act and its amendments was on allocating the cost of medical expense benefits, and recoveries for bodily injuries. The language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.5(a), prior to the enactment of AICRA, effective in 1999, is of significance because it provided that an action brought by a person not carrying the compulsory insurance was subject to the verbal threshold, which is a standard that applies solely to bodily injuries. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8; Craig and Pomeroy, <em>New Jersey Auto Insurance Law, supra, </em>at \u00a7 15:4-la (discussing the preAICRA verbal threshold). From this it is evident that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.5(a) in its form at the time of plaintiffs accident only barred recovery for economic and noneconomic losses resulting from bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Significantly, the Legislature did not address the situation where the accident victim did not sustain bodily injuries, but rather property damage resulted to the automobile, <em>i.e., </em>there was economic damage from the accident. If the Legislature had intended the phrase \u201cresulting in injuries to that person\u201d to mean both economic and bodily injuries, it surely would have so indicated in the legislative history or the Legislature would have stated so in the language of the statute. The Legislature is certainly aware of the two categories of loss. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-3(a), (b), (c) (classifying compulsory automobile insurance coverage into categories of bodily injury and property damage).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Moreover, the phrase \u201cresulting in injuries to that person\u201d refers only to bodily injuries because the PIPS\u2019 coverage required by the Act means and includes: medical expense benefits, income continuation benefits, essential services benefits, death benefits, and funeral expense benefits. <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4(a), (b), (c), (d), (e). Each of these benefits flows from bodily injury rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>property damage. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, the whole purpose of <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4.5 is to impose a disability on those persons who did not maintain PIP benefits as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4, namely, a bar to their being compensated for their bodily injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">This conclusion is consistent with case law. In order for the PIP section of the No Fault Act to be implicated, the victim of the automobile accident must have suffered bodily injury. <em>See, e.g., Roig, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 511, 641 A.2d 248 (courts have \u201cconsistently recognized that the No-Fault Law was intended to be a trade-off between the prompt payment of medical expenses, regardless of fault, and a restriction on the right of an injured party to sue a tortfeasor for minor <em>personal injunes </em>stemming from automobile accidents\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Hoglin, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 481, 677 A.2d 705 <em>(\u201cN.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4 requires that all PIP endorsements provide personal injury protection coverage to the named insured and members of his family residing in his household who sustain <em>bodily injury </em>as a result of any accident involving an automobile,\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hyman, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>400, 401, 403, 412, 759 A.2d 894 (Law Div.2000) (holding that the owner of a registered but uninsured automobile was barred from pursuing an uninsured motorist claim for her alleged personal injuries under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The trial court focused on the definition of \u201ceconomic loss\u201d and concluded that the use of the word is general and not limited to economic loss resulting from personal injuries. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2(k) states that \u201c \u2018Economic loss\u2019 means uncompensated loss of income or property, or other uncompensated expenses, including, but not limited to, medical expenses.\u201d This definition, however, was not in effect at the time of plaintiffs accident, as it was passed as part of AICRA and was \u201ceffective 90 days following the establishment by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance of basic benefits required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 or the adoption by rules of the professional boards of the designation of valid diagnostic tests pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.7, whichever is later.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2. Even if this new definition were deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>applicable to the circumstances at hand, therefore, because it went into effect after the date of the accident, it would not be controlling. <em>See Monroe, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 510, 723 A.2d 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Accordingly, based on the plain language of the statute, and alternatively on the legislative history and the development of the statutory and case law, we conclude that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.5(a) is applicable only where the automobile accident victim has sustained bodily injuries. In the present case there is nothing in the record that indicates that plaintiff has sustained bodily injuries, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.5(a) does not bar plaintiff\u2019s claim for property damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">We reverse the order of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
