Defendant entered into a plea bargain under which he agreed to plead guilty to possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose and fourth-degree aggravated assault, and the State agreed to dismiss the second-degree aggravated assault and terroristic threats charges. The State also agreed to recommend a five year term of imprisonment. Defendant stipulated that the Graves Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c, would apply to his sentences for both offenses. In addition, the State reserved the right to argue that NERA was applicable to defendant\u2019s sentence for possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">At the plea hearing, defendant admitted that he had pointed a loaded gun at the victim. Defendant stated that his purpose in brandishing the gun was to scare the victim so she would get out of his house. Defendant also admitted that after the victim left the house, he fired the gun, the bullet ricocheted off the pavement, and either the bullet or a piece of pavement became lodged in the victim\u2019s leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">At sentencing, neither the State nor defendant offered any evidence, in addition to defendant\u2019s version of the offense provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>at the time of his plea, relating to imposition of a NERA parole disqualifier. The trial court refused to impose a NERA sentence, concluding that under our decision in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>78, 89-90, 737 A.2d 1140 (App.Div.1999), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>523, 766 A.2d 1126 (2001), a purely possessory offense, such as possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, does not qualify for NERA sentencing. The court then sentenced defendant in accordance with the Graves Act to a five year term of imprisonment, with three years of parole ineligibility, for possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, and a concurrent eighteen month term without parole eligibility for aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The State appeals from the trial court\u2019s determination that NERA does not apply to defendant\u2019s sentence. Defendant\u2019s answering brief argues that the State has no right to appeal. In the alternative, defendant argues that the trial court correctly concluded that NERA does not apply to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">We conclude that the State may appeal a sentence on the ground that the trial court failed to impose the period of parole ineligibility mandated by NERA. We also conclude that the trial court correctly held that NERA does not apply to defendant\u2019s sentence for possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Initially, we consider defendant\u2019s argument that the State has no right to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling that NERA does not apply to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">It is firmly established that a court may correct an illegal sentence at any time, even if such corrective action results in an increase in a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment. <em>State v. Horton, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>92, 97-102, 751 A.2d 141 (App.Div.2000); <em>State v. Baker, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super </em>55, 74-76, 636 A.2d 553 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>89, 648 A.2d 1127 (1994). A corollary of this principle is that the State may appeal an illegal sentence without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>express authorization in the criminal code or rules of court. <em>State v. Sheppard, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>332, 336-39, 310 A.2d 731 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>318, 315 A.2d 407 (1973); <em>see also State v. Mercadante, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>522, 529, 691 A.2d 819 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>26, 695 A.2d 668 (1997); <em>State v. Eigenmann, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>331, 337-38, 347-48, 655 A.2d 452 (App.Div. 1995); <em>State v. Leslie, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>78, 86, 634 A.2d 572 (App. Div.1993), <em>certif. denied, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>29, 641 A.2d 1040 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">If NERA applies to a sentence, the imposition of a parole ineligibility period of 85% of the sentence is mandatory. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2a. Thus, a sentence that fails to include this mandatory parole ineligibility period is an illegal sentence, which the State may appeal to correct the illegality. In fact, the Supreme Court and this court have entertained appeals from trial court refusals to impose NERA parole ineligibility terms on a number of occasions without raising any question concerning the State\u2019s right to appeal. <em>See, e.g., State v. Thomas, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>560, 767 A<em>.2d </em>459 (2001); <em>State v. Pierre, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>7, 748 A.2d 1129 (App.Div.2000); <em>State v. Grawe, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>579, 744 A.2d 246 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>560, 753 A.2d 1152 (2000). Therefore, the State may appeal the sentence imposed upon defendant on the ground that the trial court failed to impose the parole ineligibility period mandated by NERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">NERA provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">A court imposing a sentence of incarceration for a crime of the first or second degree shall fix a minimum term of 85% of the sentence during which the defendant shall not be eligible for parole if the crime is a violent crime____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-11\">For the purposes of this section, \u201cviolent crime\u201d means any crime in which the actor causes death, causes serious bodily injury ..., or uses or threatens the immediate use of a deadly weapon____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-13\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-7.2a, d.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-14\">In <em>State v. Johnson, supra, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 89-90, 737 A.2d 1140, a panel of this court held that possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose is not a \u201cviolent crime\u201d within the intent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>NERA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After quoting the definition of \u201cviolent crime\u201d set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2, the panel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">We think it plain that a purely possessory crime does not meet this definition. One cannot by mere possession with an unlawful purpose be deemed to have actually caused either death or serious bodily injury or used or threatened the immediate use of a deadly weapon. These are certainly elements of the robberies for which defendant was indicted and, certainly, threat of use of a deadly weapon was an element of the robbery of which defendant was convicted. But they are not elements of the purely possessory crime. A defendant must do more than have the intent to use the weapon unlawfully against the person of another before he meets the statutory definition of a violent criminal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">However, in <em>State v. Williams, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>356, 361, 755 A.2d 1168 (App.Div.2000), another panel of this court held that if the evidence presented at trial shows that the defendant in fact used or threatened the use of a deadly weapon, a NERA sentence may be imposed for possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose even though use or threatening the immediate use of a deadly weapon is not an element of the offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">[Defendant] brandished the gun on a public street and fired it in the direction of others contemporaneous with a verbal threat to kill. Pedestrians and bystanders, including a small child, were placed in danger by defendant\u2019s use of the firearm. In this factual setting we hold that the sentencing judge properly considered facts beyond those limited to proof of the elements of the predicate crime in determining that the offense was a \u201cviolent crime\u201d under NERA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">... We hold that the possessory offense of unlawful possession of a firearm is not excluded from the imposition of a NERA sentence under all circumstances. The sentencing judge may evaluate the factual circumstances to determine whether the defendant\u2019s actions constituted a \u201cviolent crime\u201d under NERA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">In <em>State v. Mosley, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>144, 761 A.2d 130 (App.Div. 2000), <em>certif. denied, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>633, 772 A.2d 934 (2001), Judge Pressler, the author of our opinion in <em>Johnson, </em>expanded upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>conceptual underpinning of Johnson\u2019s holding that a purely possessory crime does not qualify for NERA sentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">[NERA] does not address the circumstances surrounding the commission of a crime, <em>ie., </em>firearm possession or use, but, rather, particularly well-defined, well-understood and statutorily defined elements of a crime. Thus, as section d. defines it, a NERA crime is one in which the actor (1) causes death, or (2) causes serious bodily injury as defined by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:11-1b, or (3) uses or threatens the immediate use of a deadly weapon, or (4) uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force in committing an aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">It is immediately apparent that each of [the] NERA conditions is a customary first-or second-degree crime element. Causing death is, of course, an essential element of the criminal homicide crimes defined by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:11-3 (murder), <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:11-4 (manslaughter), and <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:11-5 (vehicular homicide). Serious bodily injury is, illustratively, an essential statutory element of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:12-1b (aggravated assault), and <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-1b (first-degree robbery). Use or immediately threatened use of a deadly weapon is, illustratively, an essential statutory element of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b(2) (aggravated assault) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1b (first-degree robbery). And use or threat of immediate use of physical force is an element of aggravated sexual assault as defined by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14r-2a(6) and of sexual assault as defined by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-2c(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">... In the case of NERA offenses, there is already a statutory crime to fit the punishment intended by NERA. That is to say, if a predicate fact of NERA sentencing exists, it will also inevitably constitute or be encompassed by an element of a crime with whose commission defendant may be charged. By the same token, it would appear that if the crime of which defendant is charged and convicted does not include an element constituting or encompassing a NERA predicate fact, that crime, by definition, is not a violent crime within NERA\u2019s intendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 151-52, 761 A.2d 130.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">Applying this rationale, the court in <em>Mosley </em>concluded that the defendant, who had pled guilty to first-degree aggravated sexual assault, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-2a(1), the elements of which are an \u201cact of sexual penetration\u201d and a victim who was \u201cless than 13 years old,\u201d was not subject to a NERA sentence, because none of the elements of this offense \u201cis a counterpart to or inclusive of a NERA predicate fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159, 761 A.2d 130. Instead, the \u201cgravamen\u201d of this offense is \u201conly the age of the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158, 761A <em>2d </em>130.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">Subsequent to <em>Mosley, </em>the Supreme Court decided <em>State v. Thomas, supra, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 767 A.2d 459, which involved the application of NERA to a conviction based on a guilty plea to a charge of second-degree sexual assault, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>2C:14-2b, the elements of which are \u201can act of sexual contact,\u201d a victim who was \u201cless than 13 years old\u201d and \u201c[an] actor ... [who was] at least four years older than the victim.\u201d Thus, as in <em>Mosley, </em>none of the elements of the crime involved in <em>Thomas </em>was \u201ca counterpart to or inclusive of a NERA predicate fact.\u201d <em>Mosley, supra, 335 N.J.Super. </em>at 159, 761 A.2d 130. Nevertheless, the Court held that even though \u201cnone of the NERA factors is an element of the offense charged,\u201d a NERA sentence can be imposed if there is \u201cadditional proof of a NERA factor.\u201d 166 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 767 A.2d 459; <em>see also id. </em>at 572, 767 A.2d 459 (\u201cThose aggravated sexual assaults and sexual assaults that do not contain a NERA factor as a constituent element of the offense can be brought within the scope of NERA only upon additional proof of a NERA factor.\u201d). Applying this rationale, the Court in <em>Thomas </em>affirmed a sentence that did not include the 85% parole ineligibility period mandated by NERA, but only because the trial court had correctly found that \u201cthere was nothing in defendant\u2019s factual statement supporting his guilty plea that demonstrated an independent act of force or threat of force against the victim.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 564, 767 A.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">We are unable to reconcile Mosley\u2019s holding that \u201cif the crime of which defendant is charged and convicted does not include an element constituting or encompassing a NERA predicate fact, that crime, by definition, is not a violent crime within NERA\u2019s intendment^]\u201d 335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 152, 761 A.2d 130, with <em>Thomas\u2019 </em>holding that even though \u201cnone of the NERA factors is an element of the offense charged,\u201d a NERA sentence may be imposed if there is \u201cadditional proof of a NERA factor.\u201d 166 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 767 A.2d 459. Thus, under <em>Thomas, </em>a defendant convicted of sexual assault or aggravated sexual assault predicated solely on the victim\u2019s age, or the ages of both the victim and the defendant, is subject to a NERA sentence if there is \u201cadditional proof\u2019 of \u201cphysical force\u201d or another NERA factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The issue presented by this appeal is whether a conviction for possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose may similarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>qualify for NERA sentencing if there is \u201cadditional proof\u2019 that the conduct upon which the conviction is based involved \u201cuse[ ] or [a] threat [of] the immediate use of a deadly weapon,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2d, or another NERA factor. The Supreme Court has characterized possession of a weapon for unlawful purpose as an \u201cinchoate offense\u201d similar to \u201cattempt, conspiracy and criminal solicitation.\u201d <em>State v. Harmon, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>189, 203, 516 A.2d 1047 (1986). <em>Thomas </em>does not indicate that the State would be foreclosed from presenting \u201cadditional proof of a NERA factor,\u201d 166 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 767 A.2d 459, simply because the offense involved is inchoate in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">However, subsequent to <em>Thomas, </em>the Supreme Court summarily reversed our decision in <em>Williams </em>which held that \u201cfacts beyond those limited to proof of the elements of [possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose may be considered] in determining that the offense was a \u2018violent crime\u2019 under NERA,\u201d 333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 361, 755 A.2d 1168. <em>State v. Williams, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>287, 773 A.2d 1152 (2001). The Court\u2019s summary reversal order included a citation to its opinion in <em>Johnson. Ibid. </em>But as previously noted, <em>supra </em>note 1, the Supreme Court did not review the part of our opinion in <em>Johnson </em>which held that possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose is not a \u201cviolent crime\u201d within the intent of NERA. In affirming <em>Johnson, </em>the Court reviewed only the part of our decision which affirmed the imposition of a NERA sentence for armed robbery, and the Court\u2019s primary holding was that the determination that a crime is \u201cviolent\u201d for the purpose of imposing the 85% parole ineligibility mandated by NERA must be made by a jury. 166 <em>N.J. </em>at 539-45, 766 A.2d 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">In <em>Williams, </em>the determination that the defendant\u2019s possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose subjected him to a NERA sentence was made by the trial judge. 333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 357, 755 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>A.2d 1168. Consequently, applying <em>Johnson, </em>the NERA sentence in <em>Williams </em>could have been reversed solely on the ground that the finding that defendant\u2019s unlawful possession of a weapon met the NERA standard of a violent crime had not been made by a jury. However, the Court not only reversed the NERA sentence in <em>Williams </em>but also remanded with a direction that the defendant be resentenced \u201cwithout reference to [NERA].\u201d 168 <em>N.J. </em>at 287, 773 A.2d 1152. If the summary reversal in <em>Williams </em>had been based solely on the fact that the trial judge rather than a jury had made the NERA finding, it would seem that the appropriate disposition would have been a remand for a hearing before a jury to determine whether the defendant\u2019s conduct qualified for a NERA sentence. Although <em>Johnson </em>does not expressly state that if the NERA predicate fact was not presented to the jury which found a defendant guilty, that fact must be presented to a specially constituted sentencing jury, that is the implication of the opinion. In fact, in explaining why its holding would not apply to cases in which the right to have a jury determine the existence of a NERA predicate fact was raised for the first time in a petition for post-conviction relief, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">In the vast majority of those cases, a jury deliberation on the violent crime issue would not be likely to produce a result different from the challenged court finding, and the original sentences would be reaffirmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">[166 <em>N.J. </em>at 547, 766 A.2d 1126.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-8\"><em>See also State v. Shoats, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>359, 370, 772 A.2d 1 (App.Div.2001). Thus, the Court implied that if a case on direct appeal, which is governed by Johnson\u2019s holding, 166 <em>N.J. </em>at 549, 766 A.2d 1126, is reversed because the trial judge rather than a jury made the finding of the NERA predicate fact, the appropriate disposition would be a remand for a hearing on this issue before a jury. <em>But cf. State v. Stanton, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 9, 770 A.2d 1198 (App.Div.2001). Therefore, the failure to make that disposition in <em>Williams </em>indicates that the Court concluded a NERA sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>was inappropriate in that case, regardless of whether the determination was made by the trial judge or a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Moreover, the conclusion that NERA does not apply to a conviction for the possession for an unlawful purpose involved in <em>Williams </em>is supported by the Court\u2019s discussion of the policy underlying NERA. In <em>Thomas, </em>the Court concluded that the legislative intent in enacting NERA was to impose a mandatary period of parole ineligibility of 85% of the sentence upon only the most violent first- and second-degree offenders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">[T]he legislative history indicates that the primary purpose to be advanced by NERA was to enhance the punishment for the <em>most </em>violent criminals in society. The impetus behind enacting NERA was not for <em>all </em>first- and second-degree criminals to serve 85% of their base-sentences, but that only those who are deemed to be the <em>most </em>violent in society should face a NERA sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">[166 <em>N.J. </em>at 570, 767 A.2d 459.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">The factual circumstances of the offenses committed by Williams would not provide a basis for classifying him as among \u201cthe <em>most </em>violent criminals in society.\u201d The NERA sentence in <em>Williams </em>was predicated on the defendant brandishing a gun on a public street and firing it in the direction of others with a threat to kill. 333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 361, 755 A.2d 1168. Such use of a gun could support a conviction for terroristic threats, which is a third-degree offense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-3, or aggravated assault, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-lb(4) (\u201cKnowingly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life pointpng] a firearm ... at or in the direction of another\u201d), which is a fourth degree offense. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C: 12-1b. Thus, the predicate facts the State relied upon to justify the NERA sentence in <em>Williams </em>would be sufficient to prove only third- and fourth-degree offenses, and NERA applies solely to first- and second-degree offenses. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2a. To be sure, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose is a second-degree offense. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-4a. However, it would be difficult to reconcile the imposition of a NERA sentence upon a person whose only purpose in possessing a weapon was the commission of a third- or fourth-degree offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>with the Legislature\u2019s intent to limit NERA sentences to \u201cthe <em>most </em>violent criminals in society.\u201d <em>Thomas, supra, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>at 570, 767 A.2d 459. Therefore, we conclude that if a defendant\u2019s only unlawful purpose in possessing a weapon is the commission of a third- or fourth-degree offense, a conviction for the preparatory offense of possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose cannot provide the foundation for a NERA sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In this case, defendant\u2019s brandishing of a gun at the victim was sufficient to support a conviction for fourth-degree aggravated assault, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:12-1b(4), which was the other offense to which defendant pled guilty, and also may have been sufficient to support a conviction for third degree terroristic threats, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-3. In addition, defendant\u2019s firing of the weapon and infliction of injury upon the victim from a ricocheting bullet or piece of pavement could support a conviction for aggravated assault, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b(3) (\u201cRecklessly causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon\u201d), which is a fourth-degree offense. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-lb. However, the factual basis defendant provided for his guilty plea would not support a conviction for a violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:12-lb(1) (\u201cAttempts to cause serious bodily injury to another, or causes such injury purposely or knowingly or under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life recklessly causes such injury\u201d), which is the only form of aggravated assault not involving use of a motor vehicle that constitutes a second-degree offense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b, because there was no evidence the victim suffered a \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d and defendant\u2019s plea would not provide a sufficient foundation for finding that he had the purpose to inflict serious bodily injury. Accordingly, the trial court correctly concluded that NERA does not apply to defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>dant\u2019s sentence for possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-12\"> The Supreme Court recently affirmed, as modified, other parts of this court's decision in <em>Johnson.

However, because the grant of certification was limited to defendant's constitutional challenges to NERA, 163 <em>N.J. </em>393, 749 A,2d 367 (2000), the Court did not consider the part of our decision which held that a NERA sentence may not be imposed for possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\"> We express no opinion as to whether a NERA sentence would be required if the evidence showed that a defendant's unlawful purpose in possessing a weapon was the commission of a first- or second-degree offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
