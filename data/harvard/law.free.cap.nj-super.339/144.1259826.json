We conclude that the statement is protected work product because the trucking company\u2019s dominant purpose in taking the statement was to prepare for potential litigation and the company had an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>objectively reasonable basis for anticipating that suit would be brought by the other driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">At approximately 11:40 a.m. on March 6, 1998, plaintiff was driving her car in a southerly direction on Tonnelle Avenue in North Bergen Township. Defendant Durrell Watford, a truck driver employed by defendant J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc. (Transport), was driving a truck in a northerly direction on the same roadway. Watford suddenly swerved into plaintiffs lane, resulting in a head-on collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Watford immediately notified Transport of the accident. That same day, Transport\u2019s \u201cLitigation Manager\u201d retained a New Jersey attorney, John Welch, to represent Transport and its driver in connection with the accident. According to the Litigation Manager, she retained Welch because \u201c[ajfter receiving some preliminary information about the accident, including the fact that one of the involved drivers had been taken to the hospital with apparent facial injuries and multiple fractured bones, I fully anticipated this matter would result in litigation.\u201d On the day of the accident, Welch took a statement from Watford that was recorded by a court reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Plaintiff subsequently brought this personal injury action. In response to plaintiffs interrogatories, defendants disclosed the existence of Watford\u2019s recorded statement. When plaintiff demanded production of the statement, defendants moved for a protective order, relying upon the work product privilege. The trial court denied the motion, stating in a letter opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">Anticipation of litigation in the context of <em>R. </em>4:10 \u2014 2(e) requires some action by the potential adverse party putting the party invoking the privilege on notice that litigation is likely as opposed to merely possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Defendants filed a motion for reconsideration, asserting both the work-product and attorney-client privileges. This motion was supported by Welch\u2019s affidavit which stated that \u201c[djuring my discussion with Mr. Watford before I began taking his statement, I advised him that I had been retained to represent both him and [Transport] with respect to any claims or suits which may arise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>concerning the accident which occurred earlier that day.\u201d Defendants also submitted an affidavit by Watford, which stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">4. Mr. Welch made it clear to me immediately that he was my attorney and would act to protect my interests in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">5. After Mr. Welch and I had a lengthy discussion about the accident and the potential for litigation, I proceeded to give him a sworn statement in the presence of a court reporter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">6. At the time I gave the statement, I fully believed that this matter would result in some type of legal proceedings, and I spoke to Mr. Welch on March 6, 1998 with the understanding that he was representing me in those proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The trial court denied the motion. In reaffirming its ruling that the work product privilege does not shield Watford\u2019s statement from discovery, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">Attached to Ms. Alexander\u2019s affidavit is a fax transmittal sheet dated March 6, 1998 (accident date) which purports to confirm that Mr. Jack Welch, Esq. had been retained to \u201cfully investigate the above accident and to protect the interests of J.B. Hunt and its driver, Durrell Watford.\u201d Taken at face value, these facts do show that Ms. Alexander subjectively believed that litigation would ensue. Under this analysis the statement obtained from Mr. Watford was in fact \u201cin anticipation of litigation.\u201d The court is satisfied, however, that this approach is not consistent with both the intent of the court in <em>Medford [v. Duggan, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 732 A.2d 533 (App.Div.1999)] and the public policy which forms the basis for our rules of discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">This court holds that in determining whether \u201cthe dominant purpose in obtaining a statement is because of potential for litigation,\u201d a reviewing judge must find objective plausible evidence that litigation is likely as opposed to merely possible. It is not enough for the party seeking the applicability of the work product doctrine to show that it subjectively believed the potential for litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">The trial court rejected defendants\u2019 alternative claim that Watford\u2019s statement is protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege, because defendants rested this contention on Welch\u2019s and Watford\u2019s affidavits, which the court said should have been presented at the time of defendants\u2019 initial motion for a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">We granted defendants\u2019 motion for leave to appeal and now reverse the order requiring defendants to produce Watford\u2019s recorded statement. We conclude that Watford\u2019s statement was prepared in anticipation of litigation and thus is protected by the work product privilege. This conclusion makes it unnecessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>consider defendants\u2019 alternative contention that the statement is protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\"><em>Rule </em>4:10-2(c) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">[A] party may obtain discovery of documents and tangible things otherwise discoverable under <em>R. </em>4:10-2(a) and prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for that other party\u2019s representative (including an attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer or agent) only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the case and is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\"><em>Rule </em>4:10-2(e) essentially follows the language of the federal work product rule contained in <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>26(b)(3), which was derived from <em>Hickman v. Taylor, </em>329 <em>U.S. </em>495, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>385, 91 <em>L.Ed. </em>451 (1947). <em>See </em>James W. Moore, et al., <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00a7 26.70[2](c) at 26-209 (3d ed.1997). <em>Hickman </em>explains the policy underlying the work product privilege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">In performing his various duties, ... it is essential that a lawyer work with a certain degree of privacy, free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and them counsel. Proper preparation of a client\u2019s case demands that he assemble information, sift what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts, prepare his legal theories and plan his strategy without undue and needless interference____ This work is reflected, of course, in interviews, statements, memoranda, correspondence, briefs, mental impressions, personal beliefs, and countless other tangible and intangible ways \u2014 aptly though roughly termed by the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case as the \"Work product of the lawyer.\u201d Were such materials open to opposing counsel oh mere demand, much of what is now put down in writing would remain unwritten....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 510-11, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 393, 91 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 462.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">In determining whether a document is protected from disclosure by the work-product privilege, the threshold question is whether the document was \u201cprepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial[.]\u201d <em>R. </em>4:10-2(c). If a document was prepared \u201cin the ordinary course of business\u201d rather than in anticipation of litigation, it is not entitled to protection as work product. <em>Payton v. New Jersey Tpk. Auth., </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>524, 554, 691 A.2d 321 (1997); <em>see also Dinter v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>84, 96, 599 A.2d 528 (App.Div.1991) (holding work product privilege inapplicable where record did not support assertion that the statements \u201cwere written at the direction of counsel or in preparation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>litigation.\u201d). However, a document may be found to have been prepared in anticipation of litigation even though litigation had <em>not </em>been commenced or even threatened when the document was prepared. <em>See In re Sealed Case, </em>146 F.3d 881, 884-88 (D.C.Cir. 1998); <em>Martin v. Bally\u2019s Park Place Hotel &amp; Casino, </em>983 F.2d 1252, 1260-61 (3rd Cir.1993); <em>Springfield Terminal Ry. Co. v. Department of Transp., </em>754 A.2d 353, 358-59 (Me.2000). As Professor Wright has observed: \u201cPrudent parties anticipate litigation, and begin preparation prior to the time suit is formally commenced.\u201d 8 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Richard L. Marcus, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, </em>\u00a7 2024 at 343 (2d ed.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In <em>Medford v. Duggan, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 135, 732 A.2d 533, this court indicated that the work product privilege may be invoked if \u201cthe dominant purpose in obtaining a statement [was] ... the potential for litigation.\u201d However, Professor Wright and the <em>Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers </em>take the position that for a document to be protected by the work product privilege, it not only must have been prepared for the dominant purpose of litigation, but there must also have been an objectively reasonable basis for anticipating litigation. Professor Wright states that \u201cthe test should be whether, in light of the nature of the document and the factual situation in the particular case, the document can fairly be said to have been prepared or obtained because of the prospect of litigation.\u201d Wright, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2024 at 343. The comment to the <em>Restatement </em>indicates that \u201c[t]he reasonableness of anticipation is determined objectively by considering the factual context in which materials are prepared, the nature of the materials, and the expected role of the lawyer in ensuing litigation.\u201d <em>Restatement (Third) of Law Governing Lawyers </em>\u00a7 87 cmt. i (1998). Consistent with these authorities, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has concluded that to assert the work product privilege, the party preparing or ordering preparation of a document must have \u201cbelie[ved] that litigation [would] result\u201d and that belief must have been \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Martin v. Bally\u2019s Park Place Hotel &amp; Casino, supra, </em>983 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>1260. We agree with this approach and hold that a statement or other document will be considered to have been prepared in anticipation of litigation if the \u201cdominant purpose\u201d in preparing the document was concern about potential litigation and the anticipation of litigation was \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Applying this test, it is clear that Watford\u2019s statement is attorney work product that is protected by <em>Rule </em>4:10-2(c). In her affidavit, Transport\u2019s litigation manager stated that before she made the decision to retain Welch, she had received preliminary information concerning the accident, including the fact that the other driver had suffered facial injuries and broken bones, and had to be taken to the hospital. Moreover, because Watford immediately reported the accident to both his dispatcher and Transport\u2019s safety department, it may be assumed that the litigation manager also was aware that the accident had occurred after Watford crossed over into one of the opposing lanes of traffic and that Watford had received a summons for a traffic violation. Under these circumstances, the litigation manager had an objectively reasonable basis for anticipating that the other driver would bring litigation against Transport and Watford. Furthermore, there is no indication that Welch, as Transport\u2019s litigation attorney, had any purpose for taking a recorded statement from Watford other than protecting the interests of Transport and Watford in such anticipated litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The fact that Watford\u2019s statement was taken by an attorney retained by Transport in anticipation of litigation distinguishes this case from <em>Pfender v. Torres, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>379, 765 A.2d 208 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>637, 772 A.2d 938 (2001), upon which plaintiff relies. The statement of one of the defendants in <em>Pfender </em>was taken by an insurance adjuster retained by the defendants\u2019 insurance carrier to investigate the automobile accident which led to the suit. In concluding that the statement was not protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Legitimate concerns of self-preservation often place [an insurance company] in direct conflict with those whom it insures against liability. The avoidance of fraudulent claims and claims outside the insurance coverage justify careful investigation before undertaking a defense of the insured, as is well-evidenced by the never-ending flow of cases involving denials of liability coverage. Only the incredibly naive would suppose that an insurance company\u2019s first concern is anything other than whether it is obliged to provide a defense____No reasonable person could be unaware of this adversarial aspect of the insurer-insured relationship ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">... The key factor for denying the claim of privilege is this: the statement was not taken at the specific direction of the insured\u2019s attorney. Indeed, the claim had not even been assigned to an attorney for the insured____ Litigation was not pending, and at that early point the insurance company might well have had interests other than protection of this insured\u2019s rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 387-88, 765 A.2d 208.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">Although the court in <em>Pfender </em>made these comments in discussing the applicability of the attorney-client privilege, the conclusion that an insurance carrier\u2019s \u201cfirst concern\u201d in conducting a post-accident investigation is to determine \u201cwhether it is obliged to provide a defense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 388, 765 A.2d 208, also would preclude a finding that the insurance adjuster\u2019s \u201cdominant purpose in obtaining a statement\u201d from the insured was \u201cthe potential for litigation.\u201d <em>Medford v. Duggan, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 135, 732 A.2d 533. Therefore, such a statement could not be found to have been taken \u201cin anticipation of litigation\u201d and would not be protected from disclosure under <em>Rule </em>4:10-2(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">In contrast, Watford\u2019s statement was made directly to defendants\u2019 attorney to enable him to prepare for anticipated litigation. Thus, Welch\u2019s \u201cdominant purpose\u201d in taking the statement, indeed apparently his sole purpose, was \u201cthe potential for litigation,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>Medford, v. Duggan, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 135, 732 A.2d 533, and there was an objectively reasonable basis for anticipating that the accident in which Watford had been involved would result in litigation. Therefore, Watford\u2019s statement is protected by the work product privilege provided by <em>Rule </em>4:10-2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Plaintiff did not undertake to show that she is entitled to obtain Watford\u2019s statement because she has \u201csubstantial need\u201d for the statement \u201cin the preparation of [her] case and is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent ... by other means.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:10 \u2014 2(c); see <em>Jenkins v. Rainner, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>50, 55-58, 350 A.2d 473 (1976). In fact, Watford provided a full account of how the accident happened in a deposition taken while this appeal was pending. We of course do not foreclose plaintiff from renewing her request for disclosure of Watford\u2019s statement, if she can make a showing of substantial need after further discovery or at trial. In that event, the trial court would be required to consider defendants\u2019 claim that the statement is also protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the order denying defendants\u2019 motion for an order protecting Watford\u2019s statement from disclosure and remand the case to the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-14\"> The court in <em>Pfender </em>did not consider whether the insured-defendant\u2019s statement was taken in anticipation of litigation. Instead, the court held, in agreement with <em>Dinter </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra, 252 N.J.Super. </em>at 100, 599 <em>A.2d </em>528, and disagreeing with part of the panel\u2019s decision in <em>Medford v. Duggan, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 136-38, 732 A.2d 533, that \"the statement of a party to his insurer [describing the accident] is not protected from discovery.\" 336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 392, 765 A.2d 208. Because the statement involved in this case was given to Transport's litigation attorney, Welch, rather than to an insurer or its agent, we have no need to consider this part of <em>Pfender.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
